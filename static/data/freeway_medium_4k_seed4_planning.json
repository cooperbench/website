The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For each car, given its head, tail, direction, and speed, I can find where it is at any future turn. Collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that y, there's a car with 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nImportant: when you move to a new freeway, you're not on that freeway until the next turn. So if at turn T you move to y_{T+1}, you're still on y_T for collision purposes at turn T, and only enter y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nStart at turn t_1 = 0, position (0,0). Goal is (0,9).\n\nList the cars for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nSince it's right-moving, span at time t: [τ + s(t - t_1), h + s(t - t_1)] with t_1=0.\n\nHead and tail: for right-moving, head is larger, tail smaller. Here given as (h, τ, d, s) = (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nBut -48 > -59, so head is -48, tail is -59? That seems odd because usually we think head is front, but in coordinates, if right is positive, then for right-moving, head should be at larger x.\n\nIn the car update: for right-moving, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)], and it says \"head at h, tail at τ\".\n\nIn the example, for freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nSince it's right-moving, head is at -48, tail at -59. But -48 is greater than -59, so if x increases to the right, head is at x=-48, tail at x=-59, so the car is from -59 to -48, which is length 11, moving right at speed 3.\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nAt time T, span is [τ + s T, h + s T] for right-moving, since t1=0.\n\nt1=0, so T is turns from now.\n\nSet t=0 as current turn.\n\nSo for a car, at turn t, position depends on t.\n\nFor right-moving car: span(t) = [τ + s t, h + s t]\n\nFor left-moving: [h - s t, τ - s t]\n\nBut in this problem, all cars seem to be right-moving, except? Let's check.\n\nFreeway 1: right\n\nFreeway 2: right\n\nFreeway 3: right\n\nFreeway 4: right\n\nFreeway 5: right\n\nFreeway 6: two cars, both right: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\n(48,37,right,12): head 48, tail 37? 48>37, so if right-moving, head should be larger, so tail 37, head 48? But it says (head, tail) = (48,37), so head=48, tail=37, so span from 37 to 48.\n\nSimilarly, (0,-11,right,12): head=0, tail=-11, span from -11 to 0.\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nBoth right-moving.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nAll cars are right-moving, no left-moving mentioned.\n\nNow, collision: at turn t, if player is on freeway y, and for that y, there is a car with 0 in its span at that turn.\n\n0 is the x-coordinate where player is, since player is always at x=0.\n\nPlayer is at (0,y), so for collision on freeway y, if at that turn, there is a car on that freeway whose span includes x=0.\n\nAnd player is on freeway y at turn t only if he is at y at the start of turn t, I think. Let's see the timing.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so at turn t, the player has position y_t, which is set before the action. Then action a_t determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} is the new position after the action.\n\nFor collision: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\ny_T is the player's position at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, player is at y_T, and if for that freeway y_T, there is a car with 0 in its span at time T.\n\nNow, the note: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so no collision with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nOnly considered on the current freeway at each turn.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nFreeway y=0 is not a freeway with cars; cars are only on y=1 to 8. So at y=0, no cars, so no collision possible at y=0.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 is the goal, no cars.\n\nCars only on y=1 to 8.\n\nSo at start, y=0, safe.\n\nGoal y=9, safe.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9, passing through y=1 to 8, but not necessarily staying; I can go up and down.\n\nBut since I need to reach y=9, and minimize turns, probably best to go up as much as possible, but need to avoid collisions.\n\nEach action changes y by at most 1, so to go from 0 to 9, minimum H=9 turns, if I go up every time: actions U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U, y from 0 to 9 in 9 turns.\n\nBut I need to check if this path is collision-free.\n\nIf not, I might need to stay or move down sometimes to avoid.\n\nOr take a different path, but since I have to go up, and can go down, but down might not help much, probably staying or waiting is better.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway and each turn, whether there is a car covering x=0.\n\nSince the cars move, I need to find for each y and each t, if there is a collision risk.\n\nBut t is turn number, starting from 0.\n\nAnd since cars are on specific freeways, I should consider each freeway separately.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: y=1, one car: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nRight-moving, so span at time t: [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-59 + 3t, -48 + 3t]\n\nSet t1=0.\n\nCollision if 0 is in [ -59 + 3t, -48 + 3t ]\n\nSo -59 + 3t ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 3t\n\nFrom left: -59 + 3t ≤ 0 => 3t ≤ 59 => t ≤ 59/3 ≈ 19.666, so t ≤ 19 since t integer? t ≤ 19\n\n-59 + 3t ≤ 0 => 3t ≤ 59 => t ≤ 59/3 = 19 + 2/3, so t ≤ 19 for integer t.\n\nt from 0.\n\n-59 + 3t ≤ 0 => t ≤ 59/3 ≈19.666, so for t=0 to 19, this is true? Let's see:\n\nAt t=19: -59 + 57 = -2 ≤ 0? -59 + 3*19 = -59 + 57 = -2 ≤ 0, true.\n\nt=20: -59 + 60 =1 >0, false.\n\nNow right: 0 ≤ -48 + 3t => 48 ≤ 3t => t ≥ 16.\n\n0 ≤ -48 + 3t => 3t ≥ 48 => t ≥ 16.\n\nSo both: t ≥ 16 and t ≤ 19.\n\nSo for t=16,17,18,19: 0 in span.\n\nAt t=16: lower = -59 + 48 = -11? -59 + 3*16 = -59 + 48 = -11\n\nUpper = -48 + 48 = 0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nt=17: lower -59+51= -8, upper -48+51=3, [ -8,3], 0 in.\n\nt=18: lower -59+54= -5, upper -48+54=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nt=19: lower -59+57= -2, upper -48+57=9, [-2,9], 0 in.\n\nt=20: lower -59+60=1, upper -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo collision possible on freeway 1 only at t=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2, one car: (48,37,right,12)\n\nHead h=48, tail τ=37, right, s=12.\n\nSpan(t) = [τ + s t, h + s t] = [37 + 12t, 48 + 12t]\n\n0 in [37+12t, 48+12t]?\n\n37+12t ≤ 0 ≤ 48+12t\n\nBut 37+12t >0 for t≥0, since 37>0, so left inequality false for all t. 37+12t ≥37>0, so 0 < lower bound, so 0 not in span for any t. No collision possible on freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, (48,37,right,12), same thing, span [37+12t,48+12t] >0, no 0.\n\nFreeway 4: same, no issue.\n\nFreeway 5: same, no issue.\n\nFreeway 6: y=6, two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12), same as above, span [37+12t,48+12t] >0, no 0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12)\n\nHead h=0, tail τ=-11, right, s=12.\n\nSpan(t) = [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-11 + 12t, 0 + 12t] = [-11 + 12t, 12t]\n\n0 in span: -11 + 12t ≤ 0 ≤ 12t\n\nLeft: -11+12t ≤0 => 12t ≤11 => t ≤ 11/12 <1, so t=0 only? t≤0.916, so t=0.\n\nRight: 0 ≤ 12t always true for t≥0.\n\nAt t=0: -11 +0 = -11 ≤0, and 0≤0, so 0 in [ -11, 0]? [ -11, 0], includes 0.\n\nt=1: -11+12=1, 12*1=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at t=0, 0 in span for this car.\n\nBut t=0 is now, current turn.\n\nNow, at turn t=0, for freeway 6, there is a car with span including 0? Yes, this second car.\n\nBut the player is not on freeway 6 at t=0; player is at y=0.\n\nFor freeway 6, at t=0, there is a car covering x=0.\n\nBut collision only if player is on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAt t=0, player is at y=0, not on y=6, so no collision.\n\nBut if player were on y=6 at t=0, it would collide, but not.\n\nNow for future, only at t=0, but since player not there, no issue.\n\nt=0 only for this car on freeway 6.\n\nFirst car on freeway 6 never covers 0.\n\nSo for freeway 6, collision risk only if player is on y=6 at t=0, but t=0 is now, player at y=0, so for future turns, no risk on freeway 6, since only t=0 has car at 0.\n\nNow freeway 7: y=7, two cars.\n\nFirst: (-48,-59,right,6) similar to freeway 1 but different speed.\n\nh=-48, τ=-59, right, s=6.\n\nSpan(t) = [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-59 + 6t, -48 + 6t]\n\n0 in span: -59 + 6t ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 6t\n\nLeft: -59+6t ≤0 => 6t ≤59 => t ≤ 59/6 ≈9.833, so t≤9\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -48 +6t => 48 ≤6t => t ≥ 8.\n\nSo t from 8 to 9 inclusive.\n\nt=8: lower -59+48= -11? -59+6*8= -59+48= -11, upper -48+48=0, [ -11,0], 0 in.\n\nt=9: lower -59+54= -5, upper -48+54=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nt=10: lower -59+60=1, upper -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo collision at t=8 and t=9.\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: (0,-11,right,6)\n\nh=0, τ=-11, right, s=6.\n\nSpan(t) = [-11 +6t, 0 +6t] = [-11+6t, 6t]\n\n0 in span: -11+6t ≤0 ≤6t\n\nLeft: -11+6t ≤0 => 6t ≤11 => t≤11/6≈1.833, so t=0,1\n\nRight: 0≤6t always for t≥0.\n\nt=0: [-11,0], 0 in\n\nt=1: [-11+6,6] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nt=2: [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo for this car, collision at t=0 and t=1.\n\nBut again, player not on y=7 at t=0 or t=1 probably.\n\nNow for freeway 7, both cars can cause collision at different times.\n\nAt t=0: second car covers 0.\n\nt=1: second car covers 0.\n\nt=8: first car covers 0.\n\nt=9: first car covers 0.\n\nAt other times, no car covers 0 on freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 8: y=8, same as freeway 7: cars (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nSame as above, collision at t=0,1 for second car, and t=8,9 for first car.\n\nNow, back to the player.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nSafe.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nMinimal turns: if I go up every turn, y increases by 1 each turn.\n\nAfter t turns, y=t, if I start from y=0 and go up each time.\n\nAt turn H, y_H = H, since y_0=0.\n\ny_{t} for t=0,1,2,...\n\ny_0 =0\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo at turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn H, y_H, and we want y_H =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=0 to t=H-1, so after H actions, at turn H, position y_H.\n\nAnd we start at turn 0, y_0=0.\n\nSo to have y_H=9, with min H.\n\nIf all actions U, then y_t = t for t=0 to 9, y_9=9.\n\nBut need to check if for each t from 0 to 8, when on y_t, no collision with cars on that row at that turn.\n\ny_t from 0 to 8, since at y=9 no cars.\n\nt from 0 to 8, y=t.\n\nNow y=0: no cars, safe.\n\ny=1: freeway 1, which has collision only at t=16,17,18,19. For t from 0 to 8, t small, not in 16-19, so safe on y=1.\n\ny=2: freeway 2, no collision possible, as we saw.\n\ny=3: freeway 3, same as 2, no issue.\n\ny=4: freeway 4, same.\n\ny=5: freeway 5, same.\n\ny=6: freeway 6. At t=0, there is car, but at t=0, player is at y=0, not y=6. When on y=6, at what t?\n\nIf y_t = t, so at turn t=6, y_6=6.\n\nAt t=6, on freeway 6.\n\nIs there a car at t=6 on y=6?\n\nFreeway 6: first car: span [37+12t,48+12t], at t=6: [37+72,48+72]=[109,120], not near 0.\n\nSecond car: span [-11+12t,12t], at t=6: [-11+72,72]=[61,72], not 0.\n\nAnd only at t=0 it covered 0, but t=6>0, so no car at 0, safe.\n\ny=7: at turn t=7, y_7=7.\n\nFreeway 7: cars that can cover 0 at t=0,1,8,9.\n\nt=7 not in, so at t=7, no car covers 0.\n\nFirst car: at t=7, span [-59+42, -48+42]? s=6, t=7: [-59 + 6*7, -48 + 42] = [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17, -6], which is left of 0, not include 0.\n\nSecond car: at t=7, [-11+42, 42] = [31,42], not 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\ny=8: at turn t=8, y_8=8.\n\nFreeway 8: at t=8, first car: (-48,-59,right,6), span at t=8: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0], so 0 is included.\n\nCollision!\n\nAt t=8, if player is on y=8, and freeway 8 has a car with span [-11,0] at t=8, which includes 0, so collision.\n\nTherefore, in the direct up path, at turn 8, y=8, collision with car on freeway 8.\n\nNot safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, if I were on y=8 at t=9, but in this path, at t=8 y=8, then action to y=9, so at t=8, on y=8, collision.\n\nIf I stay or something, but in direct up, it collides at t=8.\n\nSo need to avoid that.\n\nNow, when does freeway 8 have collision times.\n\nFrom above: for first car: collision at t=8 and t=9\n\nFor second car: at t=0 and t=1.\n\nSo on freeway 8, collision at t=0,1,8,9.\n\nSpecifically, for player on y=8 at turn t, collision if t=8 or t=9.\n\nSimilarly for y=7, collision at t=8 or t=9? Earlier for freeway 7: collision at t=8 and t=9 for first car, and t=0,1 for second car.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, both freeway 7 and 8 have collision.\n\nNow back to the path.\n\nIn direct up, problem at t=8 on y=8.\n\nI need to reach y=9, so I must be on y=8 at some point before going to 9.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, y=8 has collision.\n\nSimilarly, other times might be safe.\n\nFor freeway 8, when is it safe?\n\nNot at t=0,1,8,9.\n\nSo for t=2 to 7, and t=10 onwards.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nBut I need min H, so probably not too late.\n\nSince min H=9, but direct not work, so H=9 might not be achievable, need to take more turns by staying or moving down.\n\nBut moving down might not help, since I need to go up eventually.\n\nPerhaps stay at some safe row to avoid the collision times.\n\nNow, let's list for each row and each turn, if it is dangerous to be on that row at that turn.\n\nBut turns from 0 to say 20, but I hope less.\n\nSince cars move, but only at certain times they cover x=0.\n\nFor y=1: dangerous at t=16,17,18,19\n\ny=2: always safe, no car covers 0\n\ny=3: same, safe\n\ny=4: safe\n\ny=5: safe\n\ny=6: dangerous only at t=0, but since t=0 player not there, so always safe for t>0.\n\ny=7: dangerous at t=8,9 (from first car), and t=0,1 (from second car). But t=0,1 player not there probably, so dangerous only at t=8,9\n\ny=8: dangerous at t=0,1,8,9. t=0,1 player not there, so dangerous at t=8,9\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nNow, player starts at t=0, y=0.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn T.\n\nThe path: sequence of actions, so positions y_t for t=0,1,2,... until y_T=9.\n\ny_t must be integer 0 to 9.\n\nAt each turn, for the y_t, it must not be dangerous at that t.\n\nSo for each t, when I am at y_t, it should be a safe row at that turn.\n\nNow, to min T, the turn when I reach y=9.\n\nSince I start at y=0, end at y=9, and each step change by at most 1, the min possible T is 9, if I go directly.\n\nBut as we saw, at t=8, y=8 is dangerous.\n\nIn direct up, y_t = t for t=0 to 8, then at t=9 y=9.\n\nBut at t=8, y=8, dangerous.\n\nIf I can be at y=8 at a different time.\n\nFor example, if I go slower, be at y=8 at t=7 or t=10, etc.\n\nt=7: y=7 at t=7, is it dangerous?\n\ny=7 dangerous at t=8,9, not at t=7.\n\nAt t=7, y=7: freeway 7, at t=7, as earlier, span first car [-17,-6], second [31,42], no 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at t=7: freeway 8 at t=7.\n\nFirst car: span [-59 +6*7, -48 +42] = [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17,-6], not 0.\n\nSecond car: [-11+42,42] = [31,42], not 0.\n\nSo at t=7, both y=7 and y=8 are safe.\n\nBut at t=8, both dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, t=9, dangerous for y=7 and y=8.\n\nt=10, safe.\n\nNow, back to min H.\n\nI need to reach y=9 by turn T.\n\nIf I can reach by t=9, but at t=8, I need to be on y=8 or something.\n\nSuppose I want to be at y=9 at t=9.\n\nThen at t=8, I must be at y=8 to move up to y=9.\n\nBut at t=8, y=8 is dangerous.\n\nIf at t=8 I am at y=7, then I can move to y=8 at t=9, but at t=9, y=8 is dangerous if I am there.\n\nLet's see the timing.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nIf at turn t, I am at y_t, and if y_t is dangerous at t, collision.\n\nTo go to y=9, I need at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nBefore that, at turn T-1, I must be at y_{T-1} =8 or 9, but if y_{T-1}=9, I am already there, but I need to reach, so probably y_{T-1}=8, and action U to y_T=9.\n\nOr if I stay, but to reach 9, I need to be at 8 and go up.\n\nI could be at 9 and stay, but that wastes time.\n\nMin time, so I should go up when possible.\n\nBut at the end, to reach 9, I must have been at 8 at some point.\n\nNow, at the turn when I am at 8, it must be safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nNow, for y=8, it is safe except t=8,9.\n\nSo I can be at y=8 only at t<8 or t>9.\n\nSimilarly for y=7, safe except t=8,9.\n\nBut t=8 and 9 are dangerous for both.\n\nNow, to min T, I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are both dangerous at t=8 and t=9, I need to not be on rows 7 or 8 at turns 8 and 9.\n\nI can be on other rows at those times.\n\nFor example, at t=8 and t=9, I should be on y<=6 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is safe, but I need to reach it.\n\nNow, let's find a path to y=9 with min turns.\n\nStart: t=0, y=0, safe.\n\nI need to go up.\n\nSuppose I go up each turn until possible.\n\nBut at some point I need to avoid t=8 on y=8.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=8 before t=8 or after t=9.\n\nBut after t=9 might be late.\n\nMin T=9, but if not possible, T=10.\n\nFirst, try to achieve T=9.\n\nI need y_9=9.\n\nThen at t=8, y_8 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_8=9, then I am already at 9 at t=8, but I need to reach at t=9? No, I can reach earlier.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9) at some turn, so if I reach at t=8, y_8=9, that is fine, as long as at t=8 I am at y=9, which is safe.\n\nThen H=8? Let's see.\n\ny_t: at turn t, position.\n\nAfter actions from t=0 to H-1, at turn H, position y_H.\n\nWe want y_H=9.\n\nIf H=8, then after 8 actions, at turn 8, y_8=9.\n\nThat means from y_0=0, after 8 actions, y_8=9, so I must have gone up 9 steps? y_8 = y_0 + sum of Δy from t=0 to 7.\n\ny_8 = y_0 + sum_{k=0 to7} Δy_k\n\ny_0=0, y_8=9, so sum_{k=0 to7} Δy_k =9.\n\nEach Δy_k in {-1,0,1}, so to have sum=9 in 8 steps, possible only if all Δy_k=1, except one is 0 or something, but min sum with 8 steps is -8, max +8, so +9 impossible with 8 actions.\n\ny_8 = y_0 + Δy_0 + Δy_1 + ... + Δy_7\n\n7 actions? Indices.\n\ny_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\ny_2 = y_1 + Δy_1 = y_0 + Δy_0 + Δy_1\n\n...\n\ny_t = y_0 + sum_{k=0}^{t-1} Δy_k\n\nAt turn t, after t actions? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn 0, before any action, y_0=0.\n\nAfter action a_0, at turn 1, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\nAfter action a_1, at turn 2, y_2 = y_1 + Δy_1\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{H-1}, at turn H, y_H = y_{H-1} + Δy_{H-1}\n\nAnd y_H =9.\n\nNow y_H = y_0 + sum_{k=0}^{H-1} Δy_k\n\ny_0=0, so y_H = sum_{k=0}^{H-1} Δy_k =9\n\nEach Δy_k in {-1,0,1}, so the sum of H terms is 9.\n\nTherefore, H must be at least 9, and if H=9, all Δy_k=1.\n\nIf H=10, sum of 10 terms=9, so one stay or one down and one up extra, etc.\n\nMin H is 9 if possible.\n\nWith H=9, y_t = t for t=0 to 9, but at t=8, y=8, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nTherefore, H=9 impossible.\n\nNow min possible H=10.\n\nWith H=10, y_10=9, so sum of 10 Δy_k from k=0 to9 =9.\n\nSince each <=1, sum=9 with 10 terms, so exactly 9 up and 1 stay, or 10 up and one down, but 10 up would be sum=10, too much.\n\nSum of Δy_k =9, each |Δy_k|<=1, with 10 terms.\n\nSo possibilities: nine +1 and one 0, or eight +1, one -1, and two +1? Let's see.\n\nNumber of U: u, D: d, S: s, with u + d + s =10 (number of actions), and u - d =9 (since sum Δy = u*1 + d*(-1) + s*0 = u - d =9)\n\nAlso u + d + s =10\n\nThen from u - d =9, and u + d + s=10.\n\nAdd: 2u + s =19\n\nSubtract: 2d + s =1\n\nSince u,d,s >=0 integers.\n\n2d + s =1, so possible d=0, s=1; or d=1, s=-1? Impossible, s>=0.\n\n2d + s =1, d and s integers >=0.\n\nSo d=0, s=1; or d=1, s=-1 invalid; only d=0, s=1.\n\nThen u - d = u =9\n\nu + d + s =9 +0 +1=10.\n\nSo only possibility: nine U and one S.\n\nThat is, in 10 actions, 9 up and 1 stay, no down.\n\ny increases from 0 to 9, with one stay somewhere.\n\nNow, the stay can be at some row and turn where it is safe.\n\nNow, we need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nIn the sequence, y_t for t=0 to 10.\n\ny_10=9.\n\nSince we have one stay, y_t may not increase every turn.\n\nNow, let's list the dangerous times:\n\n- For y=7: dangerous at t=8,9\n\n- For y=8: dangerous at t=8,9\n\n- Other rows are safe at all times except y=1 at t=16-19, but t small, not relevant.\n\ny=6 safe, y=5,4,3,2 safe, y=0 safe.\n\nSo only rows 7 and 8 are dangerous at t=8,9.\n\nTherefore, at turns t=8 and t=9, we must not be on rows 7 or 8.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, we can be on y=9 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nOr on y<=6.\n\nNow, with H=10, we start at t=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at t=10.\n\nSince we have one stay, the position y_t may stay the same at one turn.\n\nNow, to minimize time, we should go up as much as possible, but insert a stay somewhere safe to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at t=8,9.\n\nNow, let's consider the path.\n\nSuppose we go up every turn except one stay.\n\nThen y_t = min(t, something) but with stay.\n\nFor example, if we stay at some early time, say at t=0, stay, then y_0=0, after stay, y_1=0, then up to y_10=9? Let's see.\n\nIf we stay at turn k, meaning at turn k, action S, so y_{k+1} = y_k, so position stays at y_k for two consecutive turns? No.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nIf at step t, we do S, then y_{t+1} = y_t, so at turn t+1, we are still at the same position.\n\nBut the turn number increases.\n\nFor example, start t=0, y=0.\n\nIf a_0 = S, then y_1 = y_0 + 0 =0, so at turn 1, y=0.\n\nThen if all U after, y_2=1, y_3=2, ..., up to y_10=9? y_1=0, y_2=1, ..., y_10=9, so from y_1 to y_10, 9 steps to go from 0 to 9, but y_1=0, y_10=9, difference 9, with 9 actions? From t=1 to t=10, actions from a1 to a9? Let's index.\n\nActions from t=0 to 9 for H=10, since y_10 after 10 actions.\n\nActions: a0, a1, ..., a9\n\ny0=0\n\nAfter a0: y1 = y0 + Δy0\n\nAfter a1: y2 = y1 + Δy1\n\n...\n\nAfter a9: y10 = y9 + Δy9\n\ny10=9\n\ny0=0\n\ny10 = y0 + sum_{k=0}^9 Δy_k = sum Δy_k =9\n\nWith 10 actions, 9U and 1S.\n\nNow, the sequence of positions: y_t for t=0 to 10.\n\ny_t depends on the actions.\n\nSince we have one S, at some point y_t = y_{t+1} for some t.\n\nNow, we need for each t from 0 to 9, y_t not dangerous, and since y_10=9, no issue.\n\nt from 0 to 9, because at t=10, y=9 safe.\n\nNow, dangerous only if y_t=7 or 8 and t=8 or 9.\n\nSpecifically, at t=8, if y_8=7 or 8, collision.\n\nAt t=9, if y_9=7 or 8, collision.\n\nOther times and rows safe.\n\nTherefore, to avoid:\n\n- At turn 8, y_8 must not be 7 or 8. So y_8 <=6 or y_8=9.\n\n- At turn 9, y_9 must not be 7 or 8. So y_9 <=6 or y_9=9.\n\nBut we want to reach y_10=9, so y_9 must be 8 or 9.\n\nBecause to go to y_10=9, from y_9, with action U or S.\n\nIf y_9=9, then to stay or move, but y_10=9, so if y_9=9, action S to y_10=9, or if action U, y_10=10, but y max 9, probably not allowed, since y in [0,9], so if y=9, U not possible, or invalid.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if at y_t=9, action U is invalid, similarly at y=0, D invalid.\n\nWe must have y in [0,9], so actions are constrained.\n\nAt y_t=9, possible actions: D or S, not U.\n\nAt y_t=0, possible U or S, not D.\n\nIn this case, for y_10=9, if y_9=9, then action a9 must be S (since U not possible), so y10=9.\n\nIf y_9=8, then action a9=U, y10=9.\n\nIf y_9=9, a9=S.\n\nNow, back to constraints at t=9: y_9 must not be 7 or 8, so must be <=6 or 9.\n\nBut from above, y_9 must be 8 or 9 to reach y_10=9.\n\nTherefore, y_9 cannot be 7 or 8, so must be y_9=9.\n\nThen y_10=9 with action S.\n\ny_9=9 is safe.\n\nNow, also at t=8, y_8 must not be 7 or 8, so y_8 <=6 or 9.\n\nBut y_9=9.\n\nNow, y_9 = y_8 + Δy_8\n\nIf y_8=9, then y_9=9 only if Δy_8=0, action S.\n\nIf y_8=8, then to y_9=9, need U, but y_9=9 not 8, so possible.\n\nBut in this case, y_9=9, which is not 7 or 8, so safe at t=9.\n\nBut for y_8, if y_8=8, it would be dangerous at t=8, but we need to ensure y_8 not 7 or 8.\n\nSince y_9=9, and y_8 must be such that y_9=9.\n\nSo y_9 = y_8 + Δy_8 =9\n\nSince y_8 <=9, if y_8=9, then Δy_8=0, action S.\n\nIf y_8=8, then Δy_8=1, action U.\n\nIf y_8=9 or 8, but y_8 must not be 7 or 8 at t=8, so if y_8=8, it is dangerous at t=8.\n\nTherefore, to avoid collision, y_8 cannot be 8.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be 7.\n\nSo y_8 must be <=6 or 9.\n\nNow, from above, if y_8=9, then y_9=9 with S.\n\nIf y_8=8, but y_8=8 not allowed at t=8.\n\nSo only possibility: y_8=9 or y_8 <=6.\n\nBut if y_8 <=6, then to reach y_9=9, need y_9 = y_8 + Δy_8 =9, so if y_8 <=6, Δy_8 <=1, so y_8 + Δy_8 <=7 <9, impossible.\n\ny_8 <=6, then y_9 = y_8 + Δy_8 <= 6 +1 =7 <9, cannot reach 9.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is y_8=9, and then y_9=9 with action S.\n\nThus, we must have y_8=9 and y_9=9.\n\nNow, y_8=9, which is safe at t=8.\n\nAnd y_9=9, safe at t=9.\n\nThen y_10=9 with S.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 by turn 10, but if y_8=9, we are already at 9 at t=8.\n\nBut the goal is to reach at turn H=10, but we can reach earlier, but in this case with H=10, we have y_10=9, but if we are at y=9 at t=8, we can stay, but it might not be minimal time.\n\nBut since we need exactly H=10 actions to turn 10, but we can be at 9 earlier.\n\nFor min H, we should reach as early as possible.\n\nBut with H=10, we are forced to have y_8=9 and y_9=9, meaning we reach y=9 at t=8, and stay for two turns.\n\nBut that seems wasteful.\n\nPerhaps H=10 is not minimal, but H=9 impossible, so min H=10.\n\nBut with H=10, we can reach y=9 earlier than t=10.\n\nFor example, reach y=9 at t=9 or t=8.\n\nBut in the above, to satisfy the constraints, we need y_8=9.\n\nLet me confirm.\n\nWith H=10, y_10=9.\n\nConstraints:\n\n- At t=9, y_9 must be <=6 or 9, but to reach y_10=9, y_9 must be 8 or 9.\n\nTherefore y_9 must be 9 (since cannot be 8).\n\nThus y_9=9.\n\nThen action a9=S, y10=9.\n\nNow at t=8, y_8 must not be 7 or 8, so <=6 or 9.\n\ny_9 = y_8 + Δy_8 =9.\n\nIf y_8 <=6, y_9 <=7<9, impossible.\n\nTherefore y_8=9, and Δy_8=0, action S.\n\nThen y_9=9.\n\nSimilarly, y_10=9 with S.\n\nSo indeed, with H=10, we must have y_8=9, y_9=9, y_10=9.\n\nThat means we reach y=9 at turn 8, and stay for turns 9 and 10.\n\nBut turn 8 is early, but we have to take 10 actions to get to turn 10.\n\nNow, since we start at y_0=0, we need to reach y_8=9.\n\nWith 8 actions from t=0 to t=7, to go from y_0=0 to y_8=9.\n\ny_8 = y_0 + sum_{k=0}^{7} Δy_k = sum_{k=0}^7 Δy_k =9\n\nBut from k=0 to 7, 8 actions, sum Δy =9.\n\nMax sum with 8 actions is 8, if all U.\n\n8 <9, impossible to have sum=9 with 8 terms each <=1.\n\ny_8 = sum_{k=0}^7 Δy_k\n\nSince y_0=0.\n\nNumber of actions from k=0 to 7: 8 actions.\n\nEach Δy_k <=1, so y_8 <= y_0 + 8*1 = 8.\n\nBut we need y_8=9, impossible.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to have y_8=9 with only 8 actions from turn 0.\n\ny_8 <=8.\n\nTherefore, the earlier assumption leads to contradiction.\n\nWith H=10, we cannot have y_8=9 because to reach y_8=9 from y_0=0 requires at least 9 actions, but actions to reach y_8 are from a0 to a7, 8 actions, so y_8 <=8.\n\nSimilarly, y_9 <=9, etc.\n\nBack to the constraints.\n\nWith H=10, y_10=9.\n\nThen y_10 = sum_{k=0}^9 Δy_k =9\n\nWith 10 actions, 9U and 1S.\n\ny_t for t=0 to 10.\n\nAt t=9, y_9 must be 9 (as we concluded, because cannot be 7 or 8, and must be 8 or 9 for y_10=9, so must be 9).\n\nThen at t=8, y_8 must not be 7 or 8, so <=6 or 9.\n\nBut y_9 = y_8 + Δy_8 =9.\n\nIf y_8 <=6, then y_9 <=7 <9, impossible.\n\nIf y_8=9, then Δy_8=0, y_9=9.\n\nBut y_8=9 requires that we reach y=9 by turn 8, which requires at least 9 actions to go from 0 to 9, but to reach y_8, we have actions from a0 to a7, 8 actions, so y_8 <=8, cannot be 9.\n\nThus, impossibility.\n\nTherefore, with H=10, it is impossible to satisfy the constraints because of the conflict at t=8 and t=9.\n\nBut H=9 is impossible due to collision at t=8.\n\nSo what about H=11?\n\nWith H=11, y_11=9.\n\nThen sum of 11 Δy_k =9, so u - d =9, u + d + s =11.\n\nThen 2u + s =20, 2d + s =2.\n\nPossible solutions: d=0, s=2, u=9; or d=1, s=0, u=10.\n\nNow, y_11=9.\n\nAt t=10, y_10 must be 8 or 9 for y_11=9.\n\nAt t=9, y_9 must be safe.\n\nDangerous at t=8,9 for y=7,8.\n\nAt turn t, for each t, if on y=7 or 8 and t=8 or 9, dangerous.\n\nSpecifically, at t=8, must not be on y=7 or 8.\n\nAt t=9, must not be on y=7 or 8.\n\nWith H=11, we have more flexibility.\n\nFor example, we can be at y=8 at t=7 or t=10, etc.\n\nt=7 is safe for y=7 and y=8.\n\nt=10 is also safe.\n\nLet's find a sequence.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nGo up as much as possible, but avoid being on y=7 or 8 at t=8,9.\n\nSince at t=8 and t=9, we must be on y<=6 or y=9.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to be at y=8 at some point.\n\nThe earliest to reach y=8 is t=8, but dangerous.\n\nSo we can reach y=8 at t=7 or t=10.\n\nSimilarly for y=7.\n\nt=7 is safe.\n\nFor example, reach y=8 at t=7.\n\nThen from t=7, y=8.\n\nAt t=7, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, if we are on y=8, dangerous, so we must move away.\n\nFor example, move up to y=9, or move down to y=7, but y=7 at t=8 dangerous.\n\nOr stay, but dangerous.\n\nSo at t=8, we cannot be on y=7 or 8.\n\nSo if at t=7, y=7 or 8, we need to move to a safe row at t=8.\n\nSafe rows at t=8: y<=6 or y=9.\n\nSimilarly at t=9.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, best to go to y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nBut we need to have the position.\n\nLet's plan the path to reach y=9 by t=11 with min actions, but with H=11, we have extra steps.\n\nSince we need only 9 net up, with 11 actions, we have two extra actions which can be stay or down and up.\n\nBut to min time, we should go up fast but avoid the dangerous times.\n\nList the turns.\n\nWe need to be at y=8 at some safe turn, then go to 9.\n\nSafe turns for y=8: t<=7 or t>=10.\n\nSimilarly for y=7.\n\nt=7 is safe for both.\n\nSo one plan: reach y=7 at t=7, then at t=8, since we cannot stay on y=7, and cannot go to y=8, both dangerous, so we must go down to y=6 or up to y=8 or 9, but y=8 dangerous, so only down to y=6 or up to y=9 if possible.\n\nBut at t=7, y=7, to go to y=9 at t=8, impossible in one step, since only change by 1.\n\ny_8 = y_7 + Δy_7, so can be 6,7,8.\n\nCannot be 9.\n\nSo at t=8, from y=7, possible positions y=6,7,8.\n\nAll of which, if y=7 or 8, dangerous; if y=6, safe.\n\nSo only safe choice is to go down to y=6 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, from y=6, we can go to y=5,6,7.\n\nBut at t=9, if y=7, dangerous, so must not go to y=7.\n\nCan go to y=5 or 6 or up to y=8, but y=8 dangerous.\n\nSo only y=5 or 6 safe.\n\nThen later go up to 9.\n\nBut this may take more turns.\n\nSince we can be at y=8 at t=10.\n\nLet's set the path to reach y=8 at t=10.\n\nt=10 is safe for y=8.\n\nThen go to y=9 at t=11.\n\nWith H=11, y_11=9.\n\nActions from a0 to a10.\n\ny0=0\n\nWe need to go to y=8 at t=10, then U to y=11=9.\n\ny_10=8, then a10=U, y11=9.\n\nNow, at t=10, y=8, which is safe since t=10 not 8 or 9.\n\nNow, we need to ensure that at all turns, position safe.\n\nIn particular, at t=8 and t=9, we must not be on y=7 or 8.\n\nNow, to reach y_10=8 from y_0=0 in 10 actions.\n\nSince we have 11 actions to reach y11=9, but for y10=8, it is after 10 actions.\n\ny10 = sum_{k=0}^9 Δy_k =8? y10 = y0 + sum_{k=0}^{9} Δy_k\n\ny0=0, y10=8, so sum_{k=0}^{9} Δy_k =8\n\nWith 10 actions, sum=8.\n\nThen for y11=9, a10=U, Δy10=1.\n\nNow, for the sum, with 11 actions, u - d =9, u + d + s =11.\n\nEarlier.\n\nBut for now, let's get to y10=8.\n\ny10=8, with 10 actions from k=0 to9.\n\nsum_{k=0}^9 Δy_k =8\n\nEach |Δy|<=1, so possible with some stays or downs.\n\nBut to min time, we should go up fast.\n\nFor example, go up 8 times in 10 actions, so two stays or one down and one up, etc.\n\nBut let's avoid the dangerous times.\n\nAt t=8 and t=9, we need y_t <=6 or 9, but since we are not at 9 yet, y_t <=6.\n\nSo at t=8, y_8 <=6\n\nAt t=9, y_9 <=6\n\nThen at t=10, y_10=8, which requires from y_9, with action a9, y10 = y9 + Δy9 =8.\n\nSince y9 <=6, Δy9 <=1, so y10 <=7 <8, contradiction.\n\ny9 <=6, then y10 = y9 + Δy9 <=6+1=7 <8, but we need y10=8, impossible.\n\nTherefore, cannot have y10=8 if y9<=6.\n\nBut at t=9, y9 must be <=6 or 9, but 9 not reached, so y9<=6.\n\nThen y10 <=7, cannot be 8.\n\nContradiction.\n\nIf we reach y=9 earlier, but with H=11, y11=9, so at t=10, y10 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y10=9, then we are at 9 at t=10, then a10=S, y11=9.\n\nIf y10=8, then a10=U, y11=9.\n\nAt t=9, y9 must be safe, so not 7 or 8, so <=6 or 9.\n\nIf y10=8, then y10 = y9 + Δy9 =8.\n\ny9 must be 7,8, or 9? To reach 8, y9=7,8,9 with appropriate action.\n\nBut at t=9, y9 cannot be 7 or 8, so must be y9=9 or <=6.\n\nIf y9=9, then to have y10=8, need action D, but then y10=8.\n\nBut at t=9, y9=9 is safe.\n\nThen at t=10, y10=8, which at t=10, y=8 is safe since t=10 not 8 or 9.\n\nThen a10=U, y11=9.\n\nSimilarly, if y10=9, then y9 must be 9 or 8.\n\nIf y9=9, safe.\n\nIf y9=8, dangerous at t=9, not allowed.\n\nSo if y10=9, then y9 must be 9, with action S.\n\nNow, back to at t=8, y8 must not be 7 or 8.\n\nSo let's consider cases.\n\nFirst, suppose we want y10=8, then y11=9.\n\nThen at t=9, y9 must be 9 or <=6.\n\nBut y10 = y9 + Δy9 =8.\n\nIf y9 <=6, then y10 <=7<8, impossible.\n\nTherefore, must have y9=9, then y10 = y9 + Δy9 =9 + Δy9 =8, so Δy9 = -1, action D, y10=8.\n\nThen at t=10, y10=8, safe.\n\nThen a10=U, y11=9.\n\nNow, at t=9, y9=9, safe.\n\nAt t=8, y8 must not be 7 or 8, so <=6 or 9.\n\ny9 = y8 + Δy8 =9.\n\nIf y8 <=6, then y9 <=7<9, impossible.\n\nIf y8=9, then Δy8=0, y9=9.\n\nBut y8=9 requires reaching y=9 by turn 8, which needs at least 9 actions, but to y8, actions from a0 to a7, 8 actions, y8 <=8, cannot be 9.\n\nImpossible.\n\nTherefore, this case is impossible.\n\nSecond case: y10=9, then y11=9 with S.\n\nThen y10=9, so at t=10, y=9, safe.\n\nAt t=9, y9 must be 9 or 8.\n\nBut at t=9, y9 cannot be 7 or 8, so must be y9=9.\n\nThen y10=9 with action S.\n\nNow at t=8, y8 must not be 7 or 8, so <=6 or 9.\n\ny9 = y8 + Δy8 =9.\n\nIf y8 <=6, y9 <=7<9, impossible.\n\nIf y8=9, then Δy8=0, y9=9.\n\nBut y8=9 impossible with 8 actions.\n\nSame issue.\n\nSo for H=11, we still have the problem at t=8.\n\nThe only way is to be at y=9 at or before t=8, but with actions to t=8, only 8 actions, can reach at most y=8.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=9 before t=9.\n\ny9 is the earliest to reach y=9, with 9 actions.\n\nBut at t=9, if we are at y=9, it is safe, but at t=8, we must not be on 7 or 8, so y8 must be <=6 or 9.\n\nBut y8 <=8, so y8 <=6.\n\nThen from y8 <=6, to y9=9, need y9 = y8 + Δy8 <=6+1=7<9, impossible.\n\nSo it seems impossible to have y9=9 with y8<=6.\n\nTherefore, for any H, to reach y_H=9, at turn H-1, y_{H-1} must be 8 or 9.\n\nAt turn H-1, if H-1 =8 or 9, and y=8, it is dangerous.\n\nIf H-1 =8 or 9 and y=7 or 8, dangerous.\n\nBut for y=9, safe.\n\nSo if we can have y_{H-1}=9, then safe at t=H-1 if H-1=8 or 9.\n\nBut to have y_{H-1}=9, we need to reach it by turn H-1.\n\nThe earliest to reach y=9 is turn 9, with 9 actions.\n\nFor turn 8, y8<=8.\n\nSo for H such that H-1 >=9, i.e., H>=10.\n\nThen at turn H-1, if H-1=8 or 9, it might be dangerous if y=8.\n\nBut if H-1>9, it is safe.\n\nLet's set H=10.\n\nThen at turn 9, y9 must be 8 or 9 for y10=9.\n\nAt t=9, y9 cannot be 7 or 8, so must be y9=9.\n\nThen y10=9 with S.\n\nAt t=8, y8 must not be 7 or 8, so <=6 or 9.\n\ny9 = y8 + Δy8 =9.\n\nIf y8 <=6, y9 <=7<9, impossible.\n\nIf y8=9, impossible as before.\n\nSo the only way is to have H-1 not 8 or 9.\n\nThat is, for turn H-1, if H-1 not 8 or 9, then no problem.\n\nFor example, H=11, then turn H-1=10.\n\nt=10 is not 8 or 9, so at t=10, y10 can be 8 or 9, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8 and t=9, we can be on safe rows.\n\nLet's try H=11.\n\ny11=9.\n\nThen at t=10, y10 must be 8 or 9.\n\nSince t=10 not dangerous, both safe.\n\nSuppose y10=8, then a10=U, y11=9.\n\nOr y10=9, a10=S, y11=9.\n\nAt t=9, y9 must not be 7 or 8, so <=6 or 9.\n\nSimilarly at t=8, y8 not 7 or 8, so <=6 or 9.\n\nNow, to reach y11=9, we can have different paths.\n\nFor example, reach y=8 at t=10, then U to 9 at t=11.\n\ny10=8.\n\nThen y10 = sum_{k=0}^9 Δy_k =8\n\nWith 10 actions, sum=8.\n\nFor example, 8 up and 2 stays, or 9 up 1 down, etc.\n\nNow, at t=10, y=8, safe.\n\nWe need to be at y<=6 or 9 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nSince not at 9 yet, y8 <=6, y9 <=6.\n\nThen from y8 <=6 to y10=8.\n\ny10 = y8 + Δy8 + Δy9\n\nSince y8 <=6, and Δy8 <=1, Δy9 <=1, so y10 <=6+1+1=8.\n\nCan achieve y10=8 only if y8=6, Δy8=1, Δy9=1, so y9=7, y10=8.\n\nBut y9=7, and at t=9, y=7 is dangerous!\n\nBecause at t=9, on y=7, collision.\n\nIf y8=6, Δy8=1, y9=7, then at t=9, y9=7, dangerous.\n\nIf y8=6, Δy8=0, y9=6, then y10 = y9 + Δy9 =6 + Δy9 <=7<8, cannot reach 8.\n\nIf y8=5, then y9 <=6, y10<=7<8.\n\nSo only possibility y8=6, Δy8=1, y9=7, but y9=7 at t=9 dangerous.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf we have y10=9.\n\nThen at t=10, y10=9, safe.\n\nThen a10=S, y11=9.\n\nAt t=9, y9 must be 9 (since cannot be 7 or 8, and must be 8 or 9, so 9).\n\nThen y10=9 with S.\n\nAt t=8, y8 must not be 7 or 8, so <=6 or 9.\n\ny9 = y8 + Δy8 =9.\n\nIf y8 <=6, y9 <=7<9, impossible.\n\nIf y8=9, impossible as before.\n\nSo still stuck.\n\nUnless for t=8, if H-1=8, but in this case for H=11, t=8 is not H-1.\n\nThe only way is to have at t=8 and t=9, we are on y=9.\n\nBut to be on y=9 at t=8, impossible.\n\nSo we must avoid being on y=7 or 8 at t=8 and t=9 by being on lower rows.\n\nBut then it takes longer to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, at t=7, be at y=6.\n\nThen at t=8, go to y=7 or y=5 or stay, but y=7 dangerous, so go to y=5 or 6 or 8, but y=8 dangerous, so only y=5 or 6 or 7 dangerous, so go to y=5 or 6.\n\nSay go to y=6 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=9, from y=6, go to y=7 or 6 or 5, but y=7 dangerous, so go to y=5 or 6.\n\nThen at t=10, from y=5 or 6, go up, etc.\n\nBut this will take more turns to reach 9.\n\nWith H=11, we can do it.\n\nFor example:\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nGo up to y=6 by t=6: actions U,U,U,U,U,U, so y_t = t for t=0 to 6, all safe as earlier.\n\nAt t=6, y=6, safe.\n\nNow at t=7, action: can go U to y=7, but at t=7, y=7 is safe, as we saw.\n\nThen at t=7, y=7.\n\nThen at t=8, action: if U to y=8, dangerous at t=8; if S, y=7, dangerous at t=8; if D, to y=6, safe.\n\nSo must go D to y=6 at t=8.\n\nSo a7 = D, y8 = y7 + Δy7 =7 -1 =6.\n\nAt t=8, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=9, action: from y=6, can go U to y=7, but at t=9, y=7 dangerous; S to y=6, safe; D to y=5, safe.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nIf we go U to y=7, dangerous.\n\nSo must go S or D.\n\nSay go S to y=6 at t=9.\n\nThen at t=10, from y=6, go U to y=7.\n\nAt t=10, y=7, safe because t=10 not 8 or 9.\n\nThen at t=11, go U to y=8.\n\nAt t=11, y=8, safe.\n\nThen at t=12, go U to y=9.\n\nBut H=12, too many turns.\n\nFrom t=9, after staying at y=6, at t=10 go U to y=7, t=10.\n\nThen at t=11 go U to y=8, t=11.\n\nThen at t=12 go U to y=9.\n\nBut we can go faster.\n\nAt t=8, y=6, at t=9, instead of staying, go down to y=5, but that is worse.\n\nOr at t=9, from y=6, go directly to y=8? No, only change by 1.\n\nMust be sequential.\n\nAnother idea: at t=7, instead of going to y=7, stay at y=6 or go down, but that delays.\n\nWorse.\n\nGo up to y=7 at t=7, then at t=8 go down to y=6, as above.\n\nThen at t=9, from y=6, go U to y=7, but at t=9, y=7 dangerous, so cannot.\n\nMust go S or D at t=9.\n\nIf go S at t=9, y=6.\n\nThen at t=10, go U to y=7.\n\nt=10 safe.\n\nThen at t=11, U to y=8.\n\nt=11 safe.\n\nThen at t=12, U to y=9.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut we can reach earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=10, from y=7, go U to y=8, but if we can be at y=7 at t=10.\n\nBut from above, at t=9, we are at y=6.\n\nAt t=10, go U to y=7.\n\nThen at t=11, go U to y=8.\n\nThen at t=12, U to y=9.\n\nBut to have y=9 at t=12, H=12 actions? Let's count turns.\n\nTurn t=0 to t=12, with actions from a0 to a11 for y12.\n\nBut we want min H.\n\nSince the dangerous period is short, we can go up fast before and after.\n\nFor example, go up to y=6 by t=6.\n\nThen at t=7, go to y=7 (safe at t=7).\n\nThen at t=8, go down to y=6 (safe at t=8).\n\nThen at t=9, we are at y=6, must go to safe position, so go to y=5 or 6 or 7, but y=7 dangerous, so go to y=5 or 6.\n\nIf go to y=5, then at t=10, go to y=6, t=11 y=7, t=12 y=8, t=13 y=9, too late.\n\nAt t=9, from y=6, go down to y=5, then t=10 y=5, t=11 y=6, t=12 y=7, t=13 y=8, t=14 y=9, worse.\n\nAt t=9, stay at y=6, then t=10 go U to y=7, t=11 U to y=8, t=12 U to y=9.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach y=8 earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=7, y=7.\n\nThen at t=8, go down to y=6.\n\nAt t=9, instead of staying, can we go up to y=7? No, dangerous.\n\nBut at t=9, from y=6, if we go U, y=7, dangerous; if we go D, y=5, then later up.\n\nOr, another way: after t=8 at y=6, at t=9 go S to y=6, then at t=10 go U to y=7, but then we are at y=7 at t=10, safe, then at t=11 go U to y=8, safe, t=12 U to y=9.\n\nBut we can at t=10 go directly to y=8? No.\n\nPerhaps from t=6, instead of going to y=7 at t=7, stay at y=6 for an extra turn.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=0: y=0\n\na0=U, t=1 y=1\n\na1=U, t=2 y=2\n\na2=U, t=3 y=3\n\na3=U, t=4 y=4\n\na4=U, t=5 y=5\n\na5=U, t=6 y=6\n\nNow at t=6, y=6.\n\nInstead of going up, we can stay at y=6 for t=7.\n\na6=S, then y7 = y6 +0 =6, so at t=7, y=6.\n\nThen at t=7, position y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, action: can go U to y=7, but at t=8, y=7 dangerous; or S to y=6, safe; or D to y=5, safe.\n\nIf we go U, dangerous, so must go S or D.\n\nSay go S to y=6 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=9, from y=6, go S to y=6 or D to y=5 or U to y=7 dangerous.\n\nSo go S to y=6 at t=9.\n\nThen at t=10, from y=6, go U to y=7, t=10 safe.\n\nt=11 U to y=8, safe.\n\nt=12 U to y=9.\n\nStill H=12.\n\nTo reach earlier, at t=10, if we can be at higher y.\n\nBut from t=6 at y=6, if we go U at t=7 to y=7, then at t=8 go D to y=6, then at t=9 go S to y=6, then t=10 U to y=7, same as above.\n\nAt t=9, from y=6, if we go U to y=7, but dangerous, not possible.\n\nSo we must avoid y=7 at t=9.\n\nTherefore, the earliest to be at y=7 after t=9 is t=10.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at t=11.\n\nThen y=9 at t=12.\n\nSo min H=12.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can do with H=11.\n\nSuppose at t=7, y=7.\n\nt=8, go D to y=6.\n\nt=9, go D to y=5 (safe at t=9).\n\nThen at t=10, go U to y=6.\n\nt=11 U to y=7.\n\nt=12 U to y=8.\n\nt=13 U to y=9.\n\nWorse.\n\nAt t=9, go S to y=6, then t=10 U to y=7, t=11 U to y=8, t=12 U to y=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nOr at t=10 from y=6, go U to y=7, then at t=11 go U to y=8, t=12 U to y=9.\n\nBut at t=11 y=8, safe.\n\nNow, with this, we reach y=9 at t=12.\n\nActions: from t=0 to t=5: U each, y=0 to6 at t=6.\n\nThen a6: at t=6, action for y7.\n\nTo have y7=6, a6=S.\n\nThen y7=6 at t=7.\n\na7: at t=7, action for y8.\n\nTo have y8=6, a7=S (since if U, y8=7 dangerous; D, y8=5)\n\na7=S, y8=6.\n\nThen at t=8, y=6.\n\na8: for y9, at t=9, must not be 7 or 8, so from y8=6, a8 can be S or D, not U.\n\nSay a8=S, y9=6.\n\nThen a9: for y10, from y9=6, a9=U, y10=7.\n\nThen a10: U, y11=8.\n\na11: U, y12=9.\n\nH=12 actions, to turn 12.\n\nBut we have only one stay so far, but we need more actions.\n\nWith 12 actions, we can have more stays or downs.\n\nBut in this case, we used two stays at t=6 and t=7? Let's list:\n\nActions: a0 to a11 for y12.\n\ny0=0\n\na0=U, y1=1\n\na1=U, y2=2\n\na2=U, y3=3\n\na3=U, y4=4\n\na4=U, y5=5\n\na5=U, y6=6\n\na6=S, y7=6  (t=7, y=6)\n\na7=S, y8=6  (t=8, y=6)\n\na8=S, y9=6  (t=9, y=6)\n\na9=U, y10=7 (t=10, y=7)\n\na10=U, y11=8 (t=11, y=8)\n\na11=U, y12=9 (t=12, y=9)\n\nBut we have three stays, but we can reduce.\n\nAt t=6, y=6, instead of staying, go up to y=7 at t=7.\n\nThen:\n\na5=U, y6=6 (t=6)\n\na6=U, y7=7 (t=7, y=7 safe)\n\na7=D, y8=6 (t=8, y=6 safe)  // because if U or S, dangerous\n\na8=S, y9=6 (t=9, y=6 safe)  // cannot U to 7 dangerous\n\na9=U, y10=7 (t=10)\n\na10=U, y11=8 (t=11)\n\na11=U, y12=9 (t=12)\n\nSame number of turns.\n\nAt t=9, from y=6, we can go down to y=5, but then need to come back, worse.\n\nOr at a8, from y8=6, instead of S, go D to y9=5, then a9 U to y10=6, a10 U to y11=7, a11 U to y12=8, not 9.\n\nNeed more actions.\n\nSo min turns to reach y=9 is 12, with the path above.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach at t=11.\n\nSuppose at t=10, y=8.\n\nThen y11=9 with U.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=10.\n\nFrom start, how to reach y=8 at t=10.\n\nWith actions from a0 to a9 for y10.\n\ny10 = sum_{k=0}^9 Δy_k =8\n\n10 actions, sum=8, so for example, 8U and 2S, or 9U 1D, etc.\n\nNow, at t=8, y8 must <=6\n\nAt t=9, y9 must <=6\n\nBut y10 = y9 + Δy9 =8\n\nSince y9 <=6, Δy9 <=1, y10 <=7<8, impossible.\n\nIf y9=7, but at t=9, y=7 dangerous, not allowed.\n\nSo impossible to have y10=8.\n\nSimilarly, if y10=9, then y9 must be 9 or 8, but y9 cannot be 8, so y9=9, then y10=9 with S.\n\nBut y9=9 requires reaching by t=9, with 9 actions, possible, but at t=9, y=9 safe.\n\nBut at t=8, y8 must <=6 or 9, but y8<=8, so y8<=6.\n\nThen y9 = y8 + Δy8 =9, impossible since y8<=6.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach y=9 at t=11 or earlier than t=12 with the constraints.\n\nSo min H=12.\n\nNow for the sequence.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nGo up to y=6:\n\na0=U, y1=1\n\na1=U, y2=2\n\na2=U, y3=3\n\na3=U, y4=4\n\na4=U, y5=5\n\na5=U, y6=6\n\nNow at t=6, y=6.\n\nThen we need to be safe at t=7,8,9.\n\nAt t=7, we can be at y=6 or 7.\n\nIf go to y=7 at t=7, safe.\n\na6=U, y7=7\n\nAt t=7, y=7.\n\nThen at t=8, must not be on 7 or 8, so go down to y=6.\n\na7=D, y8=6\n\nAt t=8, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=9, from y=6, must not go to y=7, so stay at y=6 or go down.\n\na8=S, y9=6\n\nAt t=9, y=6, safe.\n\nThen go up:\n\na9=U, y10=7\n\na10=U, y11=8\n\na11=U, y12=9\n\nAt t=10, y=7, safe; t=11, y=8, safe; t=12, y=9.\n\nH=12.\n\nTo save one action, but we have to avoid the danger.\n\nAnother path: from t=6 y=6, stay at y=6 for t=7.\n\na6=S, y7=6\n\nThen at t=7, y=6.\n\nThen at t=8, go to y=6 (S) or y=5 (D) or y=7 (U dangerous), so a7=S or D.\n\nSay a7=S, y8=6\n\nThen at t=9, same, a8=S, y9=6\n\nThen a9=U, y10=7\n\na10=U, y11=8\n\na11=U, y12=9\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf at t=8, from y=6, go down to y=5, then need to come back, more actions.\n\nSo min is 12 turns.\n\nBut in the first path, we used one down action.\n\nIn terms of number of actions, both have 12 actions for 12 turns.\n\nNow for the answer, we need the sequence from t=0.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=0.\n\nActions for t=0 to t=11.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 0: action a0\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 11: action for y12, but actions are at each turn.\n\nThe action at turn t determines the move to next position.\n\nFor turn t, action a_t.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be actions from turn t1 to t1 + H-1.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t=0 to t=H-1 for actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn H.\n\nSo for H=12, actions at turn 0 to 11.\n\nWith the path:\n\nTurn 0: U (to y=1 at t=1)\n\nLet's list the actions and positions.\n\nTurn t | action a_t | position after action, at turn t+1? No.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, position becomes y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nFor collision at turn t, based on y_t.\n\nIn the sequence, for each turn, the action.\n\nSo for turn t, we specify a_t.\n\nThen for t=0: a0, which determines y1.\n\nBut position at turn 0 is given, y0=0.\n\nThen after a0, y1.\n\nIn the sequence, we need actions from t=0 to t=11.\n\nFor the player to be at y12=9.\n\nIn the path:\n\n- At turn 0: y0=0, action a0=U, then y1=1\n\n- Turn 1: a1=U, y2=2\n\n- Turn 2: a2=U, y3=3\n\n- Turn 3: a3=U, y4=4\n\n- Turn 4: a4=U, y5=5\n\n- Turn 5: a5=U, y6=6\n\n- Turn 6: a6=U, y7=7  // since we go to y=7 at t=7\n\n- Turn 7: a7=D, y8=6  // from y7=7, down to y8=6\n\n- Turn 8: a8=S, y9=6  // stay at y=6\n\n- Turn 9: a9=U, y10=7\n\n- Turn 10: a10=U, y11=8\n\n- Turn 11: a11=U, y12=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nt=0: y=0, safe\n\nt=1: y=1, safe (t=1 not 16-19)\n\nt=2: y=2, safe\n\nt=3: y=3, safe\n\nt=4: y=4, safe\n\nt=5: y=5, safe\n\nt=6: y=6, safe\n\nt=7: y=7, safe (t=7 not 8 or 9)\n\nt=8: y=6, safe (not 7 or 8)\n\nt=9: y=6, safe\n\nt=10: y=7, safe (t=10 not 8 or 9)\n\nt=11: y=8, safe (t=11 not 8 or 9)\n\nt=12: y=9, safe, but not in the collision check since we care up to when we are on freeways.\n\nAt t=12, y=9, no cars.\n\nAll safe.\n\nWith 12 turns.\n\nBut we have a down action, which might be avoidable, but in this case necessary to avoid danger.\n\nIf we don't go to y=7 at t=7, we can stay at y=6, but then we still need to go up later.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 0: U, y1=1\n\nTurn 1: U, y2=2\n\nTurn 2: U, y3=3\n\nTurn 3: U, y4=4\n\nTurn 4: U, y5=5\n\nTurn 5: U, y6=6\n\nTurn 6: S, y7=6  // stay at t=7 y=6\n\nTurn 7: S, y8=6  // stay at t=8 y=6\n\nTurn 8: S, y9=6  // stay at t=9 y=6\n\nTurn 9: U, y10=7\n\nTurn 10: U, y11=8\n\nTurn 11: U, y12=9\n\nThen at t=7, y=6 safe; t=8, y=6 safe; t=9, y=6 safe; etc.\n\nBut we have three stays, whereas in the first path, we have one down and one stay, but same number of actions.\n\nIn terms of turns, both H=12.\n\nBut in the first path, we reached y=7 earlier but had to come down.\n\nThe second has more stays.\n\nBut both work.\n\nPerhaps we can reduce the stays.\n\nSince the danger is only at t=8 and t=9, and we need to be below, we can go up to y=5 or something, but not necessary.\n\nFor example, go up to y=5 by t=5, then stay or something, but then to reach y=9 takes more turns.\n\nSo min H=12.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nThe minimal H is 12.\n\nSequence of actions.\n\nUsing the first path with down:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U  // to y=7 at t=7\n\nTurn 7: D  // down to y=6 at t=8\n\nTurn 8: S  // stay at y=6 at t=9\n\nTurn 9: U  // to y=7 at t=10\n\nTurn 10: U  // to y=8 at t=11\n\nTurn 11: U  // to y=9 at t=12\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t, action a_t.\n\nAt turn 7: a7=D, so from y7=7 to y8=6\n\nThen at turn 8: a8=S, y9=6\n\nEtc.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nH=12, actions from t=0 to t=11.\n\nBut the player reaches at turn 12.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 8 at t=8.\n\nFreeway 8 at t=8: first car span [-59 +6*8, -48 +48] = [-59+48, 0] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nSecond car at t=8: [-11+48,48] = [37,48], not 0.\n\nSo yes, covers 0.\n\nSimilarly at t=9.\n\nIn our path, at t=8, we are on y=6, not 8, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo it works.\n\nPerhaps we can have a sequence with H=11 by being at y=9 at t=11, but we saw it's impossible due to the math.\n\nSo I think H=12 is minimal.\n\nNow for the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) is 12, with the sequence of actions starting from turn \\(t_1 = 0\\).\n\nThe sequence avoids collisions by ensuring the player is not on freeways \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at turns \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 9\\), when cars on those freeways cover position \\(x = 0\\). Specifically:\n- At turn \\(t = 8\\), freeway \\(y = 8\\) has a car with span \\([-11, 0]\\) (covering \\(x = 0\\)), and freeway \\(y = 7\\) has a car with span \\([-5, 6]\\) (covering \\(x = 0\\)).\n- At turn \\(t = 9\\), freeway \\(y = 8\\) has a car with span \\([-5, 6]\\) (covering \\(x = 0\\)), and freeway \\(y = 7\\) has a car with span \\([1, 12]\\) (not covering \\(x = 0\\) at \\(t = 9\\), but freeway \\(y = 7\\) is dangerous at \\(t = 9\\) due to the first car).\n\nThe path is designed to:\n- Reach \\(y = 6\\) by turn \\(t = 6\\) (safe, as freeway \\(y = 6\\) has no car covering \\(x = 0\\) at any relevant turn).\n- Move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn \\(t = 7\\) (safe, as \\(t = 7\\) is not dangerous for \\(y = 7\\)).\n- At turn \\(t = 7\\), move down to \\(y = 6\\) to avoid being on \\(y = 7\\) at \\(t = 8\\).\n- Stay at \\(y = 6\\) during turns \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 9\\) to remain safe.\n- After the dangerous period, move up to \\(y = 7\\) at \\(t = 10\\), \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 11\\), and \\(y = 9\\) at \\(t = 12\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- Turn 0: U (move up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 1)\n- Turn 1: U (move up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 2)\n- Turn 2: U (move up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 3)\n- Turn 3: U (move up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 4)\n- Turn 4: U (move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 5)\n- Turn 5: U (move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 6)\n- Turn 6: U (move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 7)\n- Turn 7: D (move down to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 8)\n- Turn 8: S (stay at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 9)\n- Turn 9: U (move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 10)\n- Turn 10: U (move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 11)\n- Turn 11: U (move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12)\n\nAt turn 12, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\), and all intermediate positions are collision-free.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

The cars are moving, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a freeway at a certain turn, I don't collide with any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe collision rule is: at turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that turn, then I collide. Also, note that when I move to a new freeway, I'm not considered on it until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, I'm on y at turn T, and on y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nThe player position updates with actions: U for up (y+1), D for down (y-1), S for stay (y same). And y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nNow, the car states are given for turn t=6. For each freeway, there are cars with head, tail, direction, and speed.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions starting from turn 6 to reach y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at turn t=6.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nSince direction is right, head is at h=48? No, the table says head h and tail tau. For right-moving cars, span is [tau, h], so head is the larger number.\n\nIn the car update:\n\n- Left-moving: span [h, tau] -> [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]\n\n- Right-moving: span [tau, h] -> [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]\n\nAnd collision if 0 in span at turn T.\n\nFor freeway k=1: cars: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nSince direction right, span is [tau, h] = [-59, -48] at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, for k=2: (48, 37, right, 12)? Head and tail.\n\n(48, 37, right, 12). Since right, head should be larger, so if tau=37, h=48, then span [37,48] at t=6.\n\nBut in the table it's written as (head, tail, dir, speed), so for k=2: head=48, tail=37, dir=right, speed=12. So span [37,48] at t=6.\n\nSimilarly for k=3,4,5: all (48,37,right,12), so same as k=2.\n\nk=6: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, dir=right, speed=12, span [37,48] at t=6\n\nSecond car: head=0, tail=-11, dir=right, speed=12, span [-11,0] at t=6\n\nk=7: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: head=-48, tail=-59, dir=right, speed=6, span [-59,-48] at t=6\n\nSecond car: head=0, tail=-11, dir=right, speed=6, span [-11,0] at t=6\n\nk=8: same as k=7: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6), span [-59,-48] and [-11,0] at t=6.\n\nNow, the player is at (0,0) at turn t=6. Since y=0, which is not a freeway (freeways are y=1 to 8), so at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars, so no collision possible. But I need to get to y=9.\n\nAt turn t=6, player is on y=0, which is safe. I need to move up to y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0, so to go from y=0 to y=9, I need at least 9 actions if I always go up, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so it could take more turns.\n\nThe minimal H might be more than 9 if there are obstacles.\n\nNow, I need to plan the path through the freeways y=1 to y=8, avoiding collisions at each turn.\n\nSince the cars are moving, I need to compute for each freeway and each turn, whether position x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, I am on freeway y, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that exact turn T.\n\nAnd when I move, at turn T, after action, I am at y_{T}, and that's where I check for collision.\n\nPlayer update: at turn t, I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence: at turn t, I am at position y_t. I choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} is set based on a_t.\n\nThen, at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}, and I check collision for that freeway at turn t+1.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nFrom the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t based on a_t.\n\nSo, at the start of turn t, I am at y_t. I choose a_t, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nThen, at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}, and I need to check if on freeway y_{t+1}, there is a car such that 0 in span at turn t+1.\n\nThe collision condition says: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAlso, the note: if I move to a new y at turn T, I am not on it until turn T, meaning when I decide to move at turn T, y_{T} is the position before action? I think I need to read carefully.\n\nLet's see the player update: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\" based on a_t.\n\nAnd collision: \"at turn T, if 0 in Span(T) for car on freeway y_T\".\n\ny_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, position is y_T, and I check collision for that position at turn T.\n\nWhen I choose a_t at turn t, it sets y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nFor example, at turn t=6, I am at y_6 = 0. I choose a_6, which will set y_7.\n\nThen at turn t=7, I am at y_7, and I check if on freeway y_7, there is a car with 0 in span at turn t=7.\n\nSimilarly for each turn.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 have no cars, they are always safe.\n\nI need to go from y=0 at t=6 to y=9 at some turn.\n\nLet T be the turn index starting from t=6.\n\nSet t=6 as time zero for relative time.\n\nDefine dt = t - 6, so at dt=0, turn=6, y=0.\n\nI need to find H such that at some turn, y =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from a_6 to a_{6+H-1}, and y_{6+H-1} =9? Let's see.\n\nThe turn when I reach y=9 is the last turn of the sequence.\n\nThe player position at turn T: after H actions, I am at turn 6+H, position y_{6+H}.\n\nI start at turn 6, y_6.\n\nAfter first action a_6, at turn 7, y_7.\n\nAfter second action a_7, at turn 8, y_8, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, I am at turn 6+k, position y_{6+k}.\n\nI need y_{6+H} =9 for some H, and H minimal.\n\nAt turn 6, I am at y_6=0, no action yet? I need to choose actions starting from a_6.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_6 to a_{6+H-1}, and after H actions, at turn (6+H), y_{6+H} should be 9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, a_6 = U, then y_7 = 0 +1 =1, but I need to be at 9, so H=1 is too small.\n\nMinimal H without cars is 9: always up, from y_6=0, after 9 ups, at turn 15, y=9.\n\nBut with cars, it might take longer.\n\nNow, I need to simulate the car positions over time to see when each freeway is safe at x=0.\n\nCar positions change with time.\n\nFor a car on freeway i, at time T, span is as given.\n\nTime T is absolute turn number.\n\nSet t_rel = T - 6, so at t_rel=0, T=6.\n\nFor each car, given span at T=6, we can find span at any T.\n\nT > t_1 or any, but since cars are moving continuously, it should be fine.\n\nFor left-moving car: span at T: [h - s*(T-6), tau - s*(T-6)]? From the rule.\n\nCar update: for turn T > t_1, span(T) = for left-moving: [h - s (T - t_1), tau - s (T - t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [tau + s (T - t_1), h + s (T - t_1)]\n\nIn this case t_1=6.\n\nSo for each freeway, list the cars and their spans at time T.\n\nI need to find for each freeway and each time, whether x=0 is covered by any car.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway k and time T, if there is a car on k with 0 in [low, high] of its span at T.\n\nThen, when the player is on freeway y at turn T, it must be that for that y and T, no car has 0 in span, otherwise collision.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars and their span functions.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: at T=6, span for right-moving: [tau, h] = [-59, -48] since head=-48, tail=-59? Head and tail given as (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nSo head h = -48, tail tau = -59, direction right, speed s=3.\n\nSince right, span at T: [tau + s (T-6), h + s (T-6)] = [-59 + 3(T-6), -48 + 3(T-6)]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: car (48,37,right,12), so h=48, tau=37, s=12, right.\n\nSpan at T: [37 + 12(T-6), 48 + 12(T-6)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 3,4,5: same as freeway 2, each has one car like that.\n\nFreeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) same as above, span [37 + 12(T-6), 48 + 12(T-6)]\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), so h=0, tau=-11, s=12, right.\n\nSpan at T: [-11 + 12(T-6), 0 + 12(T-6)] = [-11 + 12(T-6), 12(T-6)]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,6), h=-48, tau=-59, s=6, right.\n\nSpan at T: [-59 + 6(T-6), -48 + 6(T-6)]\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6), h=0, tau=-11, s=6, right.\n\nSpan at T: [-11 + 6(T-6), 0 + 6(T-6)] = [-11 + 6(T-6), 6(T-6)]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: first car span [-59 + 6(T-6), -48 + 6(T-6)], second car [-11 + 6(T-6), 6(T-6)]\n\nNow, for each freeway k and time T, I need to see if x=0 is occupied.\n\nThat is, for k, at T, if for any car on k, 0 is in its span interval.\n\nSo let's find when 0 is in the span for each car.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: car span: low = -59 + 3(T-6), high = -48 + 3(T-6)\n\n0 in [low, high] iff low <= 0 <= high\n\nSo -59 + 3(T-6) <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 3(T-6)\n\nSolve:\n\n-59 + 3(T-6) <= 0 => 3(T-6) <= 59 => T-6 <= 59/3 = 19.666, so T <= 6 + 19 = 25? 19.666, so T <= 25 since T integer? T-6 <= 19.666, so T-6 <= 19 since integer? Let's keep fractional.\n\nT-6 <= 59/3 = 19 + 2/3, so for T-6 <= 19, inequality holds? No:\n\n-59 + 3(T-6) <= 0 => 3(T-6) <= 59 => T-6 <= 59/3 = 19.666, so for T-6 <= 19, since 3*19=57<59, -59+57=-2<0, yes; T-6=20, 3*20=60, -59+60=1>0? Let's compute:\n\nSet dt = T-6, so at time dt relative.\n\nFor freeway 1 car: low = -59 + 3 dt, high = -48 + 3 dt\n\n0 in [low, high] iff low <= 0 <= high\n\nlow <= 0: -59 + 3dt <= 0 => 3dt <= 59 => dt <= 59/3 = 19 + 2/3\n\n0 <= high: 0 <= -48 + 3dt => 3dt >= 48 => dt >= 16\n\nSo dt >= 16 and dt <= 19 + 2/3\n\nSince dt integer, dt = 16,17,18,19\n\nFor dt=16: low = -59 + 3*16 = -59 + 48 = -11, high = -48 + 48 = 0\n\n0 <= high: 0 <= 0, true; low <=0: -11 <=0 true, so 0 in [-11,0], yes.\n\ndt=17: low=-59+51=-8, high=-48+51=3, 0 in [-8,3], yes.\n\ndt=18: low=-59+54=-5, high=-48+54=6, 0 in [-5,6], yes.\n\ndt=19: low=-59+57=-2, high=-48+57=9, 0 in [-2,9], yes.\n\ndt=20: low=-59+60=1, high=-48+60=12, 0 <= high: 0<=12 true, but low=1>0, so 0 not >= low, 0 not in [1,12], false.\n\nSimilarly, dt=15: low=-59+45=-14, high=-48+45=-3, 0 <= high? 0 <= -3 false, so not.\n\nSo for freeway 1, occupied at dt=16,17,18,19 (T=22,23,24,25)\n\nT=6+dt, so T=22,23,24,25.\n\nNow freeway 2: car span [37 + 12 dt, 48 + 12 dt]\n\n0 in [low, high] iff low <= 0 <= high\n\nlow <=0: 37 +12dt <=0? 37+12dt is always positive for dt>=0, since min at dt=0 is 37>0, so low>0, so 0 < low, never <= low, so 0 not in span for any dt. Similarly for freeway 3,4,5 same.\n\nFreeway 2: low =37 +12dt >=37>0, high=48+12dt>0, so 0 < low, so 0 not in [low,high] for any dt. So freeway 2 is always safe at x=0. Similarly freeway 3,4,5 same.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: same as freeway 2, span [37+12dt, 48+12dt], always low>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSecond car: span [-11 +12dt, 12dt]\n\n0 in [low, high] iff low <=0 <= high\n\nlow <=0: -11 +12dt <=0 => 12dt <=11 => dt <= 11/12 <1, so for dt=0 only? dt integer >=0.\n\ndt=0: low=-11 +0 = -11, high=0, 0 <= high: 0<=0 true, low<=0: -11<=0 true, so 0 in [-11,0], yes.\n\ndt=1: low=-11+12=1, high=12, 0 <= high true, but 0 < low=1, false.\n\nFor dt>0, low >=1>0, so not.\n\nSo second car has 0 in span only at dt=0, T=6.\n\nThus for freeway 6, at dt=0 (T=6), second car has span [-11,0], so 0 in span, occupied.\n\nAt other times, first car never has 0, second car only at dt=0, so for dt>0, freeway 6 is safe.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: span [-59 +6dt, -48 +6dt]\n\n0 in [low, high] iff low <=0 <= high\n\nlow <=0: -59 +6dt <=0 => 6dt <=59 => dt <= 59/6 = 9 + 5/6, so dt <=9\n\n0 <= high: 0 <= -48 +6dt => 6dt >=48 => dt >=8\n\nSo dt >=8 and dt <=9\n\ndt=8: low=-59+48= -11, high=-48+48=0, 0 in [-11,0], yes\n\ndt=9: low=-59+54= -5, high=-48+54=6, 0 in [-5,6], yes\n\ndt=10: low=-59+60=1, high=-48+60=12, 0 not >=1, false\n\nSecond car: span [-11 +6dt, 6dt]\n\n0 in [low, high] iff low <=0 <= high\n\nlow <=0: -11 +6dt <=0 => 6dt <=11 => dt <= 11/6 ≈1.833, so dt<=1\n\n0 <= high: 0 <= 6dt => dt >=0\n\nSo for dt=0 and dt=1\n\ndt=0: low=-11, high=0, 0 in span, yes\n\ndt=1: low=-11+6=-5, high=6, 0 in [-5,6], yes\n\ndt=2: low=-11+12=1, high=12, 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo for freeway 7:\n\n- At dt=0: both cars have 0 in span? First car at dt=0: low=-59, high=-48, both negative, 0 not <= high? high=-48<0, so 0 > high, not in span. Only second car has 0 at dt=0.\n\nAt dt=0: first car span [-59,-48], 0 not in [-59,-48] since -48<0.\n\nSecond car span [-11,0], 0 in it.\n\nSo at dt=0, occupied by second car.\n\nAt dt=1: first car span [-59+6= -53, -48+6= -42], 0 not in; second car span [-5,6], 0 in it, so occupied.\n\nAt dt=2: first car span [-59+12= -47, -48+12= -36]? dt=2, -59 +6*2= -59+12= -47, high= -48+12= -36, both negative, 0 not in; second car low=1, high=12, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at dt=8: first car span [-59+48= -11? dt=8, -59 +6*8= -59+48= -11, high= -48+48=0, so [ -11,0], 0 in; second car at dt=8: low= -11 +48=37? -11 +6*8= -11+48=37, high=48, 0 not in, so occupied by first car.\n\ndt=8: first car has 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly dt=9: first car low=-59+54= -5, high=6, 0 in; second car low=-11+54=43, high=48, 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 7, occupied when:\n\n- dt=0: by second car\n\n- dt=1: by second car\n\n- dt=8: by first car\n\n- dt=9: by first car\n\nAnd safe otherwise.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 same as freeway 7, since same cars: occupied at dt=0,1,8,9.\n\nNow, freeway 6 we have occupied only at dt=0.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5 always safe.\n\nFreeway 1 occupied at dt=16,17,18,19.\n\nBut dt=16 is T=22, which might be far, since we start from dt=0.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at turn T=6 (dt=0).\n\nI need to go through y=1 to 8.\n\nSince y=0 is safe, and I start there.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up as fast as possible, but avoiding occupied times.\n\nSince some freeways are occupied at certain times, I need to be on them only when safe.\n\nLet me list for each freeway the unsafe times (when occupied at x=0).\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at dt=16,17,18,19 (T=22,23,24,25)\n\nFreeway 2: always safe\n\nFreeway 3: always safe\n\nFreeway 4: always safe\n\nFreeway 5: always safe\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe at dt=0 (T=6), safe for dt>=1\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at dt=0,1,8,9\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at dt=0,1,8,9\n\nI need to plan a sequence of actions to move from y=0 to y=9, starting from dt=0.\n\nAt each step, I choose to go up, down, or stay, but since I want to minimize time, down or stay might be needed to wait, but going down might not help, and y=0 is safe, so probably stay or up, but down to y=0 or below, but y min 0.\n\ny in [0,9], so I can stay at y=0 or go up.\n\nSimilarly, at other levels.\n\nBut since I need to go up, and lower levels might have issues at early times, I might need to delay going up.\n\nStart at T=6, dt=0, y=0.\n\nI need to choose a_6, which sets y_7.\n\nThen at T=7, dt=1, I am at y_7, and so on.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe fastest way is to go up every turn, but let's see if possible.\n\nIf I always go up:\n\nStart at T=6, y=0, safe.\n\na_6 = U, so y_7 =1\n\nAt T=7, dt=1, y=1, which is freeway 1? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=1 is freeway 1.\n\nAt T=7, dt=1, freeway 1: from above, freeway 1 unsafe only at dt=16-19, so at dt=1, safe. So y=1 at T=7 is safe.\n\nThen a_7 = U, y_8 =2 at T=8, dt=2.\n\ny=2, freeway 2, always safe, so ok.\n\na_8 = U, y_9=3 at T=9, dt=3, freeway 3 safe.\n\na_9 = U, y_10=4 at T=10, dt=4, freeway 4 safe.\n\na_10 = U, y_11=5 at T=11, dt=5, freeway 5 safe.\n\na_11 = U, y_12=6 at T=12, dt=6.\n\nNow freeway 6: at dt=6, since dt=6 >=1, safe, as unsafe only at dt=0. So ok.\n\na_12 = U, y_13=7 at T=13, dt=7.\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at dt=0,1,8,9. dt=7 not in, so safe.\n\na_13 = U, y_14=8 at T=14, dt=8.\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at dt=0,1,8,9. dt=8 is unsafe! Oh, problem.\n\nAt T=14, dt=8, freeway 8 is occupied, as per above.\n\nIf I go to y=8 at dt=8, collision.\n\nSo I cannot go directly up at that time.\n\nI need to avoid being on freeway 8 at dt=8 or 9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 at dt=8 and 9 also unsafe, but in the path, I would be on y=7 at dt=7 (safe), then to y=8 at dt=8, which is unsafe.\n\nSo I need to adjust.\n\nPerhaps I can stay or go down at some point to delay.\n\nSince freeway 6,7,8 have issues at early times, I might stay at lower levels longer.\n\nBut freeway 1 is safe at early times, only unsafe later.\n\nIn the always up path, I reach y=8 at dt=8, which is unsafe.\n\nI need to be on y=8 at a time when it is safe.\n\nFreeway 8 is safe except dt=0,1,8,9.\n\nSo safe for dt=2,3,4,5,6,7,10,etc.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 same.\n\nFreeway 6 safe for dt>=1.\n\nNow, I am at y=0 at dt=0.\n\nI need to go to y=1.\n\ny=1 (freeway 1) is safe at dt=1, which is T=7.\n\nAt dt=0, y=0 safe.\n\nI choose a_6: if I go up, y_7=1 at dt=1, which is safe for freeway 1.\n\nIf I stay, y_7=0 at dt=1, but y=0 safe, but I need to move up eventually.\n\nTo minimize time, I should go up as soon as possible, but with constraints.\n\nIn the always up, I got stuck at y=8 dt=8.\n\nSo for y=8, I need to be there not at dt=8 or 9.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 not at dt=8 or 9, but in the sequence, if I delay earlier, I might arrive later.\n\nSince from y=0 to y=8, it takes 8 steps, so at step k, y= k at dt= k? Let's see.\n\nAt dt=0, T=6, y=0\n\nAfter first action a_6 at T=6, sets y_7.\n\nAfter m actions, at turn T=6+m, y_{6+m}\n\nTo reach y=8, I need at least 8 actions: from y=0 to y=8 in 8 steps, so at turn T=6+8=14, dt=8, y=8.\n\nBut at dt=8, y=8 is unsafe.\n\nIf I take more actions, I arrive later.\n\nFor example, if I stay at some point, I can arrive at y=8 at a later time when safe.\n\nSimilarly, I need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, freeway 8 unsafe at dt=8,9, so I need to be on y=8 at dt not 8 or 9, so dt<=7 or dt>=10.\n\nBut since I start from y=0, to reach y=8 quickly, the earliest I can be at y=8 is dt=8 with 8 ups, but unsafe.\n\nNext is dt=9: if I have one stay, I can be at y=8 at dt=9, but dt=9 is also unsafe for y=8.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at dt=9.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=8 at dt=8 or 9.\n\nThus, the earliest possible to be at y=8 is dt=10, with some delay.\n\nSimilarly, for y=7, unsafe at dt=8,9, so I need to avoid being on y=7 at those times.\n\nBut in the path, I might not be on y=7 at those times if I sequence properly.\n\nNow, let's list the unsafe times for each y:\n\nFor freeway k=y:\n\ny=1: unsafe dt=16,17,18,19\n\nBut these are late, so for early path, we can ignore for now.\n\ny=2: always safe\n\ny=3: always safe\n\ny=4: always safe\n\ny=5: always safe\n\ny=6: unsafe only at dt=0\n\ny=7: unsafe at dt=0,1,8,9\n\ny=8: unsafe at dt=0,1,8,9\n\nNow, I start at y=0, dt=0.\n\nI need to go to y=1, but y=1 is safe at dt=1, as we saw.\n\nPerhaps I can go up to y=1 at dt=1.\n\nThen to higher y.\n\nBut when I reach y=7 or 8, I need to avoid dt=8 and 9.\n\nSince y=6 is safe for dt>=1, and y=5 always safe, etc.\n\nOne way is to reach y=6 early and stay there until it's safe to go up.\n\ny=6 is freeway 6, unsafe only at dt=0, safe for dt>=1.\n\nAt dt=1, I can be on y=1, or higher.\n\nLet me plan the path step by step.\n\nI need to be at y=9 eventually.\n\nThe critical part is around y=7 and 8 at times dt=8,9.\n\nI should avoid being on y=7 or 8 at dt=8 or 9.\n\nSince I need to pass through them, I should be on them at other times.\n\nFor example, I can be on y=7 at dt=7 or dt=10, etc.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nBut I need to connect from lower y.\n\nAlso, from y=0 to y=6, I can go quickly, since y=6 safe from dt=1 onwards.\n\ny=6 safe for dt>=1.\n\nAt dt=1, I can be on y=1.\n\nLet me set the actions.\n\nAt T=6, dt=0: y=0, safe. I choose a_6.\n\nIf I choose U, then y_7=1 at T=7, dt=1.\n\ny=1 at dt=1 is safe, as freeway 1 safe except later.\n\nThen a_7=U, y_8=2 at T=8, dt=2, safe (y=2 always safe).\n\na_8=U, y_9=3 at T=9, dt=3, safe.\n\na_9=U, y_10=4 at T=10, dt=4, safe.\n\na_10=U, y_11=5 at T=11, dt=5, safe.\n\na_11=U, y_12=6 at T=12, dt=6.\n\ny=6 at dt=6, which is >=1, safe.\n\nNow, from here, I need to go to y=7.\n\nBut y=7 is unsafe at dt=8,9.\n\nAt T=12, dt=6, y=6.\n\nI choose a_11? Actions: at turn T=12, I choose a_12, which sets y_13.\n\nAt T=12, I am at y=6, choose a_12.\n\nIf I choose U, then y_13=7 at T=13, dt=7.\n\nNow, freeway 7 at dt=7: unsafe times dt=0,1,8,9, so dt=7 not unsafe, safe.\n\nThen at T=13, y=7, safe.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=8.\n\nBut at T=13, I choose a_13.\n\nIf I choose U, y_14=8 at T=14, dt=8.\n\nBut freeway 8 at dt=8 is unsafe! Problem.\n\nIf I choose to stay, a_13=S, then y_14=7 at T=14, dt=8.\n\nBut y=7 at dt=8 is also unsafe, since freeway 7 unsafe at dt=8.\n\nSo if I stay at y=7 at T=13 (dt=7), choosing S, I stay at y=7 for T=14, dt=8, but unsafe.\n\nIf I go down, to y=6, but that might not help.\n\nAt T=13, y=7, dt=7, safe.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Go U: to y=8 at T=14 dt=8, unsafe\n\n- Go S: stay y=7 at T=14 dt=8, unsafe\n\n- Go D: to y=6 at T=14 dt=8, but y=6 is safe at dt=8, since safe for dt>=1.\n\nBut I went down, which is away from goal.\n\nThen I need to go up again later.\n\nBut time increases.\n\nTo avoid being on y=7 or 8 at dt=8, I should not be on them at that time.\n\nAt dt=7, I am on y=7, which is safe, but at the next turn, if I move to y=8, I will be on y=8 at dt=8, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, I am on y=7 at dt=8, unsafe.\n\nSo I must leave y=7 before dt=8 or after, but at dt=7, I am on it.\n\nPerhaps I need to delay reaching y=7.\n\nFor example, stay at lower levels longer so that I reach y=7 after dt=9.\n\nSince dt=8 and 9 are unsafe for y=7 and 8.\n\nSo I can be on y=7 at dt=7 or dt=10, etc.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nIn the current path, I reach y=7 at dt=7, which is safe, but I cannot stay or go up without problem at next step.\n\nSo I need to arrive at y=7 later.\n\nFor example, if I spend an extra turn at some lower level.\n\nCurrently, from start, I go up each turn to y=6 at dt=6.\n\nThen instead of going to y=7 immediately, I can stay at y=6 for one turn.\n\nAt T=12, dt=6, y=6, I choose a_12 = S (stay), then y_13=6 at T=13, dt=7.\n\ny=6 at dt=7 is safe.\n\nThen at T=13, y=6, I choose a_13 = U, then y_14=7 at T=14, dt=8.\n\nBut y=7 at dt=8 is unsafe! Still problem.\n\nIf I stay again, y_14=6 at T=14, dt=8, safe, but still at y=6.\n\nThen I can go up later.\n\nBut when to go up.\n\ny=7 unsafe at dt=8,9, so I need to be on y=7 at dt<=7 or dt>=10.\n\ndt=7 is safe, as before.\n\nBut if I go to y=7 at dt=7, I have the issue at next turn.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=7 at dt=10.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at dt=10 or later.\n\nBut dt=10 is safe for both.\n\nNow, from y=6, I can stay until it's time.\n\nLet me list the turn and desired y.\n\nI start at dt=0, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal H is 9, but may be more.\n\nSince y=7 and 8 are unsafe at dt=8,9, I should avoid being on them between dt=8 to 9 inclusive.\n\nSo the time window dt=8 and 9 should not have me on y=7 or 8.\n\nI can be on lower or higher y.\n\nBut higher y not yet, since I need to go up.\n\nSo at dt=8 and 9, I should be on y<=6 or y=9, but y=9 not yet.\n\ny<=6.\n\nFor example, at dt=8, I should be on y<=6.\n\nSimilarly at dt=9, y<=6.\n\nThen at dt=10, I can be on y=7 or 8.\n\nNow, let's see the path.\n\nFrom start, I can go up to y=6 quickly.\n\nAt dt=0: y=0\n\na_6=U, y=1 at dt=1\n\na_7=U, y=2 at dt=2\n\na_8=U, y=3 at dt=3\n\na_9=U, y=4 at dt=4\n\na_10=U, y=5 at dt=5\n\na_11=U, y=6 at dt=6\n\nNow at T=12, dt=6, y=6, I need to ensure that at dt=8 and 9, I am not on y=7 or 8.\n\nSo at dt=6, y=6.\n\nI can stay here for some turns.\n\nAt T=12, dt=6, choose a_12.\n\nIf I choose S, then y_13=6 at T=13, dt=7\n\nStill y=6 at dt=7.\n\nAt T=13, dt=7, y=6, choose a_13.\n\nIf I choose S again, y_14=6 at T=14, dt=8\n\nAt dt=8, y=6, which is <=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=14, dt=8, y=6, I can choose to go up or stay.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=7, but at safe time.\n\ny=7 safe at dt=7,10,11,etc, but dt=7 is past, now dt=8.\n\nAt dt=8, I am at y=6.\n\nIf I go up, y_15=7 at T=15, dt=9.\n\nBut y=7 at dt=9 is unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, y_15=6 at T=15, dt=9, safe, but not progress.\n\nSo better to stay at y=6 until dt=9 is over.\n\nAt T=14, dt=8, y=6, I choose S, then y_15=6 at T=15, dt=9, safe.\n\nThen at T=15, dt=9, y=6, I can choose U, to y_16=7 at T=16, dt=10.\n\nNow dt=10, freeway 7: unsafe times dt=0,1,8,9, so dt=10 not unsafe, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=16, y=7, safe.\n\nThen I can go to y=8.\n\na_16=U, y_17=8 at T=17, dt=11.\n\nFreeway 8 at dt=11: unsafe dt=0,1,8,9, so dt=11 safe.\n\nThen a_17=U, y_18=9 at T=18, dt=12.\n\ny=9, safe, reached.\n\nNow, let's list the actions and turns.\n\nStart: T=6, dt=0, y=0\n\na_6 = U  // to y=1 at T=7\n\nT=7, dt=1, y=1\n\na_7 = U  // to y=2 at T=8\n\nT=8, dt=2, y=2\n\na_8 = U  // to y=3 at T=9\n\nT=9, dt=3, y=3\n\na_9 = U  // to y=4 at T=10\n\nT=10, dt=4, y=4\n\na_10 = U  // to y=5 at T=11\n\nT=11, dt=5, y=5\n\na_11 = U  // to y=6 at T=12\n\nT=12, dt=6, y=6\n\na_12 = S  // stay, y=6 at T=13\n\nT=13, dt=7, y=6\n\na_13 = S  // stay, y=6 at T=14\n\nT=14, dt=8, y=6\n\na_14 = S  // stay, y=6 at T=15? Let's see:\n\nAt T=14, y=6, choose a_14, set y_15.\n\na_14 = S, then y_15=6 at T=15, dt=9\n\nT=15, dt=9, y=6\n\na_15 = U  // to y=7 at T=16\n\nT=16, dt=10, y=7\n\na_16 = U  // to y=8 at T=17\n\nT=17, dt=11, y=8\n\na_17 = U  // to y=9 at T=18\n\nT=18, dt=12, y=9, done.\n\nH = number of actions: from a_6 to a_17, that's 12 actions? Turns: start at T=6, after 0 actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 6+H, y=9.\n\nHere, at T=18, y=9, so 6+H=18, H=12.\n\nActions from a_6 to a_17, which is 12 actions? a_6 to a_17 inclusive is 12 actions: t=6 to 17, 12 turns? Let's index.\n\nThe actions are for turns t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nHere t_1=6, so actions a_6 to a_{6+H-1}, and after H actions, at turn 6+H, y=9.\n\nIn this case, at turn 18, y=9, so 6+H=18, H=12.\n\nActions: a_6 to a_{17}, since 6+11=17? a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt=0: a_6, t=1: a_7, ..., t=11: a_{17}, so 12 actions.\n\nBut we reached at turn 18.\n\nIs this minimal? I used 3 extra stays at y=6.\n\nBut perhaps I can reduce.\n\nNotice that at dt=7, y=7 is safe, but I had to avoid because of the next step.\n\nIn this path, I went to y=7 at dt=10, which is fine.\n\nBut maybe I can go earlier if I time differently.\n\nFor example, suppose I go to y=6 earlier.\n\nAt dt=0, y=0.\n\nInstead of going up immediately, I could stay at y=0 for some time, but y=0 is safe, but going up later might delay more.\n\nFor instance, if I stay at y=0 at first.\n\na_6 = S, then y_7=0 at T=7, dt=1\n\nThen a_7=U, y_8=1 at T=8, dt=2\n\ny=1 at dt=2, safe.\n\na_8=U, y_9=2 at T=9, dt=3, safe.\n\n...\n\nContinue up: a_9=U, y_10=3 dt=4\n\na_10=U, y_11=4 dt=5\n\na_11=U, y_12=5 dt=6\n\na_12=U, y_13=6 dt=7\n\nNow at T=13, dt=7, y=6\n\nThen I can go to y=7.\n\na_13=U, y_14=7 at T=14, dt=8\n\nBut y=7 at dt=8 unsafe! Same problem.\n\nIf I stay at y=6, a_13=S, y_14=6 at dt=8, safe.\n\nThen a_14=U, y_15=7 at dt=9, unsafe.\n\na_14=S, y_15=6 at dt=9, then a_15=U, y_16=7 at dt=10, safe, same as before.\n\nSo I still need to wait until dt=10 to go to y=7.\n\nIn the first path, I reached y=6 at dt=6, then stayed until dt=9, then to y=7 at dt=10.\n\nIn this alternative, I reached y=6 later, at dt=7, then still need to stay or go later.\n\nWorse or same.\n\nSo the first path seems efficient.\n\nBut in the first path, I had to stay at y=6 for three turns: at dt=6,7,8? Let's see the times.\n\nIn first path: after a_11 U at T=11, y=6 at T=12, dt=6.\n\nThen at T=12 (dt=6), choose a_12=S, so y_13=6 at T=13, dt=7\n\nAt T=13 (dt=7), choose a_13=S, so y_14=6 at T=14, dt=8\n\nAt T=14 (dt=8), choose a_14=S, so y_15=6 at T=15, dt=9\n\nThen at T=15 (dt=9), a_15=U, y_16=7 at T=16, dt=10\n\nSo I stayed at y=6 from dt=6 to dt=9, that's four turns at y=6: T=12,13,14,15 with y=6, but actions: at T=12,13,14 I chose S, so at T=12,13,14,15 I am at y=6? Turn and position.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nT=12: y=6\n\nAction a_12=S, so y_13=6\n\nT=13: y=6\n\na_13=S, y_14=6\n\nT=14: y=6\n\na_14=S, y_15=6\n\nT=15: y=6\n\na_15=U, y_16=7\n\nT=16: y=7\n\na_16=U, y_17=8\n\nT=17: y=8\n\na_17=U, y_18=9\n\nT=18: y=9\n\nSo from T=12 to T=15, y=6, that's turns 12,13,14,15, four turns, but I only need to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at dt=8 and 9.\n\nAt dt=8: T=14, I am at y=6, safe.\n\ndt=9: T=15, y=6, safe.\n\nThen I go to y=7 at T=16, dt=10.\n\nI could go to y=7 earlier if possible, but dt=7 is the only early safe time, but I can't because of the next step.\n\nSince at dt=7, y=7 is safe, and if I could go directly to y=8 at dt=8, but y=8 unsafe at dt=8.\n\nNo way.\n\nPerhaps I can go from y=6 to y=7 at dt=7, then since y=7 at dt=7 safe, but then at next turn, if I could skip or something, but I have to choose action.\n\nAt dt=7, T=13, y=7, safe.\n\nThen I choose action: if I go U, to y=8 at dt=8, unsafe.\n\nIf I go S, stay y=7 at dt=8, unsafe.\n\nIf I go D, to y=6 at dt=8, safe, but then I go down, and later need to come up, which takes more time.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt T=13, dt=7, y=7 (if I went there)\n\nThen a_13 = D, so y_14 = 6 at T=14, dt=8, safe (y=6)\n\nThen at T=14, y=6, I can go up again, but to y=7 at T=15, dt=9, which is unsafe for y=7.\n\nSo I have to stay or go down, worse.\n\nThus, not better than staying at y=6.\n\nTherefore, the first plan is good.\n\nBut in the first plan, I used three stay actions at y=6, from T=12 to T=14, choosing S, so that at T=15 I am still at y=6, then go up.\n\nIn terms of actions: from T=12 to T=14, I chose S three times? T=12,13,14 actions S.\n\nLet's list all actions:\n\nT=6: a_6 = U  // to y=1 at T=7\n\nT=7: a_7 = U  // to y=2 at T=8\n\nT=8: a_8 = U  // to y=3 at T=9\n\nT=9: a_9 = U  // to y=4 at T=10\n\nT=10: a_10 = U  // to y=5 at T=11\n\nT=11: a_11 = U  // to y=6 at T=12\n\nT=12: a_12 = S  // stay, y=6 at T=13\n\nT=13: a_13 = S  // stay, y=6 at T=14\n\nT=14: a_14 = S  // stay, y=6 at T=15\n\nT=15: a_15 = U  // to y=7 at T=16\n\nT=16: a_16 = U  // to y=8 at T=17\n\nT=17: a_17 = U  // to y=9 at T=18\n\nNow, at T=18, y=9.\n\nH=12 actions? From a_6 to a_17, that's 12 actions.\n\nt from 0 to 11, 12 actions.\n\nBut I need to confirm if all positions are safe.\n\nAt each turn T, position y_T:\n\nT=6: y=0, safe\n\nT=7: y=1, freeway 1 at dt=1, safe (since unsafe only dt=16-19)\n\nT=8: y=2, freeway 2, always safe\n\nT=9: y=3, freeway 3, safe\n\nT=10: y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\nT=11: y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\nT=12: y=6, freeway 6 at dt=6, safe (unsafe only dt=0)\n\nT=13: y=6, freeway 6 at dt=7, safe\n\nT=14: y=6, freeway 6 at dt=8, safe\n\nT=15: y=6, freeway 6 at dt=9, safe\n\nT=16: y=7, freeway 7 at dt=10, unsafe times dt=0,1,8,9, so dt=10 safe\n\nT=17: y=8, freeway 8 at dt=11, unsafe times dt=0,1,8,9, so dt=11 safe\n\nT=18: y=9, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nBut H=12, is it minimal?\n\nPerhaps I can reduce the waiting.\n\nNotice that at dt=7, y=7 is safe, and if I go to y=7 at dt=7, but then I have to go down or something, but that might not save time.\n\nSuppose I go to y=6 at dt=6 as before.\n\nThen at T=12, dt=6, y=6, instead of staying, I go up to y=7 at dt=7, T=13.\n\ny=7 at dt=7 safe.\n\nThen at T=13, I choose to go down, a_13=D, to y=6 at T=14, dt=8.\n\ny=6 at dt=8 safe.\n\nThen at T=14, y=6, I can go up to y=7 at T=15, dt=9, but y=7 at dt=9 unsafe, cannot.\n\nSo I stay at y=6, a_14=S, y_15=6 at T=15, dt=9 safe.\n\nThen a_15=U, y_16=7 at T=16, dt=10 safe.\n\nThen same as before, but I used an extra down action, so I have a_13=D, then later a_15=U, which is worse than just staying.\n\nSo no benefit.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=5 or something at dt=8, but y=5 is safe, but I need to go up eventually.\n\nNo better.\n\nAnother idea: since freeway 8 is safe at dt=7, for example.\n\ndt=7, T=13.\n\nIf I can be on y=8 at dt=7.\n\nBut from start, to reach y=8 at dt=7, I need to go from y=0 to y=8 in 7 actions? Let's see.\n\nAt dt=0, T=6, y=0\n\nAfter 1 action: T=7, y=1\n\nAfter 2: T=8, y=2\n\nAfter 3: T=9, y=3\n\nAfter 4: T=10, y=4\n\nAfter 5: T=11, y=5\n\nAfter 6: T=12, y=6\n\nAfter 7: T=13, y=7\n\nTo be at y=8 at T=13, I need after 7 actions to be at y=8.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 6+k, y_{6+k}\n\nSet y_{6+k} =8 for some k.\n\nAt turn 6+k, position.\n\nTo have y=8 at turn T, I need to have taken actions to reach there.\n\nMinimal k=8 to reach y=8 at turn 14 (dt=8), but unsafe.\n\nAt turn 13 (dt=7), y=8: to have y=8 at T=13, that means at T=13, position y=8.\n\ny_{13} =8.\n\nThis requires that from T=6 to T=13, I increased y by 8, in 7 steps? From turn 6 to turn 13, there are 7 actions? Turns: T=6 to T=13, actions at T=6 to T=12, 7 actions, to go from y_6=0 to y_13=8, which requires net +8 in 7 actions, possible only with 8 ups and one down or something, but I can only change by -1,0,+1 each action.\n\nEach action changes y by at most 1, so from y_6=0 to y_13=8, after 7 actions (a6 to a12), the position y_13 is determined.\n\nThe change: y_13 = y_6 + sum_{t=6}^{12} Delta y_t\n\ny_6=0, y_13=8, so sum from t=6 to 12 of Delta y_t =8\n\nThere are 7 actions (t=6 to 12), each Delta y_t = -1,0, or +1.\n\nSo to have sum=8, I need at least 8 +1 actions, but only 7, impossible. Max increase is +7 with all U, y_13=7.\n\nMinimal to reach y=8 is after 8 actions, at turn 14.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y=7 at turn 13: after 7 actions, y_13 = y_6 + sum_{t=6}^{12} Delta y_t =0 + sum of 7 actions, max y=7.\n\nSo at turn 13 (dt=7), I can be at most y=7.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 12 (dt=6), max y=6.\n\nThus, it's impossible to be on y=8 before turn 14, or on y=7 before turn 13.\n\nAt turn 13, I can be on y=7.\n\nBut as before, if on y=7 at turn 13 (dt=7), I cannot stay or go up without collision at next turn if dt=8.\n\nAnd going down wastes time.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 12, with the path above.\n\nBut in the output, I need to list the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, I have three S at y=6.\n\nBut perhaps I can have fewer waits if I use other levels.\n\nFor example, since y=2,3,4,5 are always safe, I could stay there instead of at y=6.\n\nBut staying earlier might not help, because the unsafe window is fixed.\n\nSuppose I stay at y=5 for some time.\n\nBut y=5 is safe, but when I go to y=6, I need to go through, and y=6 is safe except dt=0, which is past.\n\nThen from y=6 to y=7, same issue.\n\nFor instance, if I reach y=5 earlier and stay, but I reach y=5 at dt=5, then if I stay, I can be at y=5 at later dt, but when I go to y=6 and then y=7, I might still hit the unsafe time.\n\nFor example, suppose at some point I stay longer at y=5.\n\nBut y=5 at dt=8 is safe, but I need to go to y=6.\n\nIf I go to y=6 at dt=8, y=6 safe, but then to y=7 at dt=9, unsafe.\n\nOr if I go to y=7 at dt=10, same as before.\n\nNo better.\n\nThus, H=12 seems minimal.\n\nNow, about freeway 1, we have unsafe at dt=16-19, but in this path, I am on y=1 at dt=1, which is early, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other late times not relevant.\n\nSo the action sequence is as above.\n\nNow, to write in the answer format.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U  // for turn 6\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1} = U  // turn 7\n\n...\n\nIn the sequence: for t from 0 to H-1, action at turn t_1 + t.\n\nt_1=6.\n\nH=12.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nIn the action list, turn 12 is t_1 +6? t_1=6, turn 6: t=0, turn7:t=1, ..., turn12: t=6, turn13:t=7, turn14:t=8, turn15:t=9, turn16:t=10, turn17:t=11.\n\nt from 0 to 11.\n\nActions:\n\na_6: U\n\na_7: U\n\na_8: U\n\na_9: U\n\na_10: U\n\na_11: U  // now at y=6 at T=12\n\na_12: S  // stay, at T=13 y=6\n\na_13: S  // stay, T=14 y=6\n\na_14: S  // stay, T=15 y=6? a_14 at turn 14, sets y_15.\n\nIn terms of the sequence:\n\nThe actions are chosen at each turn.\n\nAt turn T, choose a_T, which affects y_{T+1}, but the position at turn T is before action or after?\n\nIn the collision, at turn T, position y_T is used to check collision.\n\nAnd y_T is set by previous action.\n\nFor example, at turn T=6, y_6=0, no action yet for this position.\n\nThen I choose a_6, which sets y_7.\n\nAt turn T=7, I am at y_7, and check collision based on y_7 and cars at T=7.\n\nIn the sequence above, all positions are safe as listed.\n\nIn the action list for the answer, I need to output the actions for each turn starting from t_1.\n\nSo for turn 6: action a_6 = U\n\nTurn 7: a_7 = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 17: a_17 = U\n\nAnd after a_17, at turn 18, y=9.\n\nNow, in the boxed format.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 12,13,14 I have S.\n\nTurn 12: a_12=S, etc.\n\nPerhaps I can write the sequence.\n\nSince the player reaches y=9 at turn 18, H=12 actions.\n\nBut let me confirm if I can reach faster.\n\nSuppose I go to y=6 at dt=6, then at dt=7, I go to y=7, but then at dt=8, I must leave, so I go down to y=6, but at dt=8 y=6 safe, then at dt=9, I go to y=7? But y=7 unsafe at dt=9.\n\nCannot.\n\nAt dt=8, from y=6, I go to y=7? But y=7 at dt=9 if I go at dt=8.\n\nIf at T=14, dt=8, y=6, I choose U, then y_15=7 at T=15, dt=9, unsafe.\n\nIf I choose D, to y=5, then later come up, worse.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, minimal H is 12.\n\nSo the action sequence is:\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nIn the answer, it should be written as:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 6: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: & U \\end{array} }\n\nBut H=12, from turn 6 to 17, that's 12 turns.\n\nThe last action is at turn 17, and at turn 18, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 17 action U to y=9.\n\nNow, I think that's correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) is 12. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by timing movements to be on critical freeways (e.g., \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\)) only when they are safe at \\(x = 0\\).\n\n### Key Points for Collision Avoidance:\n- **Freeway 1**: Unsafe at turns \\(T = 22, 23, 24, 25\\) (relative \\(dt = 16, 17, 18, 19\\)), but not relevant in this sequence as \\(y = 1\\) is occupied early (at turn 7, \\(dt = 1\\)).\n- **Freeway 6**: Unsafe only at turn \\(T = 6\\) (\\(dt = 0\\)), safe for \\(T \\geq 7\\) (\\(dt \\geq 1\\)).\n- **Freeway 7**: Unsafe at turns \\(T = 6, 7, 14, 15\\) (\\(dt = 0, 1, 8, 9\\)).\n- **Freeway 8**: Unsafe at turns \\(T = 6, 7, 14, 15\\) (\\(dt = 0, 1, 8, 9\\)).\n- Freeways 2, 3, 4, 5 are always safe at \\(x = 0\\).\n\nThe sequence reaches \\(y = 6\\) at turn 12 (\\(dt = 6\\)) and stays there until turn 15 (\\(dt = 9\\)) to avoid being on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) during unsafe turns 14 and 15 (\\(dt = 8, 9\\)). Then, it proceeds to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 16 (\\(dt = 10\\)) and \\(y = 8\\) at turn 17 (\\(dt = 11\\)), both safe, before reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 18.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe actions are chosen at each turn from \\(t = t_1 = 6\\) to \\(t = t_1 + H - 1 = 17\\), resulting in \\(y = 9\\) at turn 18.\n\n- At turn 6, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 7 (safe, freeway 1 at \\(dt = 1\\)).\n- Turns 7 to 11: Actions \\(U\\) move up one freeway per turn, all safe (freeways 2-5 always safe; freeway 6 at turn 12, \\(dt = 6\\), safe).\n- Turns 12 to 14: Actions \\(S\\) stay at \\(y = 6\\) (safe, freeway 6 at \\(dt = 6, 7, 8\\)).\n- Turn 15: Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 16 (safe, freeway 7 at \\(dt = 10\\)).\n- Turn 16: Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 17 (safe, freeway 8 at \\(dt = 11\\)).\n- Turn 17: Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 18 (safe, no cars).\n\nThis sequence minimizes \\(H = 12\\) as any fewer actions would require reaching \\(y = 9\\) earlier, but the unsafe windows at \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) around turns 14-15 force a delay.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 6: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: & U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 0) at turn t_1 = 12, and I need to get to (0, 9) in as few turns as possible, moving up or down or staying, but avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The grid has y from 0 to 9, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars there.\n\nThe car movement: for each freeway, there are cars with head, tail, direction, and speed. The direction tells if it's left or right moving, but in the update, left-moving cars move left (decreasing x), right-moving move right (increasing x). But in this problem, all cars given are right-moving, I think? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the car state:\n\n- Freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3) — head h=-48, tail tau=-59? That seems odd because usually head is the front, so for right-moving, head should be greater than tail, but here h=-48, tau=-59, so since -48 > -59, it might be fine, but let's confirm the span.\n\nThe span is given as (head, tail), and for right-moving, it says span is [tau, h] which becomes [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]. In this case, for freeway 1: head h=-48, tail tau=-59, direction right, speed 3.\n\nBut in the notation, it says \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\", and for right-moving, the span is [tau, h] at time t_1, and then at time T, [tau + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, it would be [h - s dt, tau - s dt].\n\nBut all cars here have direction \"right\", so they're all right-moving.\n\nNow, collision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T between 1 and 8, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAlso, important: when the player moves to a new y, at turn T, if they move to y_{T+1} != y_T, they are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so no collision from cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nThe player position is updated after the action, so at turn T, after action a_T, we have y_{T+1}.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the start of turn t, the player is at position (0, y_t).\n\nThen they choose action a_t, which determines delta y, so y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y.\n\nThen, at this new position, for turn t+1, but the collision is checked at the turn when the player is on the freeway.\n\nThe collision condition: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\ny_T is the player's y-position at turn T.\n\nSo at turn T, player is at (0, y_T), and if y_T is between 1 and 8 inclusive, and there is a car on freeway y_T such that 0 is within its span at that exact turn T.\n\nThe span at turn T depends on the initial span at t_1 and the elapsed time.\n\nt_1 is the current turn, 12.\n\nFor any future turn T, the car position is computed based on T - t_1.\n\nLet dt = T - t_1.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, with initial head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s.\n\nSince all d are right, we can simplify.\n\nFor right-moving, span at time T is [tau + s * dt, h + s * dt]\n\nBecause at t_1, span is [tau, h], then moves right.\n\nIn the input, for freeway 1: head h=-48, tail tau=-59, so at t_1, span is [tau, h] = [-59, -48]? But it says \"head h, tail tau\", and for right, span [tau, h], so tail is left end, head is right end.\n\nIn this case, tau = -59, h = -48, so span at t_1 is [-59, -48], and it's moving right with speed 3.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision if at turn T, for the player's y_T, if y_T between 1 and 8, and 0 is in [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt] for some car on that freeway.\n\nSince the car spans are intervals on x-axis, and we care about x=0.\n\nAlso, the player is at x=0 always, I assume, since it's a vertical movement game.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\ny=0 is safe, y=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe freeways with cars are y=1 to 8, each may have one or more cars.\n\nLet me list all cars per freeway at t_1=12.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: h=-48, tau=-59, d=right, s=3. So span at t_1: [tau, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (48, 37, right, 12) — head=48, tail=37? But 48 > 37, and right-moving, so span [tau, h] = [37, 48]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (48,37,right,12) — probably a mistake or same car? But freeways are different.\n\nIn the table, freeway 3 also (48,37,right,12), freeway 4 same, freeway 5 same. That can't be right, or is it?\n\nLet me read:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n\n| 1 | (-48, -59, right, 3) |\n\n| 2 | (48, 37, right, 12) |\n\n| 3 | (48, 37, right, 12) |\n\n| 4 | (48, 37, right, 12) |\n\n| 5 | (48, 37, right, 12) |\n\n| 6 | (48, 37, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12)  two cars\n\n| 7 | (-48, -59, right, 6), (0, -11, right, 6)  two cars\n\n| 8 | (-48, -59, right, 6), (0, -11, right, 6)  two cars\n\nFreeway 6 has two cars: one (48,37,right,12) and one (0,-11,right,12)\n\nSimilarly for 7 and 8.\n\nNow, for each, I need to find when 0 is covered by a car span on that freeway.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, I need to ensure that when on a freeway y at turn T, 0 not in any car span on y at T.\n\nAlso, the player can move up, down, or stay, so I can change y or stay to avoid collisions.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9 as fast as possible, so minimal H.\n\nSince y=0 to y=9, and I can move ±1 or 0, the minimum number of moves is 9 if I only move up, but I might need to wait or detour due to cars.\n\ny starts at 0, want to go to 9, so minimum H=9 actions to go from turn t_1 to t_1+8, position from y=0 to y=9 in 8 moves? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t_1, position y_t1 = 0.\n\nAfter action a_t1, y_{t1+1} = y_t1 + delta y.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t_1 + H, the position is y_{t1+H}.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1, meaning a_t1 to a_t1+H-1, and after H actions, at turn t1+H, the position is y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nAnd H is the number of turns from t1 to t1+H-1, so the number of actions is H, and after H actions, at turn t1+H, we are at 9.\n\nThe time from start to finish is H turns, but the position after H actions is at turn t1+H.\n\nSince we start at turn t1 with y=0, after 0 actions, at turn t1, y=0.\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn t1+1, y_{t1+1}, and so on, up to after H actions, at turn t1+H, y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nSo we need to reach y=9 at turn t1+H.\n\nThe minimal H such that we can achieve this without collision during the path.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn when the player is on a freeway y between 1 and 8.\n\nAt turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, and 0 in car span on y_T at T.\n\nIf y_T = 0 or 9, no collision possible.\n\nAlso, when moving, if at turn T, y_T is say 1, and I move to y_{T+1}=2, then at turn T, I am on y=1, so I can collide with cars on y=1 at T, but not with cars on y=2 at T, because I'm not on y=2 yet.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T+1, I am on y=2, so I need to avoid collision with cars on y=2 at T+1.\n\nNow, to find the minimal H, I should first see if I can go straight up in 9 turns: from y=0 to y=1 at turn t1+1, y=2 at t1+2, ..., y=9 at t1+9.\n\nH=9 actions: actions from t1 to t1+8, positions from y1 at t1+1 to y9 at t1+9? Let's define the turns.\n\nSet t1 = 12 for simplicity.\n\nAt turn 12: position y=0\n\nAfter action a12, at turn 13: y13\n\nAfter a13, turn 14: y14\n\n...\n\nAfter a12+H-1, turn 12+H: y_{12+H} =9\n\nSo we need y_{12+H} =9.\n\nFor minimal H, start with H=9: arrive at turn 21.\n\nBut need to check if during turns 13 to 20, when on y=1 to 8, no collision.\n\ny from 1 to 8 at turns when position is that y.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt turn T, y_T is set, collision if y_T in 1-8 and 0 in car span on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nFor the direct path: assume all actions U, so y_T = T - 12 for T from 13 to 20? At turn 12, y=0.\n\nAfter a12=U, y13=1\n\na13=U, y14=2\n\n...\n\na19=U, y20=8\n\na20=U, y21=9\n\nSo we are on freeways from turn 13 (y=1) to turn 20 (y=8).\n\nNow, for each freeway and each turn, check if at that turn, 0 is covered by a car on that freeway.\n\nFirst, for turn T, dt = T - 12.\n\nFor freeway y, we need to check for y from 1 to 8 at turns T from 13 to 20.\n\nBut for each turn, we are on a specific y, so we check only that freeway at that turn.\n\nFor example, at turn 13, y=1, so check freeway 1 at turn 13.\n\nAt turn 14, y=2, check freeway 2 at turn 14, and so on.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway the times when 0 is in the car span.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car: at t1=12, span [tau, h] = [-59, -48], d=right, s=3.\n\nSpan at time T: [tau + s*(T-12), h + s*(T-12)] = [-59 + 3*(T-12), -48 + 3*(T-12)]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 3*(T-12) <= 0 <= -48 + 3*(T-12)\n\nSo solve:\n\n-59 + 3(dt) <= 0 <= -48 + 3(dt)  where dt = T-12\n\nLeft: -59 + 3dt <= 0 => 3dt <= 59 => dt <= 59/3 = 19.666, so dt <= 19 since integer\n\nRight: 0 <= -48 + 3dt => 3dt >= 48 => dt >= 16\n\nSo for dt from 16 to 19 inclusive, 0 in span.\n\nThus at turns T=12+dt, T=28 to 31? dt=16 to 19, T=28,29,30,31.\n\nBut we are considering turns 13 to 20 for the direct path, which is dt=1 to 8, all less than 16, so for dt=1 to 8, 0 not in span for freeway 1. Since min dt for collision is 16.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: one car (48,37,right,12), so at t1, span [37,48]\n\nSpan at T: [37 + 12*(T-12), 48 + 12*(T-12)]\n\n0 in span if 37 + 12dt <= 0 <= 48 + 12dt\n\nBut 37 + 12dt >0 for dt>=0, since 37>0, so 0 <= ... is false, 0 is less than left end, so never in span. Similarly, all positive, so no collision possible on freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, (48,37,right,12), same thing, span [37+12dt, 48+12dt] all positive, 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 4: same.\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nAll these have head and tail positive, moving right, so span always positive, never cover 0.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) same as above, span [37+12dt,48+12dt], never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (0, -11, right, 12), head=0, tail=-11, direction right.\n\nAt t1=12, span [tau, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nSince right-moving, span [tau, h] = [-11, 0] at t1.\n\nThen at time T, span [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt] = [-11 + 12dt, 0 + 12dt] = [-11 + 12dt, 12dt]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 12dt <= 0 <= 12dt\n\nLeft: -11 + 12dt <= 0 => 12dt <= 11 => dt <= 11/12 <1, so dt <=0? Since dt integer, dt <=0\n\nRight: 0 <= 12dt, so dt >=0\n\nThus for dt=0, 0 in span? dt=0, T=12, span [-11,0], so 0 is included? The inequality: -11 +0 <=0 <=0, -11<=0<=0, 0<=0 true, so yes, at T=12, 0 is in span.\n\nBut at turn T=12, the player is at y=0, which is not a freeway, so no collision. Collision only if on freeway y=1-8.\n\nFor freeway 6, at T=12, if player were on y=6, collision, but player at y=0.\n\nFor the car, at dt=0, 0 in span only if we consider the interval closed.\n\nIn the condition, 0 ∈ span, and span is [a,b], inclusive.\n\nAt dt=0, span [-11,0], 0 is included.\n\nBut for dt>0, 0 <= 12dt is true for dt>=1, but -11+12dt <=0 only for dt<=11/12<1, so only dt=0 has 0 in span.\n\nFor dt>=1, -11+12dt >= -11+12=1>0, so left end >0, 0 not <= left end, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, right end 12dt >=12>0.\n\nSo for freeway 6, second car, 0 in span only at T=12.\n\nFor T>12, no.\n\nFirst car never covers 0.\n\nSo on freeway 6, collision only at T=12, but since player not on freeway at T=12, safe for later turns.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48, -59, right, 6) head=-48? tail=-59, d=right, s=6.\n\nAt t1, span [tau, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt T, span [-59 + 6dt, -48 + 6dt]\n\n0 in span if -59 +6dt <=0 <= -48 +6dt\n\nLeft: -59+6dt <=0 => 6dt <=59 => dt <= 59/6 ≈9.833, dt<=9\n\nRight: 0 <= -48 +6dt => 6dt >=48 => dt>=8\n\nSo for dt from 8 to 9 inclusive.\n\nT=12+dt=20 or 21.\n\ndt=8, T=20; dt=9, T=21.\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: (0, -11, right, 6) head=0, tail=-11, s=6.\n\nAt t1, span [-11, 0]\n\nAt T, span [-11 +6dt, 0 +6dt] = [-11+6dt, 6dt]\n\n0 in span if -11+6dt <=0 <=6dt\n\nLeft: -11+6dt <=0 => 6dt <=11 => dt <=11/6≈1.833, dt<=1\n\nRight: 0 <=6dt => dt>=0\n\nSo for dt=0 and dt=1.\n\ndt=0: T=12, span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\ndt=1: T=13, span [-11+6, 6] = [-5,6], 0 in since -5<=0<=6.\n\ndt=2: span [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for second car, 0 in span at dt=0,1, T=12,13.\n\nNow freeway 8: similar to 7.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,6), same as above, 0 in span at dt=8,9, T=20,21.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6), same, 0 in span at dt=0,1, T=12,13.\n\nNow back to direct path: all U, from turn 13 to 20 on y=1 to 8.\n\nAt turn 13: y=1, freeway 1. We checked freeway 1, no collision for dt=1 to 8, safe.\n\nAt turn 14: y=2, freeway 2. Freeway 2 has cars that never cover 0, safe.\n\nTurn 15: y=3, freeway 3, same, safe.\n\nTurn 16: y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nTurn 17: y=5, freeway 5, safe.\n\nTurn 18: y=6, freeway 6. At freeway 6, we have cars: first car never covers 0, second car covers 0 only at T=12, not at T=18, so safe.\n\nTurn 19: y=7, freeway 7. Now at T=19, dt=19-12=7.\n\nFor freeway 7, first car: 0 in span at dt=8,9, dt=7 not, since dt=7, span [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: 0 in only at dt=0,1, dt=7 not, span [-11+42,42] = [31,42], 0 not in. So safe.\n\nTurn 20: y=8, freeway 8. T=20, dt=8.\n\nFreeway 8: first car: at dt=8, span [-59 +48, -48+48] = [-11,0], so -11<=0<=0, 0 included, so 0 in span.\n\nSecond car: at dt=8, span [-11+48,48] = [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nBut first car has 0 in span at dt=8, T=20.\n\nSo at turn 20, if player is on y=8, collision with first car on freeway 8.\n\nIn direct path, at turn 20, y=8, so collision.\n\nTherefore, direct path has collision at turn 20.\n\nSo need to avoid that.\n\nPossible to wait or move differently.\n\nMinimal H might be more than 9.\n\nH=9 would be arriving at turn 21, but with actions, after 9 actions, at turn 21, y=9.\n\nIn the path, we have to be at y=8 at some point before.\n\nBut at turn 20, if we are at y=8, collision on freeway 8.\n\nWe could be at y=8 at a different time.\n\nOr move slower or faster.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, we need to reach it.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., collision if on that freeway at that turn.\n\nDefine unsafe times for each y from 1 to 8.\n\nFreeway 1: y=1\n\nCars: only one, 0 in span at dt=16 to 19, T=28 to 31.\n\nSo unsafe at T=28,29,30,31.\n\nFor earlier, safe.\n\nFreeway 2: y=2\n\nCars: only one, span always positive, never unsafe. Always safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3: y=3, always safe.\n\nFreeway 4: y=4, always safe.\n\nFreeway 5: y=5, always safe.\n\nFreeway 6: y=6\n\nCars: first (48,37,right,12) never unsafe.\n\nSecond (0,-11,right,12): 0 in span only at T=12 (dt=0)\n\nUnsafe only at T=12.\n\nBut T=12 is current turn, player not on it, so for T>12, safe. Always safe except T=12.\n\nFreeway 7: y=7\n\nCars: first (-48,-59,right,6): unsafe at dt=8,9 T=20,21\n\nSecond (0,-11,right,6): unsafe at dt=0,1 T=12,13\n\nSo unsafe when either car covers 0.\n\nThus unsafe at T=12,13 (from second car), and T=20,21 (from first car).\n\nFreeway 8: y=8\n\nSimilarly, first car (-48,-59,right,6): unsafe dt=8,9 T=20,21\n\nSecond car (0,-11,right,6): unsafe dt=0,1 T=12,13\n\nSo unsafe at T=12,13,20,21.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=0 at turn 12 to y=9 at some turn T=12+H.\n\nDuring the path, for each turn T from 13 to 12+H-1, if y_T between 1-8, it must be safe at that T.\n\nSince we start at turn 12, y=0, no issue.\n\nFirst action at turn 12, then position at turn 13.\n\nWe need to choose actions such that when on a freeway, it is safe.\n\nTo minimize H, we should go up as fast as possible, but avoid unsafe times.\n\nThe unsafe freeways are mainly y=7 and y=8 at times around 20-21 and 12-13.\n\ny=1 unsafe only later at 28-31, not relevant for min H.\n\ny=2,3,4,5 always safe.\n\ny=6 always safe except T=12, but T=12 not used.\n\ny=7 unsafe at T=12,13,20,21\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=12,13,20,21\n\nWe need to be on y=7 and y=8 at safe times.\n\nSince we go from bottom to top, we will hit y=7 before y=8.\n\nThe critical part is around T=20 for y=8.\n\nIn direct path, at T=20 y=8 unsafe.\n\nWe could delay or advance being at y=8.\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=8 before T=20 or after T=21.\n\nT=21 is unsafe for y=8 as well? For freeway 8, unsafe at T=20 and 21.\n\nT=20 and 21 both unsafe.\n\nSimilarly for y=7, unsafe at 20,21? y=7 unsafe at T=12,13,20,21.\n\nT=20 and 21 unsafe for both y=7 and y=8.\n\nWhat about other times?\n\nFor y=7, when is it safe?\n\nUnsafe at T=12,13,20,21. So safe at other times, e.g., T=14 to 19, or T=22+, etc.\n\nSimilarly for y=8, unsafe at T=12,13,20,21, so safe at T=14 to 19, T=22+, etc.\n\nNow, since we start at T=12, y=0.\n\nWe can move up or down or stay.\n\nTo minimize time, we should go up, but might need to wait at some safe y.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nThe path must include y=7 and y=8 at some point.\n\nMinimal steps: if no cars, H=9, arrive at T=21.\n\nBut at T=20, y=8 unsafe, and T=21 y=8 also unsafe, but at T=21 if we are at y=9, no problem.\n\nIn the sequence, to reach y=9, we need to be at y=8 at some turn before.\n\nFor example, if we are at y=8 at turn T, then at turn T+1 we can go to y=9.\n\nBut at turn T, if y=8, it must be safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=7.\n\nSince y=8 is unsafe at T=20 and 21, we need to be at y=8 at a different time.\n\nFor example, earlier or later.\n\nSimilarly for y=7.\n\nNow, the safe times for y=7 and y=8 are T=14 to 19 or T=22+.\n\nT=14 to 19 is from dt=2 to 7.\n\nT=12+H is the arrival time.\n\nWe start at T=12.\n\nIf we can be at y=8 by T=19, for example.\n\nT=19 is safe for y=8? y=8 unsafe at T=12,13,20,21. T=19 is between 14-19, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=18,17,etc safe.\n\nT=20 and 21 unsafe.\n\nSo if we can be at y=8 at T=19, then at T=20, go to y=9, arrive at T=20.\n\nLet's see the timeline.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at turn 12+H.\n\nIf we are at y=8 at turn T, then we can go U to y=9 at turn T+1.\n\nSo arrival at T+1.\n\nTo have y=8 at T, with T safe.\n\nSafe T for y=8: T=14,15,16,17,18,19,22,... \n\nSimilarly for y=7.\n\nSince we start from y=0, we need to go through lower y first.\n\ny=2,3,4,5,6 are always safe or safe in the range we care.\n\ny=6 always safe except T=12, not issue.\n\nSo we can move quickly through y=1 to y=6.\n\ny=1 safe except later, not issue.\n\nNow, let's find the earliest we can be at y=8 safely.\n\nStart at T=12, y=0.\n\nAfter first action, T=13, y=?\n\nIf we go U at T=12, y=1 at T=13.\n\ny=1 at T=13: freeway 1, which is safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nThen at T=13, we can go U to y=2 at T=14, and so on.\n\nThe slowest part is y=7 and y=8.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 have unsafe times, we need to be on them at safe times.\n\nFor example, to be at y=8 at T=19.\n\nThen we need to be at y=7 at some turn before.\n\ny=7 at T, then at T+1 go to y=8, so if y=8 at T+1.\n\nIf we want y=8 at T=19, then we need to be at y=7 at T=18 or earlier, and go U at T=18 to y=8 at T=19.\n\ny=7 at T=18 must be safe.\n\nT=18, y=7: freeway 7 at T=18, dt=6.\n\nEarlier, freeway 7 unsafe at T=12,13,20,21. T=18 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can go directly.\n\nLet's plan the path to be at y=8 at T=19.\n\nStart: T=12, y=0, action a12.\n\na12: U, then T=13, y=1 (safe)\n\na13: U, T=14, y=2 (safe)\n\na14: U, T=15, y=3 (safe)\n\na15: U, T=16, y=4 (safe)\n\na16: U, T=17, y=5 (safe)\n\na17: U, T=18, y=6 (safe, since y=6 always safe for T>12)\n\na18: U, T=19, y=7\n\nNow T=19, y=7. Is it safe? Freeway 7 at T=19, dt=7.\n\nUnsafe at T=12,13,20,21. T=19 not, so safe.\n\nThen a19: U, T=20, y=8\n\nT=20, y=8. But freeway 8 at T=20 is unsafe, as we saw earlier, 0 in span.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt T=20, y=8, collision.\n\nIf we go U at T=19 to y=8 at T=20, but T=20 unsafe.\n\nWe need to be at y=8 earlier or later.\n\nEarlier: at T=19, but to be at y=8 at T=19, we need to be at y=7 earlier.\n\nFor example, be at y=7 at T=18, then U to y=8 at T=19.\n\nT=19 y=8? If at T=18, y=7, action U, then at T=19, y=8.\n\ny=8 at T=19.\n\nT=19, dt=7 for freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at T=12,13,20,21.\n\nT=19 not in, so safe.\n\nThen at T=19, y=8 safe, then action U at T=19, to y=9 at T=20.\n\nNow, let's write the sequence.\n\nStart: T=12, y=0\n\na12: U, T=13, y=1 (safe)\n\na13: U, T=14, y=2 (safe)\n\na14: U, T=15, y=3 (safe)\n\na15: U, T=16, y=4 (safe)\n\na16: U, T=17, y=5 (safe)\n\na17: U, T=18, y=6 (safe)\n\na18: U, T=19, y=7 (safe, as above)\n\nAt T=18, y=6, action U to y=7 at T=19.\n\nT=19, y=7: freeway 7 at T=19, dt=7, not unsafe time, safe.\n\nThen a19: U, to y=8 at T=20.\n\nBut T=20, y=8: unsafe, as freeway 8 at dt=8, 0 in span.\n\nConflict.\n\nTo have y=8 at T=19, we need to be at y=7 at T=18.\n\nThen at T=18, y=7? If at T=17, y=6, action U at T=17 to y=7 at T=18.\n\nThen at T=18, y=7.\n\nThen action at T=18: U to y=8 at T=19.\n\nThen at T=19, y=8.\n\nNow, T=19, y=8: dt=7, T=19, freeway 8.\n\nUnsafe times: T=12,13,20,21. T=19 not, so safe.\n\nThen at T=19, we can go U to y=9 at T=20.\n\nAt T=20, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, check the positions:\n\nT=12: y=0\n\na12: U → T=13: y=1\n\na13: U → T=14: y=2\n\na14: U → T=15: y=3\n\na15: U → T=16: y=4\n\na16: U → T=17: y=5\n\na17: U → T=18: y=6\n\na18: U → T=19: y=7? No:\n\nAt T=17: y=5? Sequence:\n\nAfter a16 at T=16: y=4? Let's list turns and positions.\n\nTurn T | position y_T | action a_T | next y\n\nStart: T=12, y=0\n\nAction a12: say U, then y_{13} = 0 +1 =1\n\nT=13: y=1\n\nAction a13: U, y14=2\n\nT=14: y=2\n\na14: U, y15=3\n\nT=15: y=3\n\na15: U, y16=4\n\nT=16: y=4\n\na16: U, y17=5\n\nT=17: y=5\n\na17: U, y18=6\n\nT=18: y=6\n\na18: U, y19=7\n\nT=19: y=7\n\na19: U, y20=8? But we want to be at y=8 at T=19? No.\n\nIn the plan: to have y=8 at T=19.\n\nBut in the sequence above, at T=19, y=7 after a19? Confusion.\n\nPosition at turn T is after previous action.\n\nAt turn T, y_T is fixed before action a_T.\n\nThen after a_T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nFor y=8 at turn T, that means at that turn, position is y=8.\n\nFor example, to be at y=8 at turn 19: that means at turn 19, y=8.\n\nWhich means that at turn 18, after action a18, y19=8.\n\nSo at turn 18, we were at some y, say y18, then action a18, and y19=8.\n\nSimilarly, to have y19=8, we need y18=7 or 8 or 9, but since moving, likely y18=7, a18=U.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn our case, to be at y=8 at T=19.\n\nSo at turn 19, y=8.\n\nThus, at turn 18, position y18, then action a18 such that y19=8.\n\nIf y18=7, a18=U.\n\ny18=8, a18=S.\n\ny18=9, a18=D, but not efficient.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, for y=8 to be safe at T=19.\n\nT=19, dt=7, freeway 8 safe, as not unsafe time.\n\nThen at T=19, y=8, we can do a19=U to go to y=9 at T=20.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=7 by turn 18 or something.\n\nLet's find the actions.\n\nStart: T=12, y=0\n\nWe want to reach y=8 by turn 19.\n\nSince y increases slowly, we need to move up.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=7, that takes at least 7 moves.\n\nFor example:\n\na12: U → T=13, y=1\n\na13: U → T=14, y=2\n\na14: U → T=15, y=3\n\na15: U → T=16, y=4\n\na16: U → T=17, y=5\n\na17: U → T=18, y=6\n\na18: U → T=19, y=7? No, we want y=8 at T=19.\n\nWith a18: U, from y=7 to y=8, so if at T=18, y=7, then a18=U, y19=8.\n\nSo we need to be at y=7 at T=18.\n\nThen at T=18, y=7 must be safe.\n\nT=18, dt=6, freeway 7.\n\nUnsafe at T=12,13,20,21. T=18 not, so safe.\n\nThen at T=18, y=7, safe.\n\na18=U → T=19, y=8, safe (as above)\n\nThen a19=U → T=20, y=9, done.\n\nNow, how to reach y=7 at T=18.\n\nFrom start, to y=7, need 7 moves up.\n\nStart at T=12, y=0\n\nAfter 1st action: a12=U → T=13, y=1\n\n2nd: a13=U → T=14, y=2\n\n3rd: a14=U → T=15, y=3\n\n4th: a15=U → T=16, y=4\n\n5th: a16=U → T=17, y=5\n\n6th: a17=U → T=18, y=6\n\nAfter a17, at T=18, y=6.\n\nBut we need y=7 at T=18.\n\nAt T=18, position y=6.\n\nThen to have y=7 at T=18? No, position at T=18 is after a17, which is y=6 if previous actions.\n\nTo be at y=7 at turn 18, that means at turn 18, y=7.\n\nSo y_{18} =7.\n\nWhich means that at turn 17, after action a17, y18=7.\n\nSo at turn 17, we were at y17, then a17 such that y18=7.\n\nIf y17=6, a17=U; y17=7, a17=S; etc.\n\nSimilarly, to have y18=7, we need to reach y=6 or 7 by turn 17.\n\nLet's list the turn and desired position.\n\nWe want y_{18} =7, so that after a18=U, y_{19}=8.\n\nThen y_{19}=8, then a19=U, y_{20}=9.\n\nArrival at T=20.\n\nH=8 actions? From t1 to t1+H-1, 8 actions? Actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1.\n\nSet t1=12.\n\nActions: a12 to a19, that's 8 actions (t=0 to 7? Let's index.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1+H, position y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, with H=8 actions: a12 to a19.\n\nAfter a19, at turn 20, y=9.\n\nNow, during turns 13 to 19, positions y=1 to 8? Let's see.\n\nStart: T=12, y=0\n\na12: action, say U, then y13=1\n\nT=13: y=1\n\na13: U, y14=2\n\n...\n\nup to a17: U, y18=6? Sequence of actions:\n\nAfter a12: T=13, y=1\n\nAfter a13: T=14, y=2\n\nAfter a14: T=15, y=3\n\nAfter a15: T=16, y=4\n\nAfter a16: T=17, y=5\n\nAfter a17: T=18, y=6\n\nAfter a18: T=19, y=7\n\nAfter a19: T=20, y=8? Not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need 9 actions? From y=0 to y=9, 9 steps.\n\nNumber of actions to increase y by 9, so at least 9 actions if all U.\n\nWith H actions, we can reach y=9 only if sum of delta y =9.\n\nSince each action can increase y by at most 1, min H=9.\n\nWith H=9 actions, arrive at turn 21.\n\nIn the earlier plan, we need to be at y=8 at a safe time before turn 21.\n\nTurn 21 is unsafe for y=8.\n\nIn the direct all U, we arrive at turn 21 y=9, but during the path, at turn 20 y=8 collision.\n\nBut if we can avoid being at y=8 at turn 20.\n\nFor example, be at y=8 earlier.\n\nEarliest possible: start from y=0, after 8 actions, we can be at y=8 at turn 20.\n\nT=12, y=0\n\nAfter 8 actions U: at turn 20, y=8\n\nThen after 9th action U, turn 21, y=9.\n\nBut at turn 20, y=8, which is unsafe.\n\nIf we are at y=8 at turn 19, then we need to have reached faster.\n\nTo be at y=8 at turn 19, that requires only 7 actions? From y=0 to y=8, 8 steps? y=0 to y=1: one action, to y=2: two, ..., to y=8: 8 actions.\n\nAt turn t, after k actions, position at turn t1+k.\n\nAt turn 12, after 0 actions, y=0.\n\nAfter 1 action (a12), turn 13, y=1\n\nAfter 2 actions, turn 14, y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter 8 actions, turn 20, y=8\n\nAfter 9 actions, turn 21, y=9\n\nTo be at y=8 at turn 19, that would be after 7 actions? After k actions, at turn 12+k.\n\nSet after k actions, position at turn 12+k.\n\nTo have position y at turn T, T=12+k, so k=T-12.\n\nFor y=8 at turn T, we need that after k actions, y=8, with k=T-12.\n\nSince we start from y=0, to reach y=8, min k=8, so T=20.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y=9, min T=21 with k=9 actions.\n\nSo we must be at y=8 at turn 20 for the fastest path.\n\nBut at turn 20, y=8 is unsafe.\n\nIf we are at y=8 at turn 20, collision.\n\nWe need to be at y=8 at a different time, which requires more actions, so H>9.\n\nFor example, if we stay at some point or move down.\n\nTo be at y=8 at turn 19, that requires y=8 at T=19, which means after 7 actions? After k actions, at turn 12+k.\n\nIf at turn 19, y=8, then 12+k=19, k=7.\n\nAfter 7 actions, y=8.\n\nBut from y=0, with 7 actions, max y=7 if all U, cannot be y=8 with 7 actions. Since each U increases by 1, min actions to y=8 is 8, at turn 20.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be at y=8 before turn 20.\n\nAfter turn 20, we can be at y=8 later.\n\nFor example, at turn 22, y=8.\n\nThen go to y=9 at turn 23.\n\nBut that takes more time, H larger.\n\nBut we can be at y=8 at turn 19 if we start from higher, but we start from y=0.\n\nUnless we move faster, but we can only move +1 per action.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=8 before turn 20.\n\nSimilarly, after turn 20, we can be at y=8 at turn 22, for example.\n\nBut let's see if we can avoid being at y=8 at turn 20.\n\nIn the path to y=9, we must pass through y=8 at some turn.\n\nLet that turn be T.\n\nThen at turn T, y=8 must be safe.\n\nThen at turn T, we go U to y=9 at turn T+1.\n\nSafe times for y=8: T=14,15,16,17,18,19,22,23,...\n\nT=20 and 21 unsafe.\n\nSo we can choose T=19 or T=22, etc.\n\nT=19: to be at y=8 at T=19, requires after 7 actions y=8, impossible.\n\nAfter 7 actions, at turn 19, y <=7.\n\nMax y=7 at turn 19.\n\nAt turn 19, after 7 actions, y=7 if all U.\n\nThen at turn 19, y=7, we can go U to y=8 at turn 20, but turn 20 y=8 unsafe.\n\nOr stay or down, but not efficient.\n\nIf at turn 19, y=7, and we go U to y=8 at turn 20, collision.\n\nIf we stay at y=7 at turn 19, then at turn 20, we are still at y=7 if a19=S.\n\nThen at turn 20, y=7.\n\nBut freeway 7 at T=20 is unsafe, because y=7 unsafe at T=20.\n\nT=20, dt=8, freeway 7: first car unsafe at dt=8,9 T=20,21.\n\nSo at T=20, y=7 collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we are on y=7 at T=20, collision.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=7 or y=8 at T=20 or 21.\n\nFor T=19, y=7 is safe, as we saw.\n\nBut from there, if we go U at T=19 to y=8 at T=20, collision.\n\nIf we stay at T=19, y=7, then at T=20, y=7, but T=20 y=7 unsafe.\n\nSo we must leave y=7 before T=20.\n\nSimilarly for other points.\n\nPossible to go to y=8 at T=19, but impossible as established.\n\nSo we must use a later time.\n\nFor example, be at y=8 at T=22.\n\nThen go to y=9 at T=23.\n\nH=11 actions? Arrive at turn 23.\n\nBut we can do with less by waiting less.\n\nSince y=6 is always safe, we can stay at y=6 for some turns.\n\ny=6 safe at all times except T=12, not issue.\n\nSimilarly, lower y safe.\n\nSo one way: go quickly to y=6, then wait until it is safe to go to y=7 and y=8.\n\nFirst, go to y=6 as fast as possible.\n\nStart: T=12, y=0\n\na12: U → T=13, y=1\n\na13: U → T=14, y=2\n\na14: U → T=15, y=3\n\na15: U → T=16, y=4\n\na16: U → T=17, y=5\n\na17: U → T=18, y=6\n\nNow at T=18, y=6.\n\nWe can stay at y=6 for some turns.\n\ny=6 safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=7 at a time when it is safe, and similarly for y=8.\n\ny=7 unsafe at T=12,13,20,21.\n\nSo safe at T=14 to 19, T=22+, etc.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nWe want to minimize time, so go to y=7 as soon as possible, but at safe time.\n\nAt T=18, we are at y=6.\n\nWe can go U at T=18 to y=7 at T=19.\n\nT=19, y=7 safe.\n\nThen at T=19, y=7, we want to go to y=8.\n\nBut y=8 unsafe at T=20,21, so we cannot go immediately.\n\nIf we go U at T=19 to y=8 at T=20, collision.\n\nIf we stay at y=7 at T=19, then at T=20, y=7, but T=20 y=7 unsafe, collision.\n\nSo we must not be on y=7 at T=20.\n\nTherefore, at T=19, we should not stay; we could go down, but that might not help.\n\nFor example, at T=19, y=7, go D to y=6 at T=20.\n\nThen at T=20, y=6, safe.\n\nBut then we are back to y=6, and we need to go up later.\n\nThen we can go to y=7 at T=22, for example.\n\nT=22, dt=10, freeway 7: first car span [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in; second car span [-11+60,60]=[49,60], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at T=22: freeway 8, first car span [-59+60, -48+60]=[1,12], 0 not in; second car [49,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nFrom above:\n\nAt T=18, y=6\n\na18: U → T=19, y=7 (safe)\n\nNow at T=19, y=7, we cannot stay or go up to y=8 because next turn collision.\n\nSo go down: a19: D → T=20, y=6 (since from y=7, D, y=6)\n\nAt T=20, y=6, safe.\n\nThen we need to go to y=7 later, at safe time.\n\nNext safe time for y=7 is T=22, since T=20,21 unsafe, T=22 safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nAt T=20, y=6\n\nWe can stay or move.\n\nTo go to y=7 at T=22.\n\nFirst, at T=20, y=6, action a20.\n\nIf we stay: a20: S → T=21, y=6\n\nThen at T=21, y=6, safe.\n\nThen a21: U → T=22, y=7\n\nAt T=22, y=7, safe.\n\nThen a22: U → T=23, y=8\n\nAt T=23, y=8, safe (dt=11, freeway 8 span [-59+66, -48+66]=[7,18], 0 not in; second car [ -11+66,66]=[55,66],0 not in)\n\nThen a23: U → T=24, y=9\n\nArrive at T=24.\n\nH=12 actions from t1=12: a12 to a23, 12 actions, arrive at turn 24.\n\nBut we can reduce the waiting.\n\nAt T=19, y=7, instead of going down, we can go down earlier or something.\n\nSince y=5,4,etc safe, we can stay at lower y.\n\nBut let's see if we can go to y=7 earlier.\n\nAt T=18, y=6, we can go to y=7 at T=19 as above.\n\nBut T=19 y=7 is safe, but we cannot proceed.\n\nWe could go to y=7 at T=14, for example.\n\nStart faster.\n\nAt T=12, y=0, a12:U → T=13, y=1\n\na13:U → T=14, y=2\n\nBut at T=14, y=2, but we can go directly to y=6 faster? No, each step.\n\nTo reach y=7 at T=14: after 2 actions, at turn 14, y=2, not 7.\n\nMin turn for y=7 is T=19 with 7 actions.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 12+k, y <= k.\n\nTo have y=7 at turn T, T=12+k, y=7, so k>=7, T>=19.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at T>=20.\n\nSo we must be at y=7 at some T>=19, and y=8 at some T>=20.\n\nFor y=7, safe at T=14,15,16,17,18,19,22,... but T=14 to 18 require y=7 at earlier turn, impossible, so only possible at T=19,22,23,...\n\nSimilarly for y=8, only at T=20,22,23,... but T=20 unsafe, so at T=22,23,...\n\nNow for y=7 at T=19: safe, as we have.\n\nThen from there, we need to go to y=8 at a safe time, which is not T=20 or 21, so T=22.\n\nBut at T=19, y=7, we cannot stay because at T=20, if still at y=7, collision.\n\nSo we must move away from y=7 before T=20.\n\nSimilarly, we can move down to y=6.\n\nThen at y=6, we can wait until T=21 or later, then go to y=7 at T=22.\n\nSequence:\n\nReach y=7 at T=19:\n\nAs before:\n\na12:U → T=13 y=1\n\na13:U → T=14 y=2\n\na14:U → T=15 y=3\n\na15:U → T=16 y=4\n\na16:U → T=17 y=5\n\na17:U → T=18 y=6\n\na18:U → T=19 y=7  (safe)\n\nNow at T=19, y=7, action a19: D → T=20 y=6  (go down to y=6)\n\nAt T=20, y=6, safe\n\nNow at T=20, y=6, action a20: S or U, but we need to go to y=7 at T=22.\n\nAt T=20, y=6, we can stay: a20: S → T=21 y=6\n\nAt T=21, y=6, safe\n\nThen a21: U → T=22 y=7\n\nAt T=22, y=7, safe\n\nThen a22: U → T=23 y=8\n\nAt T=23, y=8, safe\n\nThen a23: U → T=24 y=9\n\nArrive at T=24, with 12 actions.\n\nBut we can save one turn.\n\nAt T=20, y=6, instead of staying, we can go down to y=5 or something, but that might not help.\n\nSince we need to go to y=7 at T=22, and at T=20 we are at y=6, we can go up to y=7 at T=21, but T=21 y=7 is unsafe.\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe at T=21.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nMust stay at y=6 or lower until T=22.\n\nAt T=20, y=6, we can go down to y=5 at T=21, for example, but y=5 is always safe, but then we need to come back up, which takes more time.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo better to stay at y=6.\n\nNow, to save time, perhaps we can reach y=6 earlier.\n\nWith all U, we reach y=6 at T=18.\n\nCan we reach earlier? No, min T=18 for y=6.\n\nT=12 y=0, after 6 actions, T=18 y=6.\n\nCannot earlier.\n\nAnother idea: since y=8 can be safe at T=19, but impossible to be there.\n\nUnless we start from higher, but no.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=9 without being at y=8 at critical time, but we have to pass through y=8.\n\nOr by moving down and up, but that increases H.\n\nMinimal H is 9 if possible, but not, so 10 or more.\n\nWith H=10 actions, arrive at turn 22.\n\ny_{22} =9.\n\nThen we need to be at y=8 at some turn before, say at turn 21 or 20, but turn 20 and 21 unsafe for y=8.\n\nTurn 21 y=8 unsafe.\n\nWith H=10, actions from a12 to a21, arrive at turn 22 y=9.\n\nDuring the path, we are at y=1 to 8 at turns 13 to 21.\n\nWe need to be at y=8 at turn 21 for example, but turn 21 y=8 unsafe.\n\nIf we are at y=8 at turn 20, turn 20 unsafe.\n\nOr at turn 19, impossible.\n\nSo with H=10, we must be at y=8 at turn 20 or 21, both unsafe.\n\nTurn 20: if we are at y=8 at turn 20, that means after 8 actions, at turn 20 y=8.\n\nThen a20: U to y=9 at turn 21.\n\nBut at turn 20, y=8 collision.\n\nIf at turn 20, we are at y=7, then a20: U to y=8 at turn 21, but turn 21 y=8 collision.\n\nIf at turn 20, we are at y=8, collision.\n\nSo with H=10, we cannot avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at turn 20 or 21.\n\nSpecifically, to reach y=9 at turn 22, we must have been at y=8 at turn 21 or 22.\n\nAt turn 21, position y21, then a21, y22=9.\n\nSo if y21=8, a21=U.\n\nOr y21=9, a21=S or D, but not efficient.\n\nMin, y21=8.\n\nThen at turn 21, y=8, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf y21=9, then we arrived earlier, but with H=10, if y21=9, that means after 9 actions, at turn 21 y=9, but H=10 actions would be for later arrival.\n\nWith H actions, arrive at turn 12+H.\n\nFor arrival at turn 12+H, we need y_{12+H} =9.\n\nAt turn 12+H-1, we must be at y=8 or 9.\n\nIf at y=8, then a_{12+H-1} = U to go to 9.\n\nIf at y=9, stay or down, but not minimal.\n\nSo typically at turn 12+H-1, y=8, then U to 9 at turn 12+H.\n\nSo at turn 12+H-1, we are at y=8.\n\nThis must be safe.\n\nFor H=9, arrive turn 21, at turn 20, y=8, unsafe.\n\nFor H=10, arrive turn 22, at turn 21, y=8, but turn 21 y=8 unsafe.\n\nFor H=11, arrive turn 23, at turn 22, y=8, which is safe, as above.\n\nSimilarly, for H=12, arrive turn 24, at turn 23, y=8 safe.\n\nSo minimal H is 11, arrive at turn 23.\n\nWith H=11 actions: a12 to a22, arrive at turn 23 y=9.\n\nAt turn 22, y=8, which is safe.\n\nHow to reach y=8 at turn 22.\n\nFrom start, we need to take 10 actions to reach y=8 at turn 22? After k actions, at turn 12+k.\n\nAt turn 22, position y22, after 10 actions? Turn 12+10=22, so after 10 actions, at turn 22.\n\nTo have y22=8, with 10 actions, we can have some S or D, but to minimize time, we should go up as much as possible.\n\nSince we have extra actions, we can wait at some safe y.\n\nFor example, go to y=6 quickly, then wait, then go to y=7 and y=8 at safe times.\n\nGo to y=6 at T=18 as before.\n\nThen from T=18 to T=22, we have 4 turns to go from y=6 to y=8, which takes 2 moves, so we can wait 2 turns at y=6 or move down and up.\n\nBut to save time, better to go directly when possible.\n\nAt T=18, y=6\n\nWe need to be at y=7 at a safe time, e.g., T=22.\n\nT=22 y=7 safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at T=22 not possible simultaneously.\n\nFrom y=6 at T=18, we can go to y=7 at T=19.\n\nT=19 y=7 safe.\n\nBut then from there, we need to go to y=8 at T=22.\n\nBut at T=19 y=7, we cannot stay because T=20 y=7 unsafe.\n\nSo go down to y=6 at T=20.\n\nThen at T=20 y=6, stay or move.\n\nThen go to y=7 at T=22.\n\nSequence:\n\nT=18, y=6\n\na18: U → T=19 y=7 (safe)\n\na19: D → T=20 y=6 (safe)\n\nT=20, y=6\n\nNow, we can stay: a20: S → T=21 y=6\n\na21: U → T=22 y=7\n\nAt T=22 y=7, safe\n\nThen a22: U → T=23 y=8? But we need to be at y=8 at turn 22 for the arrival.\n\nFor H=11, arrive at turn 23, so at turn 22, y=8, then a22: U to y=9 at turn 23.\n\nSo we need y=8 at turn 22.\n\nIn the above, at T=22, y=7, not 8.\n\nSo we need to reach y=8 at turn 22.\n\nFrom y=6 at T=18, to y=8 at T=22, with 4 actions.\n\nPossible actions: for example, U,U at some points.\n\nBut we need to avoid unsafe times.\n\nSpecifically, at turn 22, y=8.\n\nSo after action at turn 21, y22=8.\n\nTurn 21 position y21, then a21, y22=8.\n\ny21 must be 7 or 8.\n\nIf y21=7, a21=U.\n\nIf y21=8, a21=S.\n\nNow, at turn 21, y21 must be safe.\n\ny21 between 1-8, so must not be on unsafe freeway at unsafe time.\n\nFor example, if y21=7, then freeway 7 at T=21 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if y21=8, freeway 8 at T=21 unsafe.\n\nT=21 is unsafe for both y=7 and y=8.\n\nTherefore, at turn 21, we cannot be on y=7 or y=8; must be on y<=6 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 not yet.\n\nSo at turn 21, we must be on y<=6.\n\nThen to have y22=8, from y<=6 at T=21, with one action, we can reach at most y=7, not y=8.\n\nContradiction.\n\ny21 <=6, a21: U to y=7 at T=22, or S to y=6, D to y=5, cannot reach y=8.\n\nSo impossible to have y22=8 from y21<=6.\n\nTherefore, for arrival at turn 23, we need y22=8, which requires that at turn 21, y21=7 or 8, but both unsafe at T=21.\n\nSo we cannot have y22=8; we must have a different approach.\n\nFor arrival at turn 23, y23=9.\n\nThen at turn 22, y22 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y22=8, then a22: U to y9 at 23.\n\nIf y22=9, then already there, but with H=11, if y22=9, that would be after 10 actions, but we are taking 11 actions for arrival at 23.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nWith H actions, actions from a12 to a_{12+H-1}, after these H actions, at turn 12+H, position y_{12+H} =9.\n\nAt turn 12+H-1, position y_{12+H-1}, then after action a_{12+H-1}, y_{12+H} =9.\n\nSo if y_{12+H-1} =8, then a=U.\n\nIf y_{12+H-1} =9, then a=S or D, but not minimal.\n\nTypically, y_{12+H-1} =8.\n\nFor H=11, arrive turn 12+11=23, so at turn 22, y22=8, then a22: U to y9 at 23.\n\nBut as above, to have y22=8, we need that at turn 21, y21 is such that after a21, y22=8.\n\nIf y21=7, a21=U, y22=8.\n\nIf y21=8, a21=S, y22=8.\n\nBut at turn 21, if y21=7 or 8, both are unsafe because T=21 is unsafe for y=7 and y=8.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be at y=7 or y=8 at turn 21.\n\nSo we cannot have y22=8 from turn 21.\n\nThe only way is to have y22=8 with y21=8 and a21=S, but still at turn 21 y21=8 unsafe.\n\nOr if we can have y22=8 from lower, but impossible in one move.\n\nTherefore, for H=11, we cannot have the position at turn 22 to be 8 without being at 7 or 8 at turn 21, which is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly for other H.\n\nBut for H=12, arrive at turn 24.\n\nAt turn 23, y23=8, then a23: U to y9 at 24.\n\nNow, at turn 23, y23=8 must be safe.\n\nT=23, dt=11, freeway 8: as before, span [ -59+66, -48+66] = [7,18] for first car, 0 not in; second car [55,66],0 not in, so safe.\n\nNow, to have y23=8.\n\nWe need to reach y=8 at turn 23.\n\nFrom start, with 11 actions, we can go directly or with waiting.\n\nFor example, go to y=6 at T=18 with 6 actions.\n\nThen from T=18 to T=23, 5 actions to go from y=6 to y=8, which takes 2 moves, so we can wait 3 turns.\n\nBut we need to be at y=7 and y=8 at safe times.\n\nFor instance, go to y=7 at T=22.\n\nT=22 y=7 safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at T=23.\n\nSequence:\n\nReach y=6 at T=18 as before.\n\nThen:\n\nAt T=18, y=6\n\na18: S → T=19 y=6 (stay)\n\na19: S → T=20 y=6 (stay)\n\na20: S → T=21 y=6 (stay)  -- T=21 y=6 safe\n\na21: U → T=22 y=7 (safe)\n\na22: U → T=23 y=8 (safe)\n\nThen a23: U → T=24 y=9 for arrival, but with a23, it would be turn 24.\n\nWith actions up to a22 for H=11? Let's count.\n\nActions:\n\na12:U T13 y1\n\na13:U T14 y2\n\na14:U T15 y3\n\na15:U T16 y4\n\na16:U T17 y5\n\na17:U T18 y6\n\na18:S T19 y6\n\na19:S T20 y6\n\na20:S T21 y6\n\na21:U T22 y7\n\na22:U T23 y8\n\nThen for arrival at y9, we need a23:U T24 y9\n\nSo actions a12 to a23, 12 actions, arrive turn 24.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut at T=23, y=8, we can go U at T23 to y9 at T24.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=11?\n\nWith H=11, arrive turn 23.\n\nThen at turn 22, y22 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y22=9, then we arrived earlier, but with 10 actions, at turn 22 y9, then H=10 for arrival at 22.\n\nBut let's check if possible.\n\nWith H=10, arrive at turn 22 y9.\n\nThen at turn 21, y21 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y21=8, then a21:U to y9 at 22.\n\nBut at turn 21, y21=8, unsafe.\n\nIf y21=9, then a21:S or D, but y21=9 at turn 21 would require after 9 actions, turn 21 y9, so H=9 for arrival at 21, but at turn 20 y8 collision in path.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo minimal H is 12, arrive at turn 24.\n\nBut we can optimize the waiting.\n\nSince y=7 is safe at T=19, we can go to y=7 at T=19, then go down to y=6 at T=20, then stay at y=6 until T=21, then go to y=7 at T=22, then to y=8 at T=23, to y=9 at T=24.\n\nBut same as above.\n\nFrom y=6 at T=18, we can go directly to y=7 at T=22 by waiting, but with actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have three stay actions at y=6.\n\nBut we can reduce if we go to y=7 later.\n\nBut no, because we need to go up.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=5 or lower and wait, but y=6 is fine.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=8 at T=22.\n\nT=22 y=8 safe.\n\nTo be at y=8 at T=22, from start.\n\nAfter 10 actions, at turn 22 y=8.\n\nWith 10 actions from y=0, to reach y=8, we must have two S or D actions.\n\nFor example, at some point, stay twice or move down and up.\n\nBut to minimize time, better to stay at safe low y.\n\nFor example, go to y=6 at T=18 with 6 actions.\n\nThen at T=18, y=6, we need to be at y=8 at T=22 with 4 more actions.\n\nSo from T=18 to T=22, 4 actions: for example, S,S,U,U or U,D,U,U etc, but we need y22=8.\n\nIf we do U at T18 to y7 at T19, then at T19 y7, we can do D to y6 at T20, then U to y7 at T21, but T21 y7 unsafe, collision.\n\nIf at T19 y7, we do S, but T20 y7 unsafe.\n\nSo not good.\n\nFrom T18 y6, do S at T18: T19 y6\n\nS at T19: T20 y6\n\nU at T20: T21 y7, but T21 y7 unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nSo the only safe way is to go to y=7 at T=22 directly from lower.\n\nBut from y=6 at T=18, to have y=7 at T=22, we need to stay at y=6 for 4 turns: T19,T20,T21 at y6, then U at T21 to y7 at T22.\n\nBut at T21, action a21: from y6 U to y7 at T22.\n\nT22 y7.\n\nBut we want y8 at T22 for H=11 arrival.\n\nFor y8 at T22, we need from y6 to y8 in one action, impossible.\n\nSo must have two steps.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 12.\n\nAnd the sequence as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, with 12 actions, we can write it.\n\nBut let's confirm the car states at the critical points.\n\nFirst, the path:\n\nTurn 12: start y=0, action U\n\nTurn 13: y=1, action U\n\nTurn 14: y=2, action U\n\nTurn 15: y=3, action U\n\nTurn 16: y=4, action U\n\nTurn 17: y=5, action U\n\nTurn 18: y=6, action S (stay)\n\nTurn 19: y=6, action S (stay)\n\nTurn 20: y=6, action S (stay)  -- at T=20, y=6, freeway 6, always safe\n\nTurn 21: y=6, action U  -- to y=7 at T=22\n\nTurn 22: y=7, action U  -- to y=8 at T=23\n\nTurn 23: y=8, action U  -- to y=9 at T=24\n\nArrive at turn 24.\n\nNow check safety:\n\nAt turn 13: y=1, freeway 1, dt=1, span [-59+3, -48+3] = [-56,-45], 0 not in, safe\n\nTurn 14: y=2, freeway 2, car (48,37,right,12), span [37+12*2,48+12*2]? dt= T-12, T=14, dt=2, span [37+24,48+24]=[61,72], 0 not in, safe\n\nSimilarly, turn 15: y=3, freeway 3, similar, safe\n\nTurn 16: y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\nTurn 17: y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\nTurn 18: y=6, freeway 6, at dt=6, cars: first [37+72,48+72]=[109,120], 0 not; second [0 +72, -11+72]? Second car (0,-11,right,12), at dt=6, span [-11 +72, 0+72] = [61,72], 0 not in, safe\n\nTurn 19: y=6, same as above, dt=7, span [37+84,48+84]=[121,132], second [-11+84,84]=[73,84], 0 not in, safe\n\nTurn 20: y=6, dt=8, span [37+96,48+96]=[133,144], second [-11+96,96]=[85,96], safe\n\nTurn 21: y=6, dt=9, span [37+108,48+108]=[145,156], second [-11+108,108]=[97,108], safe\n\nTurn 22: y=7, freeway 7, dt=10\n\nCars: first (-48,-59,right,6), span [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSecond (0,-11,right,6), span [-11+60, 60] = [49,60], 0 not in, safe\n\nTurn 23: y=8, freeway 8, dt=11\n\nFirst car span [-59+66, -48+66] = [7,18], 0 not in\n\nSecond car span [-11+66,66] = [55,66], 0 not in, safe\n\nThen turn 24: y=9, safe.\n\nAll safe.\n\nH=12 actions.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose we go to y=7 at T=19, then at T=19, instead of going down, we go down earlier, but we are at T=19 y=7.\n\nIf we go to y=7 at T=19, then we must leave before T=20.\n\nFor example, at T=19, go D to y=6 at T=20.\n\nThen at T=20 y=6, we can go U to y=7 at T=21, but T=21 y=7 unsafe.\n\nGo directly to y=8 from y=6 at T=20, but cannot.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps stay at y=5 or lower.\n\nFor example, go to y=5 at T=17 with 5 actions.\n\nThen stay at y=5 for some turns.\n\ny=5 always safe.\n\nThen go to y=6, then to y=7 at T=22, etc.\n\nBut it might take more or same time.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=12 y=0 a12:U T13 y1\n\na13:U T14 y2\n\na14:U T15 y3\n\na15:U T16 y4\n\na16:U T17 y5\n\nThen at T17 y5, we can stay: a17:S T18 y5\n\na18:S T19 y5\n\na19:S T20 y5\n\na20:U T21 y6 -- but T21 y6 safe\n\na21:U T22 y7 safe\n\na22:U T23 y8 safe\n\na23:U T24 y9\n\nSame as before, H=12.\n\nIf we go faster to higher, but blocked.\n\nSo I think H=12 is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 21, we go from y6 to y7 at T22.\n\nBut turn 21 is not on freeway issue.\n\nNow for the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nt1=12.\n\nActions from t=0 to H-1 relative, but in the format, it says for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nSo for H=12, actions a12 to a23.\n\nThe sequence:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: S\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nTurn 20: S\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nThen position at turn 24 y=9.\n\nIn the actions, turn 23: U to y9 at 24.\n\nBut the last action is a23.\n\nIn the sequence, we have 12 actions.\n\nTo write in the box.\n\nBut let's see if we can reduce to H=11.\n\nSuppose we go to y=7 at T=19, then at T=19, go D to y=6 at T=20.\n\nThen at T=20 y=6, we go U to y=7 at T=21, but T=21 y=7 unsafe, collision.\n\nIf we go U at T=20 to y=7 at T=21, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo from y=6 at T=20 directly to y=8, impossible.\n\nSo no, H=12 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8, at T=19, it is safe, but we cannot be there.\n\nI think we have to accept H=12.\n\nSo the minimal number of turns H is 12.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: S\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nTurn 20: S\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nIn the output, it should be for turns t1 to t1+H-1, so turn 12 to 23.\n\nAnd actions.\n\nNow to write in the box.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 12. The sequence of actions minimizes \\(H\\) by moving up quickly to \\(y = 6\\) by turn 18, then waiting at \\(y = 6\\) for three turns (turns 18, 19, and 20) to avoid the unsafe times for freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) at turns 20 and 21. After waiting, the player moves up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 22 and \\(y = 8\\) at turn 23, both safe times, and finally to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 24.\n\nThe actions are as follows:\n\n- At turn 12, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 1\\) at turn 13 (safe, as freeway 1 at turn 13 has no car covering \\(x = 0\\)).\n- At turn 13, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 2\\) at turn 14 (safe, as freeway 2 at turn 14 has no car covering \\(x = 0\\)).\n- At turn 14, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 3\\) at turn 15 (safe, as freeway 3 at turn 15 has no car covering \\(x = 0\\)).\n- At turn 15, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 4\\) at turn 16 (safe, as freeway 4 at turn 16 has no car covering \\(x = 0\\)).\n- At turn 16, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 5\\) at turn 17 (safe, as freeway 5 at turn 17 has no car covering \\(x = 0\\)).\n- At turn 17, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 6\\) at turn 18 (safe, as freeway 6 at turn 18 has no car covering \\(x = 0\\)).\n- At turn 18, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 19 (safe, as freeway 6 at turn 19 has no car covering \\(x = 0\\)).\n- At turn 19, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 20 (safe, as freeway 6 at turn 20 has no car covering \\(x = 0\\)).\n- At turn 20, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 21 (safe, as freeway 6 at turn 21 has no car covering \\(x = 0\\)).\n- At turn 21, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 7\\) at turn 22 (safe, as freeway 7 at turn 22 has no car covering \\(x = 0\\); car spans are \\([1, 12]\\) and \\([49, 60]\\), excluding 0).\n- At turn 22, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 8\\) at turn 23 (safe, as freeway 8 at turn 23 has no car covering \\(x = 0\\); car spans are \\([7, 18]\\) and \\([55, 66]\\), excluding 0).\n- At turn 23, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 24 (safe, as \\(y = 9\\) has no cars).\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions and reaches the goal in the minimal \\(H = 12\\) turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 12: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: \\, U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 18, and I start at y=0.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For each freeway, there are cars with their positions and speeds. The cars move left or right based on their direction.\n\nThe collision rule is: collision occurs at turn T if I'm on a freeway y at that turn, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is within its span at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, when I move to a new y, I'm not considered on that new y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nI need to minimize H, the number of turns to reach y=9.\n\nSince I start at y=0 and need to go to y=9, and y only changes by -1, 0, or +1 each turn, the minimum possible H without any cars would be 9 turns, all U actions. But with cars, I might need to wait or go down sometimes to avoid collisions.\n\nBut going down from y=0 isn't possible since y=0 is the bottom, and y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so I can't go below 0. Similarly, I can't go above 9.\n\ny=0 is the starting point, and I need to go to freeways y=1 to 8, but y=0 and y=9 might be safe? The collision is only for freeways y=1 to 8, I think. Let me check.\n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1, …, 8\". And y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I assume, so no cars there. So positions y=0 and y=9 are safe; no collision possible there.\n\nAt turn T, if I'm on y=0 or y=9, there are no cars, so no collision. Only when I'm on y=1 to 8, I need to worry about cars.\n\nAlso, at the start, I'm at (0,0), which is safe. I need to reach (0,9), which is also safe.\n\nNow, the car positions are given at turn t_1=18. For future turns, I need to compute where the cars are based on their speeds and directions.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway at t=18.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nSince direction is right, and head is -48, tail is -59? That seems odd. Head should be the front, I think.\n\nFor right-moving cars, the span is [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor left-moving: span [h, τ] → [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt], so if h and τ, for left-moving, h is head, τ is tail, and since it's moving left, head is smaller? I need to clarify.\n\nFrom the update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, decreasing x, so if [h, τ] with h < τ, then head is at h, tail at τ, and both decrease.\n\nBut in the example, for freeway 1, it's (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, it says: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], so for right-moving, τ is the tail, h is the head, and τ < h, I think.\n\nIn freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3). But -48 and -59, if τ = -59, h = -48, then τ = -59 < h = -48, so [τ, h] = [-59, -48], so at t=18, the car spans from x=-59 to x=-48, moving right with speed 3.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 2: (48, 37, right, 12)\n\n(48, 37, right, 12), but 48 > 37, so if τ = 37, h = 48, then [τ, h] = [37, 48], moving right.\n\nBut in the notation, it says \"head h, tail τ\", but for right-moving, it's given as (h, τ) or (τ, h)? In the table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 1: head h = -48, tail τ = -59, direction right, speed 3.\n\nBut for right-moving, head should be the front, which is at higher x if moving right? Moving right means increasing x, so head should have higher x than tail.\n\nIn freeway 1: h = -48, τ = -59, so h > τ, since -48 > -59, so head at -48, tail at -59, so the car is from x=-59 to x=-48, and moving right, so head is at -48, which is to the right of tail at -59.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: head 48, tail 37, so from 37 to 48, moving right.\n\nBut 37 to 48, head 48, tail 37, yes.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 3 has one car: (48,37,right,12), same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: (48,37,right,12), same.\n\nFreeway 5: (48,37,right,12), same.\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\n(0,-11,right,12): head 0, tail -11, so from -11 to 0, moving right.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nNow, I need to find when these cars have 0 in their span at various turns.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, I am on freeway y, and for some car on y, 0 is in [min, max] of the span at that turn.\n\nSince the player is at x=0 always, I think, since it's a vertical move, x=0 fixed.\n\nThe position is (0, y_t), so x=0 always.\n\nSo for each freeway and each turn, I need to check if there is a car such that 0 is within its span at that turn.\n\nIf yes, and I am on that freeway at that turn, collision.\n\nNow, for a car, at turn T, the span depends on T - t1, where t1=18.\n\nLet Δt = T - 18, so at turn T = 18 + Δt.\n\nFor a right-moving car with head h, tail τ at t1, speed s, at T, span is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, but in this case, all cars are right-moving, I think. From the table, all directions are \"right\", so no left-moving cars.\n\nFreeway 1: right, freeway 2: right, etc. all are right-moving.\n\nSo only right-moving cars.\n\nSo for any car, at turn T, span = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt], with τ and h as given at t=18.\n\nAnd collision if 0 is in [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] for some car on that row.\n\nSince τ and h, with τ < h, so the interval is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt], and 0 is in it if τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all right here.\n\nNow, I need for each freeway y=1 to 8, and for each possible turn T, whether there is a car causing 0 to be occupied at T.\n\nBut since multiple cars per freeway, I need to check all cars.\n\nMoreover, since I might stay or move, I need to plan a path from y=0 to y=9.\n\ny starts at 0, I need to reach 9.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nSo the sequence of y positions.\n\nLet me denote the turn from t=18 onwards.\n\nAt turn 18, I am at y=0, which is safe.\n\nI perform action a_{18}, which determines y_{19}, and so on.\n\ny_{t} is the position at turn t, before action, I think? Let's see.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\na_t is action at turn t, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, position is (0, y_t), and I choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1}), and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T when I am at y_T, for that freeway.\n\nIf y_T = k (1≤k≤8), and at that turn, for some car on k, 0 is in the span, then collision.\n\nIf y_T = 0 or 9, no collision.\n\nNow, I need y_{18+H-1} = 9, and I start at y_{18} = 0.\n\ny_{18} = 0.\n\nAfter H turns, I want y_{18 + H - 1} = 9? Let's see the indices.\n\nTurn t: position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nI start at turn 18, y_{18} = 0.\n\nI perform actions a_{18}, a_{19}, ..., up to a_{18 + H - 1}? Let's think.\n\nI want to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSuppose at turn T, y_T = 9.\n\nT must be at least 18 + 9 = 27 if I go up every turn, but I might take more or less? Less not possible, since min 9 steps to go from 0 to 9.\n\ny from 0 to 9, min 9 up moves, so min H=9 turns? H is the number of turns for actions.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from t=18 to t=18+H-1, I perform H actions, and after that, at turn t=18+H, I am at y_{18+H}.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn 18: position y_{18} = 0.\n\nI choose action a_{18}, which determines y_{19} = y_{18} + Δy_{18}.\n\nThen at turn 19: position y_{19}, I choose a_{19}, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, I am at turn 18+k, position y_{18+k}.\n\nI want y_{18+k} = 9 for some k.\n\nThe number of actions H such that after H actions, I am at y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn 18+H.\n\nSo I want y_{18+H} = 9.\n\nAnd the actions are from a_{18} to a_{18+H-1}, since a_{18} to a_{18+H-1} affect y_{19} to y_{18+H}.\n\nFor example, with H=0, no actions, at turn 18, y=0.\n\nWith H=1, I do a_{18}, then y_{19} = y_{18} + Δy, so if a_{18}=U, y_{19}=1, etc.\n\nI want y_{18+H} = 9.\n\nThe minimal H is at least 9, since I need to increase y by 9.\n\nIf I can go directly up without stopping, H=9.\n\nBut with cars, I might need to stop or go down, which increases H.\n\nI need to find if I can reach y=9 in 9 turns or more.\n\nNow, the collision depends on when I am on each y.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find when it is safe to be there, i.e., when no car has 0 in its span.\n\nSince the cars move, the safety is periodic or depends on time.\n\nFirst, for each freeway, find for which turns T, the freeway is unsafe, meaning that at turn T, there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nIf for a freeway at turn T, it is unsafe, then if I am on that freeway at turn T, collision.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars and their span over time.\n\nt1=18, Δt = T - 18.\n\nFor each freeway:\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, h=-48, τ=-59, s=3, right-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-59 + 3 Δt, -48 + 3 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 3 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 3 Δt\n\nWhich is 3 Δt ≤ 59 and 3 Δt ≥ 48? Let's solve inequalities.\n\n-59 + 3 Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 3 Δt ≤ 59 ⇒ Δt ≤ 59/3 ≈ 19.666, so Δt ≤ 19 since integer\n\n0 ≤ -48 + 3 Δt ⇒ 48 ≤ 3 Δt ⇒ Δt ≥ 16\n\nSo for Δt from 16 to 19 inclusive.\n\nThus at T = 18 + Δt, for Δt=16,17,18,19, so T=34,35,36,37.\n\nT=18 + Δt, so for Δt=16, T=34; Δt=17,T=35; Δt=18,T=36; Δt=19,T=37.\n\nSo freeway 1 is unsafe at turns 34,35,36,37.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car, h=48, τ=37, s=12, right-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [37 + 12 Δt, 48 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span: 37 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 12 Δt\n\nBut 37 + 12 Δt ≤ 0? 12 Δt ≤ -37, but Δt ≥0, 12 Δt ≥0, so 37 + 12 Δt ≥37 >0, so left inequality never true. Thus 0 never in span for this car.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same car, (48,37,right,12), same as freeway 2, so never unsafe.\n\nFreeway 4: same, never unsafe.\n\nFreeway 5: same, never unsafe.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12), same as above, never unsafe.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), head=0, tail=-11, s=12.\n\nSpan at T: [-11 + 12 Δt, 0 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span: -11 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 0 + 12 Δt\n\n0 ≤ 0 + 12 Δt is always true for Δt ≥0.\n\n-11 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 12 Δt ≤ 11 ⇒ Δt ≤ 11/12 <1, so Δt=0 only? Δt integer, Δt ≥0.\n\nAt Δt=0, T=18, -11 +0 = -11 ≤0, and 0≤0, so 0 is included.\n\nFor Δt=0, -11 +0 = -11, 0+0=0, so span [-11,0], and 0 is included, since ≤ and ≥, it should be closed interval.\n\nThe inequality is τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt, which includes equality.\n\nSo for second car, at Δt=0, T=18, span [-11,0], 0 ≤0 ≤0, so yes, 0 is in [ -11, 0].\n\nFor Δt=1, span [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12].\n\nFor Δt>0, -11 +12 Δt ≥ -11 +12=1>0 for Δt≥1, so 0 not ≤ lower bound, so not in span.\n\nOnly at Δt=0, T=18, 0 is in span.\n\nSo for freeway 6, at T=18, the second car has 0 in span.\n\nFirst car never, so freeway 6 is unsafe only at T=18.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,6) head -48? Given as (-48,-59,right,6), so h=-48, τ=-59, s=6.\n\nSpan at T: [-59 +6 Δt, -48 +6 Δt]\n\n0 in span: -59 +6 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +6 Δt\n\nSo 6 Δt ≤ 59 ⇒ Δt ≤ 59/6 ≈9.833, Δt≤9\n\nAnd 6 Δt ≥ 48 ⇒ Δt ≥ 8\n\nSo Δt=8,9\n\nT=18+8=26, 18+9=27.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6), head=0, tail=-11, s=6.\n\nSpan at T: [-11 +6 Δt, 0 +6 Δt]\n\n0 in span: -11 +6 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 0 +6 Δt\n\n0 ≤ 6 Δt always true for Δt≥0\n\n-11 +6 Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 6 Δt ≤11 ⇒ Δt ≤11/6≈1.833, so Δt=0,1\n\nFor Δt=0, T=18, span [-11,0], 0 in\n\nFor Δt=1, T=19, span [-11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6], 0 in [-5,6]\n\nFor Δt=2, span [-11+12,6] = [1,6], 0 not in\n\nSo at T=18 and T=19, for second car.\n\nNow for freeway 7, at each turn, if any car has 0 in span, unsafe.\n\nAt T=18: both cars? First car at Δt=0, -59 +0 = -59 ≤0 ≤ -48? 0 ≤ -48? -48 <0, so 0 > -48, so 0 ≤ -48 +0 is false. 0 ≤ -48? No, -48 is negative, 0 > -48, so 0 not ≤ -48, so not in span for first car at T=18.\n\nSecond car at T=18: 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly, at T=19: first car, Δt=1, -59+6= -53 ≤0? -53≤0 true, 0≤ -48+6= -42? 0≤ -42 false, so not in span.\n\nSecond car: Δt=1, -5≤0≤6 true, 0 in.\n\nAt T=26: Δt=8 for both? T=26, Δt=8.\n\nFirst car: -59 +6*8 = -59+48= -11 ≤0 ≤ -48+48=0? -11 ≤0 ≤0, yes, 0≤0 true.\n\nSecond car: at Δt=8, -11 +48=37, 0+48=48, span [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, T=27: Δt=9, first car: -59+54= -5 ≤0 ≤ -48+54=6, -5≤0≤6 true.\n\nSecond car: -11+54=43, 0+54=54, [43,54], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 7 unsafe when:\n\nAt T=18: due to second car\n\nT=19: due to second car\n\nT=26: due to first car\n\nT=27: due to first car\n\nAnd other times, safe? For example, T=20 to 25, etc.\n\nNow freeway 8: same as freeway 7, since cars are identical: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nSo same unsafe times: T=18,19,26,27.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway, unsafe turns:\n\ny=1: unsafe at T=34,35,36,37\n\ny=2: always safe (no car causes 0 in span)\n\ny=3: always safe\n\ny=4: always safe\n\ny=5: always safe\n\ny=6: unsafe at T=18\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=18,19,26,27\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=18,19,26,27\n\ny=2,3,4,5 are always safe, no issue.\n\ny=1 unsafe only at T=34-37, which might not be relevant if I pass early.\n\nBut I need to go through y=1 to 8.\n\nNow, I start at turn 18, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe path must go through y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 in some order, but since I can only change by 1 each step, it must be sequential, but I can stay or go down, so I might visit some y multiple times or skip, but since min steps, I probably go up directly except when unsafe.\n\nBut I can stay on a row to wait, or go down to avoid, but going down might not help if I have to go up later.\n\nSince I need min H, I should go up as much as possible, only stop or deviate when necessary.\n\nNow, let's see the unsafe times.\n\nFirst, at turn 18, y=6 is unsafe, y=7 unsafe, y=8 unsafe.\n\nBut I start at y=0, so at turn 18, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nI choose action a_{18}, which will set y_{19}.\n\nIf I go up at turn 18, y_{19}=1, and at turn 19, I am at y=1.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, which is safe except at T=34-37, which is later, so at T=19, y=1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2,3,4,5 always safe.\n\nBut y=6 unsafe at T=18, but T=18 is now past, since we are at turn 18, but collision at turn T when I am on y.\n\nAt turn 18, I am on y=0, not on freeway, so no issue for y=6 at T=18.\n\nNow, for future turns.\n\nI need to be careful when I am on which row at which turn.\n\nSince y=2,3,4,5 are always safe, I can pass through them anytime.\n\ny=1 is unsafe only at T=34,35,36,37, which is turn 34 to 37.\n\nSince t1=18, and min time to reach y=9 is 9 steps, so at turn 27, I can be at y=9 if all up.\n\nTurn 18: y=0\n\nAfter 1 up: turn 19, y=1\n\nAfter 2: turn 20, y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter 9 up: turn 27, y=9.\n\nNow, check if this path has collision.\n\nAt each turn, when I am on a freeway.\n\nTurn 19: y=1, which is safe except at T=34-37, so at T=19, safe.\n\nTurn 20: y=2, safe.\n\nTurn 21: y=3, safe.\n\nTurn 22: y=4, safe.\n\nTurn 23: y=5, safe.\n\nTurn 24: y=6, now y=6 is freeway 6.\n\nIs it safe at T=24?\n\ny=6 unsafe only at T=18, as we found.\n\nT=18 is past, so at T=24, no car has 0 in span, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 25: y=7, freeway 7.\n\nUnsafe at T=18,19,26,27.\n\nT=25 is not in {18,19,26,27}, so safe.\n\nTurn 26: y=8, freeway 8.\n\nUnsafe at T=18,19,26,27.\n\nT=26 is unsafe! Oh, at turn 26, if I am on y=8, collision.\n\nSimilarly, turn 27: y=9, but y=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nAt turn 27, y=9, not on freeway, so no collision.\n\nBut at turn 26, I would be on y=8, which is unsafe at T=26.\n\nIn the direct path: at turn 25, y=7; turn 26, y=8; but at turn 26, y=8 is unsafe.\n\nSo collision at turn 26 if I go to y=8.\n\nThen turn 27, I could go to y=9, but I can't because I collided or I need to avoid.\n\nIn this case, on turn 26, if I am on y=8, collision, so I must not be on y=8 at turn 26.\n\nSimilarly, for y=7, unsafe at T=26 and 27? T=26 and 27 for y=7? Earlier for y=7, unsafe at T=18,19,26,27.\n\nBut in the path, at turn 25, y=7, which is not unsafe time? T=25 not in {18,19,26,27}, so safe.\n\nTurn 26: if I go to y=8, then at turn 26, I am on y=8, which is unsafe at T=26.\n\nIf I stay on y=7 at turn 26, then at turn 26, I am on y=7, which is unsafe at T=26, so collision.\n\ny=7 unsafe at T=26.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down to y=6, but y=6 might be safe or not.\n\nLet's list the unsafe turns for each y:\n\ny=1: unsafe T=34,35,36,37\n\ny=6: unsafe only T=18\n\ny=7: unsafe T=18,19,26,27\n\ny=8: unsafe T=18,19,26,27\n\ny=2,3,4,5: always safe\n\nIn the direct up path:\n\nTurn | y | safe?\n\n18: 0, safe\n\n19: 1, safe (since not 34-37)\n\n20: 2, safe\n\n21: 3, safe\n\n22: 4, safe\n\n23: 5, safe\n\n24: 6, safe (T=24 not 18)\n\n25: 7, safe (T=25 not 18,19,26,27)\n\n26: 8, unsafe (T=26 is unsafe for y=8)\n\n27: if I go to 9, but at turn 26 I am on y=8 and unsafe, so collision before I can act.\n\nAt turn 26, position y=8, collision occurs, game over or something, so I cannot reach.\n\nThus, direct path has collision at turn 26 on y=8.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at turns 26 and 27, or on y=7 at 26,27, etc.\n\ny=7 and y=8 both unsafe at T=26 and 27.\n\nAt turn 25, I am at y=7, which is safe.\n\nThen at turn 25, I choose action for y_{26}.\n\nIf I go up to y=8, then at turn 26, y=8, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, y=7, at turn 26, y=7, unsafe.\n\nIf I go down to y=6, then at turn 26, y=6.\n\ny=6 is safe at T=26, since only unsafe at T=18.\n\nSo possible to go down.\n\nThen at turn 26, I am at y=6, safe.\n\nThen I need to go up later.\n\nBut turns 26 and 27 are unsafe for y=7 and y=8, so I need to wait until after T=27.\n\nAfter T=27, y=7 and y=8 are safe, since only unsafe at 18,19,26,27.\n\nT=28 onwards, safe for all.\n\ny=1 unsafe later, but I might not be there.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nAt turn 25: y=7, safe. I need to not be on y=7 or y=8 at T=26 and T=27.\n\nSo at turn 25, I should go down to y=6, so y_{26} =6.\n\nThen at turn 26: position y=6, safe (since T=26 not unsafe for y=6).\n\nNow at turn 26, I choose action.\n\nIf I go up to y=7, then at turn 27, y=7, but T=27 unsafe for y=7, collision.\n\nIf I stay on y=6, then at turn 27, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at turn 27, I can choose to go up or stay.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9 eventually.\n\nAfter T=27, y=7 and y=8 are safe.\n\nSo at turn 26, on y=6, I should stay or go down, but going down to y=5 might not help.\n\ny=5 safe always.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nTo minimize time, at turn 26, I can stay on y=6.\n\nThen turn 27: y=6, safe. Now T=27, if I go up to y=7, then at turn 27, action a_{27}, but position at turn 27 is y=6, I choose a_{27}, which sets y_{28}.\n\nAt turn 27, position y=6, I am on y=6, which is safe.\n\nI choose a_{27}, say U, then y_{28}=7.\n\nThen at turn 28, position y=7.\n\nT=28, which is after 27, so y=7 safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can go up to y=8 at turn 29, etc.\n\nBut let's count the turns.\n\nOriginal min path to y=9 at turn 27.\n\nNow, with delay, I am at turn 27 still on y=6.\n\nThen:\n\nTurn 27: at y=6, choose U, then y_{28}=7\n\nTurn 28: at y=7, choose U, y_{29}=8\n\nTurn 29: at y=8, choose U, y_{30}=9\n\nSo I reach y=9 at turn 30, which is after 12 actions? From turn 18.\n\nStart turn 18: y=0\n\nAfter actions: let's list y_t.\n\nt=18: y=0\n\na_{18}: U, y_{19}=1\n\na_{19}: U, y_{20}=2\n\na_{20}: U, y_{21}=3\n\na_{21}: U, y_{22}=4\n\na_{22}: U, y_{23}=5\n\na_{23}: U, y_{24}=6\n\na_{24}: U, y_{25}=7\n\nNow at t=25, y=7, instead of going up, I go down.\n\na_{25}: D, then y_{26} = y_{25} + (-1) =7-1=6\n\nThen t=26: y=6\n\na_{26}: S or U? If I go U, y_{27}=7, but at t=27, y=7, unsafe.\n\nSo I should stay or go down.\n\na_{26}: S, then y_{27}=6 (stay)\n\nt=27: y=6, safe\n\na_{27}: U, y_{28}=7\n\nt=28: y=7, safe (T=28 not unsafe)\n\na_{28}: U, y_{29}=8\n\nt=29: y=8, safe\n\na_{29}: U, y_{30}=9\n\nSo at turn 30, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from a_{18} to a_{29}, that's 12 actions? Indices: a_{18} to a_{29} is 12 actions, and y_{30}=9.\n\nSince I start at t=18, y=0, after H actions, y_{18+H}=9.\n\nHere y_{30}=9, 18+H=30, H=12.\n\nBut min is 9, so H=12.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nI could go slower earlier to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, if I delay reaching y=7 and y=8 until after turn 27.\n\nTurns 26 and 27 unsafe for y=7 and y=8.\n\nI need to not be on y=7 or y=8 at t=26 and t=27.\n\nI can be on lower rows.\n\nAt turn 25, if I am on y=7, I have to leave or something.\n\nIn the above, I went down to y=6 at t=26.\n\nBut at turn 24, I am at y=6.\n\nTurn 24: y=6, safe.\n\nI choose a_{24}, if I go U, y_{25}=7, then at t=25, y=7, which is safe (T=25 not unsafe).\n\nThen at t=25, I have to deal with it.\n\nIf at turn 24, I stay on y=6 instead of going up.\n\nFor example:\n\nSuppose I reach y=6 earlier and wait there.\n\nBut y=6 is safe except at T=18, which is past.\n\nSo I can stay on y=6 as long as I want.\n\nSimilarly for other safe rows.\n\nBut to minimize time, I should go up as fast as possible until I need to avoid.\n\nThe problem is only at t=26 and t=27 for y=7 and y=8.\n\nSo I need to be below y=7 at t=26 and t=27.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAt turn 25, y_t must be <=6, so that at t=26, I can be on y<=6 or y=7 but unsafe, so better to be <=6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=26, y_t <=6, so that at t=27, y_t <=6 or y=7 but unsafe.\n\nBut if I am on y=6 at t=26, I can stay or go down.\n\nThen at t=27, if on y=6, safe, then go up.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe critical time is around t=26,27.\n\nI can arrive at y=7 after t=27.\n\nFor example, be at y=6 at t=25, t=26, t=27, then go up to y=7 at t=28, etc.\n\nBut that might take more time.\n\nLet's list the turns when I can be on each row without issue.\n\ny=1: avoid t=34-37, but since I will be there early, no problem.\n\ny=6: always safe except t=18, past.\n\ny=7: avoid t=18,19,26,27. t=18,19 past, so avoid t=26,27.\n\nSimilarly y=8: avoid t=26,27.\n\ny=2,3,4,5: no avoid.\n\nNow, min path: I need to be at y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nEarliest possible: if no cars, t=27.\n\nBut with cars, since I have to avoid y=7 and y=8 at t=26,27, I need to be at lower row at those times.\n\nFor example, at t=26 and t=27, I should be on y<=6.\n\ny=6 is safe.\n\nThen after t=27, I can go up.\n\nNow, when can I reach y=6?\n\nI can reach y=6 by t=24, for example.\n\nt=18: y=0\n\nt=19: y=1 (after a_{18}=U)\n\nt=20: y=2 (a_{19}=U)\n\n...\n\nt=24: y=6 (after 6 ups)\n\nThen at t=24, y=6.\n\nNow, at t=24, I need to stay or something until after t=27.\n\nt=24,25,26,27 I can be on y=6.\n\nThen at t=27, I am on y=6, choose U, y_{28}=7\n\nt=28: y=7, choose U, y_{29}=8\n\nt=29: y=8, choose U, y_{30}=9\n\nSo same as before, y=9 at t=30.\n\nBut I can go up faster to y=5 or something.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=5 quickly.\n\ny=5 always safe.\n\nAt t=23: y=5 (after 5 ups: t=19 y1, t20 y2, t21 y3, t22 y4, t23 y5)\n\nThen at t=23, I can stay on y=5 for a few turns, but y=5 safe, but I need to go up.\n\nIf I stay, I waste time.\n\nThen at t=24, go to y=6, etc.\n\nBut still, I need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at t=26,27.\n\nSo if at t=25, I am on y=6 or below.\n\nt=25: if on y=6, safe.\n\nThen t=26: on y=6 or below.\n\nIf on y=6 at t=26, safe.\n\nt=27: on y=6, safe, then go up.\n\nBut to be on y=6 at t=27, I can go up later.\n\nThe key is that at t=26 and t=27, I must not be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nSo positions at t=26 and t=27 must be <=6.\n\nThen at t=28, I can be on y=7, etc.\n\nNow, when can I first reach y=6? At t=24.\n\nAt t=24, y=6.\n\nThen I need to stay on y=6 until t=27? t=24,25,26,27 on y=6.\n\nBut at t=27, I can go up to y=7 at t=28.\n\nBut staying from t=24 to t=27 means I stay for 3 turns: at t=24,25,26 I stay, then at t=27 I go up.\n\nActions:\n\nt=18: U, y19=1\n\nt=19: U, y20=2\n\nt=20: U, y21=3\n\nt=21: U, y22=4\n\nt=22: U, y23=5\n\nt=23: U, y24=6\n\nNow at t=24: position y=6, I choose S (stay), so y25=6\n\nt=25: y=6, choose S, y26=6\n\nt=26: y=6, choose S, y27=6\n\nt=27: y=6, choose U, y28=7\n\nt=28: y=7, choose U, y29=8\n\nt=29: y=8, choose U, y30=9\n\nSo y=9 at t=30, H=12 actions.\n\nBut I can reduce the waiting.\n\nAt t=24, I am at y=6, which is fine.\n\nI need to be at y<=6 at t=26 and t=27.\n\nAt t=24, I can go up to y=7? But y=7 at t=25.\n\nt=24: choose a_{24}, if U, y25=7\n\nThen at t=25, y=7, which is safe (T=25 not unsafe).\n\nThen at t=25, I need to not be on y=7 at t=26? At t=26, position y_{26}.\n\nIf at t=25, I am at y=7, and I choose to go down, a_{25}=D, then y_{26}=6\n\nThen at t=26, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=26, I can choose to stay or go down.\n\nIf I stay, a_{26}=S, y_{27}=6, then at t=27, y=6, safe.\n\nThen a_{27}=U, y_{28}=7, and so on.\n\nBut I reach y=7 later.\n\nCompare:\n\nIn first option: go to y=6 at t=24, stay at t=24,25,26, go up at t=27 to y=7 at t=28.\n\ny=7 at t=28.\n\nIn second option: go to y=7 at t=25 (by a_{24}=U from y=6 at t=24? t=24 position y=6, a_{24}=U, y_{25}=7)\n\nt=25 position y=7, safe.\n\nThen a_{25}=D, y_{26}=6\n\nt=26 position y=6, safe\n\nThen a_{26}=S, y_{27}=6 (or U? If U, y_{27}=7, but t=27 y=7 unsafe, so must not)\n\nSo a_{26}=S, y_{27}=6\n\nt=27 position y=6, a_{27}=U, y_{28}=7\n\nSame as before, y=7 at t=28.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nIf at t=26, after y=6, I go down to y=5, but that might be worse.\n\nSo seems I need to reach y=9 at t=30, H=12.\n\nBut is there a way to be on y=8 at t=28 or something.\n\nt=28 y=7, t=29 y=8, t=30 y=9.\n\nMin is t=30.\n\nBut earlier I thought about y=1 unsafe at t=34-37, but since I pass early, no issue.\n\nAnother idea: can I go up slower so that I reach y=7 and y=8 after t=27.\n\nFor example, stay on lower rows longer.\n\nBut that would take more time, not less.\n\nFor instance, if I stay at y=0 for some turns, but y=0 safe, but I need to move up.\n\nSuppose I start later.\n\nBut min time might be more.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=5 and stay, then after t=27 go up.\n\nBut y=5 at t=23, if I stay until t=27, then go up.\n\nt=23: y=5\n\na_{23}=S, y24=5\n\na_{24}=S, y25=5\n\na_{25}=S, y26=5\n\na_{26}=S, y27=5\n\nThen a_{27}=U, y28=6\n\na_{28}=U, y29=7\n\na_{29}=U, y30=8\n\na_{30}=U, y31=9\n\nWorse, t=31 y=9, H=13.\n\nNot better.\n\nGo up to y=6 faster and wait.\n\nBut in all cases, since I have to spend turns 26 and 27 on y<=6, and I can be on y=6, which is fine.\n\nBut the earliest I can be on y=6 is t=24.\n\nThen from t=24 to t=27, I need to be on y<=6, so at least 3 turns from t=24 to t=26 or something.\n\nt=24,25,26,27: four turns, but I can be moving or staying.\n\nBut to minimize, I should stay on y=6 from t=24 to t=27, then go up.\n\nt=24 to t=27 is positions at those turns.\n\nAt t=24, I am at y=6 after action.\n\nThen I stay for actions at t=24,25,26 to remain at y=6.\n\nThen at t=27, go up to y=7 at t=28.\n\nNumber of actions: from a_{18} to a_{29}, 12 actions.\n\na_{18} to a_{29} is 12 actions: indices 18 to 29 inclusive is 12 terms.\n\n18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29: that's 12 actions.\n\ny_{30}=9.\n\nSince min 9, but with delay, 12.\n\nBut is there a way with H=11 or 10?\n\nSuppose I can be on y=7 at t=28 directly, but I need to pass through y=6,7,8.\n\nAnother thought: at turn t=25, if I am on y=6, and I go up to y=7 at t=26? But at t=26, if y=7, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf I go up to y=7 at t=25, but then at t=25, y=7 safe, but I have to leave before t=26.\n\nBut at t=25, I can only change to y=6,7, or 8? Actions U,D,S, so from y=7, I can go to y=6,7,8.\n\nIf I go to y=8 at t=26, but at t=26, y=8 unsafe.\n\nIf I go to y=6 at t=26, as before.\n\nNo way to skip.\n\nPerhaps use y=5 or something.\n\nBut I think 12 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm if y=1 is a problem? No, because I pass early.\n\ny=1 unsafe at t=34-37, but at that time I am already at y=9 or beyond, but y=9 is safe, and I don't move after.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=12, with sequence.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions.\n\nFrom above:\n\nAt t=18: start y=0, choose U, so y19=1\n\nt=19: at y=1, choose U, y20=2\n\nt=20: at y=2, U, y21=3\n\nt=21: at y=3, U, y22=4\n\nt=22: at y=4, U, y23=5\n\nt=23: at y=5, U, y24=6\n\nt=24: at y=6, choose S (stay), y25=6\n\nt=25: at y=6, choose S, y26=6\n\nt=26: at y=6, choose S, y27=6\n\nt=27: at y=6, choose U, y28=7\n\nt=28: at y=7, choose U, y29=8\n\nt=29: at y=8, choose U, y30=9\n\nSo actions from a_{18} to a_{29}.\n\na_{18}=U\n\na_{19}=U\n\na_{20}=U\n\na_{21}=U\n\na_{22}=U\n\na_{23}=U\n\na_{24}=S\n\na_{25}=S\n\na_{26}=S\n\na_{27}=U\n\na_{28}=U\n\na_{29}=U\n\nAnd y_{30}=9.\n\nH=12 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, a_{t} for t=18 to 29.\n\nBut the answer should be from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1? Let's see the output.\n\nThe answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nAnd H is the number of turns, I think.\n\nIn the task: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0, a_{t_1}, t=1, a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to t=H-1, a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nThen after that, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, t_1=18, H=12, so actions from a_{18} to a_{18+11}=a_{29}\n\nt from 0 to 11, a_{18+0} to a_{18+11}, so a_{18} to a_{29}.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd y_{18+12}=y_{30}=9.\n\nNow, in the sequence, at t=24,25,26 I stay, which is fine.\n\nBut can I reduce H by not staying all three times?\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=6 at t=25,26,27, but t=27 I go up.\n\nBut I need to reach y=6 by t=25.\n\nHow? From start.\n\nTo reach y=6: min 6 steps.\n\nt=18: y=0\n\nAfter 6 actions U: at t=24, y=6, as before.\n\nIf I take more than 6 actions to reach y=6, it would be later, worse.\n\nSo t=24 is earliest for y=6.\n\nThen I need to cover t=26 and t=27 on y<=6.\n\nAt t=24,25,26,27 I can be on y=6.\n\nBut at t=27, I can go up, so position at t=27 is y=6, then action to y=7 at t=28.\n\nThe critical points are positions at t=26 and t=27 must be <=6.\n\nAt t=24 and t=25, I can be higher, but y=7 at t=25 is ok, but then I have to go down.\n\nBut as before, it doesn't save time.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=23, y=5.\n\nThen a_{23}=U, y24=6\n\nt=24: y=6, a_{24}=S, y25=6\n\nt=25: y=6, a_{25}=S, y26=6\n\nt=26: y=6, a_{26}=S, y27=6\n\nt=27: a_{27}=U, y28=7\n\netc.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt t=25, if I am on y=7, I have to go down at t=25 to y=6 at t=26.\n\nThen same.\n\nNo savings.\n\nSo minimal H=12.\n\nNow, about the cars on other freeways, but I think we covered.\n\ny=6 has a car that is unsafe at t=18, but past, no issue.\n\nIn the sequence, when I am on y=6 at t=24,25,etc., it should be fine.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo I think this is the plan.\n\nNow, write the sequence.\n\nt_1=18.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 18: a_{18} = U\n\nTurn 19: a_{19} = U\n\nTurn 20: a_{20} = U\n\nTurn 21: a_{21} = U\n\nTurn 22: a_{22} = U\n\nTurn 23: a_{23} = U\n\nTurn 24: a_{24} = S\n\nTurn 25: a_{25} = S\n\nTurn 26: a_{26} = S\n\nTurn 27: a_{27} = U\n\nTurn 28: a_{28} = U\n\nTurn 29: a_{29} = U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 30, y=9.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut in the sequence, a_{27}=U to go to y=7 at t=28, etc.\n\nNow, to confirm, at turn 27, position y=6, I go up to y=7 at t=28.\n\nt=28 position y=7, which is safe since T=28 not unsafe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I can go up earlier at t=27, but to y=7 at t=28, which is after t=27, safe.\n\nIf I go up at t=26 from y=6, y_{27}=7, but at t=27, y=7 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, minimal H=12.\n\nNow, the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 18: U Turn 19: U Turn 20: U Turn 21: U Turn 22: U Turn 23: U Turn 24: S Turn 25: S Turn 26: S Turn 27: U Turn 28: U Turn 29: U }\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n\nSince it's a sequence, I can list them.\n\nAlso, H=12, but the sequence implies H.\n\nIn the output, it says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the answer format, it only shows the sequence, I think.\n\nThe format given: \\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t_1} ... }\n\nSo I think just list the actions.\n\nH is not explicitly in the box, but from the sequence, it's clear.\n\nPerhaps state H.\n\nBut in the format, it might be fine.\n\nNow, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 18\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 12. The sequence of actions must ensure that the player is not on freeways \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at turns 26 and 27, as these freeways are unsafe at those times due to car positions. Freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\) are always safe, and \\(y = 6\\) is safe except at turn 18 (which has passed). Freeway \\(y = 1\\) is unsafe at turns 34–37, but these are later than the relevant turns for the minimal path.\n\nThe optimal path involves moving up to \\(y = 6\\) by turn 24, staying on \\(y = 6\\) during turns 24–27 to avoid the unsafe times for \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\), and then moving up to \\(y = 9\\) by turn 30.\n\n- Turns 18–23: Move up from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 6\\) in 6 steps.\n- Turns 24–26: Stay on \\(y = 6\\) to avoid being on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at turns 26 and 27.\n- Turn 27: Move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 28.\n- Turn 28: Move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 29.\n- Turn 29: Move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 30.\n\nThis results in \\(y_{30} = 9\\) after 12 actions, with no collisions.\n\n**Sequence of Actions:**\n- Turn 18: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 19)\n- Turn 19: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 20)\n- Turn 20: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 21)\n- Turn 21: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 22)\n- Turn 22: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 23)\n- Turn 23: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 24)\n- Turn 24: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 25)\n- Turn 25: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 26)\n- Turn 26: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 27)\n- Turn 27: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 28)\n- Turn 28: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 29)\n- Turn 29: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 30)\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29: U }",

The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each turn, the player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span is calculated based on the car's movement: left-moving cars decrease their position over time, right-moving increase.\n\nImportant note: if the player moves to a different y at turn T, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, they are on y_T, and if they move, they change to y_{T+1} for the next turn. Collision is checked based on the y at the start of the turn.\n\nNow, the car states are given for turn t₁=24. I need to find where the cars are at future turns relative to t₁.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, (-48, -59, right, 3) — head at -48, tail at -59? That seems odd because usually head is ahead of tail. For right-moving, head should be greater than tail, but here it says (-48, -59, right, 3). -48 is greater than -59 since -48 > -59, so head is at -48, tail at -59, and since it's right-moving, it moves to increasing x.\n\nIn the span definition:\n\n- Left-moving: span is [h, τ] and moves left, so h decreases.\n\n- Right-moving: span is [τ, h] with τ < h, and moves right, so positions increase.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). I need to interpret what head and tail mean.\n\nFrom the update:\n\nFor left-moving: span starts as [h, τ] at t₁, then at T, it's [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nFor right-moving: span starts as [τ, h]? But in the table, it says \"cars (head, tail, direction, speed)\", so for right-moving, head should be the front, so for right-moving, head > tail, and span is [tail, head] or [head, tail]?\n\nLook at the update rule:\n\nRight-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nAnd it says \"head h, tail τ\", so for right-moving, if it's (head, tail, direction, speed), and direction right, then span is [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume.\n\nBut in the data, for freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3). Here head = -48, tail = -59. Since it's right-moving, τ should be the tail, which is less than head, so τ = -59, h = -48, so span at t₁ is [τ, h] = [-59, -48].\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, ...), so for consistency:\n\n- For right-moving: head is the front, tail is the rear, so head > tail, and span is [tail, head] at t₁.\n\n- For left-moving: head is the front, but since it's moving left, head < tail? But in the data, all are right-moving except I need to check directions.\n\nLooking at the cars:\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3) — head=-48, tail=-59, since right, span [tail, head] = [-59, -48]\n\nFreeway 2: (48, 37, right, 12) — head=48, tail=37, span [37,48]\n\nSimilarly for 3,4,5 same as 2? No, freeway 3,4,5 also (48,37,right,12), but freeway 6 has two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nAll cars are right-moving, no left-moving. That might simplify things.\n\nNow, since all are right-moving, for each car, at time t, the span is [τ + s(t - t₁), h + s(t - t₁)] where τ and h are from the state at t₁.\n\nt₁ = 24.\n\nI need to find for each freeway and each future turn, whether there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, player is on freeway k, and for that k, there is a car with 0 in [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)]\n\nSince all right-moving, span is [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)]\n\nAnd collision if 0 is in that interval, i.e., τ + s(T - t₁) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T - t₁)\n\nSince τ ≤ h for right-moving.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at t=24. y=0 is not a freeway, freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0, no cars, so safe. But the goal is to reach y=9, which is also not a freeway, so no cars there either. But to get to y=9, the player needs to move through y=1 to 8.\n\nPlayer position: at turn T, y_T, and action a_T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, player is on y_T, and we check collision for that y_T at turn T.\n\nThen after action, at turn T+1, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nStart: turn t₁=24, position (0,0). So at turn 24, y=0, no freeway, so no collision possible. Safe.\n\nNow, I need to get to y=9.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1, so to go from y=0 to y=9, minimum H=9 turns if moving up every turn, but might need to avoid collisions.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t=24 to t=24+H-1, we have H actions: a_{24} to a_{24+H-1}, and after H turns, at turn 24+H, position should be (0,9)? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, position is y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t + H, we are at y_{t+H}.\n\nWe want y_{t+H} = 9.\n\nt is t₁=24.\n\nSo we want y_{24 + H} = 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from a_{24} to a_{24+H-1}, which determine y_{25} to y_{24+H}.\n\ny_{24} is given as 0.\n\nAfter first action a_{24}, y_{25} = y_{24} + Δy_{24}\n\nAfter second action a_{25}, y_{26} = y_{25} + Δy_{25}, and so on, up to after action a_{24+H-1}, y_{24+H} = y_{24+H-1} + Δy_{24+H-1}\n\nSet y_{24+H} = 9.\n\ny_{24} = 0.\n\nThe change: each Δy is -1,0,+1, so to go from 0 to 9, net +9, so minimum H if all +1, but since y must stay in [0,9], and we start at 0, we can only go up or stay, no need to go down probably, but might need to stay to avoid collision.\n\nBut down is possible, but from 0, down to -1 not allowed, y>=0, so from y=0, cannot go down, only S or U.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, cannot go up.\n\nBut we start at y=0, want to reach y=9.\n\nNow, the path must avoid being on a freeway y=1 to 8 at a turn when for that freeway, a car has 0 in its span.\n\nFirst, I need to compute for each freeway k=1 to 8, for each possible turn T >=24, whether at that turn, there is a collision risk, i.e., if player is on y=k at turn T, would they collide.\n\nBut the collision depends on the car positions at turn T.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, but we only care at integer turns.\n\nt is turn number, discrete.\n\nt₁=24.\n\nFor each car, and for each T, we can compute if 0 is in the span at T.\n\nThen for each freeway k, we can find the set of turns T where it is unsafe to be on y=k.\n\nBecause if at turn T, for freeway k, there is a car with 0 in span, then if player is on y=k at turn T, collision.\n\nIf no car for that k, or no car has 0 in span at T, then safe.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right, speed s=3.\n\nAt time T, span: [τ + s(T-24), h + s(T-24)] = [-59 + 3(T-24), -48 + 3(T-24)]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 3(T-24) <= 0 <= -48 + 3(T-24)\n\nSet δ = T - 24, time offset.\n\nSo for δ >=0, span: [-59 + 3δ, -48 + 3δ]\n\n0 in [-59+3δ, -48+3δ] iff -59+3δ <= 0 and 0 <= -48+3δ? No.\n\n0 in [L,R] means L <= 0 <= R.\n\nSo L <= 0 and 0 <= R.\n\nThus:\n\n-59 + 3δ <= 0  and  0 <= -48 + 3δ\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 3δ <= 0 => 3δ <= 59 => δ <= 59/3 ≈ 19.666, so δ <= 19 since δ integer? δ = T-24, integer.\n\nT turn, integer, so δ integer >=0.\n\n-59 + 3δ <= 0 => 3δ <= 59 => δ <= 59/3 = 19 + 2/3, so δ <= 19\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 + 3δ => 48 <= 3δ => δ >= 48/3 = 16\n\nSo both: δ >=16 and δ <=19\n\nThus for δ=16,17,18,19\n\nT = 24 + δ, so T=40,41,42,43\n\nFor freeway 1, unsafe at T=40,41,42,43\n\nNow freeway 2: one car (48,37,right,12)\n\nh=48, τ=37, s=12\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(T-24), h + s(T-24)] = [37 + 12δ, 48 + 12δ] where δ=T-24\n\n0 in [37+12δ, 48+12δ]\n\nL=37+12δ >0 for all δ>=0, since 37>0, and increasing, so L >=37>0, so 0 < L <=0 false, 0 cannot be in [L,R] since L>0.\n\nSimilarly, R=48+12δ>0.\n\nSo 0 not in span for any δ, since min of L is 37>0.\n\nThus freeway 2 is always safe, no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same car? (48,37,right,12), identical to freeway 2? But freeway 3 has same, so also always safe.\n\nFreeway 4: same, always safe.\n\nFreeway 5: same, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) same as above, span [37+12δ,48+12δ], min 37>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12) head=0, tail=-11, s=12\n\nDirection right, so span [τ + sδ, h + sδ] = [-11 + 12δ, 0 + 12δ] = [-11 + 12δ, 12δ]\n\n0 in span if L <=0 <= R, so -11 +12δ <=0 and 0 <=12δ\n\nFirst: -11+12δ <=0 => 12δ <=11 => δ <= 11/12 <1, so δ=0\n\nSecond: 0 <=12δ, always true for δ>=0\n\nδ=0: at δ=0, T=24, span [-11,0], 0 is included? L=-11, R=0, so [ -11, 0 ], 0 is the right endpoint, so 0 <=0 is true, so yes, 0 in span at δ=0.\n\nBut δ=0 is T=24.\n\nFor freeway 6, at T=24, this car has span [-11,0] at T=24? Let's see.\n\nAt T=24, δ=0, span for this car: [τ + s*0, h + s*0] = [-11, 0]\n\nNow, is 0 in [-11,0]? Yes, since -11 <= 0 <= 0.\n\nSo at T=24, for freeway 6, there is a car with 0 in span.\n\nBut player is at y=0 at T=24, which is not freeway 6, freeway 6 is y=6.\n\nAt T=24, player is on y=0, not on any freeway, so no collision.\n\nBut for the freeway itself, at T=24, if player were on y=6, they would collide, but they are not.\n\nFor safety: for freeway 6, at which T is it unsafe.\n\n0 in span for second car: [-11 +12δ, 12δ]\n\nL <=0 <= R: -11+12δ <=0 and 0<=12δ\n\n-11+12δ <=0 => 12δ <=11 => δ <= 11/12 <1, so δ=0\n\n0<=12δ always for δ>=0\n\nSo only at δ=0, T=24.\n\nFor other δ, L = -11+12δ, for δ=1, L=-11+12=1>0, so [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for δ>1, L larger.\n\nSo only at T=24, freeway 6 is unsafe, but since T=24 is current turn, and player not on it, for future, T>24, freeway 6 is safe, no collision possible.\n\nNow the first car on freeway 6 is same as before, always safe.\n\nSo freeway 6 unsafe only at T=24, which is past, so for T>24, safe.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,6) head=-48, tail=-59, s=6, right.\n\nSpan: [τ + sδ, h + sδ] = [-59 + 6δ, -48 + 6δ]\n\n0 in span if -59+6δ <=0 and 0 <= -48+6δ\n\nFirst: -59+6δ <=0 => 6δ <=59 => δ <= 59/6 ≈9.833, so δ <=9\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +6δ => 48 <=6δ => δ >= 48/6 =8\n\nSo δ >=8 and δ <=9\n\nThus δ=8,9\n\nT=24+8=32, 24+9=33\n\nUnsafe at T=32,33\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: (0,-11,right,6) head=0, tail=-11, s=6\n\nSpan: [-11 +6δ, 0 +6δ] = [-11+6δ, 6δ]\n\n0 in span: -11+6δ <=0 and 0 <=6δ\n\nFirst: -11+6δ <=0 => 6δ <=11 => δ <=11/6≈1.833, so δ<=1\n\nSecond: 0<=6δ always for δ>=0\n\nSo for δ=0 and δ=1\n\nδ=0: T=24, span [-11,0], 0 in\n\nδ=1: T=25, span [-11+6, 6] = [-5,6], 0 in [-5,6] yes.\n\nδ=2: span [-11+12,12]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for second car, unsafe at T=24 and T=25.\n\nBut T=24 is now, player not on it.\n\nFor freeway 7, unsafe when either car has 0 in span.\n\nAt T=24: both cars? First car at δ=0: span [-59,-48], 0 not in, since -59<=0<=-48 false, 0>-48.\n\n-48<0? -48 is negative, 0 not <= -48? R=-48<0, so 0 > R, not <= R, so 0 not in [-59,-48].\n\nSecond car at T=24: unsafe.\n\nAt T=25, δ=1:\n\nFirst car: span [-59+6, -48+6] = [-53,-42], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: span [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nSo unsafe.\n\nAt T=32, δ=8:\n\nFirst car: span [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nSecond car: δ=8, span [-11+48,48] = [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe due to first car.\n\nSimilarly T=33, δ=9: first car span [-59+54, -48+54]=[-5,6], 0 in; second car [43,54], 0 not in.\n\nUnsafe.\n\nNow for other T, say T=26, δ=2: first car [-59+12,-48+12]=[-47,-36], 0 not; second car [1,12], 0 not; safe.\n\nSimilarly, only unsafe at T=25,32,33 for freeway 7.\n\nT=25: unsafe, T=32,33 unsafe.\n\nT=24 also but past.\n\nNow freeway 8: same as freeway 7, cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nSo identical to freeway 7, unsafe at same turns: T=25,32,33\n\nT=25: from above, for freeway 7 and 8.\n\nNow summarize unsafe turns for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at T=40,41,42,43\n\nFreeway 2: always safe\n\nFreeway 3: always safe\n\nFreeway 4: always safe\n\nFreeway 5: always safe\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe only at T=24, so for future safe\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at T=25,32,33\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=25,32,33\n\nNow, the player starts at turn 24, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn T.\n\nMinimum turns: if we go up every turn, from y=0 to y=9 in 9 moves: actions at t=24 to 32, y at t=25 to 33: y_{25}=1, y_{26}=2, ..., y_{33}=9.\n\nt=24: y=0\n\nAfter a_{24}: y_{25} = y_{24} + Δy, if U, y_{25}=1\n\nAfter a_{25}: y_{26} = y_{25} + Δy, etc.\n\nTo reach y_{24+H} =9.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{24+H} =9.\n\ny_{24} =0.\n\nIf all U, then after k up moves, y_{24+k} = k.\n\nSet k=9, y_{33}=9.\n\nSo actions from a_{24} to a_{32}, H=9 turns.\n\nNow, y during the path: at turn T, y_T for T=24 to 33.\n\nT=24: y=0, safe, not freeway.\n\nT=25: y_{25}, could be 1 if moved up, or 0 if stayed.\n\nBut we need to go to 9, so probably move up.\n\nIf at T=25, y=1, freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1 unsafe only at T=40-43, not at 25, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1 safe at T=25.\n\nNow, in the all-up path:\n\nT=25: y=1, freeway 1, safe\n\nT=26: y=2, freeway 2, always safe\n\nT=27: y=3, freeway 3, safe\n\nT=28: y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\nT=29: y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\nT=30: y=6, freeway 6, which is safe for T>24, so safe\n\nT=31: y=7, freeway 7\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe at T=25,32,33. T=31 not unsafe, so should be safe.\n\nT=32: y=8, freeway 8, unsafe at T=32? Freeway 8 unsafe at T=32,33.\n\nIn this path, at T=32, y=8, and freeway 8 unsafe at T=32, so collision!\n\nT=33: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nBut at T=32, y=8, freeway 8, and unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 unsafe at T=32,33, but at T=31, y=7, freeway 7, which is safe since unsafe only at 25,32,33, 31 not listed.\n\nBut T=32, y=8 is problem.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nt=24: y=0, safe\n\na_{24}=U, then y_{25}=1\n\nt=25: y=1, freeway 1, safe (since unsafe only later)\n\na_{25}=U, y_{26}=2\n\nt=26: y=2, freeway 2, safe\n\na_{26}=U, y_{27}=3\n\nt=27: y=3, freeway 3, safe\n\na_{27}=U, y_{28}=4\n\nt=28: y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\na_{28}=U, y_{29}=5\n\nt=29: y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\na_{29}=U, y_{30}=6\n\nt=30: y=6, freeway 6, safe (as T=30>24)\n\na_{30}=U, y_{31}=7\n\nt=31: y=7, freeway 7\n\nNow, freeway 7 unsafe at T=25,32,33. T=31 not unsafe, so safe.\n\na_{31}=U, y_{32}=8\n\nt=32: y=8, freeway 8, unsafe at T=32, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nThen after, if continue, a_{32}=U, y_{33}=9, but at t=32 collision, so cannot.\n\nSo all-up path has collision at T=32 on y=8.\n\nSimilarly, at T=33, if we reach earlier or later.\n\nBut in min H, we need to avoid this.\n\nNow, freeway 8 also unsafe at T=33, so if we delay, might hit that.\n\nBut let's see options.\n\nFirst, we need to be not on y=8 at T=32 or T=33.\n\nSimilarly, not on y=7 at T=32 or T=33? Freeway 7 unsafe at T=32,33, so not on y=7 at T=32 or T=33.\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe at T=32 and T=33, meaning if on y=7 at those turns, collision.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8 unsafe at same turns.\n\nNow, in the direct path, we are on y=8 at T=32, which is bad.\n\nWe can try to stay at some point to avoid being on the unsafe freeway at unsafe times.\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=8 at a different time, not 32 or 33.\n\nBut since we are moving up, y increases, so we pass each y only once, at a specific turn.\n\nUnless we stay or move down, but moving down might not help since we need to go up.\n\nWe can stay at some y to delay.\n\nFor instance, stay at y=6 or y=7 for some turns.\n\nBut y=6 is freeway 6, which is always safe after T=24.\n\ny=7 freeway 7, unsafe only at T=25,32,33. T=25 is early, so for later, safe except at 32,33.\n\nSimilarly y=8 unsafe at 32,33.\n\nNow, the unsafe times for y=7 and y=8 are both at T=32 and 33.\n\nTo avoid, we need to be not on y=7 or y=8 at T=32 and T=33.\n\nSince we are going up, we will be on each y from 1 to 8 at some turn.\n\nLet t_k be the turn when we are on y=k for the first time, but we might stay multiple turns.\n\nLet the turn when we arrive at y=k.\n\nDefine the turn when player is on y=k.\n\nFor each k, the player will be on y=k for one or more consecutive turns, depending on actions.\n\nTo minimize H, we probably don't want to stay unnecessarily, but to avoid, we might need to.\n\nThe critical part is around y=7 and 8 at T=32,33.\n\nWe need to ensure that at T=32 and T=33, player is not on y=7 or y=8.\n\nSince y=7 and 8 are adjacent, and we need to pass through them.\n\nPossible to be on y=6 or y=9 at those times.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\ny=6 safe.\n\nSo, for example, if we can be on y=6 at T=32 and T=33, or on y=9.\n\nBut to be on y=9, we need to have reached before, but y=9 is the goal.\n\nLet's list the turns.\n\nSuppose we start at T=24, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 by some turn.\n\nMinimum time: if we go directly, arrive at y=9 at T=33 as above, but collision at T=32.\n\nTo avoid, we can arrive earlier or later.\n\nIf we go faster, but we can only move one step per turn, so cannot go faster than one y per turn.\n\nMaximum speed is one up per turn, so from y=0 to y=9, minimum 9 actions, 9 turns later, y_{33}=9 if start moving at T=24.\n\ny_{24}=0\n\nAfter 1st action U at T=24, y_{25}=1\n\nAfter 2nd U, y_{26}=2\n\n...\n\nAfter 9th U at T=32, y_{33}=9\n\nSo earliest possible arrival at y=9 is T=33.\n\nBut at T=32, y=8, which is unsafe if on freeway 8 at T=32.\n\nAt T=33, y=9, safe.\n\nBut collision at T=32.\n\nTo avoid, we need not to be on y=8 at T=32.\n\nSimilarly, not on y=7 at T=32 or 33, but in direct path at T=31 y=7, which is safe since T=31 not unsafe for y=7.\n\nOnly T=32 and 33 unsafe for y=7 and 8.\n\nIn direct path, at T=32 y=8, unsafe.\n\nWe can delay being on y=8.\n\nFor example, stay at y=7 for an extra turn.\n\nOr stay at y=6.\n\nLet's see.\n\nFirst, suppose we want to reach y=9 at T=34 or later.\n\nBut that might not be minimal, since H would be larger.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=24 to t=24+H-1 actions, position at t=24+H.\n\nIf we reach at T=33, H=9.\n\nIf later, H>9.\n\nBut we might reach at T=33 with different path.\n\nIn direct up, we are forced to be on y=8 at T=32 for arrival at T=33.\n\nUnless we can be on y=8 earlier or later.\n\nBut earlier: if we go faster, cannot.\n\nLater: by staying longer at lower y.\n\nFor example, stay at y=6 for one turn.\n\nThen:\n\nStart: t=24, y=0\n\na_{24}=U, y_{25}=1\n\nt=25: y=1, safe\n\na_{25}=U, y_{26}=2\n\nt=26: y=2, safe\n\na_{26}=U, y_{27}=3\n\nt=27: y=3, safe\n\na_{27}=U, y_{28}=4\n\nt=28: y=4, safe\n\na_{28}=U, y_{29}=5\n\nt=29: y=5, safe\n\na_{29}=U, y_{30}=6\n\nt=30: y=6, safe\n\nNow, instead of moving up immediately, we stay: a_{30}=S, then y_{31}=6 (still y=6)\n\nt=31: y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nThen a_{31}=U, y_{32}=7\n\nt=32: y=7, freeway 7\n\nNow, freeway 7 unsafe at T=32, collision!\n\nBecause T=32 is unsafe for y=7.\n\nThen a_{32}=U, y_{33}=8, but at t=32 collision already.\n\nWorse.\n\nIf we stay at y=6 at t=30, then at t=31 y=6, then a_{31}=U, y_{32}=7, t=32 y=7 unsafe.\n\nCollision.\n\nSuppose we stay at y=5 or something.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 and y=8 both unsafe at T=32 and 33, we can be on y=9 at T=32 or T=33, but to be on y=9 at T=32, we need to arrive earlier.\n\nEarliest at y=9 is T=33, as above.\n\ny_{33}=9 only if we moved up each turn from 24 to 32.\n\nCannot be at y=9 before T=33.\n\nSo at T=32, we cannot be at y=9.\n\nThe only safe positions at T=32 and 33 are y<=6 or y=9, but y=9 not possible at T=32.\n\nAt T=32, safe y: y=0 to 6 or y=9, but y=9 not reachable.\n\ny=0 to 6: freeways 1-6, which are safe at T=32.\n\nFreeway 1 unsafe only at T=40-43, so at T=32 safe.\n\nFreeway 2-5 always safe.\n\nFreeway 6 safe for T>24.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 safe.\n\nBut at T=32, if we are at y=6, for example, then we can move up later.\n\nSimilarly, at T=33, if we are at y=9, safe.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 at T=34, for example.\n\nThen H=10 turns.\n\nBut let's see if we can do with H=9.\n\nWith H=9, we must be at y=9 at T=33.\n\nAnd we must have been at y=8 at some point, but at T=32, y=8 is unsafe, so we need to be at y=8 at a different turn.\n\nBut with fixed speed, from y=0 to y=9 in 9 moves, we must be at y=k at T=24+k for k=0 to 9? Let's see.\n\nAt T=24, y=0\n\nT=25, y=1 if move up\n\nT=26, y=2\n\n...\n\nT=33, y=9\n\nSo at T=32, y must be 8, because to be at y=9 at T=33, we must have been at y=8 at T=32 and moved up.\n\nIf we stayed at some point, we would arrive later.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=j for one turn, then y at T=25 to T=33 would not be 1 to 9 consecutively.\n\nSuppose at some point we stay, say at y=5 for two turns.\n\nThen, for instance:\n\nT=24: y=0\n\na24=U, T=25: y=1\n\na25=U, T=26: y=2\n\na26=U, T=27: y=3\n\na27=U, T=28: y=4\n\na28=U, T=29: y=5\n\nThen a29=S, T=30: y=5 (still)\n\nThen a30=U, T=31: y=6\n\na31=U, T=32: y=7\n\na32=U, T=33: y=8\n\nBut we need y=9 at T=33? No, at T=33 y=8, not 9.\n\nThen to reach y=9, we need another action: a33=U, T=34: y=9\n\nSo H=10 actions from t=24 to t=33, position at t=34.\n\nSimilarly, y at T=32 is 7, which is unsafe if T=32, freeway 7 unsafe.\n\nIn this case T=32 y=7, collision.\n\nIf we stay at lower y.\n\nSuppose we stay at y=6.\n\nT=24: y=0\n\na24=U, T=25: y=1\n\na25=U, T=26: y=2\n\na26=U, T=27: y=3\n\na27=U, T=28: y=4\n\na28=U, T=29: y=5\n\na29=U, T=30: y=6\n\na30=S, T=31: y=6\n\na31=U, T=32: y=7 — unsafe at T=32\n\nCollision.\n\na31=S, T=32: y=6, safe, but then need to move up.\n\na32=U, T=33: y=7 — at T=33, y=7, freeway 7 unsafe at T=33, collision.\n\nThen a33=U, T=34: y=8, but at T=33 collision, and also T=34 y=8, freeway 8 unsafe at T=32,33? T=34 not unsafe, but we had collision earlier.\n\nNot good.\n\nTo avoid being on y=7 or 8 at T=32 and 33, we need to be below or above.\n\nAbove not possible, so below.\n\nSuppose at T=32 and T=33, we are at y=6.\n\nThen from there, we can move up to y=9.\n\nBut to be at y=6 at T=32, we need to have reached y=6 by T=32 or earlier.\n\nFor example, reach y=6 at T=30, then stay at T=31 and T=32.\n\nThen at T=32, y=6, safe.\n\nThen a32=U, T=33: y=7\n\nBut T=33, y=7, freeway 7 unsafe at T=33, collision.\n\nIf at T=33 we are at y=6, then a33=U, T=34: y=7, but T=34 not unsafe, so safe, then continue.\n\nBut let's plan the turns.\n\nStart: T=24, y=0\n\nWe need to be at y=6 by T=30 or so.\n\nAssume we move up directly to y=6.\n\na24=U, T=25: y=1\n\na25=U, T=26: y=2\n\na26=U, T=27: y=3\n\na27=U, T=28: y=4\n\na28=U, T=29: y=5\n\na29=U, T=30: y=6\n\nNow, at T=30: y=6\n\nWe want to stay here for some turns to avoid T=32,33 on y=7 or 8.\n\nSpecifically, we need to not be on y=7 or 8 at T=32 and T=33.\n\nSo if we stay at y=6 until T=32, then:\n\na30=S, T=31: y=6\n\na31=S, T=32: y=6\n\nAt T=32: y=6, safe\n\nThen a32=U, T=33: y=7\n\nBut at T=33, y=7, and freeway 7 unsafe at T=33, collision.\n\nIf we move up at T=32 to y=7, still at T=33 y=7 if we stay, but we move up.\n\nAt T=33, if y=7, collision.\n\nTo avoid, we need to be not on y=7 at T=33.\n\nSo at T=33, we could be at y=6 or y=8 or y=9.\n\nBut if we are at y=6 at T=33, then we can move up later.\n\nBut for min H, we want to reach y=9 soon.\n\nSet T=33 at y=6, then a33=U, T=34: y=7\n\nT=34: y=7, now T=34, freeway 7 unsafe only at T=32,33, so at T=34 safe.\n\nThen a34=U, T=35: y=8\n\nT=35: y=8, freeway 8 unsafe at T=32,33, not at 35, safe.\n\nThen a35=U, T=36: y=9, goal.\n\nBut H=12 actions? Let's count.\n\nActions from t=24 to t=35, that's 12 actions, position at t=36.\n\nH is the number of turns, so actions at t=24 to t=24+H-1, position at t=24+H.\n\nHere, to reach y=9 at T=36, so 24+H=36, H=12.\n\nBut earlier with no stay, H=9 but collision. With this, H=12, larger.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nTo reach at T=34, for example.\n\nBut at T=34, we can be at y=9 only if we moved faster, impossible.\n\nEarliest y=9 at T=33.\n\nSo with H=9, it seems impossible to avoid collision because we must be at y=8 at T=32, which is unsafe.\n\nUnless we can be at y=8 at a different time, but we can't with the path.\n\nPerhaps move down at some point, but from y=0, we can't move down, and moving down would delay more.\n\nFor example, at some point move down, but that would make H larger, since we need net +9.\n\nSo probably min H is more than 9.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is a way with H=9.\n\nSuppose at T=32, we are not on y=8, but on y=7 or something, but to be at y=9 at T=33, we must be at y=8 at T=32 and move up.\n\nIf at T=32 we are at y=7, and we move up to y=8 at T=33, but at T=33 y=8 is unsafe.\n\nAnd we need y=9 at T=33, not possible.\n\nSo indeed, with H=9, we must have:\n\nAt T=32: y=8\n\nAt T=33: y=9\n\nBut at T=32, y=8, freeway 8, unsafe, collision.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach y=9 at T=33 without being on y=8 at T=32, which is fatal.\n\nThus, min H cannot be 9; we need more turns.\n\nNow, what is the minimal H.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at T>33.\n\nEarliest possible T=34, but to be at y=9 at T=34, we must be at y=8 at T=33 and move up.\n\nBut at T=33, y=8 is unsafe for freeway 8.\n\nIf we are at y=8 at T=33, collision.\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=34, we need y_{33}=8, then a_{33}=U, y_{34}=9.\n\nBut at T=33, if y=8, and freeway 8 unsafe at T=33, collision.\n\nSo cannot be on y=8 at T=33.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on y=7 at T=33.\n\nSo for T=34 arrival, we need to be at y=8 at T=33, but unsafe.\n\nIf we are at y=7 at T=33, and move up to y=8 at T=34, but we want y=9 at T=34, so must be at y=8 at T=33 to move to 9 at T=34.\n\nBut T=33 y=8 unsafe.\n\nSo impossible to reach at T=34.\n\nSimilarly, for T=35: to be at y=9 at T=35, we must be at y=8 at T=34 and move up.\n\nAt T=34, y=8, freeway 8 unsafe only at T=32,33, not at 34, so safe.\n\nThen possible.\n\nSimilarly, at T=33, we can be at lower y.\n\nSo let's plan to reach y=9 at T=35.\n\nThen H=11 actions? Position at t=24+H=35, so H=11.\n\nActions from t=24 to t=24+H-1, y at t=24+H.\n\nSet t=24+H=35, so H=11.\n\nActions at t=24 to 34.\n\ny at t=35=9.\n\nNow, we need to be at y=8 at T=34, so that a_{34}=U, y_{35}=9.\n\nAnd at T=34, y=8, freeway 8, safe since unsafe only at 32,33.\n\nSimilarly, at T=33, we need to be at y=7 or less, but not on y=7 if T=33, since unsafe.\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe at T=33.\n\nSo at T=33, we should not be on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, not on y=8.\n\nSo at T=33, we can be on y=6 or below, or y=9, but y=9 not yet.\n\ny=6 safe.\n\nNow, also, at T=32, we should not be on y=7 or 8, so y<=6 or y=9.\n\nNow, let's plan the path to be at safe positions at critical turns.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt T=32: y <=6 or y=9 (impossible)\n\nAt T=33: y <=6 or y=9 (impossible)\n\nSo at both T=32 and T=33, we must be at y<=6.\n\nSince y=6 is safe and convenient.\n\nThen after that, move up to y=9.\n\nNow, from start, we need to reach y=6 by T=32 at latest, but since we stay, we can reach earlier and stay.\n\nTo minimize H, we should move up as much as possible until y=6, then stay at y=6 during T=32 and T=33, then move up.\n\nBut at T=33, if we are at y=6, then we can move up later.\n\nBut let's set the turns.\n\nFirst, move up to y=6 as fast as possible.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=6: need 6 up moves.\n\nStart T=24, y=0\n\na24=U, T=25: y=1\n\na25=U, T=26: y=2\n\na26=U, T=27: y=3\n\na27=U, T=28: y=4\n\na28=U, T=29: y=5\n\na29=U, T=30: y=6\n\nNow, at T=30: y=6\n\nWe need to be at y=6 at T=32 and T=33? Not necessarily, but we need to be at y<=6 at T=32 and T=33.\n\nSince we are at y=6 at T=30, we can stay for two turns: at T=31 and T=32.\n\nThen at T=33, we need to be at y<=6, so we can stay again or move, but if we move, y might be higher.\n\nSo:\n\nAt T=30: y=6\n\na30=S, T=31: y=6\n\na31=S, T=32: y=6  (safe, since y=6 at T=32)\n\nNow at T=32: y=6\n\nNow, for T=33, we need y<=6, so we can stay: a32=S, T=33: y=6\n\nThen at T=33: y=6, safe.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9 from here.\n\na33=U, T=34: y=7\n\nNow T=34: y=7, freeway 7, unsafe at T=32,33? T=34 not, so safe.\n\na34=U, T=35: y=8\n\nT=35: y=8, freeway 8, unsafe only at 32,33, T=35 safe.\n\na35=U, T=36: y=9, goal.\n\nBut we reached at T=36, so H=12 actions? Actions from t=24 to t=35, 12 actions, position at t=36.\n\nt=24 to t=35 inclusive is 12 turns? Let's index.\n\nt=24: start, no action yet? The actions are from t=24 to t=24+H-1.\n\nAt turn t, we perform action a_t, then position updates to y_{t+1}.\n\nIn the sequence: at turn t, we are at position y_t, then choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nFor turn t=24, position given (0,0), so y_{24}=0.\n\nThen we choose a_{24}, which sets y_{25}.\n\nThen at turn t=25, position y_{25}, choose a_{25}, sets y_{26}, etc.\n\nAfter H actions, we have set y_{25} to y_{24+H}, and we want y_{24+H} =9.\n\nThe last action is a_{24+H-1}, which sets y_{24+H}.\n\nIn the above, with actions:\n\na24: U, y25=1\n\na25: U, y26=2\n\na26: U, y27=3\n\na27: U, y28=4\n\na28: U, y29=5\n\na29: U, y30=6\n\na30: S, y31=6\n\na31: S, y32=6\n\na32: S, y33=6  (since a32=S, y33=y32=6)\n\nThen a33: U, y34=7\n\na34: U, y35=8\n\na35: U, y36=9\n\nSo y36=9, so 24+H=36, H=12.\n\nBut we can reduce H by not staying so long.\n\nWe only need to be safe at T=32 and T=33, but we stayed from T=30 to T=33 at y=6, which is 4 turns at y=6, but we arrived at T=30.\n\nWe can arrive at y=6 later.\n\nFor example, move slower to y=6.\n\nBut to minimize H, we should move fast to y=6, then stay only during the unsafe period.\n\nUnsafe for y=7 and 8 at T=32 and 33.\n\nSo we need to be not on them at those turns.\n\nBut since we are at y=6 before, we can stay at y=6 during T=32 and T=33.\n\nT=32 and T=33 are specific turns.\n\nAt T=32, we need to be on y<=6.\n\nAt T=33, on y<=6.\n\nSo we can be on y=6 at both turns.\n\nNow, the turn we reach y=6.\n\nIf we reach y=6 at T=30, as above, then we stay at T=31 and T=32 to be at y=6 at T=32.\n\nThen at T=33, if we stay, y=6, or we can move up, but to y=7, which is unsafe at T=33.\n\nSo we must stay at y=6 at T=33 as well.\n\nThen move up after.\n\nBut T=33 is late.\n\nWe can reach y=6 at a later turn.\n\nFor example, suppose we reach y=6 at T=31.\n\nThen:\n\nHow to reach y=6 at T=31.\n\nFrom y=0 at T=24, to y=6 at T=31, that takes 7 turns? Let's see.\n\nT=24: y=0\n\nAfter a24, y25: if U, y25=1\n\nT=25: y=1\n\nAfter a25, y26: if U, y26=2\n\n...\n\nTo be at y=6 at T=31, that means at turn T=31, position y=6.\n\nWhich means that y_{31} =6.\n\ny_{31} = y_{30} + Δy_{30}\n\ny_{30} = y_{29} + Δy_{29}, etc.\n\nFrom y_{24}=0 to y_{31}=6, net change +6 in 7 steps (from t=24 to t=31 is 7 turns, but positions from y24 to y31).\n\ny24=0\n\ny31=6\n\nNumber of steps: 7 actions from a24 to a30 determine y25 to y31.\n\nAfter a24, y25\n\nAfter a25, y26\n\n...\n\nAfter a30, y31\n\nSo to have y31=6, with y24=0, net +6, so we need exactly 6 up moves and one stay (or other, but since we can't go down from 0, only S or U).\n\nWith 6 U and 1 S in some order.\n\nBut to reach faster, we should do U as much as possible.\n\nFor example, if we do 6 U and one S, y31=6, but we can have y31=6 with fewer actions if we move faster, but impossible, min 6 actions to go to y=6.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=6, min 6 actions: a24 to a29 U, then y30=6.\n\nThen at T=30, y=6.\n\nIf we want y31=6, we can stay at T=30: a30=S, y31=6.\n\nSimilarly, to have y31=6, it could be that we reached earlier and stayed.\n\nBut to minimize total H, for reaching y=9, we should not stay before necessary.\n\nBack to the plan.\n\nWe need to be at y=6 at T=32 and T=33 for safety? No, we need to be at y<=6 at those turns, but y=6 is fine.\n\nAt T=32 and T=33, position y=6.\n\nThen after, move up to y=9.\n\nNow, to be at y=6 at T=32, that means y32=6.\n\nSimilarly, y33=6 if we stay.\n\ny32=6 means that at turn T=32, we are on y=6.\n\nWhich requires that we have reached y=6 by T=32 or earlier.\n\nSimilarly for T=33.\n\nNow, the earliest we can reach y=6 is at T=30, with 6 up moves: a24 U to a29 U, y30=6.\n\nThen to have y32=6, we can stay at T=30 and T=31: a30=S, y31=6; a31=S, y32=6.\n\nThen for T=33, we need y33=6, so a32=S, y33=6.\n\nThen from there, a33=U, y34=7\n\na34=U, y35=8\n\na35=U, y36=9\n\nSo T=36, H=12.\n\nBut we can be at y=6 later.\n\nFor example, reach y=6 at T=31.\n\nHow: with 6 actions including one stay.\n\nFor example: do 5 U and one S between.\n\nBut to reach y=6 at T=31, we need to have taken 6 net up moves in the 7 actions from a24 to a30.\n\ny31 is set by a30.\n\ny31 = y30 + Δy30\n\nBut y30 depends on previous.\n\nThe position y_t for t>24.\n\ny_t = y24 + sum_{k=24}^{t-1} Δy_k\n\ny_t = 0 + sum of Δy from k=24 to k=t-1\n\nFor y31, it depends on actions from a24 to a30.\n\ny31 = Δy24 + Δy25 + ... + Δy30\n\nEach Δy is 0 or 1, since we move up or stay, no down.\n\ny31 = number of U in a24 to a30.\n\nSimilarly, to have y31=6, we need exactly 6 U in the 7 actions a24 to a30.\n\nSimilarly, for y32, it depends on a24 to a31.\n\nBut we want y32=6.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo have y32=6, with min actions.\n\nBut we also need to reach y=9.\n\nSince we have to be at y=6 at T=32, and T=32 is later than T=30, we can move slower to y=6.\n\nFor example, we can have some stays earlier to delay the arrival at higher y.\n\nBut that might increase H.\n\nThe critical point is that at T=32 and T=33, we must be at low y.\n\nThe turns T=32 and T=33 are fixed, so we need to spend those turns at y<=6.\n\nThen from there, we need 3 more moves to y=9.\n\nNow, from start to reach a low y by T=32.\n\nThe lowest we can be is y=0, but we need to go up.\n\nTo minimize H, we should be as high as possible at T=32, but safe, so y=6.\n\nSimilarly at T=33.\n\nSo let's set y32=6 and y33=6.\n\nThen from there, move up: a33=U, y34=7\n\na34=U, y35=8\n\na35=U, y36=9\n\nSo reach at T=36.\n\nNow, how to have y32=6.\n\ny32 is the position at turn T=32.\n\ny32 = sum of Δy from k=24 to k=31, since y32 = y24 + sum_{k=24}^{31} Δy_k? Let's see.\n\ny24 = 0\n\ny25 = y24 + Δy24\n\ny26 = y25 + Δy25 = y24 + Δy24 + Δy25\n\n...\n\ny_t = y24 + sum_{i=24}^{t-1} Δy_i\n\nFor t=32, y32 = 0 + sum_{i=24}^{31} Δy_i\n\nEach Δy_i = 0 or 1, so y32 = number of U in actions from a24 to a31.\n\nSimilarly, y32=6, so in 8 actions (a24 to a31), we have 6 U and 2 S.\n\nSimilarly, for y33, y33 = y32 + Δy32\n\nIf we set y33=6, then Δy32=0, so a32=S.\n\nThen y33=6.\n\nThen actions.\n\nNow, the actions before: from a24 to a31, we need 6 U and 2 S.\n\nWe can place the S actions to avoid being on unsafe freeways at other times, but since freeways 1-6 are safe except at specific times, but for y=1, unsafe only at T=40-43, which is late, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo we can do U as much as possible, but with two S.\n\nFor example, do S at some early point or late.\n\nBut to reach y=6 faster, but we need y32=6, so we can have the S early.\n\nFor min H, it doesn't matter, since we are fixed at y32=6.\n\nH will be the same.\n\nActions: a24 to a31: 8 actions, with 6 U and 2 S.\n\nThen a32: S, to keep y33=6\n\nThen a33: U, y34=7\n\na34: U, y35=8\n\na35: U, y36=9\n\nSo actions from a24 to a35, that's 12 actions.\n\nPosition at t=36.\n\nBut we can reduce by not staying at y=6 at T=33.\n\nAt T=33, we only need to be at y<=6, not necessarily 6.\n\nAnd we can move up from there.\n\nFor example, at T=32, we are at y=6.\n\nThen at T=32, we can choose to move up or stay.\n\nBut at T=33, if we move up to y=7, but T=33 y=7 unsafe, so we cannot be on y=7 at T=33.\n\nSo we must stay at y=6 or below at T=33.\n\nSo if at T=32 y=6, we must do S to stay at y=6 for T=33.\n\nCannot move up.\n\nSimilarly, if we were at lower y, we could move to y=6, but not higher.\n\nSo we must be at y=6 at both T=32 and T=33 to be safe.\n\nThen move up after.\n\nSo H=12 seems necessary.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach y=9 earlier by being at higher y at T=34.\n\nFor example, if at T=33 we are at y=6, then a33=U, y34=7\n\nT=34: y=7, safe (since T=34 not unsafe)\n\na34=U, y35=8\n\nT=35: y=8, safe\n\na35=U, y36=9\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf at T=33 we are at y=5, for example, then we need more moves.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo minimal H is 12.\n\nBut perhaps we can be at y=6 at T=32, but at T=33, we can be at y=6, but we don't need to stay; we can be at lower, but no benefit.\n\nAnother idea: since freeway 7 and 8 are only unsafe at T=32 and 33, at other times safe, so we can be on them at other turns.\n\nFor example, we can be on y=7 at T=31, which is safe, as before.\n\nThen at T=32, we need to not be on y=7, so we must move away.\n\nBut from y=7, we can move down to y=6 or up to y=8, but at T=32, y=8 is unsafe, so only move down to y=6.\n\nThen at T=32, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=33, we are at y=6, safe.\n\nThen move up.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nSuppose we reach y=7 at T=31.\n\nHow: from start, move up to y=7.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=7, min 7 moves.\n\na24 U, y25=1\n\na25 U, y26=2\n\n...\n\na30 U, y31=7\n\nT=31: y=7, freeway 7, safe since unsafe only at 25,32,33; T=31 ok.\n\nNow at T=31, we choose action a31.\n\nIf we move up, a31=U, then y32=8, but at T=32, y=8, unsafe, collision.\n\nIf we move down, a31=D, then y32=6 (since y31=7, D, y32=6)\n\nThen at T=32: y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nThen at T=32, we choose a32.\n\nIf we stay, a32=S, y33=6, safe.\n\nThen a33=U, y34=7, etc.\n\nBut at T=33, y=6, safe.\n\nThen move up: a33=U, y34=7\n\nT=34: y=7, safe\n\na34=U, y35=8\n\nT=35: y=8, safe\n\na35=U, y36=9\n\nReach at T=36, same as before.\n\nIf at T=32, after y32=6, we move up, a32=U, y33=7, but at T=33, y=7, unsafe, collision.\n\nSo we must stay or move down, but moving down not useful.\n\nSo still, we end up with a32=S, y33=6.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nSo no savings.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 12, with arrival at T=36.\n\nBut let's confirm the sequence.\n\nPlayer position must avoid collision at each turn.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nT=24: y=0, safe\n\na24=U\n\nT=25: y=1, freeway 1, safe (unsafe only at 40-43)\n\na25=U\n\nT=26: y=2, freeway 2, safe\n\na26=U\n\nT=27: y=3, freeway 3, safe\n\na27=U\n\nT=28: y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\na28=U\n\nT=29: y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\na29=U\n\nT=30: y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\na30=S\n\nT=31: y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\na31=S\n\nT=32: y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\na32=S\n\nT=33: y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\na33=U\n\nT=34: y=7, freeway 7, safe (T=34 not 32 or 33)\n\na34=U\n\nT=35: y=8, freeway 8, safe (T=35 not 32 or 33)\n\na35=U\n\nT=36: y=9, goal, safe.\n\nAll safe.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=11?\n\nH=11 would mean position at t=24+11=35, y_{35}=9.\n\nThen actions from a24 to a34.\n\ny_{35} =9.\n\nThen y_{34} must be 8, and a34=U.\n\nAt T=34, y=8, freeway 8, safe.\n\ny_{34} = y_{33} + Δy_{33}\n\nTo have y_{34}=8, and y_{35}=9.\n\nAt T=33, y_{33} must be such that after action, y_{34}=8.\n\nIf y_{33}=8, then a33=S, y34=8; or y33=7, a33=U, y34=8; or y33=9, down, but not.\n\nBut y33=9 not possible.\n\nNow, at T=33, if y33=8, freeway 8 unsafe at T=33, collision.\n\nIf y33=7, then a33=U, y34=8, but at T=33, y=7, freeway 7 unsafe at T=33, collision.\n\nIf y33=6, then a33=U, y34=7, then to have y34=7, but we need y34=8 for y35=9 with one up.\n\ny34=7, then a34=U, y35=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y35=9, y34 must be 8 or 9, but y34=9 not possible, so y34=8, a34=U, y35=9.\n\nSo y34 must be 8.\n\nThen y33 must be 7 or 8.\n\nIf y33=7, a33=U, y34=8.\n\nBut at T=33, y=7, unsafe.\n\nIf y33=8, a33=S, y34=8, but at T=33, y=8, unsafe.\n\nSo in both cases, at T=33, we are on y=7 or 8, which is unsafe.\n\nThus impossible to have y34=8 without being on unsafe y at T=33.\n\nTherefore, H=11 is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, H=10 or less worse.\n\nSo minimal H is 12.\n\nNow for the sequence, we need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the above, we have 6 U to reach y=6, but with two S before T=32.\n\nIn the sequence I had:\n\na24 to a29: all U, but that's 6 U, y30=6.\n\nThen a30=S, a31=S, a32=S, a33=U, a34=U, a35=U.\n\nBut a24 to a29 is 6 actions, a30 to a35 is 6 actions, total 12 actions.\n\na24 to a35 is 12 actions.\n\nBut we can place the S actions earlier.\n\nFor example, to have y32=6 with some S earlier.\n\nBut it doesn't change H.\n\nFor instance, suppose we do a24=S, stay at y=0, but y=0 safe, but then we delay, worse for reaching high.\n\nNot better.\n\nOr do S at other points.\n\nBut since no other collisions, we can do all U until y=6, then stay.\n\nIn the sequence, the actions are:\n\nTurn t_1=24: action U\n\nThen position y25=1\n\nTurn 25: U, y26=2\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 29: U, y30=6\n\nThen turn 30: S, y31=6\n\nTurn 31: S, y32=6\n\nTurn 32: S, y33=6\n\nTurn 33: U, y34=7\n\nTurn 34: U, y35=8\n\nTurn 35: U, y36=9\n\nBut turn 35 action a35=U, sets y36=9.\n\nIn terms of answer, we need to list actions from t=24 to t=24+H-1=35, since H=12, actions at t=24 to 35.\n\nt=24 to 35 inclusive is 12 actions.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: S\n\nTurn 31: S\n\nTurn 32: S\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nAfter a35, y36=9.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 24: U Turn 25: U Turn 26: U Turn 27: U Turn 28: U Turn 29: U Turn 30: S Turn 31: S Turn 32: S Turn 33: U Turn 34: U Turn 35: U }\n\nBut let's confirm the number of turns: from Turn 24 to Turn 35, that's 12 turns, H=12.\n\nPosition at turn 36: y=9.\n\nAnd all intermediate positions safe as above.\n\nWe could have different order of S, but this is fine.\n\nIn this, at turn 33, we do U, to y34=7, etc.\n\nBut earlier I thought about being at y=7 at T=31, but with down move, but that might save one turn? No.\n\nIn that case, with down:\n\na24 to a30 U, y31=7\n\nThen a31=D, y32=6\n\nThen a32=S, y33=6\n\nThen a33=U, y34=7\n\na34=U, y35=8\n\na35=U, y36=9\n\nSame H=12, but we have a down move, which might not be necessary, and we were at y=7 then down, but in terms of number, same.\n\nBut in this case, at T=31, we are at y=7, which is safe, no problem.\n\nBut we used a down move, whereas in the first sequence, all moves are U or S, no down.\n\nBut both work, but min H same.\n\nI think the first sequence is simpler.\n\nIn the first sequence, we stayed at y=6 from T=30 to T=33, four turns, but only necessary for T=32 and T=33, but since we reached at T=30, we had to stay.\n\nIf we reach later, but cannot reach later with less actions.\n\nFor example, to be at y=6 at T=31: that requires y31=6.\n\nWith actions a24 to a30: 7 actions, with 6 U and 1 S.\n\nFor example, a24 to a28 U: 5 actions, y29=5\n\nThen a29=S, y30=5\n\na30=U, y31=6\n\nThen at T=31: y=6\n\nThen we need to be at y=6 at T=32 and T=33.\n\nSo a31=S, y32=6\n\na32=S, y33=6\n\nThen a33=U, y34=7\n\na34=U, y35=8\n\na35=U, y36=9\n\nStill H=12, same as before.\n\nNo savings.\n\nThus, minimal H is 12.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nBut in the car states, I think I covered all.\n\nFreeway 1 unsafe at 40-43, but we are not there at that time.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nIn the answer format.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 24\\) is 12, with the sequence of actions starting from turn 24 to turn 35. This sequence ensures the player avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by staying at \\(y = 6\\) during turns 32 and 33, when freeways 7 and 8 are unsafe.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Reasoning:\n- Freeway 1 is unsafe at turns 40, 41, 42, and 43. The player is on freeway 1 at turn 25, which is safe.\n- Freeway 2 is always safe.\n- Freeway 3 is always safe.\n- Freeway 4 is always safe.\n- Freeway 5 is always safe.\n- Freeway 6 is unsafe only at turn 24 (past), so safe for turns 25 and later.\n- Freeway 7 is unsafe at turns 25, 32, and 33. The player is on freeway 7 at turns 31 and 34–35. Turn 31 is safe (not unsafe turn), and turns 34–35 are safe (unsafe only at 32–33).\n- Freeway 8 is unsafe at turns 25, 32, and 33. The player is on freeway 8 at turn 35, which is safe (unsafe only at 32–33).\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- Turns 24 to 29: Move up (U) to reach \\(y = 6\\) by turn 30.\n- Turns 30 to 32: Stay (S) at \\(y = 6\\) to avoid being on freeways 7 or 8 during unsafe turns 32 and 33.\n- Turn 33: Stay (S) at \\(y = 6\\) to remain safe at turn 33.\n- Turns 33 to 35: Move up (U) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 36.\n\nThe position evolves as follows:\n- Turn 24: \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not a freeway)\n- Turn 25: \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1, safe)\n- Turn 26: \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2, safe)\n- Turn 27: \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3, safe)\n- Turn 28: \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4, safe)\n- Turn 29: \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5, safe)\n- Turn 30: \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, safe)\n- Turn 31: \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, safe)\n- Turn 32: \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, safe)\n- Turn 33: \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, safe)\n- Turn 34: \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7, safe)\n- Turn 35: \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8, safe)\n- Turn 36: \\(y = 9\\) (goal, safe, not a freeway)\n\n### Answer:\nThe sequence of actions for turns 24 to 35 is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 24: U \\\\\nTurn 25: U \\\\\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: U \\\\\nTurn 28: U \\\\\nTurn 29: U \\\\\nTurn 30: S \\\\\nTurn 31: S \\\\\nTurn 32: S \\\\\nTurn 33: S \\\\\nTurn 34: U \\\\\nTurn 35: U\n}",

We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nPlayer movement: \n  U: y += 1\n  D: y -= 1\n  S: stay\n\nCollision condition: at turn T, if the player is at freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that exact turn.\n\nImportant note: when moving from freeway y to y' at turn T, at turn T the player is still on freeway y. Then at the next turn, the player moves to freeway y'. So we are only concerned with the freeway we are currently on at each turn.\n\nWe start at (0,0) at turn 30. Since the goal is (0,9), we must go upward. But we must avoid cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe have car data for each freeway (1 to 8). Each freeway may have multiple cars. The update rules for cars:\n\nFor a car at freeway i:\n  Left-moving (d = left): span at turn T = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  Right-moving (d = right): span at turn T = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the given car states are at turn t1=30.\n\nLet me write the car positions at turn T (relative to turn 30, so time elapsed = T - 30).\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n  Since it's right-moving, the head is the larger number? But the given is (head, tail). For right-moving, the head is the front which is the larger x? Actually, the representation is consistent: for right-moving, the head is at a larger x than the tail. But here, head=-48, tail=-59? That would mean tail=-59 and head=-48, so the car is from -59 to -48? And moving right at speed 3.\n\nWait, the representation says: for right-moving, the span at t1 is [tau, h] meaning [tail, head]? Actually, the update rule for right-moving says:\n  Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo at t1 (T=t1), the span is [tau, h]. So for freeway 1: tau=-59, h=-48. So at t1, the car is from -59 to -48.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 6: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12). \n  First car: at t1: [37,48] (because for right-moving, the span is [tail, head] = [37,48]? But wait, the input says (head, tail) = (48,37). So head=48, tail=37? Then the update rule for right-moving: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] = [37 + 12*(T-30), 48 + 12*(T-30)].\n\nBut note: the representation in the table is (head, tail, direction, speed). So for a right-moving car, head is the front (larger x) and tail is the rear (smaller x). So the span is [tail, head] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car, the head would be the front (which is at a smaller x if moving left) but we don't have any left-moving in this problem.\n\nSo let's list for each freeway and each car the span at turn T (T>=30):\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h=-48, tau=-59, d=right, s=3) -> at T: [ -59 + 3*(T-30), -48 + 3*(T-30) ]\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (48,37,right,12) -> [37+12*(T-30), 48+12*(T-30)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2: [37+12*(T-30), 48+12*(T-30)]\n\nFreeway 4: same as 2: [37+12*(T-30), 48+12*(T-30)]\n\nFreeway 5: same as 2: [37+12*(T-30), 48+12*(T-30)]\n\nFreeway 6: two cars:\n  car1: (48,37,right,12) -> [37+12*(T-30), 48+12*(T-30)]\n  car2: (0,-11,right,12) -> [-11+12*(T-30), 0+12*(T-30)] = [12*(T-30)-11, 12*(T-30)]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars:\n  car1: (-48,-59,right,6) -> [-59+6*(T-30), -48+6*(T-30)]\n  car2: (0,-11,right,6) -> [-11+6*(T-30), 0+6*(T-30)]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7: \n  car1: [-59+6*(T-30), -48+6*(T-30)]\n  car2: [-11+6*(T-30), 6*(T-30)]\n\nWe are at turn 30 at (0,0). We must avoid being on a freeway (1-8) when the freeway has a car that has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nWe start at y=0 (which is not a freeway, so safe) and we want to get to y=9 (also not a freeway). The freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) to go from y=0 to y=9, passing through freeways 1 to 8, without being hit by cars.\n\nNote: we can stay at a freeway for multiple turns? But we want minimal H, so we probably want to go up as fast as possible? But we might have to wait (stay) to avoid a car.\n\nSince we start at 0 and must go to 9, the minimal steps without any cars would be 9 steps of U (each step increases y by 1). But we have to avoid cars.\n\nWe are at turn 30: y0 = 0.\n\nAt turn 30, we are at y=0 (safe). Then we can choose an action for turn 30 that will determine y at turn 31.\n\nWe are going to simulate for each turn the player's y and check for collision at the freeways we are on.\n\nWe are going to try to find the minimal H such that we reach y=9 at turn 30+H-1? Let me clarify:\n\nAt turn 30, we are at y=0. Then we take an action at turn 30 that will move us at turn 31 to y1 = y0 + delta.\n\nSo after H actions (from turn 30 to turn 30+H-1), we are at turn 30+H. We want that at turn 30+H-1 we are at y=9? Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t=0 to H-1: so the actions are taken at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. Then the position at the end of these actions is at turn t1+H. But we want the position at turn t1+H-1 to be 9? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". Let me check:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then the last action is at t1+H-1, and then the next state is at turn t1+H. But we want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9)? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nWait, the problem states: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nSo at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). How did we get there? \n\nWe start at turn t1 at (0, y0). Then we take action a_{t1} at turn t1, which moves us to y1 at turn t1+1. Then at turn t1+1, we take action a_{t1+1}, and so on. The last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and after that action, at turn t1+H we are at y_{t1+H}. But we want at turn t1+H-1 to be at (0,9). \n\nWait, no: the position at turn t is y_t. The action at turn t determines the next position at turn t+1.\n\nSo:\n- At turn t1: we are at y_{t1}=0.\n- We take action a_{t1} at turn t1, and then at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + delta(a_{t1}).\n- Then at turn t1+1, we take action a_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nWe want at some turn T = t1+H-1, we have y_T = 9.\n\nBut note: at turn T, we are at y_T. We do not take an action at turn T that would affect turn T? The action at turn T affects the state at turn T+1.\n\nSo the sequence of actions is from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1 (H actions) and then at the end of these actions, at turn t1+H, we are at y_{t1+H}. However, the problem says we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me read again: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". So we require that at turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). \n\nBut note: the actions we take from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2 will determine the state at turn t1+H-1. The last action that affects the state at turn t1+H-1 is taken at turn t1+H-2. Then at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). But the problem asks for a sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". That means we take H actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. \n\nBut the position at turn t1+H-1 is determined by the actions taken at turns t1 to t1+H-2. The last action (at turn t1+H-1) would then determine the position at turn t1+H, which we don't care about? \n\nHowever, the problem says we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So we require that after taking H-1 actions (from turn t1 to t1+H-2) we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. Then we take the H-th action at turn t1+H-1? But that action would move us away from (0,9) at turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem does not say we have to stay at (0,9). It only says we must reach it at turn t1+H-1. So we can then take any action at turn t1+H-1? However, we are only required to provide the sequence until we are at (0,9) at the turn t1+H-1. \n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", meaning the entire process from t1 to the turn we reach (0,9) is H turns? Actually, the sequence of actions is for t from 0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions. And we require that at turn t1+H-1 (which is the turn we take the last action) the position is (0,9). \n\nWait, no: at turn t1+H-1, we take the last action. But the position at the start of turn t1+H-1 is y_{t1+H-1}. Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1, which changes the position to y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + delta(a_{t1+H-1}).\n\nBut we require that at turn t1+H-1 (the state at the beginning of the turn? or after the action?) the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nThis is ambiguous. Looking back at the collision rule: collision occurs at turn T if at that turn the player is on a freeway and the car span includes 0. And the position at turn T is the state at that turn. \n\nI think the standard interpretation is: the state at turn T is the position at the beginning of the turn? But the update rule says: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + ...\", meaning that the action at time t determines the state at time t+1.\n\nSo:\n- At the beginning of turn t, we are at state y_t.\n- Then we choose an action a_t, which will determine y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, the state y_t is the position at the beginning of turn t.\n\nThe problem says: we are at turn t1 at position (0,0). So at the beginning of turn t1, we are at (0,0). Then we take an action a_{t1} which moves us to y_{t1+1} at the beginning of turn t1+1.\n\nWe require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nBut note: the sequence of actions we take is from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2? Because to get to y_{t1+H-1}, we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2. Then the state at turn t1+H-1 is (0,9). Then we don't need to take an action at turn t1+H-1? But the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions. \n\nThis implies that we must take an action at turn t1+H-1 even though we are already at (0,9). But that action would then move us away. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take H actions and then the state at the next turn (t1+H) is (0,9). But the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nLet me read carefully: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nThis suggests that we are to take H actions (at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1) and then at the moment of turn t1+H-1 (after taking the action? or before?) we are at (0,9). \n\nBut the update rule is: action at turn t determines the next state at turn t+1. So:\n\n- Turn t1: we are at (0,0). We take action a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1, we are at y1 = 0 + delta(a_{t1})\n- ...\n- At turn t1+H-1: we are at y_{t1+H-1}. Then we take action a_{t1+H-1} -> then at turn t1+H, we are at y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + delta(a_{t1+H-1})\n\nWe require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9)? Or after the action at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H? \n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". Since the state at the beginning of turn t is y_t, then we require y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nBut note: the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken and then we move to y_{t1+H}. So we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action that moves us away. \n\nBut the problem doesn't say we have to stay there. So that's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, we need to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9, and we take H actions (from t1 to t1+H-1) but the last action (at turn t1+H-1) will change the position to something else at turn t1+H, but we don't care.\n\nSo the minimal H is the minimal number such that we can go from y=0 at turn 30 to y=9 at turn 30+H-1, and we take H actions (the last action being at the turn when we are at y=9).\n\nBut note: we start at turn 30 at y=0. Then after 0 actions, we are at turn 30 at y=0. After 1 action (at turn 30), we are at turn 31 at y1. After 2 actions, at turn 32 at y2, etc.\n\nWe require that after H-1 actions, we are at turn 30+H-1 at y=9? \n\nWait: \n- After 0 actions: turn 30: y=0.\n- After 1 action (at turn 30): turn 31: y1.\n- After 2 actions: turn 32: y2.\n- ...\n- After k actions: turn 30+k: y_k.\n\nWe require that at turn T = 30+H-1, we are at y=9. That means we have taken (T - 30) actions? \n\nAt turn 30+H-1, the number of actions taken is (30+H-1 - 30) = H-1. But we are going to take H actions? \n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nLet me re-index:\n\nWe are at turn t1 (30). We take an action at turn t1 (which is the first action) -> leads to state at turn t1+1.\n\nWe take the next action at turn t1+1 -> leads to state at turn t1+2.\n\n...\n\nWe take the k-th action at turn t1+k-1, which leads to state at turn t1+k.\n\nWe want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9). \n\nTo have the state at turn t1+H-1, we must have taken actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2. That is, H-1 actions. But the problem says we take H actions: from t=0 to H-1, meaning at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. \n\nSo the last action (the H-th action) is at turn t1+H-1, which will change the state at turn t1+H. \n\nTherefore, the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state we are in at the beginning of that turn, and then we take an action. \n\nWe require that state to be (0,9). \n\nSo we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action (which will move us to y=8,10, or 9) at turn t1+H.\n\nSo the minimal H is the minimal number of turns we are in (including the starting turn? no) such that we end up at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut note: we start at turn t1 at (0,0). Then we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. The number of steps (actions) is H, but the time elapsed is H-1 turns? \n\nLet me define T = the turn when we are at (0,9). Then T = t1 + H - 1.\n\nThe number of actions taken from turn t1 to turn T (which is the last turn we are at (0,9)) is T - t1 = H-1? But the sequence has H actions: from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}. \n\nThis is confusing. Let me look at the answer format: it says \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\", \"Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\", ... until \"Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\".\n\nAnd we want at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, the position is (0,9). \n\nBut at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9), and then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} which moves us to y = 9 + delta(a_{t1+H-1}). \n\nSo the minimal H is the minimal number of actions such that after H-1 actions (at turn t1+H-1) we are at y=9. And then we take the H-th action at that turn.\n\nBut the minimal time to go from y=0 to y=9 is at least 9 actions of U, so at least 9 actions. Then we would be at y=9 at turn 30+9 = 39? \n\nAt turn 30: y0=0.\nAfter 1st action (U) at turn30: at turn31, y1=1.\nAfter 2nd action (U) at turn31: at turn32, y2=2.\n...\nAfter 9th action (U) at turn38: at turn39, y9=9.\n\nSo at turn39, we are at y=9. Then we want to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1 = 30+H-1.\n\nSo 30+H-1 = 39 -> H=10.\n\nBut then we take 10 actions? The last action would be at turn39 (which is t1+9) and then we are at turn40 at y=9+delta. But we are required to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn39? \n\nIn this scenario, at the beginning of turn39, we are at y=9. Then we take the 10th action at turn39. \n\nSo the minimal H without any cars would be 10. But we have to avoid cars, so it might be more.\n\nBut note: we can also use D and S to wait, so it might take more turns.\n\nTherefore, we are to find the minimal H such that there exists a sequence of H actions (starting at turn30) that brings us to y=9 at the beginning of turn30+H-1, and then we take the last action (the H-th) at that turn.\n\nNow, we must avoid collisions: at every turn T from 30 to 30+H-2 (because at turn30 we are at y=0, safe; at turn30+H-1 we are at y=9, safe) but when we are at freeways (y=1..8) at turns in between, we must not have a car on that freeway at that turn that has 0 in its span.\n\nNote: at turn T, if we are at y_T in {1,2,...,8}, then we check the car(s) on freeway y_T: if any car has 0 in its span at turn T, then collision.\n\nWe start at turn30: y=0 (safe) -> no action taken yet? But we are about to take the first action.\n\nWe need to simulate for each freeway and each turn whether there is a car that has 0 in its span.\n\nWe are going to try to go up as fast as possible, but if we see that at a future turn on a freeway we would be hit, we might have to wait (use S) or even go down (D) to avoid, but going down might not be efficient.\n\nWe are at y=0 at turn30.\n\nWe want to go to y=1 at turn31. But at turn31, we will be at y=1. Then we check freeway1 at turn31.\n\nFreeway1: car: [ -59 + 3*(T-30), -48 + 3*(T-30) ] at turn T.\n\nAt turn31: T=31, so time elapsed=1: \n  span = [ -59+3*1, -48+3*1 ] = [-56, -45]. 0 is not in [-56,-45] -> safe.\n\nThen we can go to y=2 at turn32: check freeway2 at turn32.\n\nFreeway2: car: [37+12*(T-30), 48+12*(T-30)] at turn T.\nT=32: time=2: [37+24, 48+24] = [61,72] -> 0 not in there -> safe.\n\nThen turn33: go to y=3: check freeway3 at turn33.\nFreeway3: same as freeway2: [37+12*3, 48+12*3] = [37+36,48+36]=[73,84] -> safe.\n\nThen turn34: go to y=4: freeway4 at turn34: same -> [37+48,48+48]=[85,96] -> safe.\n\nThen turn35: go to y=5: freeway5 at turn35: [37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe.\n\nThen turn36: go to y=6: freeway6 at turn36. There are two cars.\n\nFreeway6:\n  car1: [37+12*(36-30)=37+72=109, 48+72=120] -> safe.\n  car2: [-11+12*(36-30)= -11+72=61, 0+72=72] -> safe.\n\nThen turn37: go to y=7: freeway7 at turn37.\n\nFreeway7: two cars.\n  car1: [-59+6*(37-30)= -59+42 = -17, -48+42=-6] -> so span [-17,-6]. 0 is not in this? But note: -17 to -6, which is negative. So 0 is not in [-17,-6] -> safe?\n  car2: [-11+6*7= -11+42=31, 0+42=42] -> [31,42] -> safe.\n\nThen turn38: go to y=8: freeway8 at turn38.\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7? No, wait, freeway7 and 8 are different.\n\nFreeway8: \n  car1: [-59+6*(38-30)= -59+48 = -11, -48+48=0] -> so span [-11,0]. \n      Does this include 0? Yes, because it's a closed interval? The problem says \"0 in Span(T)\". The span is [-11,0]. So 0 is included. -> collision.\n\nTherefore, at turn38, if we are at freeway8, we collide.\n\nSo we cannot go to y=8 at turn38.\n\nWe must avoid being at freeway8 at turn38.\n\nWhat can we do?\n\nWe could delay our arrival at freeway8. For example, we can wait at some freeway for one turn.\n\nCurrently, we went straight up from turn31 to turn37: we were at y=1 at turn31, y=2 at32, ... y=7 at turn37. Then at turn37 we are at y=7. Then at turn37 we take an action to go to y=8 at turn38. But that causes collision.\n\nSo at turn37, instead of going up (to y=8 at turn38), we could stay at y=7 (action S) for one turn, then go up at the next turn.\n\nSo:\nAt turn37: we are at y=7. We take action S -> then at turn38, we are still at y=7.\n\nThen at turn38: we take action U -> then at turn39, we go to y=8.\n\nBut we need to check freeway7 at turn37 and turn38? \n\nAt turn37: we are at y=7 -> we already checked for turn37: freeway7 was safe.\n\nAt turn38: we are at y=7 again. Check freeway7 at turn38.\n\nFreeway7 at turn38:\n  car1: [-59+6*(38-30)= -59+48 = -11, -48+48=0] -> so [-11,0] -> 0 is included -> collision!\n\nSo if we stay at y=7 at turn38, we collide.\n\nTherefore, we cannot stay at y=7 at turn38.\n\nAlternatively, we could go down from y=7 at turn37 to y=6 at turn38? But then we are at freeway6 at turn38.\n\nCheck freeway6 at turn38:\n  car1: [37+12*(38-30)=37+96=133, 48+96=144] -> safe.\n  car2: [-11+12*8= -11+96=85, 0+96=96] -> safe.\n\nSo that is safe. Then we can go down to y=6 at turn38. Then we have to go back up.\n\nBut that would take extra steps.\n\nWe could also wait at a lower freeway for one turn to avoid the collision at freeway8 at turn38.\n\nLet me compute the car positions on freeway8 at turn39:\n\nFreeway8 at turn39 (T=39, time=9):\n  car1: [-59+6*9=-59+54=-5, -48+54=6] -> [-5,6] -> includes 0 -> collision! \n  car2: [-11+6*9=-11+54=43, 0+54=54] -> safe.\n\nSo at turn39, freeway8 is also dangerous.\n\nAt turn40:\n  car1: [-59+6*10=-59+60=1, -48+60=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n  car2: [-11+60=49, 0+60=60] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway8 is safe at turn40.\n\nTherefore, we want to be at freeway8 at turn40.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7 at turn40:\n  car1: [-59+6*10=1, -48+60=12] -> [1,12] -> safe (0 not included).\n  car2: [-11+60=49, 60] -> safe.\n\nSo if we can be at freeway8 at turn40, it is safe.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nWe were planning to go straight to y=7 at turn37. Then we want to be at y=8 at turn40.\n\nSo from turn37 (y=7) we can wait for two turns? \n\nBut freeway7 at turn38: we saw it's dangerous (car1 has [-11,0] at turn38). And at turn39: freeway7 car1: at turn39: time=9 -> [-59+54=-5, -48+54=6] -> [-5,6] -> 0 is included -> collision at turn39 on freeway7.\n\nSo we cannot stay at freeway7 at turn38 or turn39.\n\nWe could go down to freeway6 at turn38 and then wait there? \n\nCheck freeway6 at turn38: as above, safe.\nAt turn39: freeway6 at turn39:\n  car1: [37+12*9=37+108=145, 48+108=156] -> safe.\n  car2: [-11+12*9=-11+108=97, 0+108=108] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway6 is safe at turn38 and turn39.\n\nThen we can:\n- turn37: at y=7 -> take action D to go to y=6 at turn38. (safe)\n- turn38: at y=6 -> take action S (stay) at turn38: then at turn39, still at y=6. (safe)\n- turn39: at y=6 -> take action U to go to y=7 at turn40. \n- turn40: at y=7 -> take action U to go to y=8 at turn41.\n\nBut we are not done: we still need to go to y=9.\n\nBut we are now at turn41 at y=8. Then we go to y=9 at turn42.\n\nCheck freeway8 at turn41: \n  T=41: time=11 -> car1: [-59+6*11=-59+66=7, -48+66=18] -> [7,18] -> safe.\n  car2: [-11+66=55, 66] -> safe.\n\nFreeway8 at turn41 is safe.\n\nBut we were at freeway8 at turn41? Actually, we are at freeway8 at the beginning of turn41? Then we take an action at turn41 to go to y=9 at turn42.\n\nBut we need to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1 = 30+H-1.\n\nCurrently, we are at turn42 at y=8? Then we take an action at turn42 to go to y=9 at turn43.\n\nSo we would be at y=9 at turn43. Then we set H such that 30+H-1 = 43 -> H=14.\n\nBut we can do better? We want minimal H.\n\nAlternatively, we could avoid going down and then up. We might wait at a freeway that is safe.\n\nWe were at y=7 at turn37. Instead of going down, we could go up to y=8 at a later turn.\n\nWe saw freeway8 is safe at turn40. So we want to be at y=8 at turn40.\n\nHow long does it take to get to y=7? We were at y=7 at turn37. Then we can wait at freeway6 for two turns? But we are at y=7 at turn37. To go to freeway6, we have to go down.\n\nBut we can also wait at freeway5? Let me see the freeways above.\n\nWe were at y=5 at turn35, y=6 at turn36, y=7 at turn37.\n\nAt turn37, we are at y=7. We could stay at y=7? But we saw freeway7 at turn37: \n  turn37: freeway7 car1: [-17,-6] -> safe, car2: [31,42] -> safe.\nBut at turn38: freeway7: car1: [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot stay at y=7 at turn38.\n\nWe could go up to y=8 at turn38? but freeway8 at turn38 is unsafe.\n\nSo we must leave freeway7 at turn37: either go down to y=6 or up to y=8? But going up to y=8 at turn38 is unsafe.\n\nSo only option is to go down to y=6 at turn38.\n\nThen at turn38, we are at y=6. We can then:\nOption 1: stay at y=6 for one turn (turn38) and then go up at turn39 to y=7, then at turn40 to y=8, then turn41 to y=9.\n\nBut we can also go up earlier? \n\nWe want to be at y=8 at turn40. From y=6 at turn38, we can go up at turn38 to y=7 at turn39? \n\nBut freeway7 at turn39: as computed earlier, car1: [-5,6] -> includes 0 -> unsafe. So we cannot be at freeway7 at turn39.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid freeway7 at turn39. So we cannot go to y=7 at turn39.\n\nSo the only safe option at turn38 (if we are at y=6) is to stay at y=6 (action S) at turn38: then at turn39, we are at y=6 (safe). Then at turn39, we go to y=7 at turn40.\n\nFreeway7 at turn40: we computed safe (car1: [1,12], car2: [49,60] -> no 0). Then at turn40, we are at y=7. Then we go to y=8 at turn41.\n\nFreeway8 at turn41: we computed safe (car1: [7,18], car2: [55,66]). Then at turn41, we are at y=8. Then we go to y=9 at turn42.\n\nAt turn42, we are at y=9. Then we require that at turn30+H-1=42, we are at y=9. So 30+H-1=42 -> H=13.\n\nBut note: we must take an action at turn42? The sequence is for t=0 to H-1, so H actions. The last action is at turn30+H-1=42, which is the 13th action? \n\nWe started at turn30. We take actions at turns 30,31,...,41,42? That would be 13 actions? But we want to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn42. Then we take the last action at turn42.\n\nSo the sequence of actions would be from turn30 to turn42, which is 13 actions? But the turn indices: from 30 to 42 (inclusive) is 13 actions? \n\nNumber of actions: from turn30 to turn42: 42-30+1 = 13 actions.\n\nThen H=13.\n\nBut we can try to see if we can do it in 12 actions? That would mean we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn30+12-1=41. \n\nSo we need to be at y=9 at turn41.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn41, we must have been at y=8 at turn40 and then taken action U at turn40.\n\nWe need to check if we can be at y=8 at turn40 safely? We know freeway8 at turn40 is safe.\n\nBut how to get to y=8 at turn40?\n\nWe were at y=0 at turn30. We need to cover 8 freeways (from 1 to 8) in 10 turns? (from turn31 to turn40: 10 turns) but we have to go from y=0 to y=8 in 10 moves? That is more than enough because we only need 8 moves of U. But we have to avoid collisions.\n\nWe can do:\n\nTurn30: U -> turn31: y=1 (safe)\nTurn31: U -> turn32: y=2 (safe)\nTurn32: U -> turn33: y=3 (safe)\nTurn33: U -> turn34: y=4 (safe)\nTurn34: U -> turn35: y=5 (safe)\nTurn35: U -> turn36: y=6 (safe)\nTurn36: U -> turn37: y=7 (safe)\n\nNow at turn37: we are at y=7. We want to be at y=8 at turn40? So we have three turns: turn37, turn38, turn39 to spend until we go to y=8 at turn40.\n\nBut we cannot stay at y=7 at turn38 or turn39 because freeway7 is unsafe at those turns.\n\nWe could go down to a lower freeway and then come back.\n\nFor example, from y=7 at turn37, we can go down to y=6 at turn38 (safe), then at turn38 we can go down again to y=5 at turn39? or stay? \n\nBut then we have to go up again. To be at y=8 at turn40, we would have to go from y=5 at turn39 to y=8 at turn40? That requires two steps up in one turn? Not possible.\n\nAlternatively, at turn37: go down to y=6 at turn38 (safe). Then at turn38: stay at y=6 (safe). Then at turn39: go to y=7 at turn40? Then we are at y=7 at turn40, not y=8.\n\nTo be at y=8 at turn40, we must be at y=7 at turn39 and take U at turn39.\n\nBut we cannot be at y=7 at turn39 because freeway7 at turn39 is unsafe.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y=8 at turn40. Hence, we cannot achieve y=9 at turn41.\n\nSo minimal H is 13.\n\nNow, let me write the sequence for H=13.\n\nWe are at turn30: y=0.\nWe want to be at y=9 at turn42.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn30: U -> turn31: y=1 (freeway1: safe at turn31: [-56,-45])\nTurn31: U -> turn32: y=2 (freeway2: [61,72] -> safe)\nTurn32: U -> turn33: y=3 (freeway3: same as 2 -> safe)\nTurn33: U -> turn34: y=4 (freeway4: same -> safe)\nTurn34: U -> turn35: y=5 (freeway5: same -> safe)\nTurn35: U -> turn36: y=6 (freeway6: car1 [109,120], car2 [61,72] -> safe)\nTurn36: U -> turn37: y=7 (freeway7: at turn37: car1[-17,-6], car2[31,42] -> safe)\n\nNow at turn37: we are at y=7. We must avoid being at freeway7 at turn38 and turn39. So we go down to y=6 at turn38.\n\nTurn37: D -> turn38: y=6 (freeway6 at turn38: car1[37+12*8=37+96=133, 48+96=144], car2[-11+96=85, 96] -> safe)\n\nAt turn38: we are at y=6. We can stay here for one turn to avoid freeway7 at turn39.\n\nTurn38: S -> turn39: y=6 (freeway6 at turn39: car1[37+12*9=145,156], car2[-11+108=97,108] -> safe)\n\nAt turn39: we go up to y=7 at turn40.\n\nTurn39: U -> turn40: y=7 (freeway7 at turn40: car1[-59+60=1, -48+60=12] -> [1,12] (safe), car2[-11+60=49,60] -> safe)\n\nAt turn40: go up to y=8 at turn41.\n\nTurn40: U -> turn41: y=8 (freeway8 at turn41: car1[-59+66=7,18], car2[-11+66=55,66] -> safe)\n\nAt turn41: go up to y=9 at turn42.\n\nTurn41: U -> turn42: y=9.\n\nWe are at y=9 at the beginning of turn42.\n\nThen we take the last action (the 13th action) at turn42? But we are already at y=9. The action at turn42 can be anything? But the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, and H=13, so we take 13 actions: from turn30 to turn42.\n\nBut at turn42, we are at y=9 at the beginning, then we take an action. We don't care what happens after, so we can choose any action. But to be safe, we can choose S (stay) so we remain at y=9? But the goal is only to be at (0,9) at turn42 (the beginning), then we take an action and go to turn43. The problem doesn't require staying.\n\nBut we must avoid collision at turn42? We are at y=9, which is not a freeway, so safe. Then we take an action, say S, and go to y=9 at turn43. But that is beyond our sequence.\n\nSo the sequence of actions:\n\nTurn30: U\nTurn31: U\nTurn32: U\nTurn33: U\nTurn34: U\nTurn35: U\nTurn36: U\nTurn37: D   (from y=7 to y=6 at turn38)\nTurn38: S   (stay at y=6 at turn39)\nTurn39: U   (to y=7 at turn40)\nTurn40: U   (to y=8 at turn41)\nTurn41: U   (to y=9 at turn42)\nTurn42: ?   (we must take an action, but we are done; we can choose S, for example)\n\nBut the problem requires the sequence until the last action that brings us to (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? Actually, we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn42, and then we take an action at turn42. The problem does not require that we remain at (0,9) after the action, so we can choose any action.\n\nBut note: the last action is taken at turn42, and then we are done. We don't care about the state after that.\n\nSo we can set the last action to S.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". We reached (0,9) at turn42 = 30+12? because t1+H-1=30+13-1=42. So we are good.\n\nSo the sequence has 13 actions.\n\nBut let me verify the freeways we were on at each turn:\n\nTurn31: y=1 -> freeway1: T=31: car1: [-59+3, -48+3] = [-56,-45] -> safe.\nTurn32: y=2 -> freeway2: T=32: [37+24,48+24]=[61,72] -> safe.\nTurn33: y=3 -> freeway3: same as freeway2: [73,84] -> safe.\nTurn34: y=4 -> freeway4: same -> [85,96] -> safe.\nTurn35: y=5 -> freeway5: [97,108] -> safe.\nTurn36: y=6 -> freeway6: \n        car1: [37+72=109,48+72=120] -> safe\n        car2: [-11+72=61,72] -> safe.\nTurn37: y=7 -> freeway7: \n        car1: [-59+6*7=-59+42=-17, -48+42=-6] -> safe\n        car2: [-11+42=31,42] -> safe.\nTurn38: y=6 (because we took D at turn37) -> freeway6: T=38: \n        car1: [37+12*8=133,144] -> safe\n        car2: [-11+96=85,96] -> safe.\nTurn39: y=6 (because we took S at turn38) -> freeway6: T=39: \n        car1: [37+12*9=145,156] -> safe\n        car2: [-11+108=97,108] -> safe.\nTurn40: y=7 (from U at turn39) -> freeway7: T=40: \n        car1: [-59+60=1, -48+60=12] -> safe (0 not in [1,12])\n        car2: [-11+60=49,60] -> safe.\nTurn41: y=8 (from U at turn40) -> freeway8: T=41: \n        car1: [-59+66=7,18] -> safe\n        car2: [-11+66=55,66] -> safe.\nTurn42: we are at y=9 -> safe (not a freeway).\n\nSo no collisions.\n\nNow, the minimal H is 13? But is there a way with H=12?\n\nWe would need to be at y=9 at turn41 (since 30+12-1=41).\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn41, we must be at y=8 at turn40 and take U at turn40.\n\nSo we need to be at y=8 at turn40.\n\nBut freeway8 at turn40 is safe, as computed: car1: [1,12] -> wait, no: freeway8 at turn40: time=10, \n  car1: [-59+60=1, -48+60=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n  car2: [-11+60=49,60] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway8 at turn40 is safe.\n\nBut how to get to y=8 at turn40?\n\nWe start at y=0 at turn30.\n\nWe have 10 turns (from turn31 to turn40) to go from y=0 to y=8. We need 8 moves of U and 2 moves of other (S or D) to use up the turns? Or we can do 8 U and 2 S, for example.\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions.\n\nWe must be at y=7 at turn39 to then go to y=8 at turn40? But freeway7 at turn39 is unsafe (car1: [-5,6] -> includes 0). So we cannot be at y=7 at turn39.\n\nWe could be at y=8 at turn40 without passing through y=7 at turn39? How? We must be at y=7 at turn39 to go to y=8 at turn40? Because we move one step at a time.\n\nSo we must be at y=7 at turn39. But freeway7 at turn39 is unsafe. Therefore, we cannot be at y=7 at turn39, so we cannot get to y=8 at turn40.\n\nHence, H=12 is not possible.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 13.\n\nThe sequence:\n\nTurn30: U\nTurn31: U\nTurn32: U\nTurn33: U\nTurn34: U\nTurn35: U\nTurn36: U\nTurn37: D\nTurn38: S\nTurn39: U\nTurn40: U\nTurn41: U\nTurn42: S   (or any, we choose S)\n\nBut the last action is at turn42, and we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn42. Then we take S and remain at y=9 at turn43.\n\nNow, write the answer.\n\nAnswer Format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: D\nTurn 38: S\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\nTurn 42: S\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., and t1=30.\n\nSo the above is correct.\n\nBut let me double-check the freeway at turn38: we are at y=6, which is freeway6. We computed it safe.\n\nAt turn39: we are at y=6 again? Then we go to y=7 at turn40. At turn39 we are at freeway6: safe.\n\nAt turn40: freeway7: we have [1,12] and [49,60] -> no 0.\n\nAt turn41: freeway8: [7,18] and [55,66] -> no 0.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo the minimal H is 13.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 42\\) (i.e., \\(H = 13\\)) is achieved with the following sequence of actions. The sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by strategically moving up, down, or staying at certain turns to bypass dangerous positions.\n\n- At turn 30, the player is at \\((0, 0)\\). Moving up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 31 is safe, as the car on freeway 1 at turn 31 is in \\([-56, -45]\\), which does not contain 0.\n- Similarly, moving up to \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\) at turns 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 is safe, as the cars on the respective freeways do not cover 0 at those turns.\n- At turn 36, the player is at \\(y = 6\\). Moving up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 37 is safe, as the cars on freeway 7 at turn 37 are in \\([-17, -6]\\) and \\([31, 42]\\), neither containing 0.\n- However, moving up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 38 would cause a collision, as the car on freeway 8 at turn 38 is in \\([-11, 0]\\), which contains 0. Similarly, staying at \\(y = 7\\) at turn 38 is unsafe due to a car in \\([-11, 0]\\). Thus, the player moves down to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 38, which is safe (cars in \\([133, 144]\\) and \\([85, 96]\\)).\n- At turn 38, staying at \\(y = 6\\) (action S) for turn 39 is safe, as the cars on freeway 6 at turn 39 are in \\([145, 156]\\) and \\([97, 108]\\), neither containing 0.\n- Moving up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 40 is safe, as the cars on freeway 7 at turn 40 are in \\([1, 12]\\) and \\([49, 60]\\), neither containing 0.\n- Moving up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 41 is safe, as the cars on freeway 8 at turn 41 are in \\([7, 18]\\) and \\([55, 66]\\), neither containing 0.\n- Finally, moving up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 42 achieves the goal. The action at turn 42 is set to S (stay), but any action is acceptable since the position at turn 42 is \\((0, 9)\\) and the sequence is complete.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 30: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 31: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 32: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 33: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 34: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 35: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 36: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 37: \\text{ D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 38: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 39: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 40: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 41: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 42: \\text{ S}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get from position (0,0) at turn 36 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. Each turn, I can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing my y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but I have to stay within y=0 to 9.\n\nThe collision rule is important: I collide at turn T only if I'm on a freeway y_T and for that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at turn T. Also, when I move to a new row, I'm not considered on that row until the next turn. So if I move to y_{T+1} at turn T, I'm not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I don't check for collision on that row until turn T+1.\n\nNow, the car states are given for turn t_1=36. I need to find where the cars are at future turns based on their speeds and directions.\n\nLet me list out the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: head -48, tail -59, direction right, speed 3. Since it's right-moving, the span moves right, so position increases.\n\nThe span update: for left-moving, it decreases; right-moving increases.\n\nFor freeway 1: right-moving, so at turn T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]? Let's see the notation.\n\nFrom the rule:\n\nRight-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nBut head and tail: for right-moving, head should be greater than tail? -48 is greater than -59, yes, since -48 > -59.\n\nSo Span(t_1) = [tail, head] = [-59, -48]? No.\n\nThe notation says: for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], meaning [tail, head], so from tail to head.\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, ...), so for freeway 1: head = -48, tail = -59, direction right.\n\nSo at t_1, span is [tail, head] = [-59, -48] for right-moving? Let's confirm.\n\nThe rule says: for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] where ΔT = T - t_1.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nIn this case, all cars seem to be right-moving except... let's check.\n\nFreeway 1: (head=-48, tail=-59, right, 3) → since right, span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nThen at time T, span is [-59 + 3(T-36), -48 + 3(T-36)]\n\nCollision occurs if 0 is in this span at turn T when I'm on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, freeway 2: (48, 37, right, 12) — head=48, tail=37, right, speed 12.\n\nSpan at t_1: [37, 48]? [tail, head] = [37,48]\n\nThen at T: [37 + 12(T-36), 48 + 12(T-36)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 4: same (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 5: same (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, right, s=12, span at t_1: [37,48]\n\nSecond car: head=0, tail=-11, right, s=12, span at t_1: [tail,head] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T: [ -11 + 12(T-36), 0 + 12(T-36) ] = [ -11 + 12ΔT, 12ΔT ] where ΔT = T-36\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst: head=-48, tail=-59, right, s=6, span at t_1: [-59, -48]\n\nAt T: [-59 + 6ΔT, -48 + 6ΔT]\n\nSecond: head=0, tail=-11, right, s=6, span at t_1: [-11, 0]\n\nAt T: [-11 + 6ΔT, 6ΔT]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nNow, I start at (0,0) at turn 36. y=0 is not a freeway, so no cars there. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0, I'm safe, no collision.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is also not a freeway, so once I'm there, no cars.\n\nBut to get there, I have to pass through y=1 to 8, and avoid being on a row when 0 is in a car's span for that row.\n\nSince the cars are moving, the spans change over time.\n\nI need to move up to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns is at least 9, since I start at y=0 and need to go to y=9, so at least 9 moves up, but I can also move down or stay, so it might take more if I have to avoid collisions.\n\nBut since I want minimal H, I should go up as fast as possible, only deviating if necessary for avoidance.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=0 to H-1, so for sequence of actions from t=36 to t=36+H-1, and at turn 36+H-1, y=9.\n\nAt turn 36, I am at y=0, and I take action a_{36}, which affects y_{37}, and so on.\n\nLet’s denote the turn: at time t, I take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThe position is given at turn t_1=36, so y_{36} = 0.\n\nThen at turn 36, I take action a_{36}, which sets y_{37} = y_{36} + Δy_{36}.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 37, I take a_{37}, sets y_{38} = y_{37} + Δy_{37}, and so on.\n\nI need to find H such that at some turn T = 36 + τ, y_T = 9, and τ is minimized, but H is the number of actions, from t=36 to t=36+H-1, so after H actions, I am at turn 36+H, position y_{36+H}.\n\nLet's clarify the indexing.\n\nThe player position is given at turn t_1, which is the start.\n\nI take actions a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nAfter taking a_{t_1}, I move to y_{t_1 +1}\n\nAfter taking a_{t_1 +1}, I move to y_{t_1 +2}, and so on.\n\nAfter taking the last action a_{t_1 + H -1}, I move to y_{t_1 + H}\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} = 9? No.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\", and \"at turn t_1 + H - 1, y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"? Let's read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n\"reach (0,9)\" at some turn, but it says \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nIn the sequence: {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at times t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt time t_1, I am at (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,0)\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at time t_1+1, I am at y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + k}, at time t_1 + k +1, I am at y_{t_1 + k +1}\n\nWe want that at some point, I am at (0,9). The position is reached at the turn after the action.\n\nThe sequence ends with action a_{t_1 + H -1}, after which I am at y_{t_1 + H}\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"? Let's see.\n\n\"reach (0,9)\" and \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} is the position at turn t_1 + H - 1, which is before taking action a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H - 1, I am at position y_{t_1 + H - 1}, then I take action a_{t_1 + H -1}, which moves me to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nIf y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9, that means I am already at 9 at turn t_1 + H - 1, and I might take an action, but since I'm at 9, if I take U or D, I might go to 10 or 8, which is invalid, since y in [0,9], so I should stay or something.\n\nThe position must be within [0,9], so if I am at y=9, I can only take S or D, but D would go to 8, which is not reaching 9, so to be at 9, I should be there after an action or at the start.\n\nI think there's confusion in the indexing.\n\nLet me read the problem carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), avoiding collisions... such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\"\n\nIt says \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\", so at turn t_1 + H - 1, the position is (0,9).\n\nThen, at that turn, I don't need to take an action; I'm already there.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1 for the offset, so actions at times t_1 to t_1+H-2? Let's see.\n\n{ a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1 } means actions at times: t_1 + 0, t_1 +1, ..., t_1 + (H-1)\n\nSo actions taken at turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1\n\nAfter taking action at turn T, I move to position at turn T+1.\n\nAt turn t_1, position is given, y_{t_1} = 0.\n\nThen I take action a_{t_1} at turn t_1, which determines y_{t_1 +1}\n\nThen take a_{t_1 +1} at turn t_1 +1, determines y_{t_1 +2}, and so on.\n\nAfter taking a_{t_1 + k} at turn t_1 + k, I move to y_{t_1 + k +1}\n\nFor the last action: at turn t_1 + H -1, I take a_{t_1 + H -1}, which determines y_{t_1 + H}\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9, which is the position at turn t_1 + H -1, before taking any action at that turn.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, I am at position y_{t_1 + H -1} = 9, and then I may or may not take an action, but since I'm already at 9, and the sequence includes actions up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, which I take at turn t_1 + H -1, but if I take an action, I might move away.\n\nIf at turn t_1 + H -1, I am at y=9, and I take action a_{t_1 + H -1}, then y_{t_1 + H} could be 8,9, or 10, but 10 is invalid, so to stay at 9, I must take S, but the position after action might not be 9.\n\nThe key point is that we want the position to be 9 at turn t_1 + H -1, meaning before the action at that turn.\n\nThen, for that turn, I take an action, but it doesn't change the fact that at that turn, I was at 9.\n\nBut the collision is checked at each turn based on position at that turn.\n\nFor turn t_1 + H -1, I am at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nThen I take an action, say S, to stay at 9 for the next turn, but it's not necessary.\n\nIn terms of reaching, once I am at (0,9) at some turn, I have reached, so the sequence can stop when I first reach.\n\nBut the problem specifies that at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9, and I have taken H actions from t=0 to H-1 offset.\n\nLet's list the turns:\n\n- Turn t_1: position y_{t_1} = 0\n\n- Action a_{t_1} taken, move to y_{t_1 +1}\n\n- Turn t_1 +1: position y_{t_1 +1}, then action a_{t_1 +1}, move to y_{t_1 +2}\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn t_1 + k: position y_{t_1 +k}, action a_{t_1 +k}, move to y_{t_1 +k +1}\n\nWe want that at some turn T, y_T = 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} = 9.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, position is 9, then I take action a_{t_1 + H -1}, which moves me to y_{t_1 + H}, which could be different, but that's fine, as long as at that turn I was at 9.\n\nAnd since y=9 is safe, no issue.\n\nH is the number of turns for actions, so from action at t_1 to action at t_1 + H -1, total H actions.\n\nThe position at turn t_1 + H -1 is 9.\n\nSince I start at turn t_1 at y=0, to reach y=9, the minimum possible H is 9, if I move up every turn, but I might need to avoid collisions, so it could be more.\n\nNow, I need to simulate the car positions over time to see when it's safe to be on each row.\n\nLet ΔT = T - 36, so at time T = 36 + ΔT.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find when 0 is not in the car span for that freeway.\n\nCollision if at turn T, I am on freeway k, and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSince there might be multiple cars per freeway, I need to check all for that row.\n\nLet's go through each freeway.\n\nFreeway y=1:\n\nCars: only one: (head=-48, tail=-59, right, s=3)\n\nSpan at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-59 + 3ΔT, -48 + 3ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 3ΔT <= 0 <= -48 + 3ΔT\n\nSo -59 + 3ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 3ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 3ΔT <= 0 => 3ΔT <= 59 => ΔT <= 59/3 = 19.666, so ΔT <= 19 since integer\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 + 3ΔT => 48 <= 3ΔT => ΔT >= 16\n\nSo 16 <= ΔT <= 19\n\nFor ΔT from 16 to 19 inclusive, 0 in span.\n\nThus, unsafe at T when 36 + ΔT, for ΔT=16,17,18,19, i.e., turns 52 to 55.\n\nT = 36 + ΔT, so for ΔT=16, T=52; ΔT=17,T=53; ΔT=18,T=54; ΔT=19,T=55.\n\nSo on freeway 1, unsafe at turns 52,53,54,55.\n\nSafe otherwise.\n\nFreeway y=2:\n\nCars: one car (48,37,right,12)\n\nSpan at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [37 + 12ΔT, 48 + 12ΔT]\n\n0 in span: 37 + 12ΔT <= 0 <= 48 + 12ΔT\n\nFirst: 37 + 12ΔT <= 0 => 12ΔT <= -37, but ΔT >=0, 12ΔT >=0, so 37 + 12ΔT >=37>0, so never <=0. Thus, 0 is never <= 48 +12ΔT which is always positive, but for 0 to be in [low, high], need low <=0 and 0<=high.\n\nHere low =37 +12ΔT >=37>0, so low >0, thus 0 < low, so 0 not in [low, high] since low >0.\n\nSimilarly, high =48+12ΔT>0.\n\nSo 0 is never in the span for freeway 2, for any T.\n\nSimilarly, freeway y=3: same car, (48,37,right,12), identical to freeway 2, so also always safe.\n\nFreeway y=4: same, always safe.\n\nFreeway y=5: same, always safe.\n\nFreeway y=6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12), same as above, span [37+12ΔT, 48+12ΔT], always >0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), head=0, tail=-11, right, s=12.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-11 + 12ΔT, 0 + 12ΔT] = [-11 +12ΔT, 12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -11 +12ΔT <= 0 <= 12ΔT\n\nFirst: -11 +12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=11 => ΔT <= 11/12 <1, so ΔT <=0 since integer ΔT >=0.\n\nΔT=0: -11 +0 <=0? -11<=0 true.\n\n0 <= 12*0 =0, true.\n\nSo at ΔT=0, 0 in span.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 12ΔT, always true for ΔT >=0.\n\nSo only when -11 +12ΔT <=0, which is 12ΔT <=11, ΔT <= 11/12, so only ΔT=0.\n\nAt ΔT=0, T=36, span [-11,0], 0 is in it.\n\nFor ΔT=1, span [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12].\n\nSimilarly for higher ΔT.\n\nSo for second car, unsafe only at T=36.\n\nBut on freeway 6, at turn T, if I am on it, and 0 in any car span.\n\nFirst car never has 0 in span, second car has 0 in span only at T=36.\n\nSo overall for freeway 6, unsafe only at turn 36.\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\nFreeway y=7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,6) head=-48, tail=-59, right, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-59 +6ΔT, -48 +6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -59 +6ΔT <=0 and 0<= -48 +6ΔT\n\nFirst: -59 +6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=59 => ΔT <= 59/6 ≈9.833, so ΔT <=9\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +6ΔT => 48 <=6ΔT => ΔT >= 48/6=8\n\nSo 8 <= ΔT <=9\n\nThus unsafe at ΔT=8,9, T=44,45\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6) head=0, tail=-11, right, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [-11 +6ΔT, 6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -11 +6ΔT <=0 and 0<=6ΔT\n\nFirst: -11+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=11 => ΔT <=11/6≈1.833, so ΔT<=1\n\nSecond: 0<=6ΔT always for ΔT>=0\n\nSo unsafe at ΔT=0 and ΔT=1\n\nΔT=0: T=36, span [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔT=1: T=37, span [-11+6,6]=[-5,6], 0 in [-5,6] yes\n\nΔT=2: span [-11+12,12]=[1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo for second car, unsafe at T=36 and 37.\n\nNow for freeway 7, unsafe if either car has 0 in span.\n\nSo from first car: unsafe at T=44,45\n\nFrom second car: unsafe at T=36,37\n\nThus overall unsafe at T=36,37,44,45\n\nSafe otherwise.\n\nFreeway y=8: same as freeway 7, since cars are identical: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nSo same unsafe times: T=36,37,44,45\n\nNow, y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nI start at turn 36, y=0.\n\nAt turn 36, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe unsafe times for each row:\n\n- y=1: unsafe at turns 52,53,54,55\n\n- y=2: always safe\n\n- y=3: always safe\n\n- y=4: always safe\n\n- y=5: always safe\n\n- y=6: unsafe only at turn 36\n\n- y=7: unsafe at 36,37,44,45\n\n- y=8: unsafe at 36,37,44,45\n\nI need to be on a row only when it is safe, except that when I move to a row, I am not on it until the next turn.\n\nImportant point: at turn T, I am on row y_T.\n\nIf I take action to move to a different row, at turn T, I am still on y_T, and I move to y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T based on y_T and the car spans at T.\n\nFor example, at turn 36, I am at y=0, which is safe.\n\nIf I take action U at turn 36, I move to y=1 at turn 37.\n\nAt turn 37, I am on y=1.\n\nNow, I need to avoid being on a row when it is unsafe.\n\nLet me list the unsafe turns for each row:\n\nRow: unsafe turns\n\n1: 52,53,54,55\n\n2: never\n\n3: never\n\n4: never\n\n5: never\n\n6: 36\n\n7: 36,37,44,45\n\n8: 36,37,44,45\n\nSince y=2,3,4,5 are always safe, I can be on them at any time without problem.\n\ny=6 is unsafe only at turn 36, so I should avoid being on y=6 at turn 36.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and y=8 are unsafe at 36,37,44,45.\n\nI start at turn 36, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal path should be to go up as fast as possible, but avoiding the unsafe times.\n\nSince y=2 to y=5 are always safe, I can pass through them quickly.\n\nThe critical parts are the first few rows and last few.\n\nAt turn 36, I am at y=0.\n\nI can take action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I take U, I go to y=1 at turn 37.\n\nBut at turn 37, I am on y=1, which is safe since y=1 unsafe only at 52-55, not now.\n\ny=1 unsafe at 52-55, turn 36 is early, so safe.\n\nIf I take U at 36, to y=1 at 37.\n\nThen at turn 37, I am on y=1, safe.\n\nI can take U again to y=2 at 38, and so on.\n\nBut I need to go through y=6,7,8.\n\ny=6 is unsafe at turn 36 only.\n\nAt turn 36, I am at y=0, not on y=6.\n\nIf I want to be on y=6, it must not be at turn 36.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and y=8 unsafe at 36 and 37.\n\nNow, let's think about the timing.\n\nI start at t=36, y=0.\n\nIf I go up continuously, I can reach y=9 in 9 turns:\n\n- At t=36, y=0, take U, go to y=1 at t=37\n\n- t=37, y=1, take U, go to y=2 at t=38\n\n- t=38, y=2, U to y=3 at 39\n\n- t=39, y=3, U to y=4 at 40\n\n- t=40, y=4, U to y=5 at 41\n\n- t=41, y=5, U to y=6 at 42\n\n- t=42, y=6, U to y=7 at 43\n\n- t=43, y=7, U to y=8 at 44\n\n- t=44, y=8, U to y=9 at 45\n\nNow, check for collisions.\n\nAt each turn, when I am on a row, is it safe?\n\nt=36: on y=0, safe.\n\nt=37: on y=1, which is safe since unsafe only later.\n\nt=38: on y=2, safe.\n\nt=39: y=3, safe.\n\nt=40: y=4, safe.\n\nt=41: y=5, safe.\n\nt=42: on y=6. Now, y=6 unsafe only at t=36, and t=42 is later, so safe.\n\nt=43: on y=7. y=7 unsafe at 36,37,44,45. t=43 not in {36,37,44,45}, so safe.\n\nt=44: on y=8. y=8 unsafe at 36,37,44,45. t=44 is unsafe! Oh, problem.\n\nAt t=44, if I am on y=8, it is unsafe because y=8 has cars where 0 is in span at t=44.\n\nSimilarly, t=45 would be unsafe for y=8 if I were there, but in this sequence, at t=44 I am on y=8, unsafe.\n\nSo collision at t=44 on y=8.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on y=8 at t=44.\n\nSimilarly, at t=43, I was on y=7, which was safe, but then to y=8 at t=44, unsafe.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on y=8 at t=44 or t=45.\n\nAlso, for y=7, unsafe at t=44 and 45? y=7 unsafe at 36,37,44,45.\n\nt=44 and 45 unsafe for y=7 and y=8.\n\nIn the sequence above, t=43: on y=7, safe since t=43 not unsafe.\n\nt=44: on y=8, unsafe.\n\nI need to adjust.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are unsafe at t=44 and 45, I should not be on them at those turns.\n\nSimilarly, at t=36 and 37, they are unsafe, but I am not there yet.\n\nNow, the unsafe turns for y=7 and y=8 are 36,37,44,45.\n\nt=36 and 37 are past or current, but I start at t=36 y=0, so for y=7 and 8, t=36 and 37 are unsafe, but I am not on them.\n\nt=44 and 45 are future.\n\nI need to be on y=7 or y=8 only when safe, i.e., not at t=44,45.\n\nAlso, y=6 is only unsafe at t=36, which is past, so after t=36, y=6 is safe.\n\nNow, I want to reach y=9 quickly.\n\ny=9 can be reached from y=8.\n\nBut y=8 is unsafe at t=44,45.\n\nSo I should avoid t=44,45 for being on y=8.\n\nSimilarly, I should not be on y=7 at t=44,45.\n\nThe safe times for y=7 and y=8 are all times except 36,37,44,45.\n\nSince 36 and 37 are early, for later times, safe except 44 and 45.\n\nSo I can be on y=7 or y=8 at, say, t=42,43,46, etc., but not 44,45.\n\nIn my previous sequence, I was on y=8 at t=44, which is bad.\n\nI need to reach y=9 before t=44 or after t=45.\n\nSince I start at t=36 y=0, and need to go up 9 rows, minimum 9 turns, so earliest I can be at y=9 is t=36 +9 = t=45? Let's see.\n\nAt t=36, y=0\n\nAfter first action (at t=36), at t=37, y=1\n\nAfter second action (t=37), at t=38, y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at t=36+k, y=k\n\nTo be at y=9, at turn t=36+9 = t=45, y=9.\n\nIf I move up every turn.\n\nAt t=45, y=9, which is safe.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at t=45, I need to be on y=8 at t=44, because at t=44, I take action U to go to y=9 at t=45.\n\nAt t=44, I am on y=8, and if I take U, I go to y=9 at t=45.\n\nBut at t=44, if I am on y=8, it is unsafe, as per above.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=44, so I cannot be on it at t=44.\n\nTherefore, at t=44, I cannot be on y=8 if I want to go up.\n\nIn the direct path, at t=44, I am on y=8 and it is unsafe.\n\nTo avoid that, I need to not be on y=8 at t=44.\n\nI could delay my arrival or go faster, but going faster is not possible since I need at least 9 moves up.\n\nI could stay somewhere to avoid being on y=8 at t=44.\n\nFor example, I could reach y=8 earlier or later.\n\nEarliest I can be at y=8: if I go up as fast as possible.\n\nStart t=36 y=0\n\nt=36: U, to y=1 at t=37\n\nt=37: U, to y=2 at t=38\n\n...\n\nt=42: U, to y=7 at t=43? Let's list:\n\nAfter action at t=36: y=1 at t=37\n\nAction t=37: y=2 at t=38\n\nt=38: y=3 at t=39\n\nt=39: y=4 at t=40\n\nt=40: y=5 at t=41\n\nt=41: y=6 at t=42\n\nt=42: y=7 at t=43\n\nt=43: y=8 at t=44\n\nt=44: y=9 at t=45\n\nAt t=43, I am on y=7? Position at turn: at turn t, y_t.\n\nAt turn t=36, y=0\n\nAction a_36: U, so y_{37} =1\n\nAt turn t=37, y=1, action a_37: U, y_{38}=2\n\n...\n\nAt turn t=41, y=5, action U, y_{42}=6\n\nTurn t=42, y=6, action U, y_{43}=7\n\nTurn t=43, y=7, action U, y_{44}=8\n\nTurn t=44, y=8, action U, y_{45}=9\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{36 + H -1} =9\n\nIn this case, at turn t=45, y=9, which would be t_1 + H -1 =36 + H -1 =45, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =45, t_1=36, so 36 + H -1 =45, thus H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions from a_{36} to a_{36 + H -1} = a_{36+9} = a_{45}? Sequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to H-1, actions at t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter last action a_{t_1 + H -1}, position at t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want position at t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nIn the above, at turn t=45, y=9.\n\nt=45 = t_1 + 9, since t_1=36, 36+9=45.\n\nSo t_1 + H -1 =45, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nAnd at turn t=45, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn t=44, y=8, which is unsafe because y=8 unsafe at t=44.\n\nSo collision at t=44.\n\nTo avoid, I need to not be on y=8 at t=44.\n\nSimilarly, not on y=7 at t=44 or 45.\n\nNow, I can be on y=7 at t=43, which is safe, as before.\n\nBut at t=43, if I am on y=7, I can take action to go to y=8 at t=44, but at t=44, y=8 is unsafe, so I would collide when I am on y=8 at t=44.\n\nI could stay on y=7 at t=44.\n\nAt t=43, I am on y=7, which is safe (t=43 not unsafe).\n\nThen at t=43, I take action S (stay), so at t=44, I am still on y=7.\n\nBut y=7 is unsafe at t=44! y=7 unsafe at 44,45.\n\nSo if I am on y=7 at t=44, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down, to y=6 at t=44, y=6 is safe except at t=36, so safe.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nLet's list the safe times.\n\nI need to cross y=7 and y=8 when not unsafe.\n\nUnsafe for y=7 and 8: t=44,45\n\nAlso t=36,37 but not relevant now.\n\nSo I can be on y=7 or y=8 at t<=43 or t>=46.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 is safe for t>=37.\n\nNow, the earliest I can be at y=9 is t=45, but to be at y=9 at t=45, I need to be at y=8 at t=44 to take U, but t=44 y=8 unsafe.\n\nIf I am at y=8 at t=43, then I can take U at t=43 to go to y=9 at t=44.\n\nAt t=43, if I am on y=8, and take U, to y=9 at t=44.\n\nBut at t=43, what is y=8 safety?\n\ny=8 unsafe at 36,37,44,45. t=43 is not in, so safe.\n\nThen at t=43, on y=8, safe, take U, go to y=9 at t=44.\n\nAt t=44, I am on y=9, which is safe, no cars.\n\nAnd y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{44} =9? Turn t=44, position y=9.\n\nt=44 = t_1 + 8, since 36+8=44.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =44, so H-1=8, H=9.\n\nAnd actions from a_{36} to a_{36+8} = a_{44}? Let's see.\n\nSequence: actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nFor H=9, actions at t=36 to t=36+8=44? t from 0 to H-1=8, so actions at t_1+0 to t_1+8, i.e., 36 to 44.\n\nAfter action a_{44} at turn 44, I move to y_{45}, but we want position at turn t_1 + H -1 =36 +9-1=44 to be 9.\n\nAt turn 44, position y_{44}, before action a_{44}.\n\nIf at turn 44, y_{44}=9, then I take action a_{44}, which might move me, but the position is 9 at that turn.\n\nIn this case, to have y_{44}=9, I need to arrive at turn 44.\n\nHow? From previous.\n\nAt turn 43, I was at y_{43}, take action to go to y_{44}=9, so if y_{43}=8, take U.\n\nNow, at turn 43, I need to be on y=8.\n\nBut y=8 at t=43 is safe, as above.\n\nNow, can I reach y=8 by t=43?\n\nStart t=36 y=0\n\nTo reach y=8 at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, y_T=8.\n\nSince I start at y=0 at t=36, to be at y=8 at turn T, I need exactly 8 up moves in between, but with turns.\n\nThe number of actions: from t=36 to t=T-1, I take actions to reach position at turn T.\n\nPosition at turn T depends on actions from turn 36 to T-1.\n\nSpecifically, y_T = y_{36} + sum_{t=36}^{T-1} Δy_t\n\ny_{36} =0, so y_T = sum_{t=36}^{T-1} Δy_t\n\nEach Δy_t is -1,0,1.\n\nTo have y_T=8, I need the sum from t=36 to T-1 of Δy_t to be 8.\n\nSince each |Δy_t| <=1, the minimal T to reach y=8 is when I go up every turn.\n\nStart: at t=36, y=0\n\nAfter first up: at t=37, y=1\n\n...\n\nAfter k up moves, at t=36+k, y=k\n\nSo to have y=8 at turn T, T=36+8=44, y=8 at t=44.\n\nEarlier, to have y=8 at t=43, that would require that at t=43, y=8.\n\nBut from above, after m actions, at t=36+m, y = number of up minus down, but since I start at 0 and go up, minimal is at t=36+8=44, y=8.\n\nAt t=43, what is the highest y I can be?\n\nAt t=36, y=0\n\nIf I go up every turn:\n\nt=37: y=1\n\nt=38: y=2\n\n...\n\nt=43: y=7\n\nBecause from t=36 to t=43, that's 7 turns later? Turns: t=36 to t=43 is 8 positions? Time from 36 to 43 inclusive is 8 turns, but positions:\n\nAt t=36: y=0\n\nt=37: y=1 (after one up)\n\nt=38: y=2\n\n...\n\nt=43: after 7 up moves? From t=36 to t=37: first action to y=1\n\nTo t=38: second to y=2\n\n...\n\nTo t=43: after action at t=42, to y at t=43.\n\nActions from t=36 to t=42 determine y at t=43.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=36 to t=42 inclusive? Actions at t=36,37,38,39,40,41,42: 7 actions.\n\nAfter 7 actions, at t=43, y=7 if all up.\n\nSimilarly, to have y=8 at t=43, I need to have done 8 up moves in 7 actions, impossible, since each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nMax y at t=43 is 7, with all up moves from t=36 to t=42.\n\nMin y is 0 or less, but bounded.\n\nSo at t=43, y can be at most 7.\n\nThus, I cannot be at y=8 at t=43; earliest is t=44.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=9 at t=44, impossible, max at t=44 is y=8.\n\nTo be at y=9 at t=45, as before.\n\nBut at t=44, to be at y=8 for going to y=9, but y=8 unsafe at t=44.\n\nTherefore, I need to avoid being on y=8 at t=44.\n\nSince I must be on y=8 at some point to go to y=9, and earliest at t=44, I need to be on y=8 at a different time.\n\nBut t=44 is the only time I can be on y=8 with minimal turns? No, I can be later.\n\nFor example, I can stay at lower rows to delay.\n\nThen be on y=8 at t=46 or later.\n\nBut that would increase H.\n\nSince y=2 to y=5 are always safe, I can stay there if needed.\n\nBut to minimize H, I should not delay unnecessarily.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=6 or y=7 and stay there during unsafe times, then proceed.\n\nFor example, y=6 is safe except at t=36, so after t=36, safe.\n\ny=7 safe except at 36,37,44,45.\n\nSo at t=43, y=7 is safe.\n\nt=44 and 45, y=7 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nSo I can be on y=7 at t=43, safe.\n\nThen at t=43, if I take action, to go to y=8 at t=44, but t=44 y=8 unsafe, so I collide at t=44.\n\nIf I take S at t=43, I stay on y=7 at t=44, but y=7 unsafe at t=44, collision.\n\nIf I take D, go to y=6 at t=44, y=6 is safe at t=44, since unsafe only at t=36.\n\nThen at t=44, on y=6, safe.\n\nThen I can go up later.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should go up as fast as possible until I need to avoid.\n\nLet's list a sequence where I avoid the unsafe spots.\n\nStart at t=36, y=0.\n\nSince y=6 is unsafe at t=36, but I am at y=0, not on it.\n\nI can go up.\n\nAt t=36, I take U, go to y=1 at t=37.\n\nt=37, on y=1, safe, take U, to y=2 at t=38.\n\nSimilarly, U to y=3 at t=39, U to y=4 at t=40, U to y=5 at t=41.\n\nNow at t=41, on y=5, I can take U to y=6 at t=42.\n\nt=42, on y=6, safe (since not t=36), I can take U to y=7 at t=43.\n\nt=43, on y=7, safe (t=43 not unsafe time).\n\nNow, at t=43, I need to take an action. If I take U, I go to y=8 at t=44, but t=44 y=8 unsafe, collision.\n\nIf I take S, I stay on y=7 at t=44, but t=44 y=7 unsafe, collision.\n\nIf I take D, I go to y=6 at t=44, y=6 safe.\n\nSo at t=43, take D, to y=6 at t=44.\n\nThen at t=44, on y=6, safe. I can take U to y=7 at t=45.\n\nBut t=45, if I go to y=7, y=7 unsafe at t=45, so if I am on y=7 at t=45, collision.\n\nAt t=44, on y=6, take U, to y=7 at t=45.\n\nAt t=45, on y=7, unsafe, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt t=44, on y=6, I could take S, stay on y=6 at t=45, safe, then at t=45, take U to y=7 at t=46.\n\nBut t=46, y=7 is safe, since unsafe only up to 45? y=7 unsafe at 36,37,44,45, so at t=46, safe.\n\nThen from there I can go up.\n\nBut let's see the turns.\n\nI want to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nCurrent: up to t=43 on y=7.\n\nThen at t=43, take D to y=6 at t=44.\n\nt=44: on y=6, take S (stay), to y=6 at t=45. But at t=45, y=6 is safe, but I need to go up.\n\nTake U at t=44 to y=7 at t=45, but t=45 y=7 unsafe.\n\nSo better to stay or go down, but delaying.\n\nAt t=44, on y=6, take S, to y=6 at t=45.\n\nt=45: on y=6, now y=6 safe, I can take U to y=7 at t=46.\n\nt=46: on y=7, safe (t=46 not unsafe), take U to y=8 at t=47.\n\nt=47: on y=8, safe (t=47 not 44,45), take U to y=9 at t=48.\n\nThen at turn t=48, y=9.\n\nNow, H: t_1 + H -1 =48, t_1=36, so 36 + H -1 =48, H-1=12, H=13.\n\nBut this is more turns, not minimal.\n\nEarlier with direct up, H=10 but collision at t=44.\n\nCan I do better?\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are unsafe only at t=44,45, I can be on y=7 before, at t=43, but I need to leave before t=44.\n\nBut at t=43, if I am on y=7, I can only go to y=6,7,8 at t=44.\n\ny=7 and y=8 unsafe at t=44, y=6 safe.\n\nSo I must go to y=6 at t=44.\n\nThen at t=44 on y=6, I can go to y=7 at t=45, but y=7 unsafe at t=45.\n\nSo I have to stay on y=6 or go down at t=45.\n\nThen at t=45 on y=6 or lower, I can go up later.\n\nBut that adds turns.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=8 earlier, but I cannot, as established.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=9 from y=8 at a safe time.\n\nBut y=8 must be safe when I am on it.\n\nThe safe times for y=8 are t<=43 or t>=46.\n\nBut I can be on y=8 at t=43? At t=43, y can be at most 7, as above.\n\nAt t=43, max y=7.\n\nAt t=44, min y=8 with all up, but unsafe.\n\nSo I need to be on y=8 at t=46 or later.\n\nFor example, at t=46, I can be on y=8 if I have taken actions to reach there.\n\nStart from t=36 y=0.\n\nTo be at y=8 at turn T.\n\nWith minimal delay.\n\nI can go up to y=5 quickly, since safe.\n\ny=5 is always safe.\n\nAt t=41, I can be at y=5, as before.\n\nThen from t=41, on y=5.\n\nInstead of going up immediately, I can stay or something.\n\nBut let's see the unsafe window for y=7 and 8 is t=44,45.\n\nSo if I can be on y=7 after t=45, or before.\n\nBefore t=44, at t=43 I can be on y=7.\n\nThen from there, I have to go down to y=6 at t=44.\n\nThen at t=44 on y=6, I can stay or go down, but to minimize, stay.\n\nThen at t=45, on y=6, I can go up to y=7 at t=46.\n\nt=46 on y=7, safe, go to y=8 at t=47.\n\nt=47 on y=8, safe, go to y=9 at t=48.\n\nAs before, H=13 with y at t=48.\n\nBut I can reduce the delay.\n\nSince the unsafe period is short, only two turns, I might stay at a safe row during that time.\n\nFor example, at t=43, I am on y=7, safe.\n\nInstead of going down, I can go to another row, but only adjacent.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=8 at t=46.\n\nWhat is the earliest I can be at y=8 after t=45.\n\nt=46 or later.\n\nAt t=46, y=8 is possible?\n\nFrom t=36 to t=46, that's 10 turns from start.\n\nAt t=36, y=0\n\nAfter 10 actions, at t=46, y could be from 0 to 10, but constrained to 0-9.\n\nTo have y=8 at t=46, I need to have net +8 in 10 actions, so I can have some stays or down, but that might delay more.\n\nMinimal actions to reach y=8 is 8 actions, to t=44 y=8.\n\nBut unsafe.\n\nNext, with 9 actions, I can be at y=8 at t=45? At t=45, position after actions from t=36 to t=44.\n\nActions at t=36 to t=44: 9 actions.\n\ny at t=45 = sum of Δy from t=36 to t=44.\n\nTo have y=8, with 9 actions, I can have one stay or down, but that would make y less than 8 if I have a down, or exactly 8 with one stay.\n\nBut at t=45, if I want to be on y=8, but I need to be there to go to y=9.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, to be at y=8 at turn T.\n\nT must be at least 44.\n\nAt T=44, y=8 possible with all up, but unsafe.\n\nAt T=45, y=8 possible with 8 up and one stay in the actions.\n\nFor example, actions from t=36 to t=43 determine y at t=44.\n\nTo have y=8 at t=44, need 8 up in 8 actions from t=36 to t=43? Actions from t=36 to t=43: 8 actions (t=36 to 43 inclusive is 8 actions).\n\nAfter 8 actions, at t=44, y=8 if all up.\n\nBut at t=44, on y=8, unsafe.\n\nIf I have a stay, y<8.\n\nTo have y=8 at t=45, that requires actions from t=36 to t=44.\n\n9 actions.\n\ny at t=45 = sum of Δy from t=36 to t=44.\n\nTo have sum =8, with 9 actions, so I can have 8 up and one stay, or 9 up and one down, etc.\n\nFor example, at some point I stay instead of up.\n\nBut then I reach y=8 later.\n\nAt t=45, on y=8, is it safe?\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=44,45.\n\nt=45 is unsafe for y=8.\n\nSo at t=45, if I am on y=8, collision.\n\nSimilarly, t=44 unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=8 at t=44 or 45.\n\nTherefore, the earliest safe time to be on y=8 is t=46.\n\nAt t=46, y=8 is safe.\n\nThen I can take U to y=9 at t=47.\n\nAt t=47, y=9.\n\nNow, t=47 = t_1 + 11, since 36+11=47.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =47, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nPosition at turn 47.\n\nBut let's see how to reach y=8 at t=46.\n\nAt turn t=46, y=8.\n\nThis means that with actions from t=36 to t=45, I reach y=8 at t=46.\n\nActions: 11 actions from t=36 to t=45.\n\ny at t=46 = sum from t=36 to t=45 of Δy_t.\n\nSince y_{36}=0, y_{46} = sum_{t=36}^{45} Δy_t.\n\nSet y_{46}=8.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=36 to t=45 inclusive, 10 actions? t=36 to t=45 is 10 actions.\n\nActions at t=36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45: 10 actions.\n\nAfter these, at t=46, y=8.\n\nTo have sum of 10 Δy_t =8, so net +8, with 10 actions, so I need 8 up, and 2 other actions that cancel or something, but each Δy is -1,0,1.\n\nSo to have sum=8, with 10 terms, I can have 8 up, 2 zero (stay), or 9 up, 1 down, etc.\n\nMinimal is with 8 up and 2 stay, or 9 up and 1 down, but 9 up and 1 down would be sum=8, yes.\n\nBut to minimize time, I should go up as much as possible, so use stays or downs only when necessary.\n\nIn this case, since I need to delay, I can have two stays somewhere safe.\n\nFor example, go up to y=5 quickly, then stay for two turns during the unsafe period.\n\nLet's plan.\n\nStart: t=36, y=0, take U, to y=1 at t=37\n\nt=37, y=1, U to y=2 at t=38\n\nt=38, y=2, U to y=3 at t=39\n\nt=39, y=3, U to y=4 at t=40\n\nt=40, y=4, U to y=5 at t=41\n\nNow at t=41, on y=5, safe.\n\nI need to be at y=8 at t=46.\n\nFrom t=41 to t=46, that's 5 turns: turns t=41 to t=45 actions determine y at t=46.\n\nAt t=41, y=5.\n\nAfter actions at t=41 to t=45, y at t=46.\n\nI need y_{46} =8, so from y=5 to 8, need +3 in 5 actions.\n\nSo I can go up directly or with some stays.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 during t=44,45.\n\nAt t=41, on y=5, I can take U to y=6 at t=42\n\nt=42, on y=6, safe, take U to y=7 at t=43\n\nt=43, on y=7, safe (t=43 not unsafe)\n\nNow, at t=43, I cannot stay or go up because at t=44, if I go to y=8 or stay y=7, unsafe.\n\nSo I must go down to y=6 at t=44.\n\nTake D at t=43, to y=6 at t=44.\n\nt=44, on y=6, safe.\n\nNow, at t=44, I can take action. If I take U, to y=7 at t=45, but t=45 y=7 unsafe, collision.\n\nIf I take S, to y=6 at t=45, safe.\n\nIf take D, to y=5 at t=45, safe but lower.\n\nTo minimize, take S at t=44, to y=6 at t=45.\n\nt=45, on y=6, safe.\n\nNow, I need to go up to y=8.\n\nAt t=45, take U to y=7 at t=46\n\nt=46, on y=7, safe (t=46 not unsafe), take U to y=8 at t=47\n\nt=47, on y=8, safe, take U to y=9 at t=48\n\nThen y at t=48=9.\n\nBut at t=47, on y=8, take U to y=9 at t=48.\n\nPosition at t=48 is 9.\n\nt=48 = t_1 + 12, so t_1 + H -1 =48, H-1=12, H=13.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut I can reach y=8 at t=46.\n\nHow?\n\nAt t=46, y=8.\n\nFrom above, at t=45, I was on y=6.\n\nAfter action at t=45, to y at t=46.\n\nIf at t=45, y=6, and I take U, to y=7 at t=46.\n\nTo have y=8 at t=46, I need to be at y=7 at t=45 and take U, but at t=45, if on y=7, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt t=46, y=8 requires that at t=45, y=7 or 8 or 9, but take action to have y=8 at t=46.\n\nIf at t=45, y=7, take U to y=8 at t=46.\n\nBut at t=45, y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf at t=45, y=8, take S to y=8 at t=46, but t=45 y=8 unsafe.\n\nIf y=9, take D to y=8, but not efficient.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=7 or 8 at t=45.\n\nTherefore, at t=45, I must be on y<=6.\n\nThen at t=45, on y<=6, take action to go to y=7 at t=46, but not to y=8 directly.\n\nSo at t=46, I can be at y=7 max, with U from y=6.\n\nThen at t=46, on y=7, take U to y=8 at t=47.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=48.\n\nSo earliest to reach y=9 is t=48, with H=13 for position at t=48.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =48, H-1=12, H=13.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn t=36: at y=0, take U, to y=1 at t=37\n\nTurn t=37: y=1, take U, to y=2 at t=38\n\nTurn t=38: y=2, U, to y=3 at t=39\n\nTurn t=39: y=3, U, to y=4 at t=40\n\nTurn t=40: y=4, U, to y=5 at t=41\n\nTurn t=41: y=5, U, to y=6 at t=42\n\nTurn t=42: y=6, U, to y=7 at t=43\n\nTurn t=43: y=7, take D (to avoid unsafe), to y=6 at t=44\n\nTurn t=44: y=6, take S (stay), to y=6 at t=45\n\nTurn t=45: y=6, take U, to y=7 at t=46\n\nTurn t=46: y=7, take U, to y=8 at t=47\n\nTurn t=47: y=8, take U, to y=9 at t=48\n\nNow, at turn t=48, y=9.\n\nWe need y at t_1 + H -1 =36 + H -1 =48, so H-1=12, H=13.\n\nActions from a_{36} to a_{36+12} = a_{48}? Actions at t=36 to t=36 + H -1 =36+12=48? H=13, H-1=12, actions at t_1 to t_1 + H -1 =36 to 36+12=48.\n\nBut at turn 48, I take action a_{48}, which moves to y_{49}, but we don't care, since position at turn 48 is 9 before action.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at t=47 to go to y=9 at t=48.\n\nActions: from t=36 to t=47 inclusive for actions, since after a_{47} at t=47, to y at t=48.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=36 to t=47, that's 12 actions? t=36 to t=47 inclusive is 12 turns, 12 actions.\n\nList action times: actions at t=36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47: that's 12 actions.\n\nH=12.\n\nThen position at turn t=48.\n\nt=48 = t_1 + 12, and t_1 + H -1 =36 +12 -1=47? Inconsistency.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = turn where position is 9.\n\nH is number of turns for actions.\n\n{ a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1 } so actions at t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H-1\n\nPosition after last action at t_1 + H-1 is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nSo for position at turn T to be 9, with T = t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, at turn t=48, y=9, so T=48.\n\nT = t_1 + H -1 =36 + H -1 =48, so 36 + H -1 =48, thus H-1=12, H=13.\n\nActions at t=36 to t=36+12 = t=48? t from 0 to H-1=12, so actions at t_1+0 to t_1+12, i.e., 36 to 48.\n\nAction at t=48.\n\nAt turn t=48, position y=9, then I take action a_{48}, which can be S, for example, to stay at 9.\n\nThen y at t=49=9, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence above, I have actions up to t=47, which sets y at t=48.\n\nBut for the sequence to include the action at the turn where I am at 9, I need to have an action at that turn or not.\n\nIn this case, at turn t=48, I am at y=9, so for the sequence, if H=13, actions from a_{36} to a_{48}, but a_{48} is taken at turn 48 when I am at y=9, and I can take S, for example.\n\nThen position remains 9.\n\nBut in the minimal sequence, I might not need the last action if I am already there, but the problem requires a sequence of H actions ending with position at t_1+H-1 being 9.\n\nWith H actions, position at t_1+H-1 is 9.\n\nIn the sequence with 12 actions from t=36 to t=47, position at t=48 is 9, which is t_1 +12.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =36 + H -1.\n\nSet equal to 48, so 36 + H -1 =48, H-1=12, H=13.\n\nThen actions at t=36 to t=36+12=48.\n\nSo I need to include action at t=48.\n\nSimilarly, in my sequence, at t=48, I am at y=9, take S, for example.\n\nBut let's not worry, I can have a shorter sequence.\n\nBack to minimizing H.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 faster by going to y=8 at t=46.\n\nAt t=46, y=8.\n\nHow to achieve that.\n\nAt t=46, y=8.\n\nThis requires that with actions from t=36 to t=45, I reach y=8 at t=46.\n\nActions at t=36 to t=45: 10 actions.\n\ny at t=46 = sum of Δy from t=36 to t=45.\n\nSet to 8.\n\nWith 10 actions, I can have 8 up and 2 stay, for example.\n\nOr 9 up and 1 down, etc.\n\nNow, I need to place the stays at safe times.\n\nFor example, go up to y=5 at t=41, as before.\n\nThen from t=41 to t=45 actions: 5 actions to go from y=5 to y=8 at t=46, so need +3 in 5 actions, so I can have 3 up and 2 stay, for example.\n\nPlace the stays during the unsafe period or when safe.\n\nAt t=41, on y=5, take U to y=6 at t=42\n\nt=42, on y=6, U to y=7 at t=43\n\nt=43, on y=7, now instead of going down, I take S at t=43, but if I take S, I stay on y=7 at t=44, but t=44 y=7 unsafe, collision.\n\nSo I cannot stay at t=43.\n\nI must take D to go to y=6 at t=44.\n\nThen at t=44, on y=6, I can take S to stay at y=6 at t=45.\n\nThen at t=45, on y=6, take U to y=7 at t=46.\n\nBut then at t=46, y=7, not 8.\n\nTo reach y=8 at t=46, from t=45 y=6, I need to take U to y=7 at t=46, not 8.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=8 at t=46 from here.\n\nIf at t=41, I take S or something to delay.\n\nFor example, at t=41, on y=5, instead of U, take S, to y=5 at t=42.\n\nThen t=42, on y=5, take U to y=6 at t=43\n\nt=43, on y=6, take U to y=7 at t=44, but t=44 y=7 unsafe, collision.\n\nTake D at t=43 to y=6 at t=44, etc., same as before.\n\nTo avoid being on y=7 or 8 at t=44,45, I can be on y=6 at those times.\n\nBut to reach y=8 at t=46, I need to be at y=7 at t=45 and take U, but t=45 y=7 unsafe.\n\nSo it's impossible to be on y=7 or 8 at t=45.\n\nTherefore, the earliest I can be on y=8 is t=46, but only if I am at y=7 at t=45 and take U, but t=45 y=7 unsafe, so I can't be on y=7 at t=45.\n\nThus, I cannot be on y=8 at t=46; earliest is t=47.\n\nAt t=47, on y=8, safe, take U to y=9 at t=48.\n\nPosition at t=48.\n\nH=13 as before.\n\nPerhaps start with a down move or something, but that would delay more, worse.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 is safe at t=44,45, I can go to y=6 quickly and stay there during t=44,45, then go up.\n\nBut y=6 at t=44,45 is safe.\n\nThen from there, go to y=7 at t=46, etc.\n\nBut still, to reach y=9 at t=48.\n\nLet's calculate the minimal H.\n\nThe direct path has H=10 but collision.\n\nTo avoid, I need to spend at least two extra turns somewhere, because the unsafe window is two turns, and I need to be at a safe row during that time.\n\nFor example, at t=44 and t=45, I must be on a row that is not y=7 or y=8, and not unsafe for that row.\n\nAvailable rows: y=0 to 6 or 9, but y=9 not yet.\n\ny=0 to 6: y=6 is safe at t=44,45.\n\ny=5,4,etc. safe.\n\nSo I can be on y=6 at t=44 and t=45.\n\nThen at t=46, go to y=7, etc.\n\nBut to be on y=6 at t=44, I need to arrive earlier.\n\nFor example, I can reach y=6 at t=42 as before.\n\nThen at t=42, on y=6, I can take S at t=42 to stay at y=6 at t=43.\n\nt=43, on y=6, take S to stay at y=6 at t=44.\n\nt=44, on y=6, take S to stay at y=6 at t=45.\n\nt=45, on y=6, take U to y=7 at t=46.\n\nt=46, on y=7, U to y=8 at t=47.\n\nt=47, on y=8, U to y=9 at t=48.\n\nThen at t=48, y=9.\n\nBut I used three stays, so more turns.\n\nFrom t=42 to t=45, I stayed at y=6 for four turns? Let's see actions.\n\nAt t=42: on y=6, take S, to y=6 at t=43\n\nTurn t=43: y=6, take S, to y=6 at t=44\n\nTurn t=44: y=6, take S, to y=6 at t=45\n\nTurn t=45: y=6, take U, to y=7 at t=46\n\n etc.\n\nBut at t=43, I could have gone to y=7, but I stayed to avoid later issue.\n\nBut in this case, I reached y=6 at t=42, then stayed until t=45, then up.\n\nBut at t=43, if I go to y=7, I have to go down at t=43 to avoid, which I did earlier.\n\nBut here with stays at y=6, I have more actions.\n\nTo minimize, I should only stay for the necessary time.\n\nThe unsafe period is t=44 and t=45, so I need to be on a safe row at those turns.\n\nAt t=44 and t=45, I can be on y=6, for example.\n\nI need to be on y=6 at t=44 and t=45.\n\nAt t=43, I can be on y=6 or y=7.\n\nIf on y=6 at t=43, I can take S to stay on y=6 at t=44 and t=45.\n\nIf on y=7 at t=43, I must take D to go to y=6 at t=44, then at t=44 take S to stay at y=6 at t=45.\n\nThen at t=45, on y=6, take U to y=7 at t=46, etc.\n\nIn both cases, I have at least one extra down or stay.\n\nThe minimal way is to be at y=6 at t=43, then stay for two turns at t=44 and t=45 on y=6.\n\nThen go up.\n\nSequence:\n\n- t=36: U to y=1 at t=37\n\n- t=37: U to y=2 at t=38\n\n- t=38: U to y=3 at t=39\n\n- t=39: U to y=4 at t=40\n\n- t=40: U to y=5 at t=41\n\n- t=41: U to y=6 at t=42\n\n- t=42: U to y=7 at t=43? Or S?\n\nTo be on y=6 at t=43, so at t=42, on y=6, take S to y=6 at t=43\n\nThen:\n\n- t=42: S to y=6 at t=43\n\n- t=43: on y=6, take S to y=6 at t=44\n\n- t=44: on y=6, take S to y=6 at t=45\n\n- t=45: on y=6, take U to y=7 at t=46\n\n- t=46: on y=7, U to y=8 at t=47\n\n- t=47: on y=8, U to y=9 at t=48\n\nPosition at t=48=9.\n\nActions from t=36 to t=47: 12 actions.\n\nH=12 for actions, position at t_1 + H =36+12=48.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =36 +12 -1=47, position at t=47 should be 9, but in this case at t=47, y=8, not 9.\n\nMistake.\n\nPosition at turn T.\n\nAt turn t=47, in above, after action at t=46, to y at t=47.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAfter action at t=46: U from y=7 to y=8 at t=47\n\nSo at turn t=47, y=8\n\nThen at t=47, take action U, to y=9 at t=48.\n\nSo at turn t=47, y=8, not 9.\n\nWe need position at t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nWith actions from t=36 to t=46: 11 actions, H=11.\n\nPosition after last action at t=46 is at t=47, y=8.\n\nBut we want position at t=47 to be 9, so not.\n\nTo have position at T=48 be 9, with actions to a_{47}, for example.\n\nThen t_1 + H -1 =48, so for H=13, actions to a_{48}, position at t=48 before action a_{48} is 9.\n\nI think I have to accept H=13.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach earlier.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=9 from y=8 at t=46.\n\nBut at t=46, y=8 requires at t=45 y=7 or 8, but t=45 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo minimal H is 13.\n\nBut in the answer, I need the sequence.\n\nAnother thought: at the beginning, y=6 is unsafe only at t=36, but I am not on it.\n\nIn the direct path, the problem is only at t=44 on y=8.\n\nBut y=8 is also unsafe at t=36,37, but early.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I can go down at some point to delay, but that seems worse.\n\nI think 13 is the minimal.\n\nSo let's write the sequence with H=13.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t=36: U  (to y=1 at t=37)\n\nTurn t=37: U  (y=2 at t=38)\n\nTurn t=38: U  (y=3 at t=39)\n\nTurn t=39: U  (y=4 at t=40)\n\nTurn t=40: U  (y=5 at t=41)\n\nTurn t=41: U  (y=6 at t=42)\n\nTurn t=42: S  (stay at y=6 at t=43)  // to be at y=6 for t=43\n\nTurn t=43: S  (stay at y=6 at t=44)  // avoid\n\nTurn t=44: S  (stay at y=6 at t=45)  // avoid\n\nTurn t=45: U  ( to y=7 at t=46)\n\nTurn t=46: U  ( to y=8 at t=47)\n\nTurn t=47: U  ( to y=9 at t=48)\n\nNow at turn t=48, y=9.\n\nFor the sequence, actions from t=36 to t=47, but that's 12 actions, H=12.\n\nPosition at t=48.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =36 +12 -1=47, position at t=47 should be 9, but it is 8, not 9.\n\nProblem.\n\nWith 12 actions, position at t_1 + H =36+12=48.\n\nBut we need position at t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nSo for position at T=48 to be 9, T = t_1 + H -1 =48, so 36 + H -1=48, H-1=12, H=13.\n\nThen actions at t=36 to t=36+12= t=48.\n\nSo I need to include action at t=48.\n\nAt t=48, position y=9, take action S, for example.\n\nThen the sequence has 13 actions.\n\nTurn t=36: U\n\nTurn t=37: U\n\nTurn t=38: U\n\nTurn t=39: U\n\nTurn t=40: U\n\nTurn t=41: U\n\nTurn t=42: S  ( to y=6 at t=43)\n\nTurn t=43: S  ( to y=6 at t=44)\n\nTurn t=44: S  ( to y=6 at t=45)\n\nTurn t=45: U  ( to y=7 at t=46)\n\nTurn t=46: U  ( to y=8 at t=47)\n\nTurn t=47: U  ( to y=9 at t=48)\n\nTurn t=48: S  ( stay at y=9, but position at t=48 is already 9)\n\nAt turn t=48, y=9, then I take S to stay.\n\nBut the position at turn t=48 is 9 before the action.\n\nSo it satisfies y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{48} =9 for H=13.\n\nActions from a_{36} to a_{48}.\n\nIn the sequence above, I have up to t=47, need to add t=48 S.\n\nBut at t=48, I am at y=9, so I can take S.\n\nNow, to save one action, but I think it's necessary.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at t=47.\n\nHow?\n\nAt t=47, y=9.\n\nRequires that at t=46, y=8, take U to y=9 at t=47.\n\nAt t=46, on y=8, safe.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at t=46, as before, requires at t=45 on y=7 or 8, but t=45 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo minimal H is 13.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\nBut let's confirm the car states.\n\nIn the sequence, at no point am I on an unsafe row at wrong time.\n\nFor example, at t=44, on y=6, safe.\n\nt=45, on y=6, safe.\n\nt=46, on y=7, safe.\n\netc.\n\nYes.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nH=13\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: S\n\nTurn 43: S\n\nTurn 44: S\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: S  // to stay at 9, but action at turn 48\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=36 to t=48.\n\nBut at turn 42: action S, position at t=43 is y=6\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the output format.\n\nBut I think I can start with fewer up moves, but it won't reduce H.\n\nSo this should be minimal.\n\nPerhaps I can have the stay earlier, but same H.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn 36 in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the sequence of actions must account for the unsafe times on certain freeways. The unsafe times for each freeway are derived from the car states at turn 36 and their movement rules:\n\n- Freeway 1: Unsafe at turns 52, 53, 54, 55 (no issue in the relevant timeframe).\n- Freeway 2: Always safe.\n- Freeway 3: Always safe.\n- Freeway 4: Always safe.\n- Freeway 5: Always safe.\n- Freeway 6: Unsafe only at turn 36.\n- Freeway 7: Unsafe at turns 36, 37, 44, 45.\n- Freeway 8: Unsafe at turns 36, 37, 44, 45.\n\nThe key unsafe periods to avoid are:\n- Freeways 7 and 8 are unsafe at turns 44 and 45. Therefore, the player must not be on rows 7 or 8 at these turns.\n- Freeway 6 is unsafe only at turn 36, which is not an issue after turn 36.\n\nThe minimal path involves moving up as quickly as possible to row 5, then waiting on row 6 during turns 44 and 45 to avoid the unsafe rows 7 and 8. After the unsafe period, the player moves up to row 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is designed as follows:\n- Turns 36 to 41: Move up (U) each turn to reach row 6 by turn 42.\n- Turns 42 to 44: Stay (S) on row 6 to avoid being on rows 7 or 8 during turns 44 and 45.\n- Turns 45 to 47: Move up (U) to reach row 8 by turn 47 and row 9 by turn 48.\n- Turn 48: Stay (S) to remain at row 9, as the position is already achieved.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 48 with \\(H = 13\\) turns (actions from turn 36 to turn 48). The position at turn 48 (which is \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 36 + 13 - 1 = 48\\)) is (0, 9), and no collisions occur as the player is only on safe rows during unsafe times.\n\n**Minimal number of turns:** \\(H = 13\\)\n\n**Sequence of actions:**\n- Turn 36: U (move to row 1 at turn 37)\n- Turn 37: U (move to row 2 at turn 38)\n- Turn 38: U (move to row 3 at turn 39)\n- Turn 39: U (move to row 4 at turn 40)\n- Turn 40: U (move to row 5 at turn 41)\n- Turn 41: U (move to row 6 at turn 42)\n- Turn 42: S (stay on row 6 at turn 43)\n- Turn 43: S (stay on row 6 at turn 44)\n- Turn 44: S (stay on row 6 at turn 45)\n- Turn 45: U (move to row 7 at turn 46)\n- Turn 46: U (move to row 8 at turn 47)\n- Turn 47: U (move to row 9 at turn 48)\n- Turn 48: S (stay on row 9 at turn 49; position at turn 48 is (0, 9))\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 36: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 39: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 40: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 41: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 42: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 43: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 44: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 45: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 46: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 47: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 48: \\text{ S} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,0) at turn 42 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens if at any turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes over time based on the car's speed and direction.\n\nThe key point is that when you move to a new y, you're not on that new y until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, you're still on y at turn T, and you arrive at y+1 at turn T+1. Therefore, you only check for collision on the freeway you're currently on at each turn.\n\nAlso, since you start at y=0, which is not a freeway, no collision there. And y=9 is the goal, also not a freeway, so no issue there. The freeways are y=1 to y=8.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions to get to y=9 quickly without getting hit by cars on y=1 to y=8.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. All cars are moving right, according to the table. Direction is \"right\" for all, so they're moving to the right, meaning their position increases over time.\n\nFor right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s*(T - t1), h + s*(T - t1)], since head and tail, but in the update, for right-moving, it says Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)], and since it's right-moving, head should be the front, so if at t1, span is [τ, h], with h > τ, I assume, because it's moving right.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1, it says (-48, -59, right, 3). -48 and -59? That seems odd because -48 is greater than -59, so if it's moving right, increasing, then head should be the larger number? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the table: Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nSince it's right-moving, and h = -48, τ = -59, so τ < h, so the car is from τ to h, with h being the front.\n\nAt time t1, span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nThen at time T, for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCollision if 0 is in Span(T) for the freeway the player is on at turn T.\n\nNow t1 = 42.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at turn t1=42.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y can only change by -1,0,+1, the minimum number of turns to go from 0 to 9 is 9 turns if I always go up, but I might have to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 9.\n\nBut I should aim for minimal H.\n\nFirst, I need to see for each freeway, when there is a car that covers x=0 at certain times.\n\nSince the player is always at x=0, we only care about when a car's span includes 0.\n\nFor each freeway and each car, I need to find the times when 0 is within the span at that turn.\n\nThen for each turn that the player is on that freeway, it must not be one of those times.\n\nNow, since the cars move continuously in time, but turns are discrete, so we evaluate at integer turns T.\n\nT is turn number, so time is discrete.\n\nNow, for a car on a freeway, at turn T, span is [τ + s*(T - t1), h + s*(T - t1)] for right-moving, and similarly for left, but all are right here.\n\nt1=42.\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - t1, so Δt is the number of turns after t1.\n\nAt turn T = t1 + Δt, span is [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt] for a right-moving car.\n\n0 is in span if τ + s*Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s*Δt.\n\nSince the car is moving right, h + s*Δt is increasing, τ + s*Δt is increasing.\n\nThe inequality τ + s*Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s*Δt must hold.\n\nNow, since τ and h are given at t1.\n\nLet's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: h=-48, τ=-59, s=3, right-moving.\n\nAt Δt, span: [ -59 + 3Δt, -48 + 3Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 3Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 3Δt\n\nSo -59 + 3Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 3Δt ≤ 59 ⇒ Δt ≤ 59/3 ≈ 19.666, so Δt ≤ 19 since integer\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -48 + 3Δt ⇒ 48 ≤ 3Δt ⇒ Δt ≥ 16\n\nSo for Δt from 16 to 19 inclusive.\n\nΔt = T - t1, so at turns T = t1 + 16 to t1 + 19, i.e., 42+16=58 to 42+19=61.\n\nSo on freeway 1, car covers x=0 from turn 58 to 61.\n\nBut only if the player is on freeway 1 at that time.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car: h=48, τ=37, s=12, right-moving? Head and tail: (48,37,right,12), so τ=37, h=48, so at t1, span [37,48]\n\nAt Δt, [37 + 12Δt, 48 + 12Δt]\n\n0 in span: 37 +12Δt ≤0 and 0≤48+12Δt\n\n0≤48+12Δt always true since both positive for Δt≥0\n\n37+12Δt ≤0 ⇒ 12Δt ≤ -37 ⇒ Δt ≤ -37/12 ≈ -3.083, but Δt ≥0, so never true.\n\nThus, for freeway 2, no time when car covers x=0. The car is at position around 37 to 48 at t1, moving right, so it's always to the right, never reaches x=0. Similarly for others with similar values.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2: (48,37,right,12) identical, so same, no collision possible.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (48,37,right,12), no issue.\n\nFreeway 5: same, (48,37,right,12), no issue.\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: same as above, never at x=0.\n\nSecond car: h=0, τ=-11, s=12, right-moving.\n\nAt t1, span [τ, h] = [-11, 0]? Head h=0, tail τ=-11, so if moving right, head is front, so at t1, it's from -11 to 0, so x=0 is included at t1.\n\nSpan at t1 is [τ, h] = [-11, 0] for this car.\n\nThen at Δt, [ -11 + 12Δt, 0 + 12Δt ] = [ -11 +12Δt, 12Δt ]\n\n0 in span: -11 +12Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 12Δt\n\n0 ≤ 12Δt always true for Δt ≥0\n\n-11 +12Δt ≤0 ⇒ 12Δt ≤11 ⇒ Δt ≤ 11/12 ≈ 0.916, so Δt ≤ 0 since integer.\n\nΔt =0: at Δt=0, T=t1=42, span [-11,0], so 0 is included.\n\nFor Δt=1, span [-11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in, since 1>0.\n\nSo only at Δt=0, T=42, 0 is in span for this car on freeway 6.\n\nBut at T=42, if player is on freeway 6, there would be collision.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: h=-48, τ=-59, s=6, right-moving.\n\nAt Δt, span [ -59 +6Δt, -48 +6Δt ]\n\n0 in span: -59 +6Δt ≤0 and 0≤ -48 +6Δt\n\n0≤ -48 +6Δt ⇒ 48≤6Δt ⇒ Δt ≥ 8\n\n-59 +6Δt ≤0 ⇒ 6Δt ≤59 ⇒ Δt ≤ 59/6 ≈9.833, so Δt ≤9\n\nThus Δt from 8 to 9 inclusive, T= t1+8=50 to t1+9=51.\n\nSecond car: h=0, τ=-11, s=6, right-moving.\n\nAt Δt, [ -11 +6Δt, 0 +6Δt ] = [ -11+6Δt, 6Δt ]\n\n0 in span: -11+6Δt ≤0 and 0≤6Δt\n\n0≤6Δt always for Δt≥0\n\n-11+6Δt ≤0 ⇒ 6Δt ≤11 ⇒ Δt ≤11/6≈1.833, so Δt=0 or 1.\n\nAt Δt=0, T=42, span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nAt Δt=1, T=43, span [-11+6,6] = [-5,6], 0 in since -5≤0≤6.\n\nAt Δt=2, span [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for second car, 0 in span at Δt=0 and 1, T=42 and 43.\n\nNow for freeway 7, both cars: but collision if either car has 0 in span at time T when player is on y=7.\n\nSo times when collision possible on y=7:\n\nFrom first car: T=50,51\n\nFrom second car: T=42,43\n\nSo overall, on y=7, collision at T=42,43,50,51.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6) same as freeway 7.\n\nSo identical to freeway 7: collision at T=42,43,50,51.\n\nNow freeway 6: we have two cars, but first one never at 0, second one at T=42 only.\n\nAt T=42, for the second car, 0 in span.\n\nBut on freeway 6, only at T=42, since for other times, no car covers 0.\n\nFirst car is at [48,37]? Earlier: (48,37,right,12), but at t1, [37,48], moving right, never to the left, so yes.\n\nSo on freeway 6, collision only possible at T=42.\n\nNow freeway 1: collision at T=58 to 61, as before.\n\nFreeways 2,3,4,5: no collision possible at any time, since cars are at high x and moving right.\n\nNow, player starts at y=0 at turn 42.\n\ny=0 is safe, no freeway.\n\nAt each turn, player chooses action: U, D, or S.\n\nAfter action, y changes for the next turn.\n\nLet’s denote the turn sequence.\n\nAt turn T, player is at position y_T.\n\nAt turn T, player chooses action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T, with Δy_T based on a_T.\n\nThen at turn T, player is on freeway y_T, and must not have collision there.\n\nCollision depends on the freeway at turn T.\n\nPlayer starts at T=42, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_42, y_43 is set.\n\nThen at turn 43, player is at y_43, and so on.\n\nWe need to reach y_T =9 for some T, and we want minimal H such that at turn t1 + H -1, y=9? Let's see the sequence.\n\nDefine the turns.\n\nSet t1=42.\n\nAt turn 42: position y_42=0\n\nAction a_42: determines y_43\n\nThen at turn 43: position y_43, check for collision on freeway y_43 if y_43 between 1 and 8.\n\nSimilarly, after action a_43, y_44 is set, and so on.\n\nWe need y_{42 + k} =9 for some k, and we want the smallest such k, but H is the number of turns, I think.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1, so actions a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}, and after H actions, we have y_{t1 + H} =9? Let's see.\n\nPlayer position: at turn t, y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo to have y_T =9 at turn T.\n\nWe start at turn t1=42, y_42=0.\n\nAfter H actions, we want y_{42 + H} =9.\n\nThe actions are a_{42} to a_{42 + H -1}, and after that, at turn 42+H, position is 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from 0 to H-1: a_{t1 + t}, so a_{42}, a_{43}, ..., a_{42 + H -1}\n\nAnd y_{42 + H} =9.\n\nThe number of turns in the sequence is H.\n\nMinimal H such that we can reach y=9 in H steps.\n\nSince we start at y=0, and go to y=9, minimum possible H is 9, if we always go up.\n\nBut we need to avoid the freeway collisions.\n\nNow, the dangerous freeways are:\n\n- y=6: collision only at T=42\n\n- y=7: collision at T=42,43,50,51\n\n- y=8: collision at T=42,43,50,51 (same as y=7)\n\n- y=1: collision at T=58 to 61, but that might be later, and since we want to go quickly, we might not be there at that time if we move fast.\n\nFirst, at turn 42, player is at y=0, which is safe.\n\nAction a_42: if we go up to y=1, then at turn 43, we are on y=1.\n\ny=1 is freeway, but from earlier, freeway 1 has no collision except at T=58-61, which is later, so at T=43, no collision on y=1, since for y=1, car only at T=58-61.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down, y= -1, but y min is 0, so we can't go below 0. The position is clipped to [0,9], so if at y=0 and action D, y stays 0? The update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if y_t=0 and a_t=D, Δy_t = -1, but y_{t+1} = max(0, min(9, y_t + Δy)), so y_{t+1} = max(0, -1) =0.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9 and U, stays 9.\n\nSo at y=0, D or S both keep y=0.\n\nNow, back to action at turn 42.\n\nIf we take a_42 = U, then y_43 =1.\n\nThen at turn 43, we are on y=1.\n\nOn y=1, at T=43, no collision, as per freeway 1 car only dangerous at 58-61.\n\nThen we can continue.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9.\n\nThe problem is with y=6,7,8 which have collisions at early times.\n\nSpecifically, y=6 is dangerous only at T=42.\n\nBut at T=42, player is at y=0, not on y=6, so no issue.\n\ny=6 collision at T=42 only? At T=42, if player is on y=6, collision, but at turn 42, player is at y=0, so not on any freeway, safe.\n\nThen at turn 43, if player is on y=6, then collision if T=43.\n\nBut y=6 collision only at T=42? Earlier for freeway 6: second car at T=42 only.\n\nAt T=43, for y=6, is there collision?\n\nFreeway 6: cars: first car never at 0, second car: at Δt=1, T=43, span [ -11+12*1, 12*1] = [1,12], 0 not in, so no collision at T=43 on y=6.\n\nSimilarly, only at T=42 it was dangerous, but player not on it at T=42.\n\nSo for y=6, no collision at any time except T=42, which is passed.\n\nAt T=42, player not on freeway, so y=6 is safe to be on at any time except possibly other cars, but no.\n\nFreeway 6 has only those two cars, and first one never at 0, second only at T=42, so for T≠42, no collision on y=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=7: collision at T=42,43,50,51.\n\ny=8 same.\n\ny=1: collision at T=58-61.\n\nBut since we want minimal H, we can go directly up quickly.\n\nSuppose we go up as fast as possible: always U.\n\nStart: T=42, y=0, action a_42=U, so y_43=1\n\nT=43, y=1, on freeway 1. At T=43, no collision on y=1 (only at 58-61). Action a_43=U, y_44=2\n\nT=44, y=2, freeway 2. But freeway 2 has no cars that cover x=0 at any time, as we saw. Similarly for y=3,4,5.\n\nFreeways 2,3,4,5 all have cars like (48,37,right,12), which are at high x and moving right, so never near x=0, so no collision possible on these freeways at any time.\n\nSo we can pass through safely.\n\nContinue: a_44=U, y_45=3\n\nT=45, y=3, safe, a_45=U, y_46=4\n\nT=46, y=4, safe, a_46=U, y_47=5\n\nT=47, y=5, safe, a_47=U, y_48=6\n\nNow T=48, y=6, on freeway 6.\n\nAt T=48, is there collision on y=6?\n\nAs above, freeway 6: only danger at T=42, which is past. At T=48, no car covers x=0, so safe.\n\nAction a_48=U, y_49=7\n\nT=49, y=7, on freeway 7.\n\nAt T=49, is collision on y=7?\n\nFreeway 7: collision at T=42,43,50,51.\n\nT=49 not in {42,43,50,51}, so should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, action a_49=U, y_50=8\n\nT=50, y=8, on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 collision at T=42,43,50,51.\n\nT=50 is in the list, so at T=50, on y=8, collision occurs because at T=50, for freeway 8, 0 is in span of one of the cars.\n\nSpecifically, for y=8, same as y=7: first car at T=50,51, second at T=42,43.\n\nSo at T=50, first car: Δt = T - t1 = 50 - 42 = 8, span for first car: [ -59 +6*8, -48 +6*8] = [ -59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0], so 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, second car at T=50: Δt=8, [ -11 +6*8, 6*8] = [-11+48, 48] = [37,48], 0 not in, but first car has it.\n\nSo at T=50, on y=8, collision.\n\nTherefore, if we arrive at y=8 at turn 50, we have collision.\n\nIn the sequence above, at T=50, y=8, collision.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=8 at turn 50.\n\nSimilarly, at T=51, also collision on y=8.\n\nNow, in the direct up path, we have:\n\nT=49: y=7\n\nThen a_49=U would make y_50=8, but at T=50, y=8, collision.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=8 at T=50 or 51.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at T=50 or 51 is also dangerous, but at T=49, y=7 is safe, as above.\n\nAt T=49, y=7 is safe because collision times for y=7 are 42,43,50,51, not 49.\n\nThen at T=49, if we do not go up, but stay or down.\n\nBut we need to go to y=8 eventually.\n\ny=8 is dangerous at T=50 and 51.\n\nSo we should not be on y=8 at those turns.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 is dangerous at T=50 and 51 as well? y=7 collision at T=50,51? Yes, from above.\n\nFreeway 7: collision at T=42,43,50,51.\n\nSo at T=50 and T=51, if on y=7, collision.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, in the sequence, at T=49, we are at y=7.\n\nIf we go up to y=8 at turn 50, collision.\n\nIf we stay, a_49=S, then y_50=7, but at T=50, on y=7, collision! Because T=50 is dangerous for y=7.\n\nIf we go down, a_49=D, y_50=6, then at T=50, on y=6.\n\nNow, y=6 at T=50: is it safe?\n\nFreeway 6: only danger was at T=42, and at T=50, no car covers x=0, so safe.\n\nThen we can be on y=6 at T=50.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom T=49, y=7, if we go down to y_50=6, then at T=50, y=6, safe.\n\nThen we need to go up later.\n\nBut we might waste time.\n\nWe could delay going to y=7 or y=8.\n\nIn the direct up, we reached y=7 at T=49.\n\nT=49 is safe for y=7.\n\nBut at T=49, if we go up, we hit y=8 at T=50, collision.\n\nIf we stay, at T=50, y=7, collision.\n\nIf we go down, to y=6 at T=50, safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut let's see the timing.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 during T=50 and T=51.\n\nAlso, y=6 is safe at all times except T=42, which is past.\n\ny=5,4,etc. safe.\n\nNow, the dangerous period is T=50 and T=51 for y=7 and y=8.\n\nSo we can be on y=7 or y=8 only outside these times.\n\nFor example, before T=50 or after T=51.\n\nSince we are going up, we might reach earlier or later.\n\nIn the min time path, we reached y=7 at T=49, which is before 50.\n\nThen at T=49, we can stay on y=7 or go down, but if we stay, at T=50 we have collision on y=7.\n\nSo we must not be on y=7 or y=8 at T=50 and T=51.\n\nTherefore, at T=49, we should go down to y=6 to avoid being on y=7 at T=50.\n\nThen at T=50, we are on y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=50, we can choose action.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=8 is dangerous at T=50,51, so we should go to y=8 after T=51.\n\nSimilarly for y=7.\n\nAfter T=51, y=7 and y=8 are safe again.\n\nFor example, at T=52, on y=7: freeway 7 collision times 42,43,50,51, so T=52 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at T=52 safe.\n\nNow, from above:\n\nAt T=49, y=7, we do a_49=D, so y_50=6\n\nThen T=50, y=6, safe. Now we can go up or stay.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are safe after T=51, we can wait on y=6 until it's safe to go up.\n\nAt T=50, y=6, we can do S or U or D.\n\nIf we go up, a_50=U, then y_51=7\n\nBut at T=51, if we are on y=7, collision, since T=51 dangerous for y=7.\n\nIf a_50=U, y_51=7, then at T=51, y=7, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf a_50=S, y_51=6, then at T=51, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=51, we can do action.\n\nBut T=51, if we go to y=7, a_51=U, y_52=7, then at T=52, y=7, which is safe, since T=52 not dangerous.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo let's outline the sequence.\n\nStart: T=42, y=0, a_42=U, y_43=1\n\nT=43, y=1, a_43=U, y_44=2\n\nT=44, y=2, a_44=U, y_45=3\n\nT=45, y=3, a_45=U, y_46=4\n\nT=46, y=4, a_46=U, y_47=5\n\nT=47, y=5, a_47=U, y_48=6\n\nT=48, y=6, a_48=U, y_49=7\n\nNow T=49, y=7, safe (since not 42,43,50,51)\n\nNow at T=49, we need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at T=50 and T=51.\n\nSo if we go up to y=8, we are on y=8 at T=50, collision.\n\nIf we stay, on y=7 at T=50, collision.\n\nSo we must go down to y=6.\n\na_49=D, so y_50=6\n\nNow T=50, y=6, safe.\n\nAt T=50, if we go up to y=7, a_50=U, y_51=7, then at T=51, y=7, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo we should not go to y=7 at T=51.\n\nThus at T=50, we can stay or go down, but going down to y=5 might not help.\n\na_50=S, so y_51=6\n\nThen T=51, y=6, safe (since y=6 only dangerous at T=42, passed)\n\nNow at T=51, we can go up to y=7, a_51=U, y_52=7\n\nThen T=52, y=7, now T=52, not in {42,43,50,51}, so safe for y=7.\n\nThen a_52=U, y_53=8\n\nT=53, y=8, T=53, not dangerous for y=8 (times 42,43,50,51), so safe.\n\nThen a_53=U, y_54=9\n\nT=54, y=9, goal reached.\n\nNow, H: we started from turn 42, after H actions, y_{42+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, y_54=9, so 42 + H =54, thus H=12.\n\nActions from a_42 to a_53? Let's list:\n\nActions: a_42 to a_53, that's 12 actions: t from 42 to 53, 12 turns? Turns: 42 to 53 inclusive is 12 actions.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=42 to t=53, that's 12 actions: 42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53.\n\nAfter a_53, y_54=9.\n\nYes.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nEarlier direct up would have reached at T=51, but had collision at T=50.\n\ny_51=9 in direct up? Let's see.\n\nDirect up: from y=0 at T=42, after 9 ups: y_51=9? T=42: y=0, after a_42: y_43=1, ..., after a_50: y_51=9? Let's index.\n\nStart T=42, y=0\n\na_42=U: y_43=1\n\na_43=U: y_44=2\n\n...\n\nAfter k ups, y_{42+k} = k\n\nSet y_{42+k} =9, so k=9, thus at turn 42+9=51, y=9.\n\nActions a_42 to a_50: 9 actions.\n\na_42 to a_50 is 9 actions: t=42 to 50, 9 steps.\n\nAfter a_50, y_51=9.\n\nBut in this path, at T=50, we were on y=8, which caused collision, so we couldn't do that.\n\nIn the safe path above, we reached at T=54 with H=12 actions.\n\nBut we might reach earlier.\n\nFor example, instead of going down at T=49, we could have delayed going up earlier.\n\nWe reached y=7 at T=49.\n\ny=7 is safe at T=49, but we cannot stay or go up immediately because of T=50,51.\n\nWe have to leave y=7 before T=50.\n\nSince we are at y=7 at T=49, and T=49 is safe, but we must not be on y=7 or y=8 at T=50 and T=51.\n\nSo at T=49, we can go down to y=6, as we did.\n\nCould we go to y=5 or something? But that might take more time.\n\nAnother idea: from y=6 at T=48, instead of going up to y=7 at T=49, we could stay on y=6 for a while, then go up after T=51.\n\nBut we were at y=6 at T=48, which is safe.\n\nIf at T=48, we do not go up, but stay: a_48=S, y_49=6\n\nThen T=49, y=6, safe.\n\nThen a_49=S, y_50=6\n\nT=50, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=50, we can go up: a_50=U, y_51=7\n\nBut at T=51, y=7, collision! Because T=51 dangerous for y=7.\n\nSo we cannot go to y=7 at T=51.\n\nThus at T=50, if we go up, y_51=7, collision at T=51.\n\nSo we need to stay on y=6 until T=51 or later.\n\nAt T=50, a_50=S, y_51=6\n\nThen T=51, y=6, safe.\n\nThen a_51=U, y_52=7\n\nT=52, y=7, safe (T=52 not dangerous)\n\nThen a_52=U, y_53=8\n\nT=53, y=8, safe\n\na_53=U, y_54=9\n\nSame as before, H=12.\n\nFrom y=6 at T=50, we could go down to y=5, but that would take longer to go up later.\n\nFor example, at T=50, y=6, a_50=D, y_51=5, then T=51, y=5, safe, but then we have to go up from 5 to 9, which takes 4 more ups, reaching at y_55=9 or something, later than 54.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the previous path with H=12 seems reasonable.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nSuppose we go slower earlier to avoid reaching y=7 too soon.\n\nFor example, at some point, we stay or go down to delay.\n\nBut since we start from low, going down might not help.\n\nStart at y=0, we need to go up, so we cannot delay much at low levels.\n\nFor instance, at T=42, if we do not go up immediately, but stay: a_42=S, y_43=0, still safe, but then we are wasting time, and we need to go up later.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down, but y=0, D keeps y=0.\n\nSo not useful.\n\nThus, the fastest is to go up directly until y=6 or so, then handle the danger zone.\n\nWe reached y=7 at T=49.\n\nThe danger for y=7,8 is at T=50,51.\n\nSo we need to be below y=7 at T=50 and T=51.\n\nAt T=50, if y=6, safe, as we did.\n\nThen at T=51, y=6, safe.\n\nThen go up from T=51 to T=52: y=7, etc.\n\nWe can go up to y=7 at T=52, which is safe.\n\nIs there a way to be at y=8 before T=50 or after T=51?\n\nBut T=50 and 51 are consecutive, so before would be earlier.\n\nBut we were at y=7 at T=49, which is before, but we cannot go to y=8 at T=50 because that causes collision at T=50 for y=8.\n\nIf we go to y=8 earlier.\n\nFor example, can we reach y=8 before T=50?\n\nIn the direct path, we reached y=8 at T=50: from above, y_50=8 in direct path.\n\nBut at T=50, collision.\n\nTo reach y=8 before T=50, say at T=49.\n\nBut at T=49, if y=8, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 8: collision at T=42,43,50,51.\n\nT=49 not in, so should be safe.\n\nBut can we be at y=8 at T=49?\n\nFrom start: to reach y=8 at turn T.\n\nSince we start at y=0 at T=42, after 8 ups, y_{42+8}=y_50=8? Let's see.\n\ny_42=0\n\nAfter first U: y_43=1\n\n...\n\nAfter 8th U: y_{42+8}=y_50=8\n\ny_{42} =0\n\na_42: y_43=1 (after 1 U)\n\na_43: y_44=2 (2)\n\n...\n\na_49: y_50=8? After action at T=49, y_50 is set.\n\nAfter k actions, y_{42+k}\n\nSet y_{42+k}=8, so k=8, turn 50.\n\nTo have y_T=8 at earlier turn, say T=49.\n\ny_49=8.\n\nThen from y_42=0, to y_49=8, that takes 8 steps? From T=42 to T=49, that's 7 actions to go from y=0 to y=8? No.\n\nPosition at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nFrom turn 42 to turn 49, that's 7 turns later? Turns: T=42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49: 8 turns including 42, but actions between.\n\nBetter to think of the number of actions to reach a position.\n\nTo go from y=0 at T=42 to y=8 at some turn.\n\nThe earliest: if we always go up, each up increases y by 1, so from y=0 to y=8, need 8 actions.\n\nAfter 8 actions, y_{42+8}=y_50=8.\n\nAt turn 50.\n\nWe cannot reach y=8 before turn 50 with min actions.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at turn 49: y_49=8.\n\nBut y_49=8 means that at turn 49, position is 8.\n\nFrom y_42=0, to y_49=8, that requires increasing y by 8 in 7 actions? From turn 42 to turn 49, the actions are a_42 to a_48, 7 actions? Let's see:\n\nAt T=42: before action, y_42=0\n\nAction a_42: determines y_43\n\n...\n\nAction a_48: determines y_49\n\nSo with actions from a_42 to a_48, that's 7 actions, we can set y_43 to y_49.\n\nTo have y_49=8, starting from y_42=0, we need to increase y by 8 in 7 actions? But each action can increase by at most 1, so with 7 actions, max y_49=7, if all U.\n\ny_49 <= y_42 + 7 = 7.\n\nSo y_49 <=7, cannot be 8 at turn 49.\n\nSimilarly, earliest to be at y=8 is at turn 50, with y_50=8.\n\nBut at T=50, if on y=8, collision.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 51, y=8, also collision.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=8 at turn 50 or 51.\n\nThe next safe time is turn 52 or later.\n\nSimilarly for y=7, we cannot be on it at turn 50 or 51.\n\nIn our path, we avoided by going down to y=6 at T=49, then stayed on y=6 until T=51, then went up to y=7 at T=52.\n\nWe could go to y=7 earlier, but at T=49 we were there, but had to leave.\n\nAnother point: we might go through y=7 and y=8 quickly before T=50.\n\nBut we can only be at y=8 at T=50 earliest, which is dangerous.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=7 at T=48 or something.\n\nBut let's see when we can reach y=7.\n\nEarliest: with 7 ups, y_{42+7}=y_49=7.\n\nAt turn 49, y=7, which is safe, as before.\n\nThen we cannot go higher immediately without hitting danger.\n\nSo I think H=12 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the sequence.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 42: action U, to y=1\n\nTurn 43: action U, to y=2\n\nTurn 44: action U, to y=3\n\nTurn 45: action U, to y=4\n\nTurn 46: action U, to y=5\n\nTurn 47: action U, to y=6\n\nTurn 48: action U, to y=7? No:\n\nAt turn 48: position y_48\n\nAfter action a_48, y_49 set.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt T=42: y=0, a_42=U → y_43=1\n\nT=43: y=1, a_43=U → y_44=2\n\nT=44: y=2, a_44=U → y_45=3\n\nT=45: y=3, a_45=U → y_46=4\n\nT=46: y=4, a_46=U → y_47=5\n\nT=47: y=5, a_47=U → y_48=6\n\nT=48: y=6, a_48=U → y_49=7\n\nT=49: y=7, a_49=D → y_50=6  (go down to avoid)\n\nT=50: y=6, a_50=S → y_51=6  (stay, since going up would go to y=7 at T=51, collision)\n\na_50=S, so y_51=6\n\nThen T=51: y=6, a_51=U → y_52=7\n\nT=52: y=7, a_52=U → y_53=8\n\nT=53: y=8, a_53=U → y_54=9\n\nNow, y_54=9, reached.\n\nNumber of actions: from a_42 to a_53, that's 12 actions.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut at T=50, we did S, but we could do something else.\n\nFor example, at T=50, y=6, we could go up to y=7, but then at T=51, y=7, collision, not good.\n\nOr go down, but worse.\n\nSo stay is fine.\n\nNow, we need to output the sequence for turns starting from t1=42.\n\nIn the sequence above, actions:\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: D\n\nTurn 50: S\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nAfter a_53, y_54=9.\n\nThe last action is at turn 53, and y_54=9.\n\nH=12, from t=0 to 11 relative, but in the sequence, actions from turn 42 to 53.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + H -1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nWith y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nHere, t_1=42, H=12, so actions from turn 42 to turn 42 + 11 = 53.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 42 + 12 -1 = 53.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd y_{42+12}=y_54=9.\n\nNow, but we have freeway 1 with danger at T=58-61, but since we reach before that, no issue.\n\nIn this path, we didn't go to y=1 at dangerous time, but it was safe.\n\nIs there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose we go slower at the beginning.\n\nFor example, at some point, we stay to delay.\n\nBut since the danger is at T=50,51 for high y, if we are slower, we might be at lower y at that time, but then we have to go up later.\n\nFor instance, suppose at T=42, we stay: a_42=S, y_43=0\n\nThen we start later.\n\nBut then we reach y=7 later, say at T=50 or something, but T=50 is dangerous for y=7.\n\nLet's see.\n\nIf we delay, we might hit the y=1 danger later, but y=1 danger is at T=58-61, which is late, so if we go fast, we avoid it.\n\nIn min time, we reach by T=54, before 58.\n\nBut with delay, we might reach later.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=0 for one turn: a_42=S, y_43=0\n\nThen a_43=U, y_44=1\n\n...\n\nThen similarly, we reach y=6 at T=49: let's compute.\n\nT=42: y=0, a_42=S → y_43=0\n\nT=43: y=0, a_43=U → y_44=1\n\nT=44: y=1, a_44=U → y_45=2\n\nT=45: y=2, a_45=U → y_46=3\n\nT=46: y=3, a_46=U → y_47=4\n\nT=47: y=4, a_47=U → y_48=5\n\nT=48: y=5, a_48=U → y_49=6\n\nT=49: y=6, a_49=U → y_50=7\n\nBut at T=50, y=7, and T=50 is dangerous for y=7, collision.\n\nThen we have problem.\n\nTo avoid, at T=49, y=6, we could not go up, but stay: a_49=S, y_50=6\n\nT=50: y=6, safe\n\nThen a_50=U, y_51=7, but T=51, y=7, collision.\n\na_50=S, y_51=6\n\nThen a_51=U, y_52=7, etc., same as before but started later, so reach y=9 later.\n\nFor example, with a_42=S, then y_43=0, then actions to y=9 take more turns.\n\nIn this case, from y=0 at T=43, need 9 ups to y_52=9? T=43: y=0, a_43=U: y_44=1, ..., after 9 actions: a_43 to a_51: y_52=9? y_44=1 after a_43, ..., y_{43+k} = k after k actions.\n\nSet y_{43+k}=9, k=9, turn 52.\n\nBut with the avoidance, we have extra steps, so later than 54.\n\nThus, the first path is better.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 12.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions:\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: D\n\nTurn 50: S\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nIn the output, it should be for each turn.\n\nAnd we need to box the answer.\n\nBut let's write it clearly.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 42\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the player must follow a sequence of actions that minimizes \\(H\\), the number of turns, and ensures no collision occurs at any turn.\n\n### Analysis of Car Collisions\n- **Freeway 1**: Collision occurs only at turns \\(T = 58\\) to \\(61\\) (inclusive). Since the player reaches the goal before these turns, this is not a concern for minimal \\(H\\).\n- **Freeway 2, 3, 4, 5**: No collision possible at any turn, as the cars are always at positions \\(x > 0\\) and moving right, never covering \\(x = 0\\).\n- **Freeway 6**: Collision occurs only at turn \\(T = 42\\). Since the player is at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 42, not on freeway 6, this is avoided.\n- **Freeway 7 and 8**: Collision occurs at turns \\(T = 42, 43, 50, 51\\). The player starts at \\(y = 0\\), so turns 42 and 43 are avoided. Turns 50 and 51 must be avoided for \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe critical collision times are \\(T = 50\\) and \\(T = 51\\) for freeways 7 and 8. To minimize \\(H\\), the player must reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible but avoid being on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at turns 50 and 51.\n\n### Minimal Path to Avoid Collisions\nThe fastest path to \\(y = 9\\) requires at least 9 turns if moving directly up, but this would place the player on \\(y = 8\\) at turn 50 (collision) or \\(y = 7\\) at turn 51 (collision). Therefore, a detour is necessary to avoid these collision times.\n\nThe minimal sequence involves:\n- Moving up directly to \\(y = 7\\) by turn 49 (safe, as \\(T = 49\\) is not a collision time for \\(y = 7\\)).\n- At turn 49, moving down to \\(y = 6\\) to avoid being on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at turns 50 and 51.\n- Staying at \\(y = 6\\) during turns 50 and 51 (safe, as \\(y = 6\\) has no collision at these times).\n- Moving up to \\(y = 9\\) starting from turn 51, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 54.\n\nThis sequence uses 12 turns (actions from turn 42 to turn 53, with \\(y_{54} = 9\\)).\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe actions are chosen as follows:\n- Turns 42 to 48: Move up (U) to reach \\(y = 7\\) by turn 49.\n- Turn 49: Move down (D) to \\(y = 6\\) to avoid collision at turn 50.\n- Turn 50: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 6\\) and avoid collision at turn 51.\n- Turns 51 to 53: Move up (U) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 54.\n\nThis sequence ensures no collision:\n- At turn 49 (\\(y = 7\\)): Safe, as \\(T = 49\\) not in {42, 43, 50, 51}.\n- At turn 50 (\\(y = 6\\)): Safe, as freeway 6 has no collision except at \\(T = 42\\) (passed).\n- At turn 51 (\\(y = 6\\)): Safe.\n- At turn 52 (\\(y = 7\\)): Safe, as \\(T = 52\\) not in {42, 43, 50, 51}.\n- At turn 53 (\\(y = 8\\)): Safe, as \\(T = 53\\) not in {42, 43, 50, 51}.\n\n### Output\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H = 12\\), with actions from turn 42 to turn 53:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 42: U \\\\\nTurn 43: U \\\\\nTurn 44: U \\\\\nTurn 45: U \\\\\nTurn 46: U \\\\\nTurn 47: U \\\\\nTurn 48: U \\\\\nTurn 49: D \\\\\nTurn 50: S \\\\\nTurn 51: U \\\\\nTurn 52: U \\\\\nTurn 53: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn 48 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For collision, it only happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. Also, when moving to a new freeway, you're not on it until the next turn, so you only check the freeway you're currently on for collision.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nFirst, I need to understand where the cars are at any given turn relative to t=48.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=0 for simplicity in calculations. So, t1=48, but I'll set τ = t - 48, so at τ=0, we start.\n\nPlayer position: y=0 at τ=0.\n\nCars:\n\nFor each freeway, the cars are given with their positions at τ=0 (t=48).\n\nI need to find when 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway for future turns.\n\nThe span changes with time based on speed and direction.\n\nLet me list all cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head h=-48, tail τ=-59? That should be tail, but it's written as tau, which might be confusing. I'll use \"tail\" to avoid confusion with time.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"head h, tail τ\", so τ is tail position.\n\nSo:\n\nFreeway 1: head = -48, tail = -59, direction = right, speed = 3\n\nSince direction is right, and it's moving right, so at time T, span is [tail + s(T - t1), head + s(T - t1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\nLeft-moving: span at T is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] but h and τ are positions at t1.\n\nFor left-moving, it says: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the notation, for left-moving, head and tail are given, but in the span, it's [h, τ], and since it's left-moving, as time increases, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it says head h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right.\n\nBut for right-moving, the span is given as [τ, h] at t1, so smaller to larger? Let's see.\n\nAt t1, for right-moving, span is [τ, h] meaning from tail to head, with τ ≤ h, I assume.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1: tail τ = -59, head h = -48, so since direction right, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-59 + 3(T-48), -48 + 3(T-48)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn the car state table, for some, it has multiple cars.\n\nLet me list all:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: tail=-59, head=-48, dir=right, speed=3 → span at t: [ -59 + 3(t-48), -48 + 3(t-48) ] for t > t1\n\nBut t is absolute turn, better to use relative time.\n\nSet t_rel = t - 48, so at t_rel=0, we start.\n\nFor freeway 1: at t_rel, span = [ -59 + 3*t_rel, -48 + 3*t_rel ]\n\nCollision on freeway 1 if 0 is in [ -59 + 3t, -48 + 3t ] for some t, where t is t_rel.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: one car: head=48, tail=37, dir=right, speed=12\n\nFor right-moving, span at t1: [tail, head] = [37, 48]\n\nAt t_rel, span = [37 + 12*t_rel, 48 + 12*t_rel]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? head=48, tail=37, dir=right, speed=12, so identical to freeway 2.\n\nBut freeway 3 is different row, but same car description? Probably separate freeway.\n\nFreeway 4: same, head=48, tail=37, dir=right, speed=12\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: first car (48,37,right,12) and second car (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: tail=37, head=48, dir=right, speed=12 → at t_rel, span [37 + 12t, 48 + 12t]\n\nSecond car: head=0, tail=-11, dir=right, speed=12 → for right-moving, span at t1: [tail, head] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt t_rel, span = [-11 + 12t, 0 + 12t] = [-11 + 12t, 12t]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: first (-48,-59,right,6) and second (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: head=-48, tail=-59, dir=right, speed=6 → span at t1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt t_rel, [ -59 + 6t, -48 + 6t ]\n\nSecond car: head=0, tail=-11, dir=right, speed=6 → span at t1: [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt t_rel, [ -11 + 6t, 0 + 6t ] = [-11 + 6t, 6t]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: first car (-48,-59,right,6), second (0,-11,right,6)\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at t_rel=0. y=0 is not a freeway, freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0, no cars, so safe. Similarly, y=9 is the goal, no cars.\n\nBut when the player is on a freeway y=1 to 8, we need to avoid collision at that turn.\n\nAlso, when moving, if you move at turn T, you are on y_T at turn T, and you move to y_{T+1} at turn T+1, so at turn T, you are only on freeway y_T, so you only care about cars on that freeway at that turn.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if y_T is between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, 0 is in some car's span at turn T.\n\n0 is the x-position, since the player is always at x=0.\n\nSo for each freeway and each turn, we need to know if there is a car where 0 is in its span.\n\nWe need to find for each freeway and each time, whether it is occupied at x=0.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, we can think per freeway the times when it is safe to be on it at x=0.\n\nBut since we move step by step, we need to plan the sequence.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when some car covers x=0.\n\nThen, when the player is on a freeway at time t, it must be that at that time, the freeway is safe.\n\nAlso, the player can stay or move.\n\nWe start at y=0, t_rel=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9, which is safe, no cars.\n\nMinimal H, so we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid unsafe times.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway the set of t_rel where it is unsafe.\n\nDefine t = t_rel for simplicity.\n\nFor freeway 1: car span [ -59 + 3t, -48 + 3t ]\n\n0 in this interval if -59 + 3t <= 0 <= -48 + 3t\n\nSo -59 + 3t <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 3t\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 3t <= 0 => 3t <= 59 => t <= 59/3 = 19.666, so t <= 19 since t integer\n\nt is turn, integer.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= -48 + 3t => 48 <= 3t => t >= 16\n\nSo t >= 16 and t <= 19? Let's see:\n\n-59 + 3t <= 0 => 3t <= 59 => t <= 19 since t integer, 59/3=19.666, so t <= 19\n\n-48 + 3t >= 0 => 3t >= 48 => t >= 16\n\nSo for t=16,17,18,19: -59+3*16 = -59+48= -11 <=0, -48+48=0>=0, so 0 in [-11,0]? At t=16, span [ -59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0], so 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly t=17: [-59+51, -48+51] = [-8,3], 0 in.\n\nt=18: [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nt=19: [-59+57, -48+57] = [-2,9], 0 in.\n\nt=20: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12], so safe.\n\nt=15: [-59+45, -48+45] = [-14,-3], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSo freeway 1 unsafe for t=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow freeway 2: car [37 + 12t, 48 + 12t]\n\n0 in this if 37 + 12t <= 0 <= 48 + 12t\n\nBut 37 + 12t <=0? 12t <= -37, t <= -37/12 ≈ -3.083, so t <= -4 since t integer? But t is t_rel >=0, so for t>=0, 37+12t >=37>0, so 0 < 37+12t <=0 impossible, so never 0 in [37+12t,48+12t] for t>=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, unsafe never.\n\nFreeway 4: same, unsafe never.\n\nFreeway 5: same, unsafe never.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: [37 + 12t, 48 + 12t], same as above, never covers 0 for t>=0.\n\nSecond car: [ -11 + 12t, 12t ]\n\n0 in this if -11 + 12t <= 0 <= 12t\n\nFirst: -11 + 12t <=0 => 12t <=11 => t <= 11/12 ≈0.916, so t<=0\n\nSecond: 0 <= 12t => t >=0\n\nSo at t=0: -11 +0 = -11 <=0, 0<=0, so 0 in [-11,0]? Span is [-11+12t, 12t], at t=0: [-11,0], so 0 included.\n\nt=1: [-11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nt=0: 0 in, so unsafe at t=0 for second car.\n\nFirst car never unsafe, so freeway 6 unsafe only at t=0.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: [ -59 + 6t, -48 + 6t ]\n\n0 in this if -59 + 6t <= 0 <= -48 + 6t\n\nFirst: -59 + 6t <=0 => 6t <=59 => t <= 59/6 ≈9.833, t<=9\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 6t => 6t >=48 => t>=8\n\nSo t>=8 and t<=9\n\nt=8: -59 +48 = -11 <=0, -48+48=0>=0, so 0 in [-11,0]\n\nt=9: -59+54= -5 <=0, -48+54=6>=0, 0 in [-5,6]\n\nt=10: -59+60=1>0, not <=0, so 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo unsafe t=8,9\n\nSecond car: [ -11 + 6t, 6t ]\n\n0 in this if -11 + 6t <=0 <= 6t\n\nFirst: -11+6t <=0 => 6t <=11 => t <= 11/6 ≈1.833, t<=1\n\nSecond: 0 <= 6t => t>=0\n\nSo t=0: -11+0= -11<=0, 0<=0, 0 in\n\nt=1: -11+6= -5 <=0, 6>=0, 0 in [-5,6]\n\nt=2: -11+12=1>0, not <=0, so 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo second car unsafe at t=0 and t=1\n\nNow for freeway 7, unsafe if either car covers 0.\n\nSo at t=0: both cars cover 0? First car at t=0: [ -59, -48], 0 not in, only second car covers 0.\n\nAt t=0: first car span [ -59, -48], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car [ -11, 0], 0 in, so unsafe.\n\nAt t=1: first car [ -59+6, -48+6] = [-53,-42], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car [ -11+6, 6] = [-5,6], 0 in, so unsafe.\n\nAt t=8: first car [ -59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nSecond car at t=8: [ -11+48, 48] = [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly t=9: first car [ -59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nSecond car [ -11+54, 54] = [43,54], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 7 unsafe at t=0 (from second car), t=1 (second car), t=8 (first car), t=9 (first car)\n\nt=0 and t=1 from second car, t=8 and t=9 from first car.\n\nNow freeway 8: same as freeway 7, since same cars, so unsafe at t=0,1,8,9.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway, unsafe times:\n\ny=1: unsafe t=16,17,18,19\n\ny=2: always safe (no car covers 0)\n\ny=3: always safe\n\ny=4: always safe\n\ny=5: always safe\n\ny=6: unsafe only at t=0\n\ny=7: unsafe at t=0,1,8,9\n\ny=8: unsafe at t=0,1,8,9\n\ny=0 and y=9: no freeway, always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0, t=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nEach turn, we can move up, down, or stay, changing y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nWe need a sequence of actions from t=0 to some H, with y_H =9.\n\nSince we want minimal H, we should go up as much as possible, but avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nAt t=0, we are at y=0, safe.\n\nNow, we need to move to higher y.\n\nBut y=1 to 8 have unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at t=0, if we go to y=1, but at t=0, y=1 might be unsafe?\n\nAt t=0, for y=1: freeway 1 unsafe only from t=16-19, so at t=0, freeway 1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2,3,4,5 always safe.\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=0, so at t=0, if on y=6, unsafe.\n\nBut at t=0, we are at y=0, not on freeway.\n\nWe take action at turn t to determine y_{t+1}.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T (which is t_rel), we are at position y_T.\n\nWe choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy based on a_T.\n\nThen at turn T, we are on freeway y_T (if y_T between 1 and 8), and we check collision for that freeway at turn T.\n\nAlso, when we move, at turn T, we are on y_T, and we move to y_{T+1} at the end of turn, so for collision at turn T, it's based on y_T.\n\nStart: at turn t=0, we are at y=0, which is safe.\n\nWe choose action a_0, which will set y_1.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t, we choose a_t, set y_{t+1}.\n\nWe need to reach y_t =9 for some t.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, we can be there any time.\n\nMinimal H: since from y=0 to y=9, we need at least 9 moves up, but we can stay or go down, so minimal steps is 9 turns if we go up each time, but we might need to wait or avoid, so H might be more.\n\nBut we need to see if we can go directly up.\n\nLet's try to go up as fast as possible.\n\nAt t=0, y=0, we choose a_0.\n\nIf we choose U, then y_1 =1.\n\nNow, at turn t=0, we are on y=0, not a freeway, safe.\n\nAfter action, y_1=1.\n\nNow at turn t=1, we are at y=1.\n\nWe need to check if at turn t=1, freeway y=1 is safe.\n\nFreeway 1 unsafe at t=16,17,18,19, not at t=1, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can keep going up.\n\nBut we need to check all steps.\n\nAssume we go up every turn.\n\nThen:\n\nStart t=0, y=0, action U, y1=1\n\nt=1, y=1, action U, y2=2\n\nt=2, y=2, action U, y3=3\n\nt=3, y=3, action U, y4=4\n\nt=4, y=4, action U, y5=5\n\nt=5, y=5, action U, y6=6\n\nNow at t=5, y=6? Let's see the turns.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t.\n\nAfter action, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nSet t starting from 0.\n\nt=0: at y=0, choose a0, then y1 = y0 + Δy0\n\nSimilarly, at turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nAnd at turn t, we are on freeway y_t if 1<=y_t<=8.\n\nFor collision at turn t, it depends on y_t.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t, we are at y_t, and we take action a_t.\n\nWe need to reach y_t =9 for some t.\n\nMinimal t such that y_t=9.\n\nSince we start at y0=0, if we go up each time, after 9 ups, at t=9, y9=9.\n\nt from 0 to 9, but y_t at t=9 is 9.\n\nt is the turn index.\n\nStart: turn t=0, y=0\n\nAfter first action (t=0), y1\n\nAt turn t=1, y=y1\n\n...\n\nAt turn t=k, y=y_k\n\nIf we do U at each step from t=0 to t=8, then:\n\nAfter t=0 action U: y1=1\n\nt=1: at y=1, action U: y2=2\n\nt=2: at y=2, action U: y3=3\n\nt=3: at y=3, action U: y4=4\n\nt=4: at y=4, action U: y5=5\n\nt=5: at y=5, action U: y6=6\n\nt=6: at y=6, action U: y7=7\n\nt=7: at y=7, action U: y8=8\n\nt=8: at y=8, action U: y9=9\n\nThen at turn t=9: y9=9, which is the goal, safe.\n\nBut we need to check for each turn when we were on a freeway, if it was safe.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt turn t=0: y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nt=1: y=1, freeway 1, is it safe? Freeway 1 unsafe at t=16-19, t=1<16, safe.\n\nt=2: y=2, freeway 2, always safe.\n\nt=3: y=3, freeway 3, always safe.\n\nt=4: y=4, freeway 4, always safe.\n\nt=5: y=5, freeway 5, always safe.\n\nt=6: y=6, freeway 6. Now freeway 6 unsafe at t=0, but t=6>0, and only unsafe at t=0, so at t=6, safe.\n\nt=7: y=7, freeway 7. Freeway 7 unsafe at t=0,1,8,9. t=7 not in {0,1,8,9}, so safe? t=7, 7 not 0,1,8,9, yes safe.\n\nt=8: y=8, freeway 8. Similarly, unsafe at t=0,1,8,9. t=8 is unsafe!\n\nAt t=8, freeway 8 is unsafe.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn t=8, we are at y=8, which is freeway 8, and t=8 is unsafe time for freeway 8.\n\nTherefore, collision would occur at turn t=8 if we are on y=8.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=8 at t=8.\n\nIn the direct up path, at t=8, y=8, which is unsafe.\n\nThus, we need to avoid that.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, we go to y=9, but at turn t=9, if we are on y=9, it's safe, no freeway.\n\nBut at t=8, problem.\n\nNow, y=7 at t=7 is safe, but when we go to y=8 at t=8, we are on y=8 at turn t=8, unsafe.\n\nWe could stay or move differently.\n\nWe need to reach y=9, so minimal H might be more than 9.\n\nIn this case, at t=7, we are at y=7, instead of going up to y=8 at t=8, we could stay or go down, but going down is worse.\n\nWe could wait at some safe position.\n\nFor example, at t=7, y=7, instead of U, we could do S, so y8=7, then at turn t=8, we are on y=7.\n\nFreeway 7 at t=8: unsafe, since t=8 is unsafe for y=7.\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nSo at t=8, if we are on y=7, it is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down to y=6, at t=8, y=6: freeway 6 is safe except t=0, t=8>0, safe.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nLet's list the unsafe times again.\n\ny=1: unsafe t=16,17,18,19 → but we are at low t, not relevant for now.\n\ny=6: unsafe only t=0\n\ny=7: unsafe t=0,1,8,9\n\ny=8: unsafe t=0,1,8,9\n\nWe are concerned about t around 7-9.\n\nAt t=7, y=7: freeway 7 safe at t=7? Earlier I said unsafe at t=0,1,8,9, so t=7 not in, safe.\n\nBut if we go to y=8 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=8 at t=9, but at t=9, y=8 is unsafe.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nWe need to be on y=8 when it is safe, but it is only safe when t not 0,1,8,9.\n\nt=0,1 are past, so for t>=2, except t=8,9.\n\nSimilarly for y=7.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible safe times for y=7: t not 0,1,8,9, so for t=2,3,4,5,6,7,10,... etc.\n\nt=7 is safe for y=7, as above.\n\nBut after that, to go to y=8.\n\ny=8 safe for t not 0,1,8,9, so for t=2,3,4,5,6,7,10,11,... etc.\n\nAt t=7, we can be on y=7, safe.\n\nIf we go U to y=8, then at turn t=8, we are on y=8, which is unsafe.\n\nIf we go S, stay at y=7, then at turn t=8, we are on y=7, but y=7 at t=8 is unsafe.\n\nIf we go D to y=6, then at turn t=8, we are on y=6, which is safe (since unsafe only t=0).\n\nThen at t=8, y=6, we can go U to y=7 at t=9.\n\nBut at turn t=9, if we go to y=7, we are on y=7 at t=9, which is unsafe for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=8 we are at y=6, action U, y9=7.\n\nThen at turn t=9, y=7, unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nFrom y=6 at t=8, we could go directly to y=8? But we can only change by 1, so to go from y=6 to y=7 or y=5, not directly to y=8.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + {-1,0,1}\n\nSo from y=6, we can go to y=5,6,7.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y=9, we need to pass through y=8 or go directly, but only adjacent moves.\n\nSo we must be on y=8 at some point to go to y=9.\n\nNow, y=8 must be safe when we are on it.\n\nSimilarly for y=7.\n\nNow, y=8 is unsafe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=8 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 unsafe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nSo for t=8 and t=9, both y=7 and y=8 are unsafe.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on y=7 or y=8 at turns t=8 or t=9.\n\nWe must avoid being on these freeways at those times.\n\nNow, at t=7, we are at y=7, which is safe.\n\nBut we cannot stay or go up at t=7 because:\n\n- If U, go to y=8 at t=8, unsafe at t=8\n\n- If S, stay at y=7 at t=8, unsafe\n\n- If D, go to y=6 at t=8\n\nAt t=8, if we are at y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, we are at y=6, and we can choose action.\n\nNow, we want to go to y=9.\n\nFrom y=6, we can go U to y=7 at t=9.\n\nBut at t=9, if we are at y=7, unsafe.\n\nGo S to y=6 at t=9, safe but not progress.\n\nGo D to y=5 at t=9, worse.\n\nSo at t=8, from y=6, if we go U to y=7, at t=9 we are on y=7, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, we need to wait until t=10 or later when y=7 and y=8 are safe.\n\nFor example, at t=10, y=7 is safe? Freeway 7 unsafe only t=0,1,8,9, so t=10 safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 unsafe t=0,1,8,9, so t=10 safe.\n\nSo we can be on y=7 or y=8 at t=10 or later.\n\nBut we are at t=7, y=7.\n\nTo avoid t=8 and t=9, we need to be below y=7 or above, but above not possible yet.\n\ny=6 is safe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,4,etc always safe.\n\nSo one way: at t=7, y=7, instead of U, we do D, go down to y=6.\n\nThen at turn t=8, we are at y=6 (since action at t=7 sets y8).\n\nSequence:\n\nt=7: at y=7, choose D, so y8 = y7 -1 =6\n\nThen at turn t=8, we are at y=6, which is freeway 6, and at t=8, safe (since unsafe only t=0).\n\nNow at t=8, we are at y=6, we need to go up.\n\nBut if we go U to y=7, then at turn t=9, we are at y=7, which is unsafe (t=9).\n\nIf we go S, stay at y=6, then at t=9, y=6, safe, but not progress.\n\nThen later we can go up.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal turns.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are unsafe at t=8,9, we can wait at y=6 for a few turns.\n\ny=6 is safe for all t except t=0, which is past.\n\nSo at t=8, we are at y=6, we can stay there for turns until we can go up safely.\n\nFor example, at t=8, y=6, choose S, so y9=6, then at turn t=9, we are at y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=9, we are at y=6, choose U, so y10=7.\n\nThen at turn t=10, we are at y=7.\n\nNow t=10, freeway 7 safe (since unsafe only t=0,1,8,9).\n\nThen we can go U to y=8 at t=11? Action at t=10: choose U, y11=8.\n\nThen at turn t=11, we are at y=8.\n\nFreeway 8 at t=11: unsafe only t=0,1,8,9, t=11>9, safe.\n\nThen at t=11, choose U, y12=9.\n\nThen at turn t=12, we are at y=9, goal.\n\nNow, let's list the sequence:\n\nStart t=0: y0=0, choose U, y1=1\n\nt=1: y1=1, choose U, y2=2\n\nt=2: y2=2, choose U, y3=3\n\nt=3: y3=3, choose U, y4=4\n\nt=4: y4=4, choose U, y5=5\n\nt=5: y5=5, choose U, y6=6\n\nt=6: y6=6, choose U, y7=7\n\nNow at t=7: y7=7, instead of U, choose D, so y8=6\n\nAt turn t=8: y8=6, which is safe.\n\nNow action at t=8: choose S (stay), so y9=6\n\nAt turn t=9: y9=6, safe.\n\nAction at t=9: choose U, so y10=7\n\nAt turn t=10: y10=7, safe (t=10 not unsafe)\n\nAction U, y11=8\n\nAt turn t=11: y11=8, safe (t=11 not 0,1,8,9)\n\nAction U, y12=9\n\nAt turn t=12: y12=9, goal reached.\n\nH = 12 turns? From t=0 to t=12, but we have actions from t=0 to t=11, since y12 is set at t=11.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from t=0 to t=11, 12 actions? No.\n\nDefine: at each turn t, we take action a_t.\n\nAfter H actions, we reach y_H =9.\n\nStart: at turn 0, before action, y=0.\n\nAfter a0, y1.\n\nAfter a1, y2.\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{H-1}, y_H =9.\n\nSo number of actions is H, and we reach y_H=9 at turn H.\n\nIn terms of turns, from turn 0 to turn H, we have H actions.\n\nIn this case, with above, at turn 0, action U\n\nturn 1, action U\n\n...\n\nup to turn 6: action U to y7=7? Let's index turns.\n\nTurn t=0: action a0, sets y1\n\nt=1: action a1, sets y2\n\n...\n\nt=k: action a_k, sets y_{k+1}\n\nWe need y_m =9 for some m.\n\nAfter action at t=m-1, y_m=9.\n\ny_m=9 at turn m.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=0 to t=m-1, H = m actions.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions from turn t1 to t1 + H-1, with H minimal.\n\nIn relative t, we start at t=0.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nAt t=0: a0=U, y1=1\n\nt=1: a1=U, y2=2\n\nt=2: a2=U, y3=3\n\nt=3: a3=U, y4=4\n\nt=4: a4=U, y5=5\n\nt=5: a5=U, y6=6\n\nt=6: a6=U, y7=7\n\nNow at t=6, we set y7=7.\n\nAt turn t=7: we are at y7=7, and we take action.\n\nIn my earlier plan, at t=7, we take D, so a7=D, then y8=6\n\nAt turn t=8: at y8=6, take action a8=S, so y9=6\n\nAt turn t=9: at y9=6, take a9=U, y10=7\n\nAt turn t=10: at y10=7, take a10=U, y11=8\n\nAt turn t=11: at y11=8, take a11=U, y12=9\n\nNow at turn t=12, y12=9, goal.\n\nSo we reached at t=12 with y12=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=0 to t=11, 12 actions, H=12.\n\nBut is this minimal? We used 12 turns to reach y=9 from y=0.\n\nBut we could have reached earlier if we didn't go down.\n\nSince we must avoid t=8 and t=9 for y=7 and y=8, but we were at y=7 at t=7, which is safe, but we had to go down to avoid being there at t=8.\n\nPerhaps we can delay earlier.\n\nFor example, instead of reaching y=7 at t=7, we can reach later.\n\nBut we start from low, so we might need to slow down.\n\nSince y=6 is safe except t=0, and t=0 is past, we can be on y=6 at any time.\n\nSimilarly, lower freeways are safe.\n\nIn the direct path, we had a problem only at t=8 on y=8.\n\nBut we could stay at y=6 for a while.\n\nFor example, at some point before t=7, we stay to delay.\n\nBut let's see the times.\n\ny=7 and y=8 unsafe at t=8,9.\n\nWe need to not be on them at those turns.\n\nIf we can be on y=7 before t=8 or after t=9.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nIn the direct path, we are on y=7 at t=7 (safe), and we want to go to y=8.\n\nBut if we go to y=8 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nSo we need to go to y=8 at a different time.\n\nFor example, if we go to y=8 at t=10, then it is safe.\n\nBut to reach y=8 at t=10, we need to be at y=7 at t=9 or t=10, but t=9 y=7 is unsafe, so we cannot be on y=7 at t=9.\n\nSo we need to be on y=7 at t=10 or later.\n\nSimilarly, to be on y=7 at t=10, we need to come from below.\n\nFor instance, at t=9, we can be on y=6, which is safe.\n\nThen go to y=7 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, to be on y=6 at t=9, we can be there from earlier.\n\nNow, in the direct path, we reach y=6 at t=6? Let's see:\n\nWith all U:\n\nt=0: after U, y1=1 at t=1\n\nBetter to list the turn and position at that turn.\n\nTurn t: position y_t\n\nt=0: y=0\n\nAfter a_t, y_{t+1}\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nt=0: y=0\n\nAfter a0, y1\n\nt=1: y=y1\n\nAfter a1, y2\n\netc.\n\nWith all U:\n\nt=0: y=0, a0=U, y1=1\n\nt=1: y=1, a1=U, y2=2\n\nt=2: y=2, a2=U, y3=3\n\nt=3: y=3, a3=U, y4=4\n\nt=4: y=4, a4=U, y5=5\n\nt=5: y=5, a5=U, y6=6\n\nt=6: y=6, a6=U, y7=7\n\nt=7: y=7, a7=U, y8=8\n\nBut at t=7, y=7 safe, but if a7=U, then at t=8, y=8, unsafe.\n\nTo avoid, at t=6, instead of going to y=7, we could stay or something.\n\nAt t=6: y=6, if we choose S, then a6=S, y7=6\n\nThen at turn t=7: y=7? No, y7=6, since we stayed.\n\ny_t is position at turn t.\n\nAt t=6: y=6\n\nIf a6=S, then y7=6\n\nThen at turn t=7: y=6 (position)\n\nThen we can choose a7.\n\nNow, at t=7, y=6, safe.\n\nWe want to go to y=7 later.\n\nBut y=7 unsafe at t=8,9, so we can go to y=7 at t=10.\n\nFor example, at t=7, y=6, we choose S, so a7=S, y8=6\n\nAt turn t=8: y=6, safe\n\nThen at t=8, choose S, a8=S, y9=6\n\nAt turn t=9: y=6, safe\n\nThen at t=9, choose U, a9=U, y10=7\n\nAt turn t=10: y=7, now t=10, safe (since not 0,1,8,9)\n\nThen choose U, a10=U, y11=8\n\nAt turn t=11: y=8, t=11, safe\n\nThen choose U, a11=U, y12=9\n\nAt t=12, y=9.\n\nSame as before, 12 turns.\n\nBut we stayed at y=6 for two extra turns (t=7 and t=8 at y=6), whereas in the first method, we went down to y=6 at t=8.\n\nIn terms of when we reach, same t=12.\n\nCan we do with less than 12?\n\nFor example, instead of staying or going down, can we go up to y=7 earlier and then down, but we need to avoid t=8,9.\n\nSuppose at t=5: y=5, instead of U to y=6, we could stay, but that delays.\n\nNot better.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=7 at t=7, but then at t=7, instead of going to y=8, we go down to y=6 at t=8, as before.\n\nBut then from there, we go to y=7 at t=10, which is after t=9.\n\nBut t=10 is late.\n\nAt t=8, we are at y=6, and instead of staying, we could go up to y=7, but at t=9, y=7 is unsafe.\n\nUnless we go up at a time when t=9 is not on y=7.\n\nBut we have to be on y=7 to move to y=8.\n\nAnother idea: since y=5 is always safe, we could go to y=5 and stay, but worse.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=7 at t=6 or something.\n\nIn all U, we reach y=6 at t=6.\n\nTo reach y=7 at t=6, we need to have been at y=6 at t=5, but at t=5 we are at y=5, we go U to y=6 at t=6.\n\nCannot be at y=7 earlier than t=7 with all U.\n\nt=7 is the earliest to be at y=7.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at t=10, we need to be at y=7 at t=9 or t=10, but t=9 y=7 unsafe, so earliest safe to be on y=7 is t=10.\n\nSimilarly, to be on y=7 at t=10, we need to come from y=6 at t=9.\n\nTo be on y=6 at t=9, we can be there from earlier.\n\nThe critical point is that we must not be on y=7 or y=8 during t=8 and t=9.\n\nThe time from t=0 to t=6, we can be moving up.\n\nAt t=6, we are at y=6.\n\nNow, from t=6 to t=9, we need to not be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nSo we must be at y<=6 during t=7,8,9? At turn t, position.\n\nAt t=7: we can be at y=6 or below.\n\nAt t=8: same.\n\nAt t=9: same.\n\nThen at t=10, we can go to y=7, etc.\n\nBut at t=6, y=6, we can choose to stay or go down, but going down might not help.\n\nIf at t=6, we choose S, then y7=6, so at t=7, y=6.\n\nThen at t=7, we can choose S, y8=6, at t=8, y=6.\n\nThen at t=8, choose S, y9=6, at t=9, y=6.\n\nThen at t=9, choose U, y10=7, at t=10, y=7, safe, then U to y=8 at t=11, U to y=9 at t=12.\n\nStill t=12.\n\nAt t=6, y=6, we could go down to y=5, but then we need to come back, worse.\n\nSo minimal seems 12 turns.\n\nBut in the first approach, we went down at t=7 to y=6 at t=8, and then stayed or went up later.\n\nIn the down approach, at t=7, we went D to y=6 at t=8, then at t=8 we stayed S to y=6 at t=9, then U to y=7 at t=10, etc., same as above.\n\nIn the first down approach: at t=7, action D, so y8=6 (position at t=8)\n\nThen at t=8, action S, y9=6\n\nThen at t=9, action U, y10=7\n\nThen at t=10, U, y11=8\n\nThen at t=11, U, y12=9\n\nCompared to the stay approach: at t=6, S, y7=6; t=7, S, y8=6; t=8, S, y9=6; t=9, U, y10=7; etc. Here we stayed at t=6, so at t=7 we are still at y=6, whereas in down approach, at t=7 we were at y=7, then down to y=6 at t=8.\n\nIn both, we reach y=9 at t=12.\n\nBut in down approach, we were at y=7 at t=7, which is fine, but we had to go down immediately.\n\nBut the number of actions is the same.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nSuppose we can be on y=8 at t=7? But to be on y=8 at t=7, we need to have come from y=7 at t=6, but at t=6, we were at y=6, we go U to y=7 at t=7, not directly to y=8.\n\nImpossible to be at y=8 before t=8 with all U.\n\nt=8 is the earliest to be at y=8, but unsafe.\n\nSo we must be at y=8 at t>=10.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at t=10, we need to be at y=7 at t=9 or t=10, but t=9 y=7 unsafe, so must be at y=7 at t=10.\n\nThen to be at y=7 at t=10, need to be at y=6 at t=9.\n\nTo be at y=6 at t=9, we can be there from t=6 onwards.\n\nThe fastest is to reach y=6 as early as possible, then stay until t=9, then go up.\n\nReach y=6: with all U, at t=6 we are at y=6.\n\nThen we stay at y=6 for turns t=6,7,8,9? At turn t=6: we are at y=6.\n\nIf we stay, at t=7, y=6; t=8, y=6; t=9, y=6.\n\nThen at t=9, we go U to y=7 at t=10? Action at t=9: U, y10=7.\n\nThen at turn t=10, y=7.\n\nThen U to y=8 at t=11, U to y=9 at t=12.\n\nBut at t=6, if we stay, we waste turns staying.\n\nTo reach y=6 earlier? But we start at y=0, with U each time: t=0 y=0, after U y1=1 at t=1; ... after a5 U, y6=6 at t=6. Cannot be earlier.\n\nSo at t=6, y=6, we must stay until t=9 to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 during t=8,9.\n\nAt t=9, we go U to y=7 at t=10.\n\nBut at turn t=9, we are at y=6, we take action U, so y10=7.\n\nThen at turn t=10, we are at y=7.\n\nThen action U, y11=8 at t=11.\n\nThen U, y12=9 at t=12.\n\nWe stayed at y=6 for three turns: t=6,7,8,9? Turns when at y=6: at t=6,7,8,9 if we stay from t=6 to t=9.\n\nt=6: at y=6\n\nt=7: at y=6 (if we chose S at t=6)\n\nt=8: at y=6 (if S at t=7)\n\nt=9: at y=6 (if S at t=8)\n\nThen at t=9, action U, so at t=10, y=7.\n\nSo positions: t=6: y=6, t=7: y=6, t=8: y=6, t=9: y=6, t=10: y=7, t=11: y=8, t=12: y=9.\n\nH=12 actions from t=0 to t=11.\n\nIn the down approach: we were at y=7 at t=7, then down to y=6 at t=8, then at y=6 at t=8 and t=9, then up at t=10.\n\nSo positions: t=7: y=7, t=8: y=6, t=9: y=6, t=10: y=7, t=11: y=8, t=12: y=9.\n\nStill reached at t=12.\n\nBut in down approach, we had an extra move down, but since we went up to y=7 earlier, it compensates, same number.\n\nNow, can we save a turn?\n\nSuppose we go to y=7 at t=7, but instead of going down, can we go directly to y=9? No, impossible, must go through y=8.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=8 at t=7, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 is safe, and we can be there, but to go to y=7, we must be on it when safe.\n\nBut at t=10, we go to y=7.\n\nBut t=10 is late.\n\nNotice that y=7 is safe at t=7, but we cannot stay because at t=8 it would be unsafe if we are there.\n\nBut at t=7, we are there, safe, but we have to leave.\n\nIf we go to y=8 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nSo we must go down to y=6.\n\nThen from y=6, we can only go to y=7 at t=10 or later.\n\nBut t=10 is the earliest safe for y=7 after t=7.\n\nt=7 is safe, but we cannot be at y=7 at t=8.\n\nSo the next safe is t=10.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=8 from y=7 at a different time.\n\nBut y=7 must be safe when we are on it to move.\n\nI think 12 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm with the absolute turn.\n\nt1=48, so relative t=0 is absolute 48.\n\nIn the answer, we need the actions starting from turn t1=48.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions from turn 48 to turn 48+11=59.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nFirst, in the down approach:\n\nAt turn 48 (t=0): action U\n\nThen position at turn 49: y=1\n\nTurn 49: action U\n\nTurn 50: y=2, U\n\nTurn 51: y=3, U\n\nTurn 52: y=4, U\n\nTurn 53: y=5, U\n\nTurn 54: y=6, U\n\nTurn 55: y=7, action D (since we go down)\n\nAfter action at turn 55: y for turn 56 is 6\n\nTurn 56: position y=6, action S (stay)\n\nAfter action, y for turn 57 is 6\n\nTurn 57: y=6, action S? In my first down approach, I had at t=8 relative, action S.\n\nRelative t=8 is absolute turn 48+8=56.\n\nSet:\n\nAbsolute turn: let τ = t - 48, so τ=0: turn 48\n\nτ=1: turn 49\n\netc.\n\nAt τ=0 (turn 48): position y=0, action a_{48} = U, so y at τ=1 is 1\n\nAt τ=1 (turn 49): position y=1, action U, y2=2\n\n...\n\nAt τ=5 (turn 53): position y=5, action U, y6=6\n\nAt τ=6 (turn 54): position y=6, action U, y7=7\n\nAt τ=7 (turn 55): position y=7, action D, so y8=6\n\nAt τ=8 (turn 56): position y=6, action S, so y9=6\n\nAt τ=9 (turn 57): position y=6, action U, so y10=7\n\nAt τ=10 (turn 58): position y=7, action U, so y11=8\n\nAt τ=11 (turn 59): position y=8, action U, so y12=9\n\nAt τ=12 (turn 60): position y=9, goal.\n\nSo actions from turn 48 to 59.\n\nH=12 actions.\n\nIn the stay approach: at τ=6 (turn 54), position y=6, action S, so y7=6\n\nAt τ=7 (turn 55), position y=6, action S, y8=6\n\nAt τ=8 (turn 56), position y=6, action S, y9=6\n\nAt τ=9 (turn 57), position y=6, action U, y10=7\n\nAt τ=10 (turn 58), position y=7, action U, y11=8\n\nAt τ=11 (turn 59), position y=8, action U, y12=9\n\nSame, but we stayed at y=6 longer.\n\nIn down approach, we were at y=7 at τ=7, then down, so we had a higher position earlier, but still reach at same time.\n\nNow, back to the car on freeway 1, but we didn't reach there, since we were at low y early, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nBut in the beginning, I thought about y=1 unsafe at t=16-19, but in our path, we are at high y by then, since at τ=12, we are at y=9, which is τ=12, absolute t=48+12=60, which is after t=48+16=64? t=16 relative is τ=16, absolute 64, but we are done at τ=12, t=60, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly, all safe.\n\nBut is there a way with H=11?\n\nSuppose we reach y=9 at τ=11.\n\nThen y_{11}=9.\n\nSo after action at τ=10, y11=9.\n\ny11=9 means at turn τ=11, position y=9.\n\nNow, y11=9, so y10 must be 8, and at τ=10, action U.\n\nSimilarly, y9 must be 7 or 8 or 9, but since y10=8, and action U from y10=8? y10 is position at τ=10.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo y11 = y10 + Δy10\n\nIf y11=9, then y10 must be 8 or 9 or 10, but y<=9, so y10=8 or 9.\n\nIf y10=9, then Δy10=0 or -1, but to have y11=9, if y10=9, then Δy10=0 or D, but D would make y11=8, not 9.\n\nIf y10=9, then y11 = y10 + Δy10, if Δy10=0, y11=9; if U, y11=10>9 invalid; if D, y11=8.\n\nSo to have y11=9, if y10=9, then Δy10 must be 0.\n\nBut we can reach y=9 earlier by staying, but minimal is to go up.\n\nIf y10=8, then Δy10=U, y11=9.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y10=8, etc.\n\nNow, for y11=9 at τ=11.\n\nThen at τ=10, y10 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y10=8, then at τ=10, position y=8, which must be safe.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9,10? τ=10 not in, safe.\n\nτ=10 not 0,1,8,9, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, if y10=9, safe.\n\nBut to minimize, probably y10=8, then U to 9.\n\nSimilarly, y10=8 must be reached.\n\ny10=8 at τ=10.\n\nThen at τ=10, y=8, safe as above.\n\nNow, y10=8, so from y9, with action at τ=9.\n\ny10 = y9 + Δy9\n\nIf y9=8, then Δy9=0 or U or D, but to have y10=8, Δy9=0.\n\nIf y9=7, Δy9=U, y10=8.\n\nIf y9=9, Δy9=D, y10=8.\n\nNow, at τ=9, if we are on y=8, freeway 8 at τ=9 is unsafe! Because τ=9 is unsafe time.\n\nSimilarly, if on y=7, unsafe at τ=9.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nBut if y9=9, then to have y10=8, we need to go down, but we are going up, inefficient.\n\nSo probably, we want y9=7, then U to y10=8.\n\nBut at τ=9, y=7 is unsafe.\n\nCannot be on y=7 at τ=9.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on y=8 at τ=9.\n\nSo the only way is to be on y=9 at τ=9, then stay or something, but to be at y=9 at τ=9, we need to have reached earlier, which might take more turns.\n\nFor example, to reach y=9 at τ=9.\n\nWith all U, we reach y=9 at τ=9? Start τ=0 y=0, after 9 U, y9=9 at τ=9.\n\nBut in that case, at τ=8, we would be at y=8, which is unsafe at τ=8.\n\nSimilarly, problem.\n\nIf we reach y=9 at τ=9, then at τ=8, we must be at y=8, but unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nReach earlier, but impossible since min 9 actions.\n\nSo it seems impossible to reach before τ=12 with the constraints.\n\nThus, minimal H=12.\n\nNow, for the sequence.\n\nIn the down approach, we have:\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U  (to y=7 at τ=7? At turn 54, action U, sets y for turn 55 to 7? Let's list absolute.\n\nTurn τ=0 (48): action U, so position at τ=1 (49) is 1\n\nBetter to list for each turn the action.\n\nThe answer should be:\n\nFor turn t, action a_t.\n\nStarting from turn t1=48.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 48: action U\n\nTurn 49: action U\n\nTurn 50: action U\n\nTurn 51: action U\n\nTurn 52: action U\n\nTurn 53: action U  (at this point, after action, position at turn 54 is 6? After turn 53 action, y at turn 54 is set.\n\nTurn 53: at position y=5 (since after turn 52 action, y53=5? Sequence:\n\nAfter turn 48 action U: position turn 49: y=1\n\nTurn 49: at y=1, action U, position turn 50: y=2\n\nTurn 50: at y=2, action U, position turn 51: y=3\n\nTurn 51: at y=3, action U, position turn 52: y=4\n\nTurn 52: at y=4, action U, position turn 53: y=5\n\nTurn 53: at y=5, action U, position turn 54: y=6\n\nTurn 54: at y=6, action U, position turn 55: y=7\n\nNow turn 55: at y=7, action D, so position turn 56: y=6\n\nTurn 56: at y=6, action S, position turn 57: y=6\n\nTurn 57: at y=6, action U, position turn 58: y=7\n\nTurn 58: at y=7, action U, position turn 59: y=8\n\nTurn 59: at y=8, action U, position turn 60: y=9\n\nAt turn 60, y=9, reached.\n\nActions from turn 48 to 59, 12 actions.\n\nIn the answer format, we need to list the actions for each turn starting from t1.\n\nNow, for the car on freeway 6, at τ=0, unsafe, but we were not on it at τ=0, we were at y=0.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid the down move.\n\nAnother sequence: suppose we stay at y=6 at turn 54.\n\nTurn 54: at y=6, action S, so position turn 55: y=6\n\nTurn 55: at y=6, action S, position turn 56: y=6\n\nTurn 56: at y=6, action S, position turn 57: y=6\n\nTurn 57: at y=6, action U, position turn 58: y=7\n\nTurn 58: at y=7, action U, position turn 59: y=8\n\nTurn 59: at y=8, action U, position turn 60: y=9\n\nSame, but we stayed at y=6 from turn 54 to 57, four turns at y=6, whereas in down, we had only three turns from turn 56 to 58? In down, at turn 55 we were at y=7, turn 56 at y=6, turn 57 at y=6, then up.\n\nSlightly different, but same end.\n\nI think down is fine.\n\nNow, in the car list, freeway 6 has two cars, but we only care about when 0 is covered.\n\nSimilarly, all covered.\n\nSo the minimal H is 12.\n\nBut let's confirm the number.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=9, min 9 moves, but we had 3 extra: one down and two stays or something, but in the sequence, we have 12 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=8 at τ=7, but impossible.\n\nI think it's optimal.\n\nSo for the answer.\n\nThe sequence of actions:\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: D\n\nTurn 56: S\n\nTurn 57: U  // turn 57 action U, to y=7 at turn 58\n\nIn the sequence above, turn 57: at y=6, action U, so position turn 58: y=7\n\nThen turn 58: at y=7, action U, position turn 59: y=8\n\nTurn 59: at y=8, action U, position turn 60: y=9\n\nIn the action list, we need up to turn 59 action.\n\nH=12 actions from turn 48 to 59.\n\nIn the boxed answer.\n\nNow, for freeway 7 and 8, we have cars, but we avoided the unsafe times.\n\nIn freeway 6, at τ=0, unsafe, but we were not there.\n\nAt τ=6, we were on y=6, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nSo the minimal sequence.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 48\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the player must follow a sequence of actions that accounts for the unsafe times on certain freeways. The unsafe times for each freeway are derived from the car positions and movements:\n\n- Freeway 1: Unsafe at turns \\(t = 16, 17, 18, 19\\) relative to \\(t_1\\) (absolute turns 64, 65, 66, 67).\n- Freeway 6: Unsafe only at turn \\(t = 0\\) relative to \\(t_1\\) (absolute turn 48).\n- Freeway 7: Unsafe at turns \\(t = 0, 1, 8, 9\\) relative to \\(t_1\\) (absolute turns 48, 49, 56, 57).\n- Freeway 8: Unsafe at turns \\(t = 0, 1, 8, 9\\) relative to \\(t_1\\) (absolute turns 48, 49, 56, 57).\n- Freeways 2, 3, 4, 5: Always safe, as no car covers \\(x = 0\\) for \\(t \\geq 0\\).\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 0\\) (safe) at turn 48 and aims to reach \\(y = 9\\) (safe) as quickly as possible. Direct upward movement is blocked because:\n- At turn 55 (relative \\(t = 7\\)), the player is at \\(y = 7\\) (safe, as \\(t = 7\\) is not unsafe for freeway 7).\n- Moving up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 56 (relative \\(t = 8\\)) is unsafe, as freeway 8 is unsafe at \\(t = 8\\).\n- Staying at \\(y = 7\\) or moving down must be considered, but \\(y = 7\\) is also unsafe at \\(t = 8\\).\n\nTo avoid the unsafe times at \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 9\\) (absolute turns 56 and 57) for freeways 7 and 8, the player must not be on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) during these turns. The earliest safe turn to be on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) after \\(t = 7\\) is \\(t = 10\\) (absolute turn 58). Thus, the player moves down to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 55 and stays there until it is safe to move upward again.\n\nThe minimal sequence involves:\n- Moving up from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 7\\) in the first 7 turns (turns 48 to 54).\n- Moving down to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 55 to avoid being on \\(y = 7\\) at turn 56.\n- Staying at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 56 to remain safe.\n- Moving up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 57 (safe, as \\(t = 10\\) relative is turn 58, and freeway 7 is safe at \\(t = 10\\)).\n- Moving up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 58 (safe, as freeway 8 is safe at \\(t = 11\\) relative).\n- Moving up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 59.\n\nThis sequence reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 60 after 12 actions (turns 48 to 59), which is minimal given the constraints.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n- Turn 48: U (move up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 49)\n- Turn 49: U (move up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 50)\n- Turn 50: U (move up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 51)\n- Turn 51: U (move up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 52)\n- Turn 52: U (move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 53)\n- Turn 53: U (move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 54)\n- Turn 54: U (move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 55)\n- Turn 55: D (move down to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 56)\n- Turn 56: S (stay at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 57)\n- Turn 57: U (move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 58)\n- Turn 58: U (move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 59)\n- Turn 59: U (move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 60)\n\nCollisions are avoided:\n- At turn 48, the player is at \\(y = 0\\), not a freeway.\n- Freeway 6 is unsafe only at turn 48, but the player is on \\(y = 6\\) at turns 54, 55 (after action), 56, and 57, all safe except turn 54 is after turn 48.\n- Freeway 7 is unsafe at turns 48, 49, 56, 57; the player is on \\(y = 7\\) at turns 55 (safe, \\(t = 7\\)) and 58 (safe, \\(t = 10\\)).\n- Freeway 8 is unsafe at turns 48, 49, 56, 57; the player is on \\(y = 8\\) at turn 59 (safe, \\(t = 11\\)).\n- Other freeways are always safe or not occupied during relevant turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 48: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 49: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 50: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 51: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 52: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 53: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 54: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 55: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 56: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 57: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 58: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 59: U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns H, moving only vertically with actions U (up), D (down), or S (stay). The vertical position y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nThere are cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, and I need to avoid collisions. A collision happens at turn T if the player is on a freeway y_T at that turn, and for some car on that freeway, the x=0 is within the car's span at that exact turn.\n\nThe car spans move based on their direction and speed. Left-moving cars decrease their position over time, right-moving increase. But looking at the data, all cars seem to be right-moving; let me check.\n\nFrom the car state:\n\n- Freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3) — head at -48, tail at -59? That seems odd because usually head is the front, so for right-moving, head should be greater than tail. Let me read carefully.\n\nThe car is given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s). For right-moving, it says: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left: [h, τ] → [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3). Since it's right-moving, head should be the right end, so h should be greater than τ. But here h = -48, τ = -59, so -48 > -59, yes, that makes sense because -48 is to the right of -59 on a number line.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 6: (48, 37, right, 12) — h=48, τ=37, 48>37, good.\n\nAnd (0, -11, right, 12) for freeway 6, h=0, τ=-11, 0 > -11, good.\n\nFreeway 7: (-48, -59, right, 6) and (0, -11, right, 6), both right-moving.\n\nFreeway 8 same.\n\nAll cars are right-moving, no left-moving mentioned.\n\nNow, collision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and x=0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAlso, important note: when you move to a new freeway, at the turn you move, you are not on the new freeway yet; you only occupy it at the next turn. Let me read that note.\n\n\"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, you are on freeway y_T. If you take an action to move to y_{T+1}, then at turn T, you are still on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1} at the start of turn T+1.\n\nTherefore, for collision check at turn T, you only care about cars on the current freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at t=54. y=0 is not a freeway with cars; freeways are y=1 to y=8. y=0 is probably safe, no cars.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 is the goal, also no cars.\n\nThe player needs to go from y=0 to y=9, passing through y=1 to y=8, but avoiding the cars on those lanes.\n\nSince we start at y=0 and end at y=9, and we can move up or down, but to minimize turns, we probably want to go up as much as possible, but we have to avoid the cars.\n\nThe minimal number of turns to go from y=0 to y=9 is at least 9 turns if we move up every turn, but we might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 9.\n\nBut let's see the car positions and how they move.\n\nFirst, I need to find for each freeway, at what turns the point x=0 is covered by a car, meaning it's in the span.\n\nFor a given freeway, and a car on it, I can find the time intervals when x=0 is within its span.\n\nSince the cars move continuously in position over time, but turns are discrete, so I need to find for each turn T, if at that turn, for the freeway, if x=0 is covered.\n\nT is in terms of turns from t_1=54.\n\nSet τ = T - t_1, so at τ=0, it's turn t_1.\n\nThen for a car, at time τ after t_1, its span for right-moving car: [τ + sτ, h + sτ] where s is speed, but let's use the span formula.\n\nAt turn T, which is turn number, so time elapsed since t_1 is Δt = T - t_1.\n\nFor a car at t_1 with head h, tail τ, direction right, speed s.\n\nAt turn T, span is [τ + s * (T - t_1), h + s * (T - t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left, but all are right here.\n\nx=0 is in span if min(τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)) <= 0 <= max(..., ...) but since it's right-moving, and head > tail, so min is τ + s*(T-t_1), max is h + s*(T-t_1), so:\n\nτ + s*(T-t_1) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-t_1)\n\nBecause the span is from left to right: [tail + s*Δt, head + s*Δt]\n\nAnd since head > tail, it's increasing.\n\nSo for x=0 to be covered:\n\nτ + s*(T-t_1) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-t_1)\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but no left here.\n\nNow, let's list all freeways and their cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: h = -48, τ = -59, d=right, s=3\n\nAt time Δt = T - t_1, span: [ -59 + 3*Δt , -48 + 3*Δt ]\n\nx=0 covered when:\n\n-59 + 3Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 3Δt\n\nSo:\n\n-59 + 3Δt <= 0 => 3Δt <= 59 => Δt <= 59/3 ≈ 19.666, so Δt <= 19 since integer turns? T and t_1 are integers, so Δt integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -48 + 3Δt => 3Δt >= 48 => Δt >= 16\n\nSo for freeway 1, x=0 covered when 16 <= Δt <= 19\n\nΔt from 16 to 19 inclusive.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car: h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=12\n\nSpan at Δt: [37 + 12*Δt, 48 + 12*Δt]\n\nx=0 covered: 37 + 12Δt <= 0 <= 48 + 12Δt\n\nBut 37 + 12Δt <= 0? 12Δt <= -37, which is impossible since Δt >=0, so 37 + 12Δt >=37 >0, so left end >0, so 0 cannot be <= left end? Let's see.\n\nThe inequality: min <= 0 <= max\n\nmin = 37 + 12Δt >=37 >0, so min >0, thus 0 < min, so 0 not in [min, max] since min >0.\n\nSimilarly, max > min >0, so 0 not covered at any Δt. Because the car is at position around 37 to 48 at t_1, moving right, so always positive, never covers x=0.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 3: same as freeway 2, (48,37,right,12), same thing, min=37+12Δt >0, so never covers x=0.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (48,37,right,12), never covers x=0.\n\nFreeway 5: same, (48,37,right,12), never covers x=0.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) — same as above, min=37+12Δt >0, never covers x=0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12) — h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=12\n\nSpan at Δt: [ -11 + 12*Δt , 0 + 12*Δt ] = [ -11 +12Δt, 12Δt ]\n\nx=0 covered: min <= 0 <= max\n\nmin = -11 +12Δt, max=12Δt\n\nSo -11 +12Δt <= 0 <= 12Δt\n\nFirst, 0 <= 12Δt always true for Δt >=0.\n\nSecond, -11 +12Δt <= 0 => 12Δt <=11 => Δt <= 11/12 <1, so since Δt integer >=0, Δt <=0? 12Δt <=11, Δt <= 11/12 <1, so for Δt=0, let's check.\n\nAt Δt=0: min = -11 +0 = -11, max=0, so [-11,0], 0 is included? 0 <= max is 0<=0, true; min <=0 is -11<=0 true, so yes, at Δt=0, x=0 covered.\n\nFor Δt=1: min = -11+12=1, max=12, [1,12], min=1>0, so 0 not in [1,12].\n\nSimilarly for Δt>0, min >=1>0.\n\nSo only at Δt=0, covered.\n\nΔt=0 is turn t_1 itself.\n\nBut at turn T, for the car, we need to see if 0 in span at that turn.\n\nFor freeway 6, second car covers x=0 only at Δt=0.\n\nFirst car never.\n\nSo for freeway 6, x=0 covered only at Δt=0.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,6) — h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=6\n\nSpan at Δt: [ -59 +6*Δt , -48 +6*Δt ]\n\nx=0 covered: -59 +6Δt <= 0 <= -48 +6Δt\n\nSo:\n\n-59 +6Δt <= 0 => 6Δt <=59 => Δt <= 59/6 ≈9.833, so Δt <=9\n\n0 <= -48 +6Δt => 6Δt >=48 => Δt >=8\n\nSo for Δt from 8 to 9 inclusive.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6) — h=0, τ=-11, s=6\n\nSpan: [ -11 +6*Δt , 0 +6*Δt ] = [ -11+6Δt, 6Δt ]\n\nx=0 covered: -11+6Δt <= 0 <= 6Δt\n\n0 <= 6Δt always for Δt>=0\n\n-11+6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=11 => Δt <= 11/6 ≈1.833, so Δt <=1\n\nFor Δt=0: min=-11, max=0, [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔt=1: min=-11+6=-5, max=6, [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nΔt=2: min=-11+12=1, max=12, [1,12], min=1>0, 0 not in.\n\nSo covered for Δt=0 and Δt=1.\n\nNow for freeway 7, we have two cars, so x=0 covered if either car covers it.\n\nFirst car covers at Δt=8 and 9.\n\nSecond car covers at Δt=0 and 1.\n\nSo overall for freeway 7: covered at Δt=0,1,8,9.\n\nNow freeway 8: similar to 7, two cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nSame as freeway 7, covered at Δt=0,1,8,9.\n\nNow freeway 1: covered at Δt=16,17,18,19.\n\nFreeways 2,3,4,5: never covered.\n\nFreeway 6: covered only at Δt=0.\n\nBut freeway 6 has coverage only at Δt=0, which is turn t_1.\n\nNow, the player is at y=0 at turn t_1.\n\ny=0 has no cars, so it's safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe freeways with cars are y=1 to y=8.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to know when it is safe to be on that freeway, i.e., when x=0 is not covered by any car on that row.\n\nSince multiple cars per row, but we care about the row being unsafe if any car covers x=0.\n\nSo let's summarize for each freeway, the unsafe time intervals (in Δt).\n\nΔt = T - t_1, from 0 up.\n\n- Freeway 1 (y=1): unsafe at Δt=16,17,18,19\n\n- Freeway 2 (y=2): always safe, since no coverage\n\n- Freeway 3 (y=3): always safe\n\n- Freeway 4 (y=4): always safe\n\n- Freeway 5 (y=5): always safe\n\n- Freeway 6 (y=6): unsafe at Δt=0 only\n\n- Freeway 7 (y=7): unsafe at Δt=0,1,8,9\n\n- Freeway 8 (y=8): unsafe at Δt=0,1,8,9\n\nFreeway 6 is unsafe only at Δt=0, which is now.\n\nBut at turn t_1, the player is at y=0, not on freeway 6.\n\nNow, the player moves at each turn.\n\nWe start at turn t_1=54, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, no issue.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up as much as possible, but avoiding being on a freeway when it is unsafe.\n\nThe actions: U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, 0.\n\ny must stay in [0,9].\n\nWe start at y=0 at τ=0 (turn t_1).\n\nτ is the step from t_1, so at time τ, we are at turn t_1 + τ.\n\nPosition y_τ, with y_0 = 0.\n\nAfter action, y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy.\n\nCollision: at turn t_1 + τ, if y_τ = k for k=1 to 8, and freeway k is unsafe at time τ.\n\nUnsafe meaning x=0 covered at that turn.\n\nFor freeway k, unsafe at certain τ values.\n\nWe need to choose a sequence of actions so that for each τ, when we are on a freeway y_τ between 1 and 8, it is not unsafe at that τ.\n\nSince we start at y=0, and end at y=9, we need to cross all freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe minimal H is at least 9, if we go up every turn.\n\nBut we may need to wait or go down to avoid unsafe times.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can reach in 9 turns, i.e., from τ=0 to τ=8, after 9 actions, at τ=9, y=9.\n\nAt τ=0: start at y=0, safe.\n\nWe take action at turn t_1 + τ for τ=0 to H-1, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_H.\n\nWe need y_H =9.\n\nDefine: at turn T = t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, we take action a_t, then position at turn T+1 is updated.\n\nSet t as the step index from t_1.\n\nAt turn t_1 + t for t=0,1,2,...,H-1, we take action a_{t_1 + t}, which determines the position at the next turn.\n\nPosition at turn t_1 + t is y_t.\n\nFor t=0, turn t_1, y_0 = 0.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + t}, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn based on y_t and the time.\n\nAt turn T = t_1 + t, position y_t, if y_t between 1 and 8, and if freeway y_t is unsafe at time t (since Δt = T - t_1 = t).\n\nT - t_1 = t, so at step t.\n\nFor freeway k, unsafe at times t where coverage.\n\nWe need that for all t, if 1 <= y_t <=8, then freeway y_t is safe at time t.\n\ny_t is the position at turn t_1 + t.\n\nWe start at t=0, y_0=0, safe.\n\nAfter H actions, at t=H, we should have y_H=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nEach action changes y.\n\nNow, to minimize H, so we want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nFirst, list the unsafe times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: unsafe at t=16,17,18,19\n\n- y=2: always safe\n\n- y=3: always safe\n\n- y=4: always safe\n\n- y=5: always safe\n\n- y=6: unsafe only at t=0\n\n- y=7: unsafe at t=0,1,8,9\n\n- y=8: unsafe at t=0,1,8,9\n\nt=0 is now, and at t=0, we are at y=0, not on any freeway, so no issue.\n\nThe earliest we can be on a freeway is at t=1 or later, since at t=0 we are at y=0.\n\ny_t for t>=0.\n\nAt t=0, y_0=0.\n\nAfter first action, at t=1, y_1 could be 0 or 1, depending on action.\n\nSimilarly, at each turn, we are at y_t.\n\nFor y=6, unsafe only at t=0. But t=0 is the starting turn, and we are not on y=6 at t=0, since y_0=0. So for y=6, since unsafe only at t=0, and we can only be on y=6 at t>=1, when it is safe. So y=6 is always safe for t>=1.\n\nSimilarly, for y=7 and y=8, unsafe at t=0,1,8,9.\n\nt=0: we are not on it.\n\nt=1: we could be on it if we move up at t=0.\n\nBut at t=1, if we are on y=7 or y=8, it is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8 and t=9, unsafe.\n\nNow for t>=2 to 7, and t>=10, y=7 and y=8 are safe.\n\ny=1 unsafe at t=16,17,18,19, which might be later, but since we want minimal H, probably we finish before t=16, so y=1 might not be an issue if we cross early.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways are safe except y=7 and y=8 at t=0,1,8,9.\n\nBut t=0 not relevant.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=0 to y=9 in min turns.\n\nThe critical part is near y=7 and y=8 because of unsafe times at t=1,8,9.\n\nAlso, y=6 is safe after t=0.\n\ny=1 to 5 are safe except y=1 at late times, but we can avoid that by crossing early.\n\nSince we start at t=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some t=H.\n\nThe minimal H without obstacles is 9: go up each turn, so at t=9, y=9.\n\nBut let's see if we can be on the freeways safely.\n\nSuppose we go up at each step.\n\nAt t=0: action U, then y_1 = 1 (since y_0=0, +1)\n\nPosition at turn t_1 +1: y_1=1.\n\nTime for this turn is t=1.\n\ny_1=1, which is freeway 1.\n\nAt t=1, is freeway 1 safe? Freeway 1 unsafe at t=16-19, not at t=1. Since t=1<16, it should be safe. Earlier we have unsafe only at 16-19, so at t=1, safe.\n\nSimilarly, action at t=0: U, y_1=1 at turn t_1 +1.\n\nCollision check at turn T: when we are at position, at turn T, we are at y_T, and check that freeway.\n\nFor turn T=t_1 + t, position y_t.\n\nAt t=0, turn t_1, y_0=0, no freeway, safe.\n\nAction U, then at turn t_1 +1, position y_1=1.\n\nAt turn t_1 +1, which is time t=1, we are on freeway y=1.\n\nFreeway 1 at time t=1: unsafe? No, unsafe only at t=16-19, so safe at t=1.\n\nThen action at t=1: U, y_2=2 at turn t_1 +2.\n\nFreeway 2 always safe.\n\nSimilarly, U, y_3=3, safe.\n\nU, y_4=4, safe.\n\nU, y_5=5, safe.\n\nU, y_6=6 at turn t_1 +6.\n\nTime t=6.\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe only at t=0, but t=6>0, so safe.\n\nThen action U, y_7=7 at turn t_1 +7, time t=7.\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at t=0,1,8,9. t=7 not in, so safe? t=7, not 0,1,8,9, so should be safe.\n\nThen action U, y_8=8 at turn t_1 +8, time t=8.\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at t=8,9. t=8 is unsafe.\n\nAt turn t_1 +8, position y_8=8, freeway 8, at time t=8, which is unsafe.\n\nCollision!\n\nProblem.\n\nIf we go straight up, at t=8, we are on y=8 when it is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if we continue to y=9, but at t=8, we are on y=8, unsafe.\n\nThen action at t=8: U, but before that, at turn t_1 +8, we are on y=8, which is unsafe at t=8, so collision at that turn.\n\nWe cannot be on y=8 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, y=9 is safe, but if we are on y=8 at t=9, also unsafe.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=7, we are on y=7 at time t=7, which is safe for y=7.\n\nThen at turn t_1 +7, we take action U, so at turn t_1 +8, we are at y_8=8.\n\nAt that turn, t=8, y=8, unsafe.\n\nTo avoid, we need to not be on y=7 or y=8 at t=8 or t=9, and also not at t=0,1, but t=0,1 are early.\n\nt=0 not possible, t=1 might be possible but we can avoid.\n\nSpecifically for y=8, unsafe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nSimilarly y=7 unsafe at t=8 and t=9? From earlier: y=7 unsafe at t=0,1,8,9.\n\nSo at t=8 and t=9, both y=7 and y=8 are unsafe.\n\nWe need to be on these freeways at times other than 0,1,8,9.\n\nSince we want minimal H, and H=9 would have us at y=9 at t=9, but to be at y=9 at t=9, we must have been at y=8 at t=8 or earlier.\n\nAt t=8, if we are at y=8, unsafe.\n\nIf we are at y=7 at t=8, also unsafe.\n\ny=7 at t=8 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, if we are at y=8, unsafe, or y=7 unsafe.\n\nBut at t=9, we might be at y=9, which is safe.\n\nThe issue is around t=8 and t=9 for layers 7 and 8.\n\nWe need to cross y=7 and y=8 when it is safe, i.e., not at t=8 or t=9.\n\nSafe times for y=7 and y=8: for t not in {0,1,8,9}, so t=2,3,4,5,6,7,10,... etc.\n\nSimilarly, for y=1, but since we can cross early, not a problem.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe direct path has problem at t=8.\n\nWe might need to delay or advance the crossing of y=7 and y=8.\n\nSince y=6 is safe except t=0, but we can be there at t=6 as above.\n\ny=5 always safe, etc.\n\nOne way is to reach y=7 earlier or later.\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=7 at t=7, which is safe, but then from y=7 at t=7, we take action to go to y=8 at t=8, but at t=8, y=8 is unsafe.\n\nIf we stay on y=7 at t=8, but y=7 is unsafe at t=8.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=7 or y=8 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nTherefore, we must be below y=7 at t=8, or above.\n\nBut since we need to go up, probably below.\n\nSimilarly at t=9, we cannot be on y=7 or y=8, so we must be at y<=6 or y=9.\n\nBut we want to reach y=9, so at t=9, we could be at y=9.\n\nNow, let's think about the timing.\n\nSuppose we reach y=7 at some safe time, say t=7.\n\nAt t=7, y=7 is safe (since unsafe at 0,1,8,9, t=7 not in).\n\nThen at turn t_1 +7, we are at y_7=7.\n\nIf we take action S, stay, then at turn t_1 +8, y_8=7, but at t=8, y=7 is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf we take U, go to y=8 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nIf we take D, go down to y=6 at t=8.\n\ny=6 at t=8: freeway 6 safe for t>0, so safe.\n\nThen at t=8, y=6 safe.\n\nBut we need to go up later.\n\nSimilarly, from y=6 at t=8, we can go up to y=7 at t=9, but at t=9, y=7 is unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt t=9, y=7 unsafe.\n\nSo if we go to y=7 at t=9, unsafe.\n\nWe need to avoid t=8 and t=9 for y=7 and y=8.\n\nSo possible safe times for y=7: t=2,3,4,5,6,7,10,...\n\nBut t=7 is safe, as above.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to have been at y=8 at some point.\n\nSuppose we are at y=7 at t=7, safe.\n\nBut we cannot stay or go up at t=7 because at t=8 we would be in trouble.\n\nSo we must go down or something.\n\nFrom y=7 at t=7, if we go down to y=6 at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, y=6, which is safe, as we said.\n\nThen at t=8, we are at y=6.\n\nNow at turn t_1 +8, we take action.\n\nIf we go up to y=7 at t=9, but at t=9, y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf stay, y=6 at t=9, safe, but not progressing.\n\nIf go down to y=5 at t=9, safe, but worse.\n\nSo we need to go up later, when safe.\n\nBut at t=9, y=7 and y=8 are both unsafe.\n\nNext safe time for y=7 and y=8 is t=10 or later.\n\nt=10 is safe for both.\n\nFor example, at t=10, y=7 and y=8 are safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can be there.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so delaying increases H.\n\nFirst, without delaying, minimal H is 9, but we cannot achieve it because of t=8 and t=9.\n\nSo H must be at least 10 or more.\n\nWith H=10, we can reach y=9 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, y=9 safe.\n\nNow, we need to be at y=9 at t=10.\n\nThat means at t=9, we must be at y=8 or y=9.\n\nIf at t=9, we are at y=9, then we are done, but to be at y=9 at t=9, we must have come from y=8 at t=8 with action U or S, but at t=8, if we are at y=8, unsafe, or if we stay at y=9, but we start from below.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nAt t=9, if we are at y=9, that means at turn t_1 +9, position y_9=9.\n\nWhich is after 9 actions from t=0.\n\nBut at t=8, we would be at y_8, and after action, y_9 = y_8 + Δy.\n\nIf y_9=9, then y_8 must be 8 or 9, with action U or S.\n\nBut if y_8=8, at t=8, unsafe.\n\nIf y_8=9, then at t=8, y=9 safe, but how did we get to y=9 before?\n\nPerhaps we reached earlier.\n\nBut y=9 is only at the end, I think.\n\nSince we start from y=0, and go up, we reach y=9 at the end.\n\nAt t=8, we cannot be on y=8 because unsafe.\n\nSo for H=9, to have y_9=9, we must have y_8=8 or 9.\n\nIf y_8=8, then at t=8, on y=8, unsafe.\n\nIf y_8=9, that means at t=8, we are at y=9, which is safe, but to be at y=9 at t=8, we must have arrived earlier, but then we can stop earlier, but H is the number of turns, including actions to reach.\n\ny_t is position at turn t_1 + t.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_H.\n\nWe need y_H =9.\n\nFor H=9, y_9=9.\n\nThen at t=8, position y_8, with y_9 = y_8 + Δy, so if y_9=9, y_8 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_8=8, then at turn t_1 +8, position y_8=8, which is unsafe at t=8.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf y_8=9, then at turn t_1 +8, position y_8=9, which is safe, but y_8=9 means we reached y=9 at turn t_1 +8, which is after 8 actions? Let's clarify.\n\nAt t=0: turn t_1, position y_0=0\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, position at turn t_1 +1 is y_1\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + t}, position at turn t_1 + (t+1) is y_{t+1}\n\nStandard: at turn T, we take action, then position at turn T+1 is set.\n\nSo at turn T=t_1 + t, we take action a_T, then position at turn T+1 is y_{t+1}.\n\nPosition at turn T is denoted as y for that turn.\n\nIn the problem: \"at turn T, the player position is (0, y_T)\"\n\nAnd collision at turn T if on freeway y_T and covered.\n\nThen after action, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nFor turn T, position y_T.\n\nAt T=t_1, y_{t_1} =0\n\nThen action a_{t_1}, then y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn terms of t from t_1.\n\nSet T = t_1 + τ for τ=0,1,2,...\n\nAt turn T = t_1 + τ, position y_τ\n\nThen take action a_{T}, then y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy for next turn.\n\nCollision at turn T=t_1 + τ if 1<= y_τ <=8 and freeway y_τ unsafe at time τ.\n\nWe need to find H such that at turn t_1 + H, y_H =9.\n\ny_H is position after H actions? No.\n\nAt turn t_1, τ=0, y_0\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn t_1+1, y_1\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1 + k, position y_k\n\nWe need y_H =9 for some H.\n\nFor H=9, at turn t_1 +9, y_9=9.\n\nThen at turn t_1 +8, position y_8, and y_9 = y_8 + Δy, so if y_9=9, then y_8 must be 8 or 9, and action U or S.\n\nIf y_8=8, then at turn t_1 +8, position y_8=8, which is freeway 8, and at time τ=8, unsafe, collision.\n\nIf y_8=9, then at turn t_1 +8, position y_8=9, which is safe, and if we take action S, y_9=9, or U, but y cannot exceed 9, probably stay or something, but we can stay.\n\nIf we are at y_8=9 at turn t_1+8, we can take action S, then at turn t_1+9, y_9=9, done.\n\nBut to be at y_8=9 at turn t_1+8, that means we reached y=9 at turn 8, so with H=8 actions, we can be at y=9 at turn t_1+8.\n\nBut we need to reach (0,9), so if we reach at turn t_1+8 with y=9, then H=8 is sufficient, but is that possible?\n\nFrom y=0 to y=9 in 8 actions? Minimal actions to go from 0 to 9 is 9 actions if we move up each time, but with 8 actions, we can at best reach y=8, since each U increases by 1, from 0, after k actions, y <= k.\n\nAfter 0 actions, y=0\n\nAfter 1 action, y<=1\n\n...\n\nAfter 8 actions, y<=8\n\nSo at turn t_1+8, y_8 <=8, cannot be 9.\n\nTherefore, for y_9=9, we must have y_8=8 or 9, but y_8 cannot be 9, so y_8 must be 8, then action U to y_9=9.\n\nBut at turn t_1+8, y_8=8, which is unsafe at τ=8.\n\nSo for H=9, it's impossible because we must be on y=8 at τ=8, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, for any H, if we are on y=8 at τ=8, unsafe.\n\nBut we can avoid being on y=8 at τ=8.\n\nWe can reach y=9 later.\n\nFor example, H=10, at turn t_1+10, y_10=9.\n\nThen at τ=10, y=9 safe.\n\nNow, we need to not be on y=7 or y=8 at τ=8 or τ=9.\n\nSimilarly, at other times.\n\nNow, let's plan the path with minimal H.\n\nFirst, we need to cross y=7 and y=8 at safe times.\n\nSafe times for y=7 and y=8: τ not in {0,1,8,9}, so τ=2,3,4,5,6,7,10,11,...\n\nSimilarly, for other layers, no restrictions except y=1 at high τ, but we can cross early.\n\nSince we start at τ=0, y=0, we can start moving up.\n\nWe can be on y=1 at τ=1, which is safe.\n\nThen y=2 at τ=2, safe.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThe critical part is around y=7 and y=8.\n\nWe need to be on y=7 at some τ where τ not 0,1,8,9.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nAnd since we move step by step, we need to be on y=7 before y=8.\n\nPossible to be on y=7 at τ=7, which is safe.\n\nBut from there, we cannot go to y=8 at τ=8 because unsafe.\n\nWe can stay on y=7, but at τ=8, y=7 unsafe.\n\nGo down to y=6 at τ=8.\n\nThen at τ=8, y=6 safe.\n\nThen at τ=8, we are on y=6.\n\nWe can go up to y=7 at τ=9, but at τ=9, y=7 unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\nSo we need to wait until τ=10 to go to y=7 or y=8.\n\nFor example, at τ=7, if we are on y=7, we must go down to avoid τ=8.\n\nSay go down to y=6 at τ=8.\n\nThen at τ=8, y=6 safe.\n\nBut at τ=9, we cannot go up to y=7 because unsafe, so we can stay on y=6 or go down.\n\nIf we stay on y=6 at τ=9, safe.\n\nThen at τ=9, we are on y=6, take action to go up to y=7 at τ=10.\n\nAt τ=10, y=7 safe.\n\nThen go up to y=8 at τ=11, safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at τ=12.\n\nBut this takes more turns.\n\nH would be 12, since y_12=9.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=7 earlier.\n\nFor example, be on y=7 at τ=6.\n\nτ=6 is safe for y=7.\n\nThen at τ=6, y=7.\n\nThen we need to go to y=8.\n\nIf we go up at τ=6, to y=8 at τ=7.\n\nAt τ=7, y=8: is it safe? Freeway 8 unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9, so τ=7 not in, safe.\n\nThen at τ=7, y=8 safe.\n\nThen from here, we can go to y=9 at τ=8.\n\nBut at τ=8, if we go to y=9, position at turn t_1+8 is y_8.\n\nIf we take action at turn t_1+7 to go up, then at turn t_1+8, y_8=9.\n\nNow, at turn t_1+8, position y_8=9, which is safe, and we are done if H=8, but can we reach y=9 in 8 actions?\n\nFrom y=0, after 8 actions, maximum y=8, so at turn t_1+8, y_8 <=8, cannot be 9.\n\nAfter 8 actions, at turn t_1+8, y_8 <=8.\n\nTo have y_8=8, for example.\n\nThen from there, to reach y=9 at turn t_1+9, we need action U at turn t_1+8, then y_9=9.\n\nBut at turn t_1+8, if y_8=8, it is unsafe.\n\nIn the scenario above: at τ=6, y=7, safe.\n\nAction U at turn t_1+6, then at turn t_1+7, y_7=8.\n\nPosition at turn t_1+7: y_7=8.\n\nTime τ=7.\n\nFreeway 8 at τ=7: unsafe? τ=7 not in {0,1,8,9}, so safe.\n\nThen at turn t_1+7, we take action U, so at turn t_1+8, y_8=9.\n\nNow at turn t_1+8, position y_8=9, safe.\n\nAnd we need y_H=9, so H=8, at turn t_1+8.\n\nBut is this possible? Let's trace the positions.\n\nAt turn t_1 (τ=0): y=0\n\nAction: let's list actions and resulting positions.\n\nWe need to be at y=7 at τ=6.\n\nτ=6 is turn t_1+6.\n\nPosition at turn t_1+6 should be y=7.\n\nHow to get there from start.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=0.\n\nWe can go up each turn until y=7 at τ=6.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=7, need 7 steps up? Positions:\n\nAt τ=0, y=0\n\nAfter action U, at τ=1, y=1\n\nU, τ=2, y=2\n\nU, τ=3, y=3\n\nU, τ=4, y=4\n\nU, τ=5, y=5\n\nU, τ=6, y=6\n\nTo be at y=7 at τ=6, we need to have moved faster.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0\n\nAfter first action (at turn t_1), if U, then at τ=1, y=1\n\nSimilarly, after second action at turn t_1+1, if U, at τ=2, y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1+k, y_k = k if we go up each time.\n\nTo have at turn t_1+6, y_6=7, we need to have increased by 7 in 6 actions, but each action can increase by at most 1, so maximum y after 6 actions is 6, so at τ=6, y_6 <=6, cannot be 7.\n\nThe position at turn t_1 + τ is y_τ.\n\ny_τ is the position after τ actions? No.\n\nAt turn t_1 + 0, y_0 =0, no action yet.\n\nAfter first action at turn t_1, we go to y_1 at turn t_1+1.\n\nAfter second action at turn t_1+1, to y_2 at turn t_1+2.\n\n...\n\nAfter τ actions, at turn t_1 + τ, position y_τ.\n\nAnd y_τ <= τ, since each action increases y by at most 1.\n\nSimilarly, to have y_τ = k, we need τ >= k.\n\nFor example, to be at y=7 at turn t_1 + τ, we need τ >=7, so at τ=7, y_7 can be 7 if we went up each time.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=6, y_6 <=6.\n\nIn the earlier idea, to be at y=7 at τ=6 is impossible because y_6 <=6.\n\nEarliest to be at y=7 is at τ=7, with y_7=7.\n\nThen at τ=7, y=7, which is safe, as τ=7 not unsafe for y=7.\n\nThen from there, we can go to y=8 at τ=8.\n\nBut at τ=8, y=8 is unsafe.\n\nIf we go to y=8 at τ=8, collision.\n\nIf we stay, at τ=8, y=7, but y=7 unsafe at τ=8.\n\nSo we must not be on y=7 or y=8 at τ=8.\n\nTherefore, at τ=7, if we are at y=7, we cannot stay or go up; we must go down.\n\nFor example, go down to y=6 at τ=8.\n\nThen at τ=8, y=6, which is safe.\n\nThen at turn t_1+8, position y_8=6.\n\nNow, we need to go up to y=7, but at τ=9, if we go to y=7, unsafe.\n\nSo we can stay at y=6 at τ=9, safe.\n\nThen at τ=9, y=6, take action U to go to y=7 at τ=10.\n\nAt τ=10, y=7 safe.\n\nThen U to y=8 at τ=11, safe.\n\nThen U to y=9 at τ=12.\n\nSo at τ=12, y_12=9, H=12.\n\nBut we can reach y=7 earlier.\n\nFor example, we can be at y=7 at τ=7, as above.\n\nBut we can be earlier if we move faster, but we start from y=0, so τ=7 is the earliest for y=7.\n\ny_7=7 at τ=7.\n\nSimilarly, we can be at y=7 at later times, but that would delay.\n\nFor example, at τ=10, y=7, but then go to y=8 at τ=11, y=9 at τ=12, same as above.\n\nBut we can be at y=7 at τ=7.\n\nThen instead of going down, we can go to y=6 at τ=8, then wait, then up at τ=10.\n\nBut τ=10 for y=7.\n\nSince y=6 is safe at all times except τ=0, which is irrelevant.\n\nAt τ=8, we are at y=6.\n\nInstead of staying at τ=9, we can go up to y=7 at τ=9, but at τ=9, y=7 unsafe, so cannot.\n\nMust stay or go down.\n\nSo we have to wait until τ=10 to go to y=7.\n\nThen y=7 at τ=10, y=8 at τ=11, y=9 at τ=12.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut is there a way to avoid waiting?\n\nAnother idea: since y=2,3,4,5 are always safe, we can stay there to kill time, but that might not help.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=8 before τ=8.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at τ=8, we need y_8=8, but at τ=8, unsafe.\n\nOr at earlier τ.\n\nFor example, be at y=8 at τ=7.\n\nIs it possible?\n\nAt τ=7, y_7=8.\n\nBut y_7 <=7, since after 7 actions, y<=7, so impossible.\n\nMaximum at τ=7 is y=7.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=6, y<=6.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=8 before τ=8.\n\nEarliest to be on y=8 is at τ=8 with y_8=8, but unsafe.\n\nOr at later times.\n\nSimilarly for y=7, earliest at τ=7.\n\nSo the only way is to be on y=7 at a safe time not 8 or 9, like τ=7, then go down to y=6 at τ=8, then wait at y=6 until τ=10, go to y=7 at τ=10, then to y=8 at τ=11, to y=9 at τ=12.\n\nBut at τ=9, we are at y=6, which is safe, and we can stay or go down, but going down is worse, so stay.\n\nThen at τ=10, go to y=7.\n\nBut we can go to y=7 directly from y=6 at τ=10.\n\nNow, what about the beginning? We can go up quickly to y=6 or something.\n\nLet's list the sequence to minimize H.\n\nH=12 seems long, but we can see if we can do with less.\n\nAnother safe time for y=7 and y=8 is τ=2,3,4,5,6,7,10,...\n\nBut τ=2 to 6 are early.\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=7 at τ=6, but impossible, y_6<=6.\n\nAt τ=6, y_6<=6, so we can be at y=6 at τ=6.\n\nThen from there, we can go to y=7 at τ=7, which is safe.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nWe cannot be on y=7 before τ=7.\n\nSo the earliest safe time for y=7 is τ=7.\n\nSimilarly for y=8, earliest τ=8, but unsafe at τ=8, so we have to be later, like τ=10.\n\nSo we need to delay the crossing of y=7 and y=8 to after τ=9.\n\nSpecifically, be on y=7 at τ=10 or later.\n\nSince we can be at y=6 earlier and wait.\n\nFor example, we can reach y=6 at τ=6, as in the direct path.\n\nAt τ=6, y=6, safe.\n\nThen we can stay at y=6 for a few turns until we can go up safely.\n\nBut at τ=8 and τ=9, we can be on y=6, safe.\n\nThen at τ=9, we take action to go to y=7 at τ=10.\n\nAt τ=10, y=7 safe.\n\nThen at turn t_1+10, take action U to go to y=8 at τ=11.\n\nAt τ=11, y=8 safe.\n\nThen at turn t_1+11, take action U to go to y=9 at τ=12.\n\nSo y_12=9, H=12.\n\nBut at τ=9, we are at y=6, we take action U at turn t_1+9, so at turn t_1+10, y_10=7.\n\nThen U at t_1+10, to y_11=8 at turn t_1+11.\n\nU at t_1+11, to y_12=9 at turn t_1+12.\n\nH=12.\n\nCan we reach y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=7 at τ=10, but we need to get there.\n\nFrom start, to be at y=7 at τ=10, we can go slower in the beginning.\n\nBut that might not help, since we can go fast to y=6 and wait.\n\nFor example, go up from y=0 to y=6 in 6 actions: at τ=0, y=0; U to y1=1 at τ=1; U to y2=2 at τ=2; ... U to y6=6 at τ=6.\n\nThen at τ=6, y=6.\n\nThen we need to stay for 3 turns: at turn t_1+6, take action S, so at τ=7, y=6.\n\nAt turn t_1+7, take action S, at τ=8, y=6.\n\nAt turn t_1+8, take action S, at τ=9, y=6.\n\nAt turn t_1+9, take action U, to y_10=7 at τ=10.\n\nThen U at t_1+10, to y_11=8 at τ=11.\n\nU at t_1+11, to y_12=9 at τ=12.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut at τ=7,8,9 we are at y=6, all safe.\n\nWe can go up to y=5 or something, but no benefit.\n\nPerhaps we can reach a higher position earlier.\n\nFor example, at τ=7, we can be at y=7, but then we have to go down.\n\nSuppose at τ=7, y=7, safe.\n\nThen at turn t_1+7, take action D, so go down to y=6 at τ=8.\n\nThen at τ=8, y=6 safe.\n\nThen at turn t_1+8, we can take action S or D, but to go up later.\n\nBut at τ=9, we cannot go to y=7, unsafe.\n\nSo we must stay or go down.\n\nIf stay, y=6 at τ=9.\n\nThen at turn t_1+9, U to y_10=7 at τ=10.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf from y=6 at τ=8, we go down to y=5 at τ=9, then at τ=9, y=5 safe, then we need to go up to y=6,7,8,9, which takes more turns, worse.\n\nSo best to stay at y=6 from τ=6 to τ=9, then go up.\n\nBut we have to stay for 3 turns: from τ=6 to τ=7,8,9.\n\nAt τ=6, we are at y=6 after arriving.\n\nThen we stay at y=6 for turns τ=7,8,9 by taking S actions.\n\nThen at τ=9, we go to y=7 at τ=10.\n\nBut τ=10 is turn t_1+10.\n\ny_10=7.\n\nThen to y=8 at τ=11, y_11=8.\n\nTo y=9 at τ=12, y_12=9.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut can we reduce the waiting time?\n\nNotice that at τ=7, if we are at y=7, we go down to y=6 at τ=8, so we are at y=6 at τ=8, which is the same as above at that time.\n\nThen we still need to stay or something.\n\nBut from there, we are at y=6 at τ=8, same as if we had stayed at y=6 from beginning.\n\nNo gain.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=8 at τ=10 directly, but to be at y=8 at τ=10, we need to come from y=7 or y=9, but y=9 later.\n\nAt τ=10, y=8, then go to y=9 at τ=11.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at τ=10, we need to have been at y=7 or y=8 or y=9 at τ=9, with appropriate action.\n\nBut at τ=9, if on y=7 or y=8, unsafe.\n\nIf on y=9, too early.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=8 at τ=10 without being on unsafe freeway at τ=9.\n\nSimilarly, we must be on y=7 at τ=10, which requires not being on y=7 or y=8 at τ=9, so we must be at y=6 or below at τ=9.\n\nThen go to y=7 at τ=10.\n\nSo the waiting is necessary.\n\nH=12 seems the minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can do with H=11.\n\nSuppose H=11, y_11=9.\n\nThen at τ=11, y=9.\n\nAt τ=10, y_10 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_10=9, then at τ=10, y=9 safe, and we can be there, but to be at y_10=9, we need to have reached earlier, so H could be 10, but let's see.\n\nIf y_10=9, then at turn t_1+10, y_10=9, so H=10.\n\nBut to have y_10=9, at τ=10, y=9.\n\nThen at τ=9, y_9 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_9=8, then at τ=9, y=8 unsafe.\n\nIf y_9=9, then at τ=9, y=9 safe, but to be at y_9=9, we need H=9, which we saw impossible because at τ=8, y_8 must be 8 or 9, but y_8=8 unsafe, y_8=9 impossible.\n\nSo H=9 impossible.\n\nSimilarly, for H=10, y_10=9.\n\nThen at τ=10, y=9.\n\nAt τ=9, y_9 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_9=8, then at τ=9, y=8 unsafe.\n\nIf y_9=9, then at τ=9, y=9 safe, but to have y_9=9, we need at τ=8, y_8=8 or 9, but y_8=8 unsafe, y_8=9 impossible, so y_9=9 impossible. Thus for H=10, y_10=9 requires y_9=8 or 9, both impossible or unsafe, so H=10 impossible.\n\nSimilarly, H=11: y_11=9.\n\nAt τ=11, y=9.\n\nAt τ=10, y_10 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_10=8, then at τ=10, y=8 safe? τ=10 not unsafe, so safe.\n\nThen possible.\n\nIf y_10=9, then at τ=10, y=9 safe, but to have y_10=9, need y_9=8 or 9, which as above, y_9=8 unsafe at τ=9, y_9=9 impossible, so y_10=9 impossible. Thus for H=11, y_11=9 requires y_10=8 or 9, so y_10=8 is possible, then action U to y_11=9.\n\nNow, y_10=8 at τ=10, which is safe.\n\nHow to reach y_10=8.\n\ny_10=8 at τ=10.\n\nThen at τ=9, y_9 must be 7,8, or 9, with action to reach y_10=8.\n\nIf action U from y_9=7, or S from y_9=8, or D from y_9=9, but y_9=9 impossible.\n\nSo y_9=7 or 8.\n\nBut at τ=9, if y_9=7 or 8, both unsafe for their freeways.\n\ny_9=7: freeway 7 unsafe at τ=9.\n\ny_9=8: freeway 8 unsafe at τ=9.\n\nSo collision at τ=9 if on y=7 or 8.\n\nThus impossible to have y_10=8 without being on unsafe freeway at τ=9.\n\nTherefore, H=11 impossible.\n\nSimilarly, H=12: y_12=9.\n\nAt τ=12, y=9.\n\nAt τ=11, y_11 must be 8 or 9.\n\ny_11=8 or 9.\n\nIf y_11=9, then at τ=11, y=9 safe, and we can have reached earlier, but let's see.\n\ny_11=8: at τ=11, y=8 safe (since τ=11 not unsafe).\n\nThen action U to y_12=9.\n\ny_11=9: possible if reached earlier.\n\nBut to have y_11=9, need H=11, which we think impossible, but let's not assume.\n\nFor y_11=8 at τ=11, safe.\n\nThen we need to reach y_11=8.\n\ny_11=8 at τ=11.\n\nThen at τ=10, y_10 must be 7,8, or 9.\n\ny_10=7: action U to y_11=8\n\ny_10=8: action S to y_11=8\n\ny_10=9: action D to y_11=8, but y_10=9 possible? If we reached earlier.\n\nBut at τ=10, y_10=7,8, or9.\n\nIf y_10=7, at τ=10, y=7 safe.\n\nIf y_10=8, at τ=10, y=8 safe.\n\nIf y_10=9, at τ=10, y=9 safe.\n\nAll safe at τ=10.\n\nNow, to have y_10=7, for example.\n\nThen at τ=9, y_9 must be 6,7, or8 with action to y_10=7.\n\nBut at τ=9, if y_9=7 or 8, unsafe.\n\nIf y_9=6, action D to y_10=7? Action D would be y_10 = y_9 -1, so from y_9=6, D to y_10=5, not 7.\n\nTo reach y_10=7, from y_9:\n\n- If action U, y_10 = y_9 +1, so y_9=6\n\n- If action S, y_10 = y_9, so y_9=7\n\n- If action D, y_10 = y_9 -1, so y_9=8\n\nSo y_9 must be 6,7, or8.\n\nAt τ=9, y_9=6,7, or8.\n\nIf y_9=7 or 8, unsafe.\n\nIf y_9=6, safe, and action U to y_10=7.\n\nSimilarly for other cases.\n\nSo for y_10=7, it is possible with y_9=6 and action U.\n\ny_9=6 at τ=9, safe.\n\nThen action U to y_10=7 at τ=10.\n\nSimilarly, if we want y_10=8, from y_9=7 or 8 or 9, but y_9=7 or 8 unsafe at τ=9, y_9=9 impossible, so y_10=8 cannot be achieved without collision or impossibility.\n\nThus for H=12, we can have y_11=8 with y_10=7 and action U, or y_10=8 with action S, but y_10=8 only possible if y_9=8, unsafe, or from above, y_10=8 not possible safely, so only way is y_10=7, then U to y_11=8.\n\nThen U to y_12=9.\n\nNow, to have y_10=7, we need y_9=6 with action U.\n\ny_9=6 at τ=9, safe.\n\nWe can reach y_9=6 easily.\n\nFor example, from start, go up to y=6 by τ=6, then stay at y=6 until τ=9.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- At τ=0: y=0\n\nAction U, to y1=1 at τ=1\n\nU, to y2=2 at τ=2\n\nU, to y3=3 at τ=3\n\nU, to y4=4 at τ=4\n\nU, to y5=5 at τ=5\n\nU, to y6=6 at τ=6\n\nNow at turn t_1+6, position y6=6, take action S, to y7=6 at τ=7\n\nAt t_1+7, take action S, to y8=6 at τ=8\n\nAt t_1+8, take action S, to y9=6 at τ=9\n\nAt t_1+9, take action U, to y10=7 at τ=10\n\nAt t_1+10, take action U, to y11=8 at τ=11\n\nAt t_1+11, take action U, to y12=9 at τ=12\n\nAnd at each turn, no collision because:\n\n- τ=1 to 5: on y=1 to 5, all safe at those times.\n\n- τ=6: y=6, safe\n\n- τ=7: y=6, safe\n\n- τ=8: y=6, safe\n\n- τ=9: y=6, safe\n\n- τ=10: y=7, safe (τ=10 not unsafe)\n\n- τ=11: y=8, safe\n\n- τ=12: y=9, safe\n\nH=12 actions, reaching at turn t_1+12.\n\nBut can we start moving later or something to reduce H? Probably not, since we need to cover the distance.\n\nWe could go slower in the beginning to save time, but no, going slower means we reach y=6 later, and we still have to wait until τ=9 to go up, so it might take more turns.\n\nFor example, if we go up slower, say stay at y=0 for some turns, then we reach y=6 later, say at τ=8, then we are at y=6 at τ=8, but we need to be at y=6 at τ=9 to go to y=7 at τ=10.\n\nIf we reach y=6 at τ=8, then at τ=8, y=6, we can stay at τ=9, y=6, then go to y=7 at τ=10, same as before, but we might have wasted time staying earlier.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=0 for 2 turns, then start going up.\n\nAt τ=0: y=0, action S, to y1=0 at τ=1\n\nAction S, to y2=0 at τ=2\n\nThen U, to y3=1 at τ=3\n\nU, to y4=2 at τ=4\n\nU, to y5=3 at τ=5\n\nU, to y6=4 at τ=6\n\nU, to y7=5 at τ=7\n\nU, to y8=6 at τ=8\n\nThen at τ=8, y=6, action S to y9=6 at τ=9\n\nThen U to y10=7 at τ=10\n\nU to y11=8 at τ=11\n\nU to y12=9 at τ=12\n\nStill H=12, but we have two extra S actions at start, same H.\n\nWorse if we stay more.\n\nSo minimal H is 12 with the first sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, at τ=6,7,8,9 we are at y=6, which is fine.\n\nNow, the actions are for turns t_1 + t for t=0 to 11.\n\nt from 0 to 11, 12 actions.\n\nAnswer should be the actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nIn this case, actions from turn 54 to 54+11=65.\n\nList:\n\nTurn t_1: action U (to go to y=1)\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt turn t_1 (τ=0): position y=0, take action a_{t_1} = U, then at turn t_1+1, y=1\n\nAt turn t_1+1 (τ=1): position y=1, take action U, to y=2 at t_1+2\n\n...\n\nUp to at turn t_1+5 (τ=5): position y=5, take action U, to y=6 at t_1+6\n\nAt turn t_1+6 (τ=6): position y=6, take action S, to y=6 at t_1+7\n\nAt turn t_1+7 (τ=7): position y=6, take action S, to y=6 at t_1+8\n\nAt turn t_1+8 (τ=8): position y=6, take action S, to y=6 at t_1+9\n\nAt turn t_1+9 (τ=9): position y=6, take action U, to y=7 at t_1+10\n\nAt turn t_1+10 (τ=10): position y=7, take action U, to y=8 at t_1+11\n\nAt turn t_1+11 (τ=11): position y=8, take action U, to y=9 at t_1+12\n\nSo we reach at turn t_1+12 with y=9.\n\nActions from turn t_1 to t_1+11.\n\nThat is 12 actions.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut the sequence of actions: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1+11}\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed.\n\nNow, but we have freeway 1 unsafe at τ=16-19, but since we cross early, no problem.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nIn this path, we don't even go to y=1 at high τ.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nBut is there a way with H=11? We thought not, but let's confirm.\n\nSuppose we go to y=5 faster or something, but y=5 at τ=5, then we can stay, but we still need to go to y=6,7,8,9.\n\nBut the bottleneck is crossing y=7 and y=8 after τ=9.\n\nSince y=6 is safe, we must be on y=6 at τ=9 to go to y=7 at τ=10.\n\nAnd to be at y=6 at τ=9, we need to have reached by then.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=6 is τ=6, so we can be there from τ=6 to τ=9.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nNo shorter.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=7 at τ=7, then down to y=6 at τ=8, then at τ=8 we are at y=6, same as before, then we still need to stay at τ=9 y=6, then up at τ=10.\n\nSame as staying from beginning.\n\nNo gain.\n\nSo H=12 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have three S actions at y=6.\n\nBut in the action list.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nt_1=54.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U  (to y=2 at turn 56)\n\nIn terms of turns:\n\nTurn t_1 + t for t=0 to 11.\n\nt_1=54\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 54: action U  (after this, at turn 55, y=1)\n\nTurn 55: action U  (to y=2 at turn 56)\n\nTurn 56: action U  (to y=3 at turn 57)\n\nTurn 57: action U  (to y=4 at turn 58)\n\nTurn 58: action U  (to y=5 at turn 59)\n\nTurn 59: action U  (to y=6 at turn 60)\n\nNow at turn 60, position y=6, take action S, so to y=6 at turn 61\n\nTurn 60: action S  (to y=6 at turn 61)\n\nSimilarly,\n\nTurn 61: action S  (to y=6 at turn 62)\n\nTurn 62: action S  (to y=6 at turn 63? Let's index.\n\nAt turn turn t_1 + t, action a, then position at next turn.\n\nAfter action at turn 59 (t_1+5), position at turn 60 is y=6.\n\nThen at turn 60 (t_1+6), take action S, so position at turn 61 is y=6\n\nAt turn 61 (t_1+7), take action S, position at turn 62 is y=6\n\nAt turn 62 (t_1+8), take action S, position at turn 63 is y=6\n\nt_1+8 is turn 62, position at turn 63? Let's list the turn when action is taken.\n\nDefine:\n\n- At turn 54: position y=0, take action U → position at turn 55: y=1\n\n- At turn 55: position y=1, take action U → position at turn 56: y=2\n\n- At turn 56: position y=2, take action U → position at turn 57: y=3\n\n- At turn 57: position y=3, take action U → position at turn 58: y=4\n\n- At turn 58: position y=4, take action U → position at turn 59: y=5\n\n- At turn 59: position y=5, take action U → position at turn 60: y=6\n\n- At turn 60: position y=6, take action S → position at turn 61: y=6\n\n- At turn 61: position y=6, take action S → position at turn 62: y=6\n\n- At turn 62: position y=6, take action S → position at turn 63: y=6\n\n- At turn 63: position y=6, take action U → position at turn 64: y=7\n\n- At turn 64: position y=7, take action U → position at turn 65: y=8\n\n- At turn 65: position y=8, take action U → position at turn 66: y=9\n\nPosition at turn 66 is y=9, which is after 12 actions, from turn 54 to 65.\n\nH=12, actions from t_1 to t_1+11=65.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 63: action U to y=7 at turn 64.\n\nThen turn 64: action U to y=8 at turn 65.\n\nTurn 65: action U to y=9 at turn 66.\n\nAt turn 64, position y=7, which is at time τ=10 (since turn t_1+10=64, τ=10), freeway 7 safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 65, position y=8, τ=11, safe.\n\nTurn 66, y=9, safe.\n\nAnd during waiting, all safe.\n\nNow, but in the car state, we have freeway 6 with cars, but at τ=6,7,8,9, we are on y=6, which is safe since only unsafe at τ=0.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose we go up to y=7 at τ=7, then at turn t_1+7, take action D, so go down to y=6 at turn t_1+8, position y=8? No.\n\nAt turn t_1+7 (τ=7), position y=7, take action D, then position at turn t_1+8: y=6 (since Δy = -1 for D)\n\nThen at turn t_1+8 (τ=8), position y=6, safe.\n\nThen at turn t_1+8, we can take action? But we need to go up later.\n\nAt τ=8, y=6, we take action, say S, to y=6 at τ=9.\n\nThen at τ=9, y=6, take U to y=7 at τ=10, etc., same as before.\n\nIf at τ=8, y=6, we take U to go to y=7 at τ=9, but at τ=9, y=7 unsafe, cannot.\n\nSo must not go up at τ=9.\n\nThus no benefit.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 12.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nThe sequence of actions:\n\nFor turn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: S\n\nTurn 61: S\n\nTurn 62: S\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write the turns.\n\nt_1=54.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 54: a_{54} = U\n\nTurn 55: a_{55} = U\n\nTurn 56: a_{56} = U\n\nTurn 57: a_{57} = U\n\nTurn 58: a_{58} = U\n\nTurn 59: a_{59} = U\n\nTurn 60: a_{60} = S\n\nTurn 61: a_{61} = S\n\nTurn 62: a_{62} = S\n\nTurn 63: a_{63} = U\n\nTurn 64: a_{64} = U\n\nTurn 65: a_{65} = U\n\nAfter action at turn 65, position at turn 66 is y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence, from turn 54 to 65, 12 actions.\n\nH=12.\n\nI think this is minimal.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 54\\) is 12. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by moving up to \\(y = 6\\) quickly and then staying at \\(y = 6\\) for three turns to avoid the unsafe times for freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) at \\(\\tau = 8\\) and \\(\\tau = 9\\) (where \\(\\tau = T - t_1\\) is the time step from turn \\(t_1\\)).\n\nThe unsafe times for each freeway are:\n- \\(y = 1\\): unsafe at \\(\\tau = 16, 17, 18, 19\\) (not relevant as crossing occurs early).\n- \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\): always safe.\n- \\(y = 6\\): unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 0\\) (not relevant as player is not on \\(y = 6\\) at \\(\\tau = 0\\)).\n- \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\): unsafe at \\(\\tau = 0, 1, 8, 9\\).\n\nThe player starts at \\(\\tau = 0\\), \\(y = 0\\). The sequence moves up to \\(y = 6\\) by \\(\\tau = 6\\) (turn \\(t_1 + 6 = 60\\)), stays at \\(y = 6\\) for \\(\\tau = 7, 8, 9\\) (turns \\(t_1 + 7 = 61\\) to \\(t_1 + 9 = 63\\)) to avoid being on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) during unsafe times, then moves up to \\(y = 9\\) by \\(\\tau = 12\\) (turn \\(t_1 + 12 = 66\\)).\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- At turn \\(54\\) (\\(\\tau = 0\\)), action \\(U\\): move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn \\(55\\).\n- At turn \\(55\\) (\\(\\tau = 1\\)), action \\(U\\): move to \\(y = 2\\) at turn \\(56\\).\n- At turn \\(56\\) (\\(\\tau = 2\\)), action \\(U\\): move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn \\(57\\).\n- At turn \\(57\\) (\\(\\tau = 3\\)), action \\(U\\): move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn \\(58\\).\n- At turn \\(58\\) (\\(\\tau = 4\\)), action \\(U\\): move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn \\(59\\).\n- At turn \\(59\\) (\\(\\tau = 5\\)), action \\(U\\): move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn \\(60\\).\n- At turn \\(60\\) (\\(\\tau = 6\\)), action \\(S\\): stay at \\(y = 6\\) at turn \\(61\\).\n- At turn \\(61\\) (\\(\\tau = 7\\)), action \\(S\\): stay at \\(y = 6\\) at turn \\(62\\).\n- At turn \\(62\\) (\\(\\tau = 8\\)), action \\(S\\): stay at \\(y = 6\\) at turn \\(63\\).\n- At turn \\(63\\) (\\(\\tau = 9\\)), action \\(U\\): move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn \\(64\\).\n- At turn \\(64\\) (\\(\\tau = 10\\)), action \\(U\\): move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn \\(65\\).\n- At turn \\(65\\) (\\(\\tau = 11\\)), action \\(U\\): move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(66\\).\n\nCollision checks confirm safety:\n- \\(\\tau = 1\\) to \\(5\\): On \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 5\\), all safe at these times.\n- \\(\\tau = 6\\) to \\(9\\): On \\(y = 6\\), safe except at \\(\\tau = 0\\) (not applicable).\n- \\(\\tau = 10\\): On \\(y = 7\\), safe (\\(\\tau = 10\\) not unsafe).\n- \\(\\tau = 11\\): On \\(y = 8\\), safe (\\(\\tau = 11\\) not unsafe).\n- \\(\\tau = 12\\): On \\(y = 9\\), safe (no cars).\n\nNo shorter sequence is possible, as \\(H = 9\\), \\(H = 10\\), and \\(H = 11\\) all require being on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) during unsafe times at \\(\\tau = 8\\) or \\(\\tau = 9\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 54: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 55: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 56: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 57: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 58: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 59: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 60: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 61: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 62: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 63: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 64: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 65: \\, U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nPlayer movement: \n  U: y increases by 1 (up)\n  D: y decreases by 1 (down)\n  S: stay (y remains)\n\nImportant: The player can only be at y in [0,9]. So if at y=0 and we try to go down, we stay at 0. Similarly, at y=9, going up stays at 9.\n\nCollision condition:\n  At turn T, if the player is at position (0, y_T) and there is a car on freeway y_T (i.e., the freeway corresponding to the row the player is on at that turn) such that the car's span at turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player), then collision occurs.\n\nNote: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on freeway y_T during the entire turn T. Therefore, we only check the car on the freeway of the current row (y_T) at turn T.\n\nCar movement:\n  For a car at freeway k (which is fixed) with initial (at turn t1=60) head h, tail tau, direction d, and speed s:\n    - If d is 'right', then at turn T (>= t1), the car's span is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n    - If d is 'left', then the car's span is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: the given cars are all moving right? Actually, the table says \"right\" for all.\n\nHowever, note that for freeway 6,7,8 there are two cars.\n\nWe are at turn 60. We are going to simulate from turn 60 onward.\n\nGoal: Find the minimal H and a sequence of actions (starting at turn 60) of length H such that at the last turn (turn 60+H-1) the player is at y=9.\n\nWe start at y0 = 0 (at turn 60).\n\nWe must avoid being at a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway at turn T that covers x=0.\n\nNote: We are only at risk when on freeways 1 to 8. At y=0 and y=9, there are no cars? Actually, the freeways with cars are from 1 to 8. So at y=0 and y=9, we are safe (no cars).\n\nTherefore, we only worry about rows 1 to 8.\n\nWe are at turn 60 at (0,0). We need to get to (0,9). We can only change by at most 1 per turn. So we must go through the rows 0->1->...->9. But note we might wait (S) or even go down? But going down from 0 is not possible (it stays at 0). Since we start at 0 and need to get to 9, we must go up. However, we might have to wait sometimes to avoid cars.\n\nWe are to output the actions starting at turn 60 (t1) for H turns (so the last action is at turn 60+H-1, and after that action we are at (0,9)).\n\nWe need to compute the positions of the cars at any future turn T (relative to turn 60, so T = 60, 61, ...).\n\nLet me denote the relative time: t = T - 60, so at t=0 we are at turn 60.\n\nThen for a car with initial head h, tail tau, direction right, speed s, at relative time t (i.e., turn 60+t) the car's span is:\n  [tau + s*t, h + s*t]\n\nWe must avoid being at freeway k (for k in 1..8) at relative time t if there is a car on freeway k such that 0 is in [tau + s*t, h + s*t] (for a right-moving car).\n\nBut note: for a car that is right-moving, we have head h and tail tau. However, in the table, for example, freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3). Note: the head is -48 and tail is -59? But typically for a right-moving car, the head is the front (which is at a higher x) and tail at lower? But here head=-48 and tail=-59, meaning that the car extends from -59 to -48? So if the car is moving right, then at time t, the car is at [ -59 + 3*t, -48 + 3*t ].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 6: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12). For the first car: [37+12*t, 48+12*t] and for the second: [-11+12*t, 0+12*t].\n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. However, in the table, the representation is (head, tail, ...). In the example of freeway1: head=-48, tail=-59. Then the initial span is [tau, h] = [-59, -48]? But the problem says for right-moving: the initial span is [tau, h] and then becomes [tau+s*(T-t1), h+s*(T-t1)]. So yes, the car on freeway1 at t=0 is at [-59, -48]. Then at time t, it is at [-59+3t, -48+3t].\n\nSimilarly, the second car on freeway6 at t=0: (0, -11) -> so [ -11, 0 ]? Then at time t: [ -11+12t, 0+12t ].\n\nNow, we must check for each freeway and each car on that freeway at a given time t (relative) whether 0 is in the interval [A, B] (for a right-moving car: [tau+s*t, h+s*t]).\n\nNote: the interval is inclusive? The problem says \"if 0 in Span(T)\", so inclusive.\n\nWe are going to simulate the player's movement. We start at y=0 at t=0 (turn60). We must end at y=9 at some time H-1 (so at the end of the last action we are at y=9).\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) over states (time, y) to find the minimal steps. The state is (t, y) where t is the relative time (starting at 0) and y is the current row. We start at (0,0). We want to reach any (t,9) with minimal t (so minimal H = t+1? because at time 0 we are at turn60, and we take H actions: from t=0 to t=H-1, and at the end we are at time H-1?).\n\nActually, at relative time t (meaning we have taken t actions: from turn60 to turn60+t-1? Let me clarify:\n\nAt turn60 (current turn) we are at (0,0). We are about to take an action at turn60. Then at the next turn (turn61) we update.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning:\n  t=0: a_{t1} = a_60\n  t=1: a_61\n  ...\n  t=H-1: a_{60+H-1}\n\nAnd after H actions, at turn60+H, the player's position is updated H times. However, the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nWait: the sequence is from t=0 to H-1? Then the last action is at turn60+H-1. After that action, we have the position at turn60+H? But the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nLet me re-read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nActually, the player update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo at turn t1 (60): we are at y_60 = 0.\nThen we take action a_60: then y_61 = y_60 + Delta y_60.\n\nThen at turn t1+1 (61): we take a_61, then y_62 = y_61 + Delta y_61.\n\nSo at the end of the sequence (after the last action at turn60+H-1), we have:\n  y_{60+H} = y_{60+H-1} + Delta y_{60+H-1}\n\nBut we require that at turn60+H-1, we are at 9? Actually, the requirement is: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nWait, the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". So after the last action (which is at turn60+H-1) we are at 9? \n\nBut note: the position at turn60+H-1 is the position after the action taken at turn60+H-2? \n\nActually, the state at turn60+t is after the action at turn60+t-1? \n\nLet me define:\n  At turn60: we are at (0,0). We take action a_60 -> then at turn61 we are at y_61 = y_60 + Delta y_60.\n\nSo the position at turn60 is given (0). Then we take an action at turn60 to move to y_61.\n\nTherefore, the position at turn60+t is the position after t actions? \n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions is from turn60 to turn60+H-1. And we require that at turn60+H-1 we are at 9. \n\nThis means: after taking the action at turn60+H-1, we are at 9? \n\nBut note: the position at turn60+H-1 is the position after the action at turn60+H-2? \n\nWait, let me index:\n\nTurn60: position is y_60 = 0.\nAfter action a_60 at turn60: we get y_61 = 0 + Delta y_60.\n\nSo the position at turn61 is y_61.\n\nTherefore, the position at turn60 is fixed (0). Then:\n\n  turn60: take a_60 -> leads to y_61.\n  turn61: take a_61 -> leads to y_62.\n  ...\n  turn60+H-1: take a_{60+H-1} -> leads to y_{60+H}.\n\nBut the requirement is that the position at turn60+H-1 is 9? That would be y_{60+H-1} = 9. \n\nBut y_{60+H-1} is the position at the beginning of turn60+H-1? Or after the action? \n\nActually, the update rule: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t. Then we take action a_t, which determines Delta y_t, and then we get y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, the position at turn60 is y_60=0 (given). Then we take an action at turn60 to get y_61.\n\nThen at turn61, we are at y_61. Then we take action at turn61 to get y_62.\n\nSo the position at turn60+t (for t>=0) is the position at the beginning of that turn? \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\" meaning at the beginning of turn60+H-1 we are at 9? \n\nBut then we haven't taken the action at turn60+H-1? And the sequence of actions includes a_{60+H-1}? \n\nThat would be inconsistent.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" \n  and \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nBut note: the action at turn60+t is taken at that turn, and then the position at the next turn is updated. \n\nSo the last action is at turn60+H-1, which then updates the position to turn60+H. But we require that at turn60+H-1 we are at 9? \n\nThat means we are at 9 at the beginning of turn60+H-1? Then we don't need to take an action at that turn? But the sequence includes an action at turn60+H-1.\n\nAlternatively, the requirement might be that at the turn when we are at 9, that turn is turn60+H-1? And we do take an action at that turn? But then the action at that turn would change the position? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLooking back: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nBut if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn60+H-1, then we don't need to do anything? But the sequence requires an action at turn60+H-1. \n\nAlternatively, we might interpret that the sequence of H actions leads to the state at turn60+H-1 being 9. How?\n\nActually, the position at turn60 is 0. After the first action (at turn60) we get y_61. Then after the second action (at turn61) we get y_62, ... and after the (H-1)-th action (which is at turn60+H-1) we get y_{60+H}. \n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so we take H actions. And we require that at turn60+H-1 we are at 9? \n\nBut turn60+H-1 is the turn at which we take the last action? Then at the beginning of turn60+H-1 we are at y_{60+H-1}, then we take an action a_{60+H-1} to get y_{60+H}. \n\nSo the requirement is that at the beginning of turn60+H-1 we are at 9? Then we take an action (which must be S, because if we move we leave 9) and then we remain at 9? But then the position at turn60+H is 9. \n\nBut the problem says: we require y_{60+H-1}=9, not y_{60+H}=9.\n\nAlternatively, if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn60+H-1, then we don't need to take an action? But the sequence requires an action at turn60+H-1.\n\nSo it must be that the action at turn60+H-1 is S? Then we stay at 9. And then the position at the next turn (which we don't care about) is still 9.\n\nBut the requirement is only that at turn60+H-1 (the beginning) we are at 9. Then after the action we are still at 9? \n\nYes, that works. But note: we are required to output an action for turn60+H-1. So if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn60+H-1, then we can choose S.\n\nBut how do we get to 9 at the beginning of turn60+H-1? That means that the action at turn60+H-2 must have moved us to 9? \n\nWait: \n  At turn60+H-2: we are at y_{60+H-2}. Then we take action a_{60+H-2} to get y_{60+H-1} = y_{60+H-2} + Delta a_{60+H-2}.\n\nWe require y_{60+H-1}=9.\n\nSo the last action that matters is at turn60+H-2? And then at turn60+H-1 we are at 9, and then we take an action (which must be S) to stay at 9? But that would be one extra turn.\n\nAlternatively, we might get to 9 at turn60+H-1 by the action at turn60+H-1? \n\nBut the action at turn60+H-1: \n  y_{60+H} = y_{60+H-1} + Delta a_{60+H-1}\n\nWe require y_{60+H-1}=9. Then if we take any action at turn60+H-1, the next position is 9+Delta. But we don't require anything about y_{60+H}. \n\nBut the problem says we must be at 9 at turn60+H-1. So we are at 9 at the beginning of turn60+H-1. Then we take an action. If we take U, we go to 10 -> but that's invalid (must be in [0,9]). Similarly, D goes to 8. S stays at 9. \n\nSo the only valid action at turn60+H-1 is S? Then we stay at 9. Then the sequence ends and we are at 9 at the beginning of the next turn? But we don't care about the next turn.\n\nBut the requirement is only that at turn60+H-1 we are at 9. So we are at 9 at the beginning of that turn, and then we take an action. The problem doesn't require that we remain at 9 after the action? It only requires the position at turn60+H-1 to be 9.\n\nTherefore, we can take any action? But if we take U or D, we leave 9? Then at the next turn we are not at 9? But the requirement is only at turn60+H-1. \n\nHowever, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" meaning that we are at (0,9) at turn60+H-1. Then we are done. We don't care what happens after.\n\nBut note: the collision condition: we must avoid collisions at every turn we are on. At turn60+H-1, we are at (0,9). Since 9 is the goal and there are no cars on freeway 9, we are safe. Then we take an action? But that action might move us to another row? But the problem doesn't require that we stay at 9. It only requires that at turn60+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nBut then why take an action? The sequence must have H actions. So we must take an action at turn60+H-1. \n\nHowever, if we take an action that moves us away from 9, then we are no longer at 9? But we were at 9 at the beginning of the turn? That satisfies the requirement.\n\nBut that seems odd. Alternatively, the problem might intend that we are at 9 after the entire sequence? \n\nLooking back: \"reach (0,9)\". And the sequence of actions leads to that.\n\nBut the problem states: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nSo I think we have to be at 9 at the beginning of turn60+H-1. Then we take an action at that turn (which can be anything, but we are only required to be at 9 at the beginning of that turn). However, if we take an action that moves us down to 8, then we are at 8 at the next turn? But the problem doesn't require that we remain at 9. \n\nBut note: we are only required to avoid collisions on freeways 1-8. At turn60+H-1, we are at 9 (safe). Then we take an action. The next turn we are at y_{60+H}. If that y is in [1,8], then we must check for collisions at turn60+H. But the problem doesn't require that? It only says \"to reach (0,9)\" at turn60+H-1. \n\nSo we don't care what happens after turn60+H-1? \n\nBut then we might have a collision at turn60+H? \n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars\" during the entire sequence of turns? \n\nRe-reading: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\"\n\nSo we must avoid collisions for every turn from turn60 to turn60+H-1? \n\nBecause at turn T (from 60 to 60+H-1) we are at a position (0, y_T) and we must avoid collisions at that turn.\n\nTherefore, we must be safe at every turn in the range [60, 60+H-1].\n\nSo at turn60+H-1, we are at (0,9) (safe). Then we take an action at that turn? But then we are at turn60+H, and we are at (0, y_{60+H}) and we must avoid collision at turn60+H? \n\nBut the problem doesn't say we require to avoid collisions after we have reached 9? \n\nThe problem says: \"to reach (0,9)\" and \"avoiding collisions\" during the journey. So once we have reached (0,9) at turn60+H-1, then we have reached. The action we take at turn60+H-1 might move us away, but we are only concerned with avoiding collisions until we have reached the goal? \n\nBut note: the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn60+H-1. Then at that turn we are safe. Then we take an action at that turn? But that action happens at the same turn we reached? \n\nThe problem doesn't specify that we must remain at the goal. It only requires that at the turn60+H-1 we are at the goal. \n\nBut the collision condition applies at every turn we are on the freeway. So if at turn60+H-1 we are at 9 (safe), and then we take an action that moves us to 8 at the next turn (turn60+H), then we are not at the goal at turn60+H? But we were at the goal at turn60+H-1. \n\nAnd we are not required to be safe after the goal? \n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1, ..., 8\" during the entire sequence of turns. The sequence of turns is from turn60 to ...? \n\nThe problem doesn't explicitly say for which turns, but logically we must avoid collisions at every turn we are in the freeway (i.e., at every turn from the start until we finish the actions). \n\nBut note: the goal is reached at turn60+H-1. The actions are taken at turns 60 to 60+H-1. Therefore, we must be safe at every turn from 60 to 60+H-1? \n\nAt turn60+H-1, we are at 9 (safe). Then we take an action at that turn. But the action does not put us in danger at turn60+H-1 because we are at 9. However, the action causes the next state, but we don't care about the next state? \n\nBut the collision condition is checked at the turn when we are at a particular freeway. At turn60+H-1, we are at 9, so no collision. The action we take at turn60+H-1 does not affect the safety at turn60+H-1? \n\nTherefore, we can take any action? But if we take an action that moves us to 8 at turn60+H, then we are at 8 at turn60+H, but we are not required to avoid collision at turn60+H? \n\nThe problem only requires avoiding collisions during the turns in which we are taking actions? That is, turns 60 to 60+H-1. At turn60+H, we are not taking an action? Because the sequence has H actions: from turn60 to turn60+H-1.\n\nSo we don't care about turn60+H.\n\nTherefore, we only need to ensure that at every turn T in [60, 60+H-1] (the turns we are present) we are safe.\n\nAt turn60+H-1, we are at 9 (safe). Then we take an action (any action) at turn60+H-1, and then the game continues? But we are done.\n\nSo the minimal H is the minimal number of actions to get to 9 at the beginning of some turn (which will be turn60+H-1) and then we take the last action (which can be arbitrary, but we choose S to be safe? Or we can choose U? but if we choose U at y=9, we stay at 9? Actually, the update: at y=9, U: y_{next}=min(9+1,9)=9? The problem says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we try to go above 9, we stay at 9. Similarly for D at 0.\n\nSo at y=9, any action: \n  U: 9 -> min(9+1,9) -> 9\n  D: 9 -> max(9-1,0) -> 8\n  S: 9\n\nBut if we choose D, then at the next turn (which we don't control) we are at 8? But we don't care. However, the problem doesn't require that we remain at 9. So we can choose any action at the last step? But to be consistent, we can choose S.\n\nBut note: we must output an action for turn60+H-1. Since we are at 9 at the beginning of that turn, we can choose S.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose U or D? But if we choose D, then we leave 9? But that's allowed. However, the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at turn60+H-1. So we are at 9 at that turn. Then we leave? \n\nSo the minimal H: we need to get to 9 as soon as possible at the beginning of a turn.\n\nHow many steps to go from 0 to 9? At least 9 moves (if we go up every time). But we might have to wait (S) to avoid cars.\n\nSo H is the number of actions. The minimal H is at least 9? Because we start at 0 and need to get to 9.\n\nBut we can do it in 9 actions: all U. Then at turn60+0: action0: U -> y61=1\n          turn60+1: U -> y62=2\n          ...\n          turn60+8: U -> y69=9\n\nThen at turn60+9-1 = turn60+8, we are at 9? \n\nBut then H = 9? The sequence would be from t=0 to t=8 (9 actions). Then at the beginning of turn60+8? we are at y_{60+8}? \n\nLet me clarify the indexing:\n\nAt turn60: we are at y60=0. Then we take 9 actions: a60 to a68 (which are U each). Then:\n  After a60: y61=1\n  After a61: y62=2\n  ...\n  After a68: y69=9\n\nThen the position at turn60+9-1 = turn69? But we are at y69=9 at the beginning of turn69? \n\nBut we require that at turn60+H-1 we are at 9. Here H=9, so turn60+8: at the beginning of turn68, we are at y68. How much is y68? \n  After a67 (at turn67) we get y68 = 8? \n  Then at turn68: we are at y68=8. Then we take a68 (U) to get y69=9.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn68 (which is turn60+8) we are at 8, not 9.\n\nTherefore, to be at 9 at the beginning of turn60+H-1, we need to have arrived at 9 by the action at turn60+H-2? \n\nBecause at turn60+H-2: we take an action that leads to y_{60+H-1}=9.\n\nThen at turn60+H-1: we are at 9 (beginning) and then we take an action a_{60+H-1} (which can be S, U, or D) but we are at 9 so if we choose U or D, we go to 9 or 8? But U: 9->9, D:9->8.\n\nThen we output the sequence including that last action.\n\nBut the minimal steps to get to 9 is 9 moves (all U) and then we need one more action to be at the beginning of a turn at 9? \n\nWait: with 9 moves (all U) we get to 9 at the beginning of turn69? \n  turn60: start at 0.\n  turn61: after a60 (U) -> 1\n  turn62: after a61 (U) -> 2\n  ...\n  turn69: after a68 (U) -> 9\n\nSo at the beginning of turn69, we are at 9.\n\nTherefore, we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn60+H-1. So turn60+H-1 = 69? Then H-1 = 9 -> H=10.\n\nSo we take 10 actions: from a60 to a69. And at the beginning of turn69 (which is turn60+9) we are at 9.\n\nBut the requirement is: at turn60+H-1 we are at 9. Here H=10, so turn60+9=69 -> we are at 9 at the beginning of turn69. Then we take an action at turn69 (a69). \n\nSo the sequence has 10 actions.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at 9 earlier? \n\nWe can be at 9 at an earlier turn? For example, if we wait sometimes, we might arrive at 9 at an earlier turn? But waiting would delay.\n\nThe fastest is 9 moves up. Then we arrive at turn69 (the beginning of turn69) at 9. So H=10.\n\nBut we must avoid collisions at every turn from 60 to 69? \n\nAt each turn T in [60,69], we are at row y_T. We must ensure that at that turn, if y_T is between 1 and 8, then there is no car on freeway y_T that covers x=0.\n\nSo we need to simulate:\n\nWe start at turn60: y60=0 -> safe (no car check).\n\nThen at turn61: y61=1 -> check freeway1: car at [-59+3*1, -48+3*1] = [-56, -45] -> 0 not in this interval? -> safe? \n  But note: relative time t = T - 60, so at turn61: t=1.\n\nFreeway1: initial: [-59,-48] at t=0. At t=1: [-59+3, -48+3] = [-56, -45]. 0 is not in [-56,-45] -> safe.\n\nTurn62: y62=2 -> freeway2: car (48,37,right,12) -> initial at t=0: [37,48]. At t=2: [37+12*2, 48+12*2] = [37+24,48+24]=[61,72]. 0 not in [61,72] -> safe.\n\nTurn63: y63=3 -> freeway3: same car as freeway2? Actually, the table says freeway3: (48,37,right,12) -> same: [37,48] at t=0, then at t=3: [37+36,48+36]=[73,84] -> safe.\n\nTurn64: y64=4 -> freeway4: same -> [37+48,48+48]=[85,96] -> safe.\n\nTurn65: y65=5 -> freeway5: same -> [37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe.\n\nTurn66: y66=6 -> freeway6: two cars.\n  First car: (48,37,right,12) -> [37+12*6,48+12*6]=[37+72,48+72]=[109,120] -> safe.\n  Second car: (0,-11,right,12) -> at t=0: [-11,0] -> at t=6: [-11+72,0+72]=[61,72] -> 0 not in [61,72] -> safe.\n\nTurn67: y67=7 -> freeway7: two cars.\n  First car: (-48,-59,right,6) -> at t=0: [-59,-48] -> at t=7: [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17, -6] -> 0 not in [-17,-6] -> safe.\n  Second car: (0,-11,right,6) -> at t=0: [-11,0] -> at t=7: [-11+42,0+42]=[31,42] -> safe.\n\nTurn68: y68=8 -> freeway8: two cars, same as freeway7? \n  First car: (-48,-59,right,6) -> at t=8: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> now 0 is in [-11,0]? \n      The interval is [-11,0] -> inclusive: so 0 is included. Therefore, collision!\n\nSo at turn68 (relative time t=8) we are at freeway8, and the car (0,-11,right,6) at freeway8? Actually, freeway8 has two cars: \n  (head, tail, direction, speed): \n    (-48,-59,right,6): at t=8: [-59+6*8, -48+6*8] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in this interval? \n    and (0,-11,right,6): at t=8: [-11+48,0+48]=[37,48] -> safe.\n\nBut the first car: from -11 to 0 -> covers 0. So collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot go straight up without waiting. We must avoid being at freeway8 at turn68.\n\nSo we need to adjust.\n\nWe can wait at some row to avoid a collision.\n\nWe are going to use BFS over states (t, y) where t is the relative time (number of steps taken so far, and also the time elapsed) and y is the current row.\n\nWe start: (0,0) at time0 (turn60).\n\nWe can move: U, D, S.\n\nConstraints: y in [0,9]. If at y=0, D: stays at 0. Similarly at y=9, U: stays at 9.\n\nWe must avoid: for a state (t,y) with y in [1,8], we must check that there is no car on freeway y at time t (relative) that covers 0.\n\nNote: at a given relative time t, for a freeway y, we check all cars on that freeway.\n\nWe want to reach a state (t,9) for some t (minimal t) and then we output the actions that led to that state. And then we need to output the actions for the entire sequence including the last action at turn60+t? \n\nBut note: we are at (t,9) at the beginning of turn60+t. Then we must take an action at turn60+t (which is the last action of the sequence). The sequence length is H = t+1? \n\nBecause we have taken t actions to get to the state (t,9) (from turn60 to turn60+t-1) and then we take one more action at turn60+t? \n\nBut wait: \n  After 0 actions: we are at (0,0) at the beginning of turn60.\n  After 1 action: at turn60 we take a0 -> we are at the beginning of turn61 at y1.\n\nSo to be at (t, y) means: at the beginning of turn60+t, we are at y.\n\nWe require that at the beginning of turn60+H-1, we are at 9. \n\nBut in our state, we are at (t,9) at the beginning of turn60+t.\n\nSo we require: 60+t = 60+H-1  => t = H-1.\n\nTherefore, we are at state (H-1, 9). \n\nThen we output the sequence of actions from a60 to a_{60+H-1}. But note: the action at turn60+H-1 is taken at the beginning of turn60+H-1 (when we are at 9) and then we update to turn60+H. But we don't care about that state.\n\nSo the minimal H is the minimal t such that we can be at (t,9) at the beginning of turn60+t, and we then take an action at that turn (so the total number of actions is t+1? because we take t actions to get to (t,9) and then one more?).\n\nBut no: \n\n  The state (t, y) is after t actions? \n\nActually, the state is defined by the turn: at the beginning of turn60+t, we are at y. How many actions have we taken? t actions (from turn60 to turn60+t-1). \n\nTherefore, to be at (t,9) we have taken t actions. Then we are at the beginning of turn60+t. Then we take one more action at turn60+t? \n\nBut then the total number of actions is t+1, and then the turn after that is turn60+t+1. \n\nBut the requirement is that at turn60+H-1 we are at 9. \n\nSet: 60+t = 60+H-1  => t = H-1.\n\nThen the total actions: we have taken t actions to get to (t,9) at the beginning of turn60+t, which is turn60+H-1. Then we take an action at turn60+H-1 (which is the H-th action). \n\nBut the sequence is from a60 to a_{60+H-1} (H actions). \n\nTherefore, the minimal H is the minimal t such that we can reach (t,9) by the beginning of turn60+t, and then we set H = t+1? \n\nBut wait: if we are at (t,9) at the beginning of turn60+t, then we have taken t actions. Then we set H = t+1? \n\nBut the requirement: at turn60+H-1 we are at 9. So 60+H-1 = 60+t  => H-1 = t  => H = t+1.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the minimal t for which we can reach (t,9), and then H = t+1.\n\nBut note: we also need to output the actions. The actions are the ones taken from turn60 to turn60+t (so t+1 actions). \n\nBut the state (t,9) is reached by taking t actions. Then we take one more action at turn60+t. \n\nBut the last action (at turn60+t) is taken while we are at 9. We can choose any action? But we choose S to be safe and not move.\n\nBut we don't care about the next state.\n\nSo we need to find the minimal t such that there is a path of t actions that brings us to 9 at the beginning of turn60+t.\n\nThen H = t+1, and the actions are the t actions that got us there, plus one action (S) at the end.\n\nAlternatively, we might get to 9 at the beginning of turn60+t without having to take the extra action? But the problem requires that at turn60+H-1 we are at 9, and then we take an action at that turn. So we must take that last action.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is the minimal t (for the state (t,9)) plus 1.\n\nBut note: we can also get to 9 at the same time t but with a different path? \n\nWe'll do BFS for states (t,y) for t from 0 upwards, and we want to reach (t,9) for the smallest t.\n\nThen H = t+1.\n\nWe'll simulate the cars at relative time t for each freeway and each car.\n\nLet me list the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway1: [ (head=-48, tail=-59, d='right', s=3) ]\n  Span at time t: [ -59 + 3*t, -48 + 3*t ]\n\nFreeway2: [ (48,37,right,12) ]\n  [37+12*t, 48+12*t]\n\nFreeway3: same as freeway2: [37+12*t,48+12*t]\n\nFreeway4: same: [37+12*t,48+12*t]\n\nFreeway5: same: [37+12*t,48+12*t]\n\nFreeway6: two cars:\n  car1: (48,37,right,12) -> [37+12*t,48+12*t]\n  car2: (0,-11,right,12) -> [-11+12*t, 0+12*t]\n\nFreeway7: two cars:\n  car1: (-48,-59,right,6) -> [-59+6*t, -48+6*t]\n  car2: (0,-11,right,6) -> [-11+6*t, 0+6*t]\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7? \n  car1: (-48,-59,right,6) -> [-59+6*t, -48+6*t]\n  car2: (0,-11,right,6) -> [-11+6*t, 0+6*t]\n\nWe are going to simulate the player's moves.\n\nWe start at (t=0, y=0) -> safe.\n\nActions: we can go U (to y=1) or S (stay at 0) or D (stay at 0). \n\nWe'll use a queue for BFS: (time, y, path) \nBut we want minimal time. We'll use a visited array: visited[t][y] = whether we have been at (t,y) already.\n\nBut t can be large? We don't know. But we hope minimal t is not too large.\n\nWe need to check for each state (t,y) whether it is safe (if y in [1,8], then check all cars on freeway y at time t).\n\nWe want the minimal t such that we reach y=9.\n\nThen H = t+1, and the actions are the path (which is the sequence of actions from t=0 to t-1) that got us to (t,9), and then we add an action at time t (which we set to S).\n\nBut note: the last action (at time t) is not used to get to (t,9). The state (t,9) is the result of the actions taken at times 0 to t-1.\n\nSo we only need to find a path of t actions that gets us to (t,9).\n\nThen we output the t actions (for turns60 to 60+t-1) and then the action for turn60+t (which is the last action, and we choose S).\n\nBut the problem requires a sequence of H actions. Here H = t+1.\n\nSo we output:\n  Turn60: action0\n  ...\n  Turn60+t-1: action_{t-1}\n  Turn60+t: action_t (which is S)\n\nBut note: after the action at turn60+t, the player might move, but we don't care.\n\nWe'll do BFS:\n\nLet me define:\n\n  Let dist[y][t] = minimal steps? Actually, we are doing BFS by time.\n\nWe start: (t=0, y=0)\n\nThen we consider next time: t=1, and we can go to y=0 (if we did S or D at y=0) or y=1 (if we did U).\n\nBut at t=1, we are at the beginning of turn61.\n\nWe need to check safety at (t=1, y):\n\n  If y=0: safe.\n  If y=1: check freeway1 at t=1: [-59+3, -48+3] = [-56,-45] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSo we can go to (1,0) and (1,1).\n\nThen from each state, we expand.\n\nWe want to find the minimal t such that we are at (t,9).\n\nWe'll do BFS in increasing t.\n\nBut note: we might have to wait arbitrarily long? But the cars move linearly, and the patterns repeat? But the speeds are integers, and the initial positions are integers. The intervals move with constant speed. The period for a car to cover an integer interval? Actually, the danger at a freeway y at time t is periodic? \n\nBut since we are only interested in minimal t, we can run BFS until we find a path to 9.\n\nWe'll use a queue.\n\nSteps:\n\n  Let Q be a queue.\n  We start with (0,0) and mark visited[0][0]=True.\n\n  Then for each time step, we expand.\n\n  We also want to record the path? But the path might be long. Alternatively, we can store the parent's state and the action taken.\n\n  However, to save memory, we can store for each (t,y) the previous state and action.\n\nBut we'll do:\n\n  Let's have a 2D array (or dictionary) visited[t][y] = (prev_t, prev_y, action) or we can store the action that led to (t,y) and then backtrack.\n\nBut we can avoid storing the entire path by storing for each state (t,y) the previous state and the last action.\n\nBut we don't know the time range. We can use a dictionary: key = (t,y)\n\n  parent[(t,y)] = (t_prev, y_prev, action)\n\nBut we are doing BFS so we expand t from 0 up.\n\nAlternatively, we can use Dijkstra? But all steps cost 1.\n\nWe'll use a queue:\n\n  from collections import deque\n\n  q = deque()\n  q.append((0,0))   # (t,y)\n  visited = set()\n  visited.add((0,0))\n\n  parent = {}  # key: (t,y), value: (prev_t, prev_y, action) that led to (t,y)\n\n  Then when we pop (t,y), we check if y==9: then we found the minimal t.\n\n  Then we backtrack to get the actions from (0,0) to (t,9). Then we output the actions for turns60 to 60+t-1? \n\n  But note: the action taken at time t_prev (which is the previous time) leads to the state at time t.\n\n  Actually, the state (t,y) is at the beginning of turn60+t. To get to (t,y), we took an action at turn60+t_prev? \n\n  How we got to (t,y): from a state (t-1, y_prev) and then we took an action a at time t-1 (which is turn60+t-1) to get to y at time t.\n\n  Therefore, the action that led to (t,y) is taken at time t-1.\n\n  So when we backtrack, we have the action for turn60+t-1.\n\n  Then we also need to output the last action at turn60+t (which is not used in the path to (t,9), but we will set it to S).\n\n  So the sequence of actions we output: \n      from turn60 to turn60+t: \n          turn60: action0\n          turn61: action1\n          ...\n          turn60+t-1: action_{t-1}   [which is the last action that got us to (t,9)]\n          turn60+t: action_t = S\n\n  And the total number of actions H = t+1.\n\nBut note: the problem requires the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nWe'll run BFS until we hit y=9.\n\nLet me simulate the cars for the first few t:\n\nWe know that going straight up without waiting fails at t=8 (at freeway8) because at t=8, freeway8 has a car at [-11,0] -> covers 0.\n\nWe need to avoid being at freeway8 at t=8.\n\nWe can either wait at some row before, or take a detour (go down and then up) but going down from 0 is not possible. So we can only wait.\n\nFor example, we can wait at row0 for one turn? Then we start at t=1 still at 0? Then we go up.\n\nThen the times:\n\n  t0: (0,0)\n  t1: (1,0) [if we wait at turn60: action S]\n  t2: (2,1) [after action U at turn61]\n  t3: (3,2)\n  t4: (4,3)\n  t5: (5,4)\n  t6: (6,5)\n  t7: (7,6)\n  t8: (8,7)\n  t9: (9,8)\n  t10: (10,9)\n\nThen at t=10, we are at 9.\n\nBut we must check the collisions:\n\nAt t1: (1,0): safe.\nAt t2: (2,1): freeway1 at t=2: [-59+6, -48+6]=[-53,-42] -> safe.\nAt t3: (3,2): freeway2: [37+12*3,48+12*3]=[37+36,48+36]=[73,84] -> safe.\nAt t4: (4,3): freeway3: same as freeway2 -> [73,84] -> safe.\nAt t5: (5,4): freeway4: [37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe.\nAt t6: (6,5): freeway5: same -> safe.\nAt t7: (7,6): freeway6: \n   car1: [37+72,48+72]=[109,120] -> safe.\n   car2: [-11+72,0+72]=[61,72] -> safe.\nAt t8: (8,7): freeway7:\n   car1: [-59+48, -48+48]=[-11,0] -> covers 0? -> collision? \n        But we are at freeway7 at t=8: the car1 on freeway7: [-11,0] -> 0 is included -> collision.\n\nOh, so we collide at freeway7 at t=8 if we are at row7 at t=8.\n\nBut in this path, at t=8 we are at row7. And freeway7 at t=8: car1: [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nSo we must avoid freeway7 at t=8.\n\nWe might wait two times? \n\nAlternatively, wait at row0 for two turns? Then:\n\n  t0: (0,0)\n  t1: (1,0) [S at turn60]\n  t2: (2,0) [S at turn61]\n  t3: (3,1) [U at turn62]\n  t4: (4,2)\n  t5: (5,3)\n  t6: (6,4)\n  t7: (7,5)\n  t8: (8,6)\n  t9: (9,7)\n  t10: (10,8)\n  t11: (11,9)\n\nCheck t8: (8,6): freeway6 at t=8: \n   car1: [37+12*8,48+12*8]=[37+96,48+96]=[133,144] -> safe.\n   car2: [-11+96,0+96]=[85,96] -> safe.\n\nt9: (9,7): freeway7 at t=9:\n   car1: [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in [-5,6]? yes -> collision.\n\nSo we collide at t=9.\n\nAlternatively, wait at a different row.\n\nWe might wait at row7? But we are moving up.\n\nWe can consider a path that waits at row6 for one turn? \n\nBut to get to row6 at a safe time, and then wait.\n\nLet me compute the dangerous intervals for each freeway and time.\n\nWe are particularly worried about freeway7 and freeway8.\n\nFreeway7: \n  car1: [-59+6t, -48+6t] -> we require that 0 is not in [-59+6t, -48+6t] \n        -> either -59+6t > 0  OR -48+6t < 0.\n        -59+6t > 0 -> t > 59/6 ≈ 9.83 -> t>=10\n        -48+6t < 0 -> t < 48/6 = 8 -> t<=7\n        So for t in [8,9] the interval covers 0? \n        t=8: [-59+48, -48+48]=[-11,0] -> covers 0.\n        t=9: [-59+54, -48+54]=[-5,6] -> covers 0.\n        t=10: [1,12] -> does not cover 0? because 0<1 -> safe.\n        t=7: [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17,-6] -> safe.\n\n  car2: [-11+6t, 0+6t] -> covers 0 only when -11+6t<=0<=0+6t -> \n        -11+6t<=0 -> 6t<=11 -> t<=1 (since t integer: t=0,1)\n        and 0<=6t -> always true for t>=0.\n        So for t=0: [-11,0] -> covers 0.\n        t=1: [-5,6] -> covers 0.\n        t>=2: the interval is [6t-11, 6t] -> 0 is in only if 6t-11<=0<=6t -> \n              which is 0<=6t and 6t-11<=0 -> 6t<=11 -> t<=1. \n        So for t>=2, car2 on freeway7 is safe.\n\nTherefore, freeway7 is dangerous for t in {0,1,8,9} for car1? Actually, car1 is dangerous for t in [8,9] (but t integer: 8,9) and car2 for t=0,1.\n\nBut we are only at freeway7 when we are at row7. And we won't be at row7 at t=0 or 1 because we start at 0 and we are moving up. The earliest we can be at row7 is t=7 (if we go straight up).\n\nSimilarly, freeway8 has the same cars? \n  car1: same as freeway7 car1: dangerous at t=8,9\n  car2: same as freeway7 car2: dangerous at t=0,1.\n\nBut we won't be at freeway8 until at least t=8.\n\nSo freeway8 is dangerous at t=8,9.\n\nTherefore, to avoid freeway7 and freeway8 at t=8 and t=9, we can be at row7 only at t not in {8,9} and row8 only at t not in {8,9}. \n\nBut if we go straight up, we are at row7 at t=7 (safe) and row8 at t=8 (dangerous). \n\nSo we can try to be at row7 at t=7 (safe), then at t=8 we want to be at row7 or row8 or row9? But we can only move by 1 per turn.\n\nAt t=7, we are at row7. Then we can do:\n  U: go to row8 at t=8 -> dangerous.\n  D: go to row6 at t=8 -> safe (freeway6 at t=8: we computed earlier: safe)\n  S: stay at row7 at t=8 -> dangerous because freeway7 at t=8 is dangerous.\n\nSo the only safe move from row7 at t=7 is D to row6.\n\nThen at t=8, we are at row6. Then at t=9, we can move U to row7? But freeway7 at t=9 is dangerous. Or to row6 (S) or row5 (D). \n\nThen we have to eventually go up.\n\nLet me try:\n\n  t0:0\n  t1:1\n  t2:2\n  t3:3\n  t4:4\n  t5:5\n  t6:6\n  t7:7\n  t8:6 (from 7, we moved down)\n  t9:7? -> but freeway7 at t=9 is dangerous.\n\n  or at t9: from 6 we move up to 7? dangerous.\n\n  or we move up to 7 at t9? dangerous.\n\n  or we stay at 6 at t9? safe.\n\n  then t10:7? but freeway7 at t=10: safe? because car1: [ -59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSo:\n\n  t0:0\n  t1:1\n  t2:2\n  t3:3\n  t4:4\n  t5:5\n  t6:6\n  t7:7\n  t8:6  (action: D)\n  t9:6  (action: S)  [wait at 6]\n  t10:7 (action: U) -> at t=10, freeway7: safe (as above)\n  t11:8 (action: U) -> freeway8 at t=11: \n        car1: [-59+6*11, -48+6*11] = [-59+66, -48+66] = [7,18] -> safe.\n        car2: [-11+66,0+66] = [55,66] -> safe.\n  t12:9 (action: U)\n\nSo we reach 9 at t=12.\n\nThen we output 13 actions: the 12 actions that got us to t=12 (at 9) and then one more action (S) at turn60+12.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nWe could wait at an earlier row.\n\nFor example, wait at row0 for one turn: then we start moving at t=1.\n\nThen:\n  t0:0\n  t1:0 (S)\n  t2:1\n  t3:2\n  t4:3\n  t5:4\n  t6:5\n  t7:6\n  t8:7 -> dangerous (freeway7 at t=8: collision)\n  so we cannot be at row7 at t=8.\n\nThen at t7: we are at row6. Then we can choose to go down to 5 at t8? \n  t8:5 -> freeway5: car: [37+12*8,48+12*8]=[37+96,48+96]=[133,144] -> safe.\n  t9:6 -> freeway6: at t=9: \n        car1: [37+108,48+108]=[145,156] -> safe.\n        car2: [-11+108,0+108]=[97,108] -> safe.\n  t10:7 -> freeway7: at t=10: safe (as above)\n  t11:8 -> freeway8: at t=11: safe.\n  t12:9\n\nSo we reach 9 at t=12.\n\nTotal time t=12, so H=13.\n\nBut in the first scenario (without initial wait) we also got to 9 at t=12.\n\nCan we do better?\n\nWe might not wait at the beginning, but wait at row6 for one turn.\n\nIn the straight up (without initial wait) we are at row6 at t=6 (safe). Then at t=7, we go to row7 (safe). Then at t=7 (row7) we have to avoid being at row7 at t=8? So we go down to row6 at t=8 (safe). Then at t=9, we can go up to row7? but freeway7 at t=9 is dangerous. So we wait at row6 at t=9. Then at t=10, go to row7 (safe), then row8 at t=11 (safe), row9 at t=12.\n\nTotal: 12 steps to row9 at t=12.\n\nSo the same.\n\nBut can we avoid waiting two times?\n\nAlternative: wait at row5 for one turn.\n\n  t0:0\n  t1:1\n  t2:2\n  t3:3\n  t4:4\n  t5:5\n  t6:5 (S)  [wait at 5]\n  t7:6\n  t8:7 -> dangerous.\n\nThen we have to go down from 7 to 6 at t8? Then same as before.\n\nOr at row5 at t6, we can go down to 4 at t7? Then we are even farther.\n\nSo the minimal t is 12.\n\nWe also need to check if there is a path with t<12.\n\nWhat if we try to be at row8 at t=10? \n\nTo be at row8 at t=10, we must have been at row7 at t=9? But freeway7 at t=9 is dangerous. Or at row8 at t=9? freeway8 at t=9: car1: [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6] -> covers 0? dangerous.\n\nOr at row9 at t=9? But then we are done? But to be at row9 at t=9, we need to start from 0 and go up 9 times in 9 actions? \n\nBut then we would be at row9 at the beginning of turn60+9? \n\nBut with 9 ups, we are at row9 at the beginning of turn60+9? \n\nBut then we need to check the collisions for the intermediate steps.\n\nAt t=1: row1 -> freeway1: t=1: [-56,-45] -> safe.\nt=2: row2: freeway2: [37+24,48+24]=[61,72] -> safe.\nt=3: row3: [37+36,48+36]=[73,84] -> safe.\nt=4: row4: [37+48,48+48]=[85,96] -> safe.\nt=5: row5: [37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe.\nt=6: row6: \n   car1: [37+72,48+72]=[109,120] -> safe.\n   car2: [-11+72,0+72]=[61,72] -> safe.\nt=7: row7: \n   car1: [-59+42, -48+42]=[-17,-6] -> safe.\n   car2: [-11+42,0+42]=[31,42] -> safe.\nt=8: row8: \n   car1: [-59+48, -48+48]=[-11,0] -> covers 0 -> dangerous.\n\nSo we fail at t=8.\n\nIf we wait at row0 for one turn: then we start at t=1, then we are at row8 at t=9? \n\n  t0:0\n  t1:0 (S)\n  t2:1\n  t3:2\n  t4:3\n  t5:4\n  t6:5\n  t7:6\n  t8:7 -> dangerous? freeway7 at t=8: dangerous -> collision.\n\nIf we wait at row0 for two turns: \n  t0:0\n  t1:0 (S)\n  t2:0 (S)\n  t3:1\n  t4:2\n  t5:3\n  t6:4\n  t7:5\n  t8:6\n  t9:7 -> freeway7 at t=9: dangerous.\n\nSo we cannot reach by t=9.\n\nWhat about t=10? \n\nTo be at row9 at t=10: we have 10 steps to go from 0 to 9, so we must have 9 U and 1 S (or 1 extra move that cancels? but we cannot go down from 0). So we have one wait.\n\nWe can do: 9 U and 1 S.\n\nWe can put the S at any time.\n\nWe want to avoid being at row7 at t=8 and t=9, and row8 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nBut if we are at row6 at t=6, then:\n\n  We can do:\n    t6:6\n    then we can wait at row6 at t7:6 (S) -> then t7:6\n    then t8:7 -> but freeway7 at t=8: dangerous.\n\n    or from t6:6, we can go to row5 at t7? Then we are at row5 at t7: safe? freeway5 at t=7: [37+84,48+84]=[121,132] -> safe.\n    then t8:6 (from 5 we go up) -> freeway6 at t=8: safe? [37+96,48+96]=[133,144] and [-11+96,0+96]=[85,96] -> safe.\n    then t9:7 -> freeway7 at t=9: dangerous.\n\n    or from t7:5, we can go to row6 at t8:6 (same as above) -> then at t9: we want to go to row7? dangerous.\n\n    or at t8: we are at row6, then we wait at t9:6? then at t10:7 (freeway7 at t=10: safe) and then we need to go to 9 in two more steps: \n          t10:7\n          t11:8 -> freeway8 at t=11: safe.\n          t12:9 -> so we are at 9 at t=12.\n\nBut then total steps: 12 moves to get to 9, so the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, we could do the S at the beginning: \n  t0:0 (S) -> then we have 9 U in the next 9 steps? \n        then at t=10: we would be at row9? \n        But the moves: \n          t0:0->0 (S)\n          t1:1 (U)\n          t2:2 (U)\n          ...\n          t9:9 (U at t9: from 8 to 9)\n\n        Then we are at row9 at the beginning of turn60+10.\n\n        Check collisions: \n          t1: row1: safe.\n          t2: row2: safe.\n          t3: row3: safe.\n          t4: row4: safe.\n          t5: row5: safe.\n          t6: row6: safe.\n          t7: row7: at t=7: freeway7: \n                car1: [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17,-6] -> safe.\n                car2: [31,42] -> safe.\n          t8: row8: at t=8: freeway8: \n                car1: [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nSo we fail.\n\nIf we do the S at a different time, say at t=7: at row7 we do S? but we are at row7 at t=7 (safe), then we do S to stay at row7 at t=8? -> dangerous.\n\nOr if we do the S at row6 at t=6: \n  then at t=6: row6 (safe), then S -> row6 at t=7: freeway6 at t=7: \n        car1: [37+84,48+84]=[121,132] -> safe.\n        car2: [-11+84,0+84]=[73,84] -> safe.\n  then at t=7: we are at row6, then we go to row7 at t=8: freeway7 at t=8: dangerous.\n\nSo we cannot avoid the collision at row8 at t=8 by just one wait.\n\nTherefore, the minimal t is 12.\n\nWe'll implement BFS to find the minimal t, and it should find t=12.\n\nWe'll write a small program in mind.\n\nStates: (t,y) for t from 0 to ... and y in [0,9]\n\nWe'll expand t from 0 upward.\n\nWe need a function safe(t,y) that checks freeway y at time t.\n\nIf y==0 or y==9: safe.\nElse, for each car on freeway y, check if 0 is in the car's span at time t.\n\n  For a car (head, tail, d, s) given in the table, and if d='right', then span = [tau + s*t, head + s*t] (because the initial representation is (head, tail) and the initial span is [tau, head] for a right-moving car? Actually, the problem says for a right-moving car: initial span is [tau, head] and then becomes [tau+s*(T-t1), head+s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut in the table, for freeway1: head=-48, tail=-59 -> then the initial span is [tau, head] = [-59, -48]. Then at time t: [-59+3t, -48+3t].\n\nSo the function for a car: \n  if d == 'right':\n      low = tail + s * t\n      high = head + s * t\n      then check if low <= 0 <= high.\n\nBut note: for freeway6, the car (0,-11,right,12): \n      low = -11 + 12*t\n      high = 0 + 12*t\n\n  Then at t=0: [-11,0] -> includes 0.\n  at t=1: [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\nBut the problem says: at turn60 (t=0) for freeway6, there is a car (0,-11,right,12). And we are at freeway6 at turn60: but we start at turn60 at row0, so we are not at freeway6 at turn60. But if we were at freeway6 at turn60, we would collide.\n\nNow, we do BFS:\n\n  Start: (0,0) -> safe.\n\n  Then we consider actions: U, D, S.\n\n  From (0,0): \n      U -> y=1 -> state (1,1) -> check safe(1,1): freeway1: car: [-59+3*1, -48+3*1]=[-56,-45] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n      D -> y=0 -> state (1,0) -> safe (y=0)\n      S -> y=0 -> state (1,0)\n\n  So we have (1,1) and (1,0).\n\n  Then from (1,0): \n        U-> (2,1): safe(2,1): freeway1: [-59+6,-48+6]=[-53,-42] -> safe.\n        D-> (2,0) -> safe.\n        S-> (2,0) -> safe.\n\n  From (1,1):\n        U-> (2,2): freeway2: [37+24,48+24]=[61,72] -> safe.\n        D-> (2,0) -> safe.\n        S-> (2,1): freeway1: [-53,-42] -> safe.\n\n  We continue until we find (t,9).\n\n  We'll skip the details and assume we find the minimal t=12.\n\n  How to get to (12,9) with minimal actions.\n\n  We found a path:\n\n    t0:0\n    t1:1\n    t2:2\n    t3:3\n    t4:4\n    t5:5\n    t6:6\n    t7:7\n    t8:6   (from 7, we moved down: action D)\n    t9:6   (then we stayed: action S)\n    t10:7  (then up: U)\n    t11:8  (U)\n    t12:9  (U)\n\n  But wait, at t7:7, we move down to 6 at t8:6. Then we stay at t9:6. Then at t10: we move up to 7.\n\n  So the actions:\n\n    t0 (turn60): U  -> y=1\n    t1 (turn61): U  -> y=2\n    t2 (turn62): U  -> y=3\n    t3 (turn63): U  -> y=4\n    t4 (turn64): U  -> y=5\n    t5 (turn65): U  -> y=6\n    t6 (turn66): U  -> y=7\n    t7 (turn67): D  -> y=6   (from 7 to 6)\n    t8 (turn68): S  -> y=6\n    t9 (turn69): U  -> y=7\n    t10(turn70): U  -> y=8\n    t11(turn71): U  -> y=9\n\n  Then we are at (12,9) at the beginning of turn72 (which is turn60+12).\n\n  Then we need to output one more action at turn72: we choose S.\n\n  But the problem: we require the sequence of actions for turns60 to 60+H-1, and we require that at turn60+H-1 we are at 9.\n\n  Here, at turn72 (which is 60+12) we are at 9 at the beginning. Then we take an action at turn72. \n\n  So H = 13? because we have 12 actions to get to (12,9) and then one more.\n\n  But the actions we have: from turn60 to turn71: 12 actions. Then turn72: the 13th action.\n\n  And at the beginning of turn72 (which is turn60+12) we are at 9, as required.\n\n  So the sequence:\n\n      Turn60: U\n      Turn61: U\n      Turn62: U\n      Turn63: U\n      Turn64: U\n      Turn65: U\n      Turn66: U\n      Turn67: D\n      Turn68: S\n      Turn69: U\n      Turn70: U\n      Turn71: U\n      Turn72: S   [because we are at 9, we choose S to stay]\n\n  But note: the turn60+H-1 = turn72, and we are at 9 at the beginning of turn72, and then we take action S.\n\n  Is there a shorter path? We assume not, because we found by BFS.\n\n  Alternatively, we might be able to avoid the extra action at the end? But the problem requires an action for turn60+H-1, and we are at 9 at that turn. So we must take an action.\n\n  And we must output H=13.\n\nBut wait: the state (12,9) is reached at the beginning of turn72. The turn72 is turn60+12. We require that at turn60+H-1 we are at 9. So 60+H-1 = 60+12 => H-1=12 => H=13.\n\nSo we output 13 actions.\n\nBut in the action list above, the last action (at turn72) is the 13th action? and the turns are from 60 to 72 (13 turns: 60,61,...,72).\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n  Turn60: U\n  Turn61: U\n  Turn62: U\n  Turn63: U\n  Turn64: U\n  Turn65: U\n  Turn66: U\n  Turn67: D\n  Turn68: S\n  Turn69: U\n  Turn70: U\n  Turn71: U\n  Turn72: S\n\nBut let me verify the safety for the entire path:\n\n  turn60: y=0 -> safe.\n  turn61: y=1: freeway1 at t=1: [-56,-45] -> safe.\n  turn62: y=2: freeway2 at t=2: [61,72] -> safe.\n  turn63: y=3: freeway3 at t=3: [73,84] -> safe.\n  turn64: y=4: freeway4 at t=4: [85,96] -> safe.\n  turn65: y=5: freeway5 at t=5: [97,108] -> safe.\n  turn66: y=6: freeway6 at t=6: \n        car1: [109,120] -> safe.\n        car2: [61,72] -> safe.\n  turn67: y=7: freeway7 at t=7: \n        car1: [-17,-6] -> safe.\n        car2: [31,42] -> safe.\n  turn68: y=6: freeway6 at t=8: \n        car1: [37+96,48+96]=[133,144] -> safe.\n        car2: [-11+96,0+96]=[85,96] -> safe.\n  turn69: y=6: freeway6 at t=9: \n        car1: [37+108,48+108]=[145,156] -> safe.\n        car2: [-11+108,0+108]=[97,108] -> safe.\n  turn70: y=7: freeway7 at t=10: \n        car1: [-59+60, -48+60]=[1,12] -> safe (0 not in).\n        car2: [-11+60,0+60]=[49,60] -> safe.\n  turn71: y=8: freeway8 at t=11: \n        car1: [-59+66, -48+66]=[7,18] -> safe.\n        car2: [-11+66,0+66]=[55,66] -> safe.\n  turn72: y=9: safe.\n\n  And then we take action S at turn72, and we are safe at turn72.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 13.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". Is there a path with H=12? \n\nIf H=12, then we are at 9 at the beginning of turn60+11 (i.e., turn71). \n\nSo we need to be at (11,9). \n\nIs there a path to (11,9)? \n\nThat means we take 11 actions to get to 9 at the beginning of turn71.\n\nWe need to go from 0 to 9 in 11 actions, so we have 9 U and 2 extra actions that are not U (could be S or D, but D at 0 is not helpful).\n\nWe can do: 9 U and 2 S, or 8 U and 1 D and 1 something? but that would be slower.\n\nLet me try to put two waits.\n\nFor example, wait at the beginning twice:\n\n  t0:0 (S) -> turn60: S, then at turn61: y=0.\n  t1:0 (S) -> turn61: S, then at turn62: y=0.\n  then 9 U: from turn62 to turn70: 9 U -> then at turn71: y=9.\n\n  So we are at (11,9) at the beginning of turn71.\n\n  Check collisions:\n\n    turn60:0 -> safe.\n    turn61:0 -> safe.\n    turn62:1 -> freeway1 at t=2: [-59+6, -48+6]=[-53,-42] -> safe.\n    turn63:2 -> freeway2 at t=3: [37+36,48+36]=[73,84] -> safe.\n    turn64:3 -> freeway3: [73,84] -> safe.\n    turn65:4 -> freeway4: [85,96] -> safe.\n    turn66:5 -> freeway5: [97,108] -> safe.\n    turn67:6 -> freeway6: \n          car1: [37+84,48+84]=[121,132] -> safe.\n          car2: [-11+84,0+84]=[73,84] -> safe.\n    turn68:7 -> freeway7: \n          car1: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> collision at t=8? \n                at turn68: t=8 (because relative to turn60, turn68 is t=8) -> freeway7 at t=8: [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nSo we collide.\n\nAlternatively, wait at row6 for two turns:\n\n  Without initial wait, we go up to row6 at t=6 (safe).\n  Then at row6: \n        turn66: at row6, then we do S at turn66: then at turn67: row6 (t=7)\n        then S again at turn67: at turn68: row6 (t=8) -> freeway6 at t=8: safe.\n        then U at turn68: to row7 at turn69: freeway7 at t=9: dangerous.\n\n  So collide at turn69.\n\nAlternatively, wait at row6 and then row7 later? \n\n  After row6 at t=6: \n        turn66: S -> t7: row6 (safe)\n        turn67: U -> t8: row7 -> dangerous (t=8)\n\n  Or wait at row5: \n        to be at row5 at t=5: safe.\n        then S at turn65: t6: row5 (safe)\n        then U at turn66: t7: row6 (safe)\n        then U at turn67: t8: row7 -> dangerous.\n\nSo we always have the same problem.\n\nWhat if we do a detour: go up to row4, then down to row3? That would cost extra steps.\n\nBut we only have 2 extra steps. \n\nExample:\n\n  t0:0->1 (U)\n  t1:1->2 (U)\n  t2:2->3 (U)\n  t3:3->4 (U)\n  t4:4->5 (U)\n  t5:5->4 (D)  [wait one by going down]\n  t6:4->5 (U)\n  t7:5->6 (U)\n  t8:6->7 (U) -> dangerous at t8 at row7.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, at t5:5, we do S: then at t6:5, then continue.\n\n  t6:5->6\n  t7:6->7 -> dangerous.\n\nWe need to avoid row7 at t=8.\n\nAt t7: we are at row7 at t=7 (safe). Then we have to go down to row6 at t=8 (safe). Then at t=8: row6, then we need to go up to 7 at t=9 (dangerous) or wait at row6 at t=9 (safe) and then go up at t=10.\n\nThen we get to row7 at t=10 (safe), then row8 at t=11 (safe), row9 at t=12.\n\nThat is 12 steps to get to row9 at t=12, so H=13.\n\nTherefore, we believe 13 is minimal.\n\nSo the answer is the sequence we found.\n\nBut note: there might be a symmetric path with the same length.\n\nWe output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: U\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: U\nTurn 64: U\nTurn 65: U\nTurn 66: U\nTurn 67: D\nTurn 68: S\nTurn 69: U\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: U\nTurn 72: S\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"current turn is t1=60\", and we output from turn60 to turn72 (13 actions).\n\nAnd at the beginning of turn72, we are at 9, as required.\n\nWe'll write it in the format.\n\nNote: the last action is S, but we could also choose U or D? But U at 9: stays at 9, D goes to 8. But we are required to avoid collisions only at the turns we are in the freeway during the actions (turns60 to 72). At turn72, we are at 9 (safe), and then we take an action. After that, we are not in the sequence. So if we choose D, then at turn73 we would be at 8, but we don't care. However, the problem does not require us to be at 9 after the action. It only requires at the beginning of turn72 we are at 9. \n\nBut to be safe and not move, we choose S.\n\nTherefore, the final answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 60, while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 13. The sequence of actions is determined as follows:\n\n- The player starts at \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 60.\n- The sequence of actions moves the player upward, with strategic waits and one downward move to avoid collisions, specifically to bypass dangerous car positions on freeways 7 and 8 at turns 68 and 69.\n- After 12 actions, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at the beginning of turn 72 (i.e., turn \\(60 + 12 = 72\\)).\n- The 13th action (at turn 72) is \"S\" (stay) to remain at \\((0, 9)\\), satisfying the requirement to be at \\((0, 9)\\) at turn \\(60 + H - 1 = 72\\).\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n- Turn 60: Move up (U) to \\((0, 1)\\).\n- Turn 61: Move up (U) to \\((0, 2)\\).\n- Turn 62: Move up (U) to \\((0, 3)\\).\n- Turn 63: Move up (U) to \\((0, 4)\\).\n- Turn 64: Move up (U) to \\((0, 5)\\).\n- Turn 65: Move up (U) to \\((0, 6)\\).\n- Turn 66: Move up (U) to \\((0, 7)\\).\n- Turn 67: Move down (D) to \\((0, 6)\\) to avoid a car on freeway 7 at turn 68.\n- Turn 68: Stay (S) at \\((0, 6)\\) to avoid cars on freeways 7 and 8.\n- Turn 69: Move up (U) to \\((0, 7)\\) (now safe).\n- Turn 70: Move up (U) to \\((0, 8)\\).\n- Turn 71: Move up (U) to \\((0, 9)\\).\n- Turn 72: Stay (S) at \\((0, 9)\\).\n\nThis sequence ensures safety at every turn:\n- Turns 60: Safe (y=0).\n- Turn 61: Safe (freeway 1: car at [-56, -45], 0 not in interval).\n- Turn 62: Safe (freeway 2: car at [61, 72], 0 not in interval).\n- Turn 63: Safe (freeway 3: car at [73, 84], 0 not in interval).\n- Turn 64: Safe (freeway 4: car at [85, 96], 0 not in interval).\n- Turn 65: Safe (freeway 5: car at [97, 108], 0 not in interval).\n- Turn 66: Safe (freeway 6: cars at [109, 120] and [61, 72], 0 not in intervals).\n- Turn 67: Safe (freeway 7: cars at [-17, -6] and [31, 42], 0 not in intervals).\n- Turn 68: Safe (freeway 6: cars at [133, 144] and [85, 96], 0 not in intervals).\n- Turn 69: Safe (freeway 6: cars at [145, 156] and [97, 108], 0 not in intervals).\n- Turn 70: Safe (freeway 7: cars at [1, 12] and [49, 60], 0 not in intervals).\n- Turn 71: Safe (freeway 8: cars at [7, 18] and [55, 66], 0 not in intervals).\n- Turn 72: Safe (y=9).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 60:  \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 61:  \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 62:  \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 63:  \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 64:  \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 65:  \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 66:  \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 67:  \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 68:  \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 69:  \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 70:  \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 71:  \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 72:  \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\begin{array}{c}\nU \\\\\nU \\\\\nU \\\\\nU \\\\\nU \\\\\nU \\\\\nU \\\\\nD \\\\\nS \\\\\nU \\\\\nU \\\\\nU \\\\\nS \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 0) at turn 66, and I need to get to (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns. The vertical axis goes from y=0 to y=9, and there are freeways at y=1 to y=8 with cars moving. I have to avoid collisions with cars on those freeways.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. The span is the position of the car at that specific turn.\n\nThe player's position updates based on actions: U for up (y increases by 1), D for down (y decreases by 1), S for stay (y stays the same). y must stay between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is the top, and since we're at (0,0), we need to move up.\n\nNow, the car states are given for each freeway k from 1 to 8.\n\nLet me list them clearly:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: head h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right, speed 3. Since direction is right, it's moving right, so span at time T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]? Let me check the update rule.\n\nThe update rule says:\n\nFor left-moving: span goes from [h, τ] to [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] where Δt = T - t1\n\nFor right-moving: span goes from [τ, h] to [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor right-moving, head is the front, so if it's moving right, head should be on the right, so at initial time, span is [tail, head] for right-moving? Let's see the notation.\n\nIt says: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] and then span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ] and span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nDirection right, so at t1, span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? τ is tail, h is head.\n\nSince right-moving, tail is left, head is right, so span is [tail, head] = [-59, -48]\n\nThen at time T, span = [ -59 + 3*(T-66) , -48 + 3*(T-66) ]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is in the span of some car at time T.\n\nAlso, note: if player moves to a different y at turn T, they are not on that freeway until the next turn. Specifically: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". So at turn T, you are on y_T, and if you move, at turn T+1 you are on y_{T+1}.\n\nThe position update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t based on action at t.\n\nAt turn t, action a_t determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} is set based on a_t.\n\nThen, at time t, player is at y_t.\n\nFor collision at time t: if y_t is between 1 and 8, and on that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in its span at time t.\n\nSince the grid is at x=0, we care if 0 is in the car's span at time t for that row.\n\nNow, we start at turn 66, y=0.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, so no cars, so safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9, which is also not a freeway, so no issue there.\n\nBut to get there, we need to pass through y=1 to 8, which have cars.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=0 to y=9, avoiding collisions on y=1 to 8 when we are on those rows at the turn we are there.\n\nSince we start at y=0, and we need to end at y=9, and we can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn, the minimal number of turns to go from 0 to 9 is 9 moves up, so H=9 turns if we go up every time. But we might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, so it could take more turns.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so we should try to go up as much as possible, only deviating when necessary to avoid collisions.\n\nNow, let's look at the car positions at different times.\n\nt1 = 66 is the current turn.\n\nWe need to consider for each freeway, when a car has 0 in its span.\n\nSince the cars are moving, the span changes over time.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find for which times T, 0 is covered by some car on that freeway.\n\nThen, when the player is on that row at time T, it must not be such a time.\n\nFirst, let's handle each freeway one by one.\n\nFreeway 1: k=1, one car: head h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right, speed s=3.\n\nRight-moving, so span at time T: [τ + s(T-66), h + s(T-66)] = [-59 + 3(T-66), -48 + 3(T-66)]\n\n0 is in span if -59 + 3(T-66) ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 3(T-66)\n\nLet Δt = T - 66, so we have:\n\n-59 + 3 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 3 Δt\n\nSplit:\n\nLeft: -59 + 3 Δt ≤ 0 => 3 Δt ≤ 59 => Δt ≤ 59/3 ≈ 19.666, so Δt ≤ 19 since integer? Δt is integer since turns are discrete.\n\nT is turn number, so Δt = T - 66, integer.\n\nSimilarly, all times are integers.\n\nSo -59 + 3 Δt ≤ 0 => 3 Δt ≤ 59 => Δt ≤ 19.666, so Δt ≤ 19\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -48 + 3 Δt => 48 ≤ 3 Δt => Δt ≥ 16\n\nAlso, since it's inequality, need to check if the span includes 0.\n\n0 is in [A,B] if A ≤ 0 ≤ B.\n\nHere A = -59 + 3 Δt, B = -48 + 3 Δt\n\nSo A ≤ 0 ≤ B\n\nA ≤ 0: -59 + 3 Δt ≤ 0 => 3 Δt ≤ 59 => Δt ≤ 19 since 3*19=57<59? 57 <=59, but 57 < 59, so -59 + 57 = -2 <=0, true; 3*20=60, -59+60=1>0, not <=0.\n\n-59 + 3 Δt ≤ 0\n\n3 Δt ≤ 59\n\nΔt ≤ 59/3 = 19 + 2/3, so since Δt integer, Δt <= 19\n\nBecause Δt=19: 3*19=57, -59+57=-2 <=0\n\nΔt=20: 60, -59+60=1 >0, not <=0\n\nSimilarly, 0 ≤ B: 0 ≤ -48 + 3 Δt => 48 ≤ 3 Δt => 3 Δt >=48, Δt >=16\n\nBecause Δt=16: 3*16=48, -48+48=0, 0<=0 true\n\nΔt=15: 45, -48+45=-3 <0, 0 <= -3 false? 0 ≤ -3 is false.\n\n0 ≤ B means B >=0\n\nB = -48 + 3 Δt\n\nSo -48 + 3 Δt >=0 => 3 Δt >=48 => Δt >=16\n\nAnd A <=0: -59 + 3 Δt <=0 => 3 Δt <=59 => Δt <=19\n\nSo for Δt from 16 to 19 inclusive, 0 is in span.\n\nΔt=16: A = -59 + 48 = -11, B= -48 +48=0, so [-11,0], 0 is included.\n\nΔt=17: A=-59+51=-8, B=-48+51=3, [-8,3], 0 in\n\nΔt=18: A=-59+54=-5, B=-48+54=6, [-5,6], 0 in\n\nΔt=19: A=-59+57=-2, B=-48+57=9, [-2,9], 0 in\n\nΔt=20: A=-59+60=1, B=-48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not <=1? 0 <1, not in\n\nΔt=15: A=-59+45=-14, B=-48+45=-3, [-14,-3], 0 not in\n\nSo for freeway 1, 0 is covered at T = 66 + Δt for Δt=16 to 19, so T=82,83,84,85.\n\nT=66+16=82, 83,84,85.\n\nNow, freeway 2: (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nHead=48, tail=37, direction right, speed 12.\n\nRight-moving, so span at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [37 + 12 Δt, 48 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span if 37 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 12 Δt\n\nBut 37 + 12 Δt ≤ 0? Since 12 Δt >=0, 37 + something positive <=0 impossible.\n\nSimilarly, 48 + 12 Δt >=0 always for Δt>=0.\n\nSo 37 + 12 Δt <=0 only if Δt negative, but Δt >=0, so never true.\n\nThus, 0 is never in the span for freeway 2 car.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (48,37,right,12), identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 5: same, (48,37,right,12)\n\nAll these have head=48, tail=37, both positive, moving right, so span starts at 37 and increases, so 0 is never covered since min is 37 at t1, increasing.\n\nSo for freeways 2,3,4,5, no car ever covers 0.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: same as above, never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: head=0, tail=-11, direction right, speed 12.\n\nRight-moving, so span at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-11 + 12 Δt, 0 + 12 Δt] = [-11 + 12 Δt, 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 12 Δt\n\nLeft: -11 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 => 12 Δt ≤ 11 => Δt ≤ 11/12 ≈ 0.916, so Δt <=0 since integer? Δt=0: -11 +0 = -11 <=0 true, but at Δt=0, T=t1=66.\n\nBut we need to see for T>t1 or including?\n\nThe collision is at time T, for T >= t1.\n\nAt T=t1, Δt=0, span = [-11, 0] for this car, so 0 is included.\n\nNow, 0 ≤ 12 Δt is always true for Δt >=0.\n\nAnd -11 +12 Δt <=0: for Δt=0, -11<=0 true; Δt=1, -11+12=1>0, false.\n\nSo only at Δt=0, which is T=66.\n\nBut at T=66, for freeway 6, the second car has span [-11,0], so 0 is covered.\n\nNow, freeway 7: two cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: head=-48, tail=-59, direction right, speed 6.\n\nSimilar to freeway 1 but different speed.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-59 + 6 Δt, -48 + 6 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 6 Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 6 Δt\n\nA <=0: -59 + 6 Δt <=0 => 6 Δt <=59 => Δt <= 59/6 ≈9.833, so Δt <=9\n\nB >=0: -48 + 6 Δt >=0 => 6 Δt >=48 => Δt >=8\n\nSo for Δt=8,9\n\nΔt=8: A=-59+48=-11, B=-48+48=0, [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔt=9: A=-59+54=-5, B=-48+54=6, [-5,6], 0 in\n\nΔt=10: A=-59+60=1, B=-48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nΔt=7: A=-59+42=-17, B=-48+42=-6, [-17,-6], 0 not in\n\nSo T=66+8=74, 66+9=75\n\nNow second car on freeway 7: (0,-11,right,6)\n\nSpan: [-11 + 6 Δt, 0 + 6 Δt] = [-11 + 6 Δt, 6 Δt]\n\n0 in span: -11 + 6 Δt <= 0 <= 6 Δt\n\nLeft: -11 + 6 Δt <=0 => 6 Δt <=11 => Δt <= 11/6 ≈1.833, so Δt<=1\n\nRight: 0 <= 6 Δt always for Δt>=0\n\nSo for Δt=0: -11<=0<=0, 0 in\n\nΔt=1: -11+6=-5<=0<=6, 0 in\n\nΔt=2: -11+12=1, 6*2=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo at Δt=0 and 1, T=66 and 67.\n\nNow freeway 8: similar to 7, two cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nSame as freeway 7.\n\nFirst car: covers 0 at T=74,75\n\nSecond car: covers 0 at T=66,67\n\nNow, back to freeway 6: we have second car covers 0 only at T=66.\n\nFirst car never.\n\nSo for freeway 6, 0 covered only at T=66.\n\nNow, let's summarize for each freeway, the times when 0 is covered, meaning if player is on that row at that time, collision occurs.\n\n- Freeway 1: T=82,83,84,85\n\n- Freeway 2: never\n\n- Freeway 3: never\n\n- Freeway 4: never\n\n- Freeway 5: never\n\n- Freeway 6: T=66 (only, from second car)\n\n- Freeway 7: T=66,67 (from second car), and T=74,75 (from first car)\n\n- Freeway 8: same as 7: T=66,67 (second car), T=74,75 (first car)\n\nFreeway 6 has only T=66, but at T=66, it's covered.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have multiple times.\n\nNow, player starts at turn 66, y=0.\n\nAt turn 66, y=0, which is not a freeway, so no collision, even though freeways 6,7,8 have cars at 0, but player is not on those rows, so safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimal path is to go up each turn, but we might hit a collision when on a freeway at a bad time.\n\nSince we start at y=0, turn 66.\n\nAction at turn 66: we can choose U, D, or S.\n\nIf we go U, at turn 67, y=1.\n\nIf S, y=0 at turn 67.\n\nIf D, but y=0, down to -1? But y must be >=0, so I think D is invalid at y=0, or it stays? The update says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y in [0,9], so if at y=0 and a_t=D, y_{t+1} = 0 -1 = -1, but y must be in [0,9], so probably it stays at 0 or something? The rule doesn't specify, but since y must be in [0,9], I think we cannot go below 0 or above 9, so if action would take it out, it should stay or be clamped.\n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\", so if action would make it outside, it should be adjusted, but not specified how. To be safe, I think we should avoid actions that would cause out of bounds, or assume it stays.\n\nBut in this case, at y=0, D would try to go to -1, which is invalid, so probably y_{t+1} remains 0, same as S. Similarly for y=9, U would be like S.\n\nI think for simplicity, we can assume that actions that would cause y out of bounds are not allowed, or have no effect, but since we want minimal turns, we probably don't want to go down from 0 anyway.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, U not needed.\n\nSo for now, at y=0, possible actions: U or S, D not useful.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, D or S.\n\nBut we start at 0, go to 9.\n\nNow, let's plan the path.\n\nWe need to be on each freeway y=1 to 8 at some turn, but not when 0 is covered for that row.\n\nSince we can stay or move, we can delay or advance the time we are on a row.\n\nLet T be the turn number starting from 66.\n\nPlayer position at turn T: y_T.\n\ny_{T} depends on previous actions.\n\nStart: T=66, y=0.\n\nWe need y_{66 + H -1} = 9, and H minimal.\n\nSince we start at 0, to reach 9, we need at least 9 up moves, so H >= 9.\n\nIf no cars, H=9, actions all U.\n\nBut with cars, we might need more turns if we have to wait.\n\nFirst, let's see the critical times.\n\nFreeway 6 has danger only at T=66.\n\nBut at T=66, player is at y=0, not on freeway 6, so when we are on y=6, we need to avoid T=66, but T=66 is now, we are not on it, so for future, no issue for y=6 except at T=66 which is past or current.\n\nT=66 is the current turn, we are at y=0.\n\nFor freeway 6, 0 is covered only at T=66, so for T>66, no danger on y=6, since no car covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: danger at T=66,67,74,75\n\nT=66 and 67 are soon.\n\nFreeway 8: same, T=66,67,74,75\n\nFreeway 1: danger at T=82,83,84,85\n\nNow, since we need to go through rows 1 to 8, and we start at row 0.\n\nLet me denote the turn when we are on row k.\n\nSince we move step by step, the time we reach a row depends on when we leave row 0.\n\nAction at T=66: if we go U, then at T=67, y=1\n\nIf we stay S, at T=67, y=0, etc.\n\nSimilarly, from y=1, we can go to y=0,1,2, etc.\n\nBut since we want to go to 9, we should generally go up, but may need to stay or go down to avoid.\n\nNow, let's consider the danger times for each row.\n\nFor row k (freeway k), when is it dangerous, i.e., when 0 is covered.\n\n- Row 1: dangerous at T=82,83,84,85\n\n- Row 2: never dangerous\n\n- Row 3: never\n\n- Row 4: never\n\n- Row 5: never\n\n- Row 6: dangerous only at T=66, but since T=66 we are at y=0, not on row 6, so for T>66, row 6 is always safe. Because no other times.\n\n- Row 7: dangerous at T=66,67,74,75\n\n- Row 8: dangerous at T=66,67,74,75\n\nRows 2,3,4,5 are always safe, since no cars cover 0 ever.\n\nRow 6 is safe for all T except T=66, but T=66 is past for when we are on row, so row 6 is always safe to be on.\n\nOnly rows 1,7,8 have danger times.\n\nRow 1: danger at 82-85\n\nRow 7: danger at 66,67,74,75\n\nRow 8: same as 7.\n\nNow, we need to be on row 7 and 8 at times not in {66,67,74,75}, and on row 1 not in {82,83,84,85}.\n\nBut 66 and 67 are early, 74-75 and 82-85 are later.\n\nSince we start at T=66, y=0.\n\nIf we go up immediately at T=66, action U, then at T=67, y=1.\n\ny=1 is row 1? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=1 is row 1.\n\nAt T=67, y=1, but row 1 is dangerous only at T=82-85, not at 67, so safe.\n\nThen we can continue up.\n\nBut we have to go through row 7 and 8 which have danger at 74-75.\n\nSimilarly, row 1 later.\n\nFirst, let's see the minimal time to reach each row.\n\nIf we go up every turn:\n\nStart T=66, y=0\n\nAction U: T=67, y=1\n\nU: T=68, y=2\n\nU: T=69, y=3\n\nU: T=70, y=4\n\nU: T=71, y=5\n\nU: T=72, y=6\n\nU: T=73, y=7\n\nNow at T=73, y=7.\n\nBut row 7 is dangerous at T=74,75? T=73 is not in danger, but if we go U to y=8 at T=74.\n\nAt T=73, y=7, which is row 7.\n\nIs row 7 dangerous at T=73? Danger times are 66,67,74,75. T=73 not in, so safe.\n\nThen at T=73, action U: to y=8 at T=74.\n\nAt T=74, y=8, row 8.\n\nBut row 8 dangerous at T=74,75. T=74 is danger.\n\nSo if we are at y=8 at T=74, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay at y=7 at T=74.\n\nBut at T=74, if we are on y=7, row 7, which is dangerous at T=74, so also collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nIn the sequence: at T=73, y=7, safe.\n\nThen at T=73, if we do action S: stay, then at T=74, y=7 still.\n\nBut at T=74, on row 7, which is dangerous (since T=74 in {74,75}), so collision.\n\nIf we go U to y=8 at T=74, on row 8 at T=74, also dangerous.\n\nIf we go D to y=6 at T=74, but y=6 at T=74, row 6 is safe, but we are going down, which might not be efficient.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nTo avoid, we need not to be on row 7 or 8 at T=74 or 75.\n\nSimilarly, not on row 1 at T=82-85.\n\nFirst, let's handle row 7 and 8.\n\nDanger times for row 7 and 8: T=66,67,74,75\n\nT=66 and 67 are at the beginning, we are not on row 7 or 8 yet, since we start at y=0.\n\nSo we need to avoid T=74 and 75 for being on row 7 or 8.\n\nThat is, if we are on row 7 or 8 at turn 74 or 75, collision.\n\nSimilarly, for row 1, avoid T=82-85.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nIf we go straight up, we reach y=7 at T=73, which is safe for row 7.\n\nThen at T=73, if we go U, we reach y=8 at T=74, but T=74 dangerous for row 8.\n\nIf we go S at T=73, we stay y=7 at T=74, dangerous.\n\nIf we go D, to y=6 at T=74.\n\nThen at T=74, y=6, row 6 is safe, as we established.\n\nBut then we are at y=6, need to go up to y=7,8,9.\n\nBut at T=74, we are at y=6.\n\nThen action at T=74: we can go U to y=7 at T=75.\n\nBut at T=75, y=7, row 7 dangerous at T=75, collision.\n\nIf S at T=74, stay y=6, then at T=75 y=6, safe, but not progress.\n\nIf D, to y=5, worse.\n\nSo to avoid collision on row 7 at T=75, we need not to be on row 7 at T=75.\n\nSimilarly, if we are at y=6 at T=74, and we go U at T=74, to y=7 at T=75, but T=75 dangerous for row 7.\n\nIf we stay at y=6 at T=74, then at T=75, we can go U to y=7 at T=76.\n\nT=76, is row 7 dangerous? Danger times 66,67,74,75. T=76 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nSo let's plan.\n\nIf we reach y=7 at a time not 74 or 75.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nMinimal time to reach y=7: if start at T=66 y=0, after 7 up moves, at T=73 y=7, as before.\n\nBut at T=73 y=7 safe, but we cannot stay or go up immediately because T=74 and 75 dangerous.\n\nSo we need to delay reaching y=7.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=6 for one turn.\n\nLet's list the turns.\n\nStart T=66, y=0\n\nSuppose we go U at 66: T=67, y=1\n\nU at 67: T=68, y=2\n\nU at 68: T=69, y=3\n\nU at 69: T=70, y=4\n\nU at 70: T=71, y=5\n\nU at 71: T=72, y=6\n\nNow at T=72, y=6, row 6 safe.\n\nAction at T=72: if U, go to y=7 at T=73.\n\nT=73 y=7, row 7, not dangerous (73 not in 74,75), safe.\n\nThen at T=73, if we go U, to y=8 at T=74, but T=74 dangerous for row 8.\n\nIf S, stay y=7 at T=74, dangerous for row 7.\n\nIf D, to y=6 at T=74.\n\nAt T=74, y=6, row 6 safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go to y=7 later.\n\nBut at T=74, y=6, action at T=74: if U, to y=7 at T=75, but T=75 row 7 dangerous.\n\nIf S, stay y=6 at T=75, safe but no progress.\n\nIf D, worse.\n\nSo better to stay at T=74: action S, then at T=75, y=6, then action U at T=75 to y=7 at T=76.\n\nT=76, y=7, row 7, T=76 not dangerous (only 66,67,74,75), so safe.\n\nThen from T=76, y=7, we can go U to y=8 at T=77.\n\nT=77, y=8, row 8, danger times 66,67,74,75, T=77 not in, safe.\n\nThen U to y=9 at T=78.\n\nNow, we also have row 1 to consider later? We are at y=8 at T=77, go to y=9 at T=78.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9, and row 1 is below, but since we are going up, we passed row 1 already at T=67, which was safe.\n\nIn this sequence, we have extra turns: we stayed at y=6 for one turn? Let's count the turns.\n\nT=66: y=0, action U\n\nT=67: y=1, action U\n\nT=68: y=2, action U\n\nT=69: y=3, action U\n\nT=70: y=4, action U\n\nT=71: y=5, action U\n\nT=72: y=6, action U? In my earlier, at T=72 y=6, if we go U, to y=7 at T=73, then problem.\n\nBut I said we need to not go up at T=72? No.\n\nIn the sequence above, I had:\n\nAt T=72, y=6, instead of going U, we can do something else.\n\nBut in the minimal path, we can go to y=7 at T=73, which is safe, but then stuck because T=74 and 75 dangerous.\n\nSo from T=72 y=6, we can stay or go down, but going down is bad.\n\nAt T=72, action S: stay at y=6 for T=73.\n\nThen at T=73, y=6, then action U to y=7 at T=74.\n\nBut at T=74, y=7, row 7 dangerous, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt T=72, action S, then at T=73 y=6, then action S again at T=73, stay y=6 at T=74.\n\nThen at T=74 y=6, action U to y=7 at T=75, but T=75 row 7 dangerous.\n\nStill problem.\n\nTo avoid being on row 7 at T=74 or 75, we need to be on row 7 at T<74 or T>75.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nThe safe times for row 7 and 8 are T <=73 or T>=76.\n\nT=73 is safe, as we have.\n\nT=76 and later safe.\n\nT=74 and 75 dangerous.\n\nSo we can be on row 7 at T=73 or T=76, etc.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nIn the straight path, we reach y=7 at T=73, which is safe.\n\nBut we need to go to y=8, which should be at T=74, but dangerous.\n\nSo we need to spend some time not on row 7 or 8 during T=74 and 75.\n\nWe can, for example, stay at y=6 during T=73 and T=74, then go to y=7 at T=75? But T=75 row 7 dangerous.\n\nNot.\n\nStay at y=6 until after T=75.\n\nFor example:\n\nReach y=6 at T=72 as before.\n\nThen at T=72, action S: stay y=6 at T=73\n\nAt T=73, action S: stay y=6 at T=74\n\nAt T=74, action S: stay y=6 at T=75\n\nNow at T=75, y=6, row 6 safe.\n\nThen at T=75, action U: to y=7 at T=76\n\nT=76, y=7, row 7 safe (T=76 not danger)\n\nThen action U: to y=8 at T=77\n\nT=77, y=8, row 8 safe\n\nThen action U: to y=9 at T=78\n\nNow, we have H=78 - 66 + something? Turn sequence.\n\nStart turn T=66, we have actions from t=66 to t=77? Let's list:\n\nTurn t=66: action, then y at t+1.\n\nPosition y_t at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, we perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nWe start at turn 66, y_66 = 0.\n\nAfter action a_66, y_67 set.\n\nAnd so on, until we reach y_{t} =9 for some t.\n\nThe minimal t such that y_t =9.\n\nThen H = t - 66 +1? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=66 to t=66+H-1, and after H actions, we are at y_{66 + H}? No.\n\nAfter action at turn t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo at turn 66, after action a_66, y_67 is set.\n\nSimilarly, after a_{66+H-1}, y_{66+H} is set.\n\nWe want y_{66+H} =9.\n\nAnd we start with y_66=0.\n\nSo the number of actions is H, and we reach position at turn 66+H.\n\nFor example, if H=9, actions at t=66 to 74, y_{75} =9? Let's see:\n\nt=66: a66, y67\n\nt=67: a67, y68\n\n...\n\nt=74: a74, y75\n\nSo after a74, y75 set. If all U, y75=9.\n\ny_{66} =0, after 9 up, y_{75} =9.\n\nSo turns from 66 to 74, H=9 actions.\n\nGenerally, from y=0 to y=9, min H=9.\n\nIn our case, with delays.\n\nBack to the plan.\n\nIn the sequence I thought:\n\nTo avoid danger at T=74,75 for rows 7,8.\n\nReach y=6 at T=72.\n\ny at turn T.\n\nAt T=72, y=6.\n\nThen we stay at y=6 for multiple turns until after T=75.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt turn 72: action S, so y_{73} =6 (since stay)\n\nAt turn 73: action S, y_{74} =6\n\nAt turn 74: action S, y_{75} =6\n\nAt turn 75: action U, y_{76} =7\n\nAt turn 76: action U, y_{77} =8\n\nAt turn 77: action U, y_{78} =9\n\nNow, at T=76, y=7, row 7, turn 76, not danger time, safe.\n\nT=77, y=8, row 8, safe.\n\nT=78, y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nWe started from T=66 y=0.\n\nHow did we get to y=6 at T=72?\n\nFrom start:\n\nT=66: y=0, action U, so y_{67} =1\n\nT=67: action U, y_{68} =2\n\nT=68: action U, y_{69} =3\n\nT=69: action U, y_{70} =4\n\nT=70: action U, y_{71} =5\n\nT=71: action U, y_{72} =6\n\nYes, so at T=72, y=6.\n\nThen actions:\n\nT=72: S, y_{73}=6\n\nT=73: S, y_{74}=6\n\nT=74: S, y_{75}=6\n\nT=75: U, y_{76}=7\n\nT=76: U, y_{77}=8\n\nT=77: U, y_{78}=9\n\nSo we reach y=9 at T=78.\n\nH = number of actions from t=66 to t=77? t=66 to t=77 inclusive? Actions at t=66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77.\n\nThat's 12 actions? t=66 to 77 is 12 turns? 77-66+1=12.\n\nBut from t=66 to t=77, that's 12 actions, to reach y_{78}=9.\n\nSince y_{66}=0, we need 9 net up moves, but we have 3 extra stays (at t=72,73,74), so 9 up + 3 stay, 12 actions, reach at T=78.\n\nMinimal would be 9, but we added 3 delays.\n\nBut we also have row 1 to consider.\n\nIn this sequence, when were we on row 1?\n\nAt T=67, y=1, row 1.\n\nDanger times for row 1 are T=82,83,84,85.\n\nT=67 is not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, other rows safe.\n\nBut at T=78, y=9, done.\n\nH=12, but perhaps we can do with less delay.\n\nFor example, we only need to avoid rows 7 and 8 at T=74 and 75.\n\nWe were on y=6 at T=72,73,74,75.\n\nT=72 y=6, T=73 y=6, T=74 y=6, T=75 y=6.\n\nBut we could go to y=7 earlier if possible, but T=73 is safe for y=7, but then we cannot stay or go up because T=74 dangerous.\n\nWe could go down to a safe row.\n\nFor example, at T=72, y=6, action U to y=7 at T=73 (safe)\n\nThen at T=73, instead of staying or going up, we go down to y=6 at T=74? Action D at T=73.\n\nThen y_{74} =6, which is row 6, safe.\n\nThen at T=74, y=6, we need to go to y=7, but if we go U at T=74, to y=7 at T=75, but T=75 row 7 dangerous.\n\nIf we stay at T=74, action S, y_{75}=6, then at T=75, action U to y=7 at T=76, safe.\n\nThen from there.\n\nCompare: in this case:\n\nT=72: U, y_{73}=7  (row 7, T=73 safe)\n\nT=73: D, y_{74}=6  (row 6, safe)\n\nT=74: S, y_{75}=6  (row 6, safe? At T=74, y=6, row 6 safe)\n\nT=75: U, y_{76}=7  (row 7, T=76 safe)\n\nT=76: U, y_{77}=8\n\nT=77: U, y_{78}=9\n\nBut we have an extra down move, which is inefficient, since we go to y=7 and back to y=6, then up again.\n\nIn terms of time, we reach y=9 at same T=78, but with an extra action: down and then up later, whereas in previous we had three stays but no down.\n\nIn this sequence: actions: U at 72 (to 7), D at 73 (to 6), S at 74 (stay 6), U at 75 (to 7), U at 76 (to 8), U at 77 (to 9)\n\nFrom T=71: y=5? Let's list all from start.\n\nStart:\n\nT=66: U, y67=1\n\nT=67: U, y68=2\n\n...\n\nUp to T=71: U, y72=6? T=71 action, y72 set.\n\nT=66: a=U, y67=1\n\nT=67: a=U, y68=2\n\nT=68: a=U, y69=3\n\nT=69: a=U, y70=4\n\nT=70: a=U, y71=5\n\nT=71: a=U, y72=6\n\nNow at T=72, y=6? Position at turn T: y_t.\n\nAt turn T=72, we perform action.\n\nIn the sequence above, at T=72: action U, so y_{73} =7\n\nThen at T=73: action D, so y_{74} =7 -1 =6\n\nThen at T=74: action S, so y_{75} =6\n\nThen at T=75: action U, so y_{76} =7\n\nThen T=76: U, y77=8\n\nT=77: U, y78=9\n\nSame as before, y78=9 with actions from t=66 to 77, 12 actions.\n\nBut in the first sequence, we had three S at y=6, here we have U to 7, D to 6, S at 6, then U to 7, so we have an extra D and U instead of S, but same number of actions to reach y=9 at T=78.\n\nWorse because we moved down unnecessarily.\n\nSo better to stay at y=6 for multiple turns.\n\nBut can we reduce the waiting?\n\nWe need to not be on row 7 or 8 at T=74 and 75.\n\nWe can be on other rows.\n\nFor example, at T=74 and 75, we can be on row 1-6 or 9, but y=9 not yet.\n\nRows 2,3,4,5,6 are safe at all times, as we have.\n\nRow 1 is safe except at T=82-85, which are later, not issue yet.\n\nSo at T=74 and 75, we can be on any row except 7 and 8.\n\nBut since we are going up, we might be on row 6 or below.\n\nIn the minimal time, we reach row 6 at T=72.\n\nThen we need to be not on 7 or 8 at T=74,75.\n\nSo we can stay at row 6 until T=75, then go to row 7 at T=76.\n\nAs in first plan.\n\nWe could go to row 7 at T=73, but then at T=74, we must not be on row 7 or 8, so we need to go down to row 6 or lower at T=74.\n\nBut going down is counterproductive.\n\nFor example, at T=73 y=7, action D to y=6 at T=74.\n\nThen at T=74 y=6, now we need to go up, but at T=75, if we go to y=7, dangerous, so we must stay at y=6 or go down, then go up later.\n\nThus, it takes more turns.\n\nFor instance: from T=73 y=7, D to y=6 at T=74.\n\nThen at T=74 y=6, S to y=6 at T=75.\n\nThen at T=75 y=6, U to y=7 at T=76.\n\nThen U to y=8 at T=77, U to y=9 at T=78.\n\nSame as before, but we reached y=7 earlier but went down, so net same.\n\nWorse if we go down further.\n\nSo minimal is to stay at a safe row during the danger times.\n\nIn this case, row 6 is safe, so stay at y=6 during T=73,74,75? But at T=73, if we are at y=6, it is fine.\n\nIn terms of position: at T=73, y=6; T=74, y=6; T=75, y=6; all safe.\n\nThen go up.\n\nNow, the number of turns: from start to reach y=6 at T=72, that took 6 actions (t=66 to 71: actions to go from y=0 to y=6, 6 up moves, at t=71 action, y72=6? t=66 U, y67=1; t=67 U, y68=2; ... t=71 U, y72=6. So after 6 actions (t=66 to 71), we are at y72=6.\n\nThen we need to stay at y=6 for three turns: actions at t=72,73,74: all S, so y73=6, y74=6, y75=6.\n\nThen at t=75: U, y76=7\n\nt=76: U, y77=8\n\nt=77: U, y78=9\n\nSo actions from t=66 to t=77, that's 12 actions, reach y78=9.\n\nt=66 to t=77 inclusive is 12 turns.\n\nSince we start action at t=66, end at t=77, H=12.\n\nBut we also have row 1 danger at later times, but in this path, we passed row 1 at T=67, which is fine.\n\nNow, what about row 1? We need to avoid being on row 1 at T=82-85.\n\nBut in this sequence, we are at row 1 only at T=67, which is early, so no problem.\n\nBut we might have other paths, but since we reach y=9 at T=78, before T=82, row 1 is not an issue.\n\nT=78 < 82, so we are done before row 1 becomes dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nFor example, if we delay the start.\n\nSuppose we don't go up immediately.\n\nAt T=66, y=0, we could stay for some turns.\n\nBut since y=0 is safe, but staying there doesn't help, because the danger times are fixed, and later we have row 1 danger at 82-85.\n\nIf we start later, we might hit row 1 at dangerous time.\n\nFor example, suppose we stay at y=0 for D turns.\n\nThen at T=66+D, y=0.\n\nThen go up.\n\nReach y=1 at T=67+D.\n\nThen if we go straight up, reach y=7 at T=73+D.\n\nThen we need to avoid row 7 and 8 at T=74,75, so similar issue.\n\nTo avoid, we need T=73+D not 74 or 75 for row 7, but T=73+D is when we are on row 7.\n\nSet T_y=7 = 73 + D.\n\nWe need T_y=7 not in {74,75}, so if D=0, T=73, which is ok, but then next turn problem.\n\nThe time we are on row 7 must not be 74 or 75.\n\nSimilarly, on row 8 not 74 or 75.\n\nIn the sequence, if we reach y=7 at T, then y=8 at T+1 if go up.\n\nBut we can stay or move down.\n\nBut to minimize, perhaps reach y=7 at T=73, which is safe, then we need to be not on row 7 or 8 at T=74 and T=75.\n\nSo we must leave row 7 before T=74 or stay but avoid, but we can go down to row 6.\n\nFor example, at T=73, y=7, action D to y=6 at T=74.\n\nThen at T=74, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=74, we can stay or go up.\n\nIf go U at T=74, to y=7 at T=75, but T=75 row 7 dangerous.\n\nSo must not go to row 7 at T=75.\n\nThus at T=74, action S, y75=6, then at T=75, action U, y76=7.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nSame as before.\n\nReach y=7 at T=76 directly by delaying.\n\nBut if we delay start, we might hit row 1 danger.\n\nFor example, minimal delay: suppose we stay at y=0 for one turn.\n\nT=66: S, y67=0\n\nT=67: U, y68=1\n\nThen similar, T=68: U, y69=2\n\n...\n\nT=72: U, y73=6\n\nT=73: U, y74=7? But at T=74, y=7, row 7 dangerous if T=74.\n\nT=74 is danger.\n\ny at T=74 is 7, set by action at T=73.\n\nAction at T=73 U, y74=7.\n\nT=74, y=7, row 7, dangerous.\n\nNot good.\n\nAfter staying at start, reach y=6 later.\n\nT=66: S, y67=0\n\nT=67: U, y68=1\n\nT=68: U, y69=2\n\nT=69: U, y70=3\n\nT=70: U, y71=4\n\nT=71: U, y72=5\n\nT=72: U, y73=6\n\nT=73: ? Now at T=73 y=6.\n\nThen we need to stay or go.\n\nBut to avoid, we can stay at y=6 for T=73,74,75.\n\nActions: T=73: S, y74=6\n\nT=74: S, y75=6\n\nT=75: S, y76=6? Then U at T=75 to y=7 at T=76? T=75 action U, y76=7\n\nThen U at T=76, y77=8\n\nU at T=77, y78=9\n\nBut we reached y=9 at T=78 same as before, but we started with a stay, so one extra turn: actions from t=66 to t=77, but t=66 was S, not progress, so y at T=78, same.\n\nBut we have an extra action at start, so H larger? In previous without delay, we had actions to t=77 for y78=9 with 12 actions.\n\nHere: t=66: S (y67=0), t=67: U (y68=1), ..., up to t=72: U (y73=6), then t=73: S (y74=6), t=74: S (y75=6), t=75: U (y76=7), t=76: U (y77=8), t=77: U (y78=9)\n\nActions from t=66 to t=77, same 12 actions, but we have one more stay at beginning, but since we stayed at y=0, we progress slower, but in terms of reaching y=9, same turn T=78, but we used an action to stay at start which didn't help, so H same or worse? H is number of actions, here 12 actions to reach y78=9.\n\nIn the first sequence without initial stay, we had 12 actions: t=66 to 71: 6 U to y72=6, then t=72,73,74: 3 S to y75=6, then t=75: U y76=7, t=76:U y77=8, t=77:U y78=9. t=66 to t=77 is 12 actions.\n\nIn this with initial stay: t=66:S, t=67:U, t=68:U, t=69:U, t=70:U, t=71:U, t=72:U, that's to y73=6? t=67:U y68=1, ..., t=72:U y73=6. Then t=73:S y74=6, t=74:S y75=6, t=75:U y76=7, t=76:U y77=8, t=77:U y78=9. So actions t=66 to t=77, 12 actions, but y reached at same time, but we have one extra action (the initial S) and one less up? From y=0 to y=6, it took 6 actions but with initial S, so we have only 5 up moves to reach y=6 at T=73, whereas without, we reached at T=72.\n\nBut in both, we reach y=9 at T=78 with 12 actions.\n\nBut in the first case, we used 9 up and 3 stay; here with initial stay, we used 8 up and 4 stay or something, but same H.\n\nBut we can save by not staying unnecessarily.\n\nNow, back to row 1 danger at T=82-85.\n\nIn this path, we are done at T=78, before 82, so no issue.\n\nBut suppose we take more time, we might hit that.\n\nFor example, if we take longer to go up, we might be on row 1 at T=82-85.\n\nBut in minimal path, we should be fine.\n\nBut is there a way with H<12?\n\nFor example, we only need to avoid rows 7 and 8 at T=74,75.\n\nWe can be on row 7 at T=73, which is safe, and then at T=74, instead of being on row 7 or 8, we can be on row 9? But not yet.\n\nOr on row 6.\n\nBut to be on row 6 at T=74, we need to have been at row 6 or 5 or 7 but moved down.\n\nBut from row 7, moving down to row 6 at T=74.\n\nThen as before.\n\nWe could reach row 7 later, but row 7 at T=76.\n\nIn the straight path, we reach row 6 at T=72.\n\nThen if we go to row 7 at T=73 (safe), then at T=73 action D to row 6 at T=74 (safe), then at T=74 action S to row 6 at T=75 (safe), then at T=75 action U to row 7 at T=76 (safe), then U to row 8 at T=77, U to row 9 at T=78.\n\nSame as before, 12 actions.\n\nIf at T=74, after being at row 6, we go directly to row 8? No, we have to go through row 7.\n\nAnother idea: since rows 2,3,4,5 are always safe, we could stay there during danger times, but we are at row 6 at T=72, which is before, so we need to go back, which takes more time.\n\nFor example, at T=72, y=6, instead of staying, go down to y=5 at T=73, then at T=73 y=5, safe, but then we need to go up later, worse.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo minimal seems to be H=12.\n\nBut let's confirm the row 1 issue.\n\nIn this sequence, we are on row 1 at T=67, which is not dangerous.\n\nDanger times 82-85, late.\n\nBut we also need to ensure that when we are on other rows, no collision, but rows 2-5 always safe, row 6 always safe, row 7 and 8 we are at safe times.\n\nIn the sequence: when on row 7 at T=76, safe; row 8 at T=77, safe.\n\nNow, but in the car states, for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but we already computed the times when 0 is covered.\n\nFor example, on freeway 7, at T=76, is 0 covered?\n\nWe have danger times only at 66,67,74,75, so at T=76, not danger, so 0 not covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, but we have row 1 danger at 82-85, but we are not on row 1 then.\n\nBut just to be complete, suppose we take more turns, we need to avoid row 1 at those times.\n\nBut in this case, not necessary.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster by timing differently.\n\nAnother thought: since row 8 has the same danger times as row 7, and we need to pass both.\n\nThe danger window is only two turns: 74 and 75.\n\nWe need to be not on row 7 or 8 during these two turns.\n\nIn the path, we can pass row 7 quickly at a safe time and row 8 at another safe time.\n\nFor example, if we reach row 7 at T=73 (safe), then immediately go to row 8 at T=74, but T=74 row 8 dangerous.\n\nNot good.\n\nReach row 7 at T=76, then row 8 at T=77, both safe.\n\nBut to reach row 7 at T=76, we need to delay.\n\nFrom start, if we go slower to row 6.\n\nFor example, stay at some row.\n\nBut rows below are safe, but delaying might cause row 1 issue later.\n\nFor instance, suppose we stay at y=0 for one turn.\n\nT=66: S, y67=0\n\nThen T=67: U, y68=1\n\nT=68: U, y69=2\n\nT=69: U, y70=3\n\nT=70: U, y71=4\n\nT=71: U, y72=5\n\nT=72: U, y73=6\n\nT=73: U, y74=7  // but at T=74, y=7, dangerous\n\nProblem.\n\nAfter T=72: U to y73=6, then stay or go.\n\nTo avoid, at T=73: S, y74=6\n\nT=74: S, y75=6\n\nT=75: U, y76=7\n\nT=76: U, y77=8\n\nT=77: U, y78=9\n\nSame as before.\n\nWith the initial stay, we have T=66: S, y67=0, then from t=67 to 72: U to y73=6, then same as above, but we reached y=6 later, so y=9 at T=78 still, but with one extra action, H=13? Actions t=66 to t=77: 12 actions, y78=9.\n\nt=66: S, y67=0\n\nt=67: U, y68=1\n\n...\n\nt=72: U, y73=6 (now t=72 action U, y73=6)\n\nThen t=73: S, y74=6\n\nt=74: S, y75=6\n\nt=75: U, y76=7\n\nt=76: U, y77=8\n\nt=77: U, y78=9\n\nActions from t=66 to t=77, 12 actions, but y73=6, whereas without initial stay, y72=6, but both reach y78=9 with 12 actions.\n\nIn no initial stay: actions t=66 to 71: 6U to y72=6; then t=72,73,74: 3S to y75=6; t=75:U y76=7; t=76:U y77=8; t=77:U y78=9. 12 actions.\n\nWith initial stay: t=66:S y67=0; t=67:U y68=1; t=68:U y69=2; t=69:U y70=3; t=70:U y71=4; t=71:U y72=5; t=72:U y73=6; then t=73:S y74=6; t=74:S y75=6; t=75:U y76=7; t=76:U y77=8; t=77:U y78=9. Now, actions from t=66 to t=77, 12 actions, but to reach y=6, it took from t=67 to t=72: 6 actions (t=67 U to t=72 U, but t=67 U y68=1, t=68 U y69=2, ..., t=72 U y73=6, so 6 actions to go from y=0 to y=6, but started from t=67, whereas without delay, started from t=66.\n\nBut in both, H=12 to reach y=9 at T=78.\n\nNow, back to row 1: suppose we want to avoid the row 1 danger, but since we pass early, no issue.\n\nBut if we delay too much, we might be on row 1 at T=82.\n\nFor example, suppose we stay at y=0 for many turns.\n\nBut that would increase H, not good.\n\nWe can pass row 1 at a safe time.\n\nBut in minimal time, we pass at T=67, safe.\n\nNow, another thing: in the car states, for freeway 6, there was a car at T=66, but we not on it.\n\nBut for freeway 7 and 8, at T=66 and 67, cars cover 0, but we not on them.\n\nNow, I think with H=12 is acceptable.\n\nBut let's see if we can do with H=11 or less.\n\nSuppose we reach row 6 at T=72.\n\nThen at T=72, action U to row 7 at T=73 (safe)\n\nThen at T=73, since we cannot stay or go up because next turn dangerous, we go down to row 6 at T=74 (action D)\n\nThen at T=74, we are at row 6, safe.\n\nNow, at T=74, action: if we go U to row 7 at T=75, dangerous.\n\nSo we must not go to row 7 at T=75.\n\nThus action S at T=74, to row 6 at T=75.\n\nThen at T=75, action U to row 7 at T=76.\n\nThen U to row 8 at T=77, U to row 9 at T=78.\n\nSame as before.\n\nActions: t=72:U to y73=7; t=73:D to y74=6; t=74:S to y75=6; t=75:U to y76=7; t=76:U to y77=8; t=77:U to y78=9.\n\nCompared to staying: t=72:S y73=6; t=73:S y74=6; t=74:S y75=6; then U etc.\n\nIn the down-up, we have an extra D action, which is wasteful, so better to stay.\n\nThus minimal H=12.\n\nBut we have three S actions during the danger period.\n\nPerhaps we can use the fact that row 1 is safe except late, but no.\n\nAnother idea: go to row 8 directly from row 7 at a safe time after.\n\nBut we need to be on row 7 first.\n\nUnless we jump, but no, only move one step.\n\nSo I think H=12 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to output actions starting from t_1=66.\n\nIn the first sequence without initial delay:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 66: U  (to y=1 at t=67)\n\nTurn 67: U  (y68=2)\n\nTurn 68: U  (y69=3)\n\nTurn 69: U  (y70=4)\n\nTurn 70: U  (y71=5)\n\nTurn 71: U  (y72=6)\n\nTurn 72: S  (y73=6)  // stay at y=6\n\nTurn 73: S  (y74=6)  // stay\n\nTurn 74: S  (y75=6)  // stay\n\nTurn 75: U  (y76=7)  // now safe\n\nTurn 76: U  (y77=8)\n\nTurn 77: U  (y78=9)\n\nAfter turn 77 action, y78=9, so we reached at turn 78.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=66 to t=77, 12 actions.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions from t=66 to t=77, but H is the number, and sequence for t=66 to t=66+H-1.\n\nHere H=12, actions from t=66 to t=77 (since 66 + 12 -1 =77).\n\ny_{66+12} = y_{78} =9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, we need to confirm that at all points, no collision.\n\nFor example, at T=67, y=1, row 1: danger times 82-85, not 67, safe.\n\nT=68, y=2, row 2 always safe.\n\nSimilarly T=69 y=3, safe; T=70 y=4 safe; T=71 y=5 safe; T=72 y=6, row 6 always safe; T=73 y=6, safe; T=74 y=6, safe; T=75 y=6, safe; T=76 y=7, row 7, T=76 not danger (74,75), safe; T=77 y=8, row 8, T=77 not 74,75, safe; T=78 y=9, not freeway.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, but in freeway 6, there was a car at T=66, but we not on row 6 at T=66.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this works.\n\nBut the problem has row 1 danger at 82-85, which we avoid.\n\nIs there a way with H=11?\n\nSuppose we reach row 7 at T=73, safe.\n\nThen at T=73, instead of going down, we go to row 8 at T=74, but dangerous.\n\nNot possible.\n\nOr, delay less.\n\nSuppose we stay only two turns at row 6.\n\nFor example, at T=72 y=6, action S: y73=6\n\nThen at T=73, action S: y74=6\n\nThen at T=74, action U: to y=7 at T=75.\n\nBut at T=75, y=7, row 7 dangerous, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt T=74, if we go U, y75=7, dangerous.\n\nIf we go to row 7 at T=74, dangerous.\n\nSo we must avoid that.\n\nThus, we need to be at row 6 or below at T=74 and T=75.\n\nSince at T=72 we are at row 6, we can stay until T=75, then go up.\n\nCannot skip.\n\nThus minimal H=12.\n\nPerhaps start by going down, but from y=0, cannot go down, and not useful.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the sequence.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for freeway 6, there are two cars, but we only care when 0 covered, which we did.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo sequence of actions:\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: S\n\nTurn 73: S\n\nTurn 74: S\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nAfter Turn 77 action, position at turn 78 is (0,9).\n\nH=12.\n\nBut let's write in the format.\n\nThe sequence should be for t from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=66, H=12, so t=66 to 77.\n\nActions as above.\n\nIn the output, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 66: U\nTurn 67: U\nTurn 68: U\nTurn 69: U\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: U\nTurn 72: S\nTurn 73: S\nTurn 74: S\nTurn 75: U\nTurn 76: U\nTurn 77: U\n}\n\nBut we need to make sure about the row 1 later, but since we finish early, no issue.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster if we consider that row 1 danger is late, but we don't need to.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 7 and 8, at T=66 and 67, cars cover 0, but we not on them.\n\nBut for example, if we were on row 7 at T=67, it would be dangerous, but we not.\n\nIn our path, we avoid.\n\nSo I think fine.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 66\\) is 12, considering the need to avoid collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\n### Collision Avoidance Reasoning:\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Dangerous at turns 82, 83, 84, 85 (0 covered by car span).\n- **Freeways 2-5 (y=2-5)**: Always safe (0 never covered).\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Dangerous only at turn 66, but since the player is at y=0 at turn 66, it is safe for all turns >66.\n- **Freeways 7 and 8 (y=7-8)**: Dangerous at turns 66, 67, 74, 75 (0 covered by car spans).\n\nThe player starts at y=0 (safe) at turn 66. To minimize turns, the player moves up directly to y=6 by turn 72. However, being on y=7 or y=8 at turns 74 or 75 would cause a collision. Therefore, the player stays at y=6 (safe) during turns 73, 74, and 75 to avoid these danger times. After turn 75, the player moves up to y=9 by turn 78.\n\nThe sequence ensures:\n- At turn 67 (y=1), row 1 is safe (turn 67 not in 82-85).\n- Rows 2-5 are always safe.\n- Row 6 is safe at all relevant turns.\n- At turn 76 (y=7), row 7 is safe (turn 76 not in {66,67,74,75}).\n- At turn 77 (y=8), row 8 is safe (turn 77 not in {66,67,74,75}).\n- The player reaches y=9 at turn 78, before row 1 becomes dangerous at turn 82.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_t\\}\\) for \\(t = 66\\) to \\(77\\) (12 turns) is:\n\n- Turn 66: U (move up to y=1 at turn 67)\n- Turn 67: U (move up to y=2 at turn 68)\n- Turn 68: U (move up to y=3 at turn 69)\n- Turn 69: U (move up to y=4 at turn 70)\n- Turn 70: U (move up to y=5 at turn 71)\n- Turn 71: U (move up to y=6 at turn 72)\n- Turn 72: S (stay at y=6 at turn 73 to avoid danger on y=7/8 at turn 74)\n- Turn 73: S (stay at y=6 at turn 74 to avoid danger on y=7/8 at turn 74)\n- Turn 74: S (stay at y=6 at turn 75 to avoid danger on y=7/8 at turn 75)\n- Turn 75: U (move up to y=7 at turn 76, safe as turn 76 not dangerous)\n- Turn 76: U (move up to y=8 at turn 77, safe as turn 77 not dangerous)\n- Turn 77: U (move up to y=9 at turn 78, reaching goal)\n\nAfter turn 77, the player position at turn 78 is (0,9), achieving the goal in 12 turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 66: U \\\\\nTurn 67: U \\\\\nTurn 68: U \\\\\nTurn 69: U \\\\\nTurn 70: U \\\\\nTurn 71: U \\\\\nTurn 72: S \\\\\nTurn 73: S \\\\\nTurn 74: S \\\\\nTurn 75: U \\\\\nTurn 76: U \\\\\nTurn 77: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn 72 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 through y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For each car, I'm given its head, tail, direction, and speed at turn t1=72. I need to find where they are at future turns to avoid being on the same freeway when the car spans include 0, since that's where the player is.\n\nThe collision rule says: collision occurs at turn T if for any car on the freeway y_T, 0 is in the car's span at that turn. But importantly, when I move from y_T to y_{T+1}, I'm not considered on y_{T+1} until the next turn. So if I move up at turn T, I leave y_T and enter y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe player position update is: at turn t, player is at (0, y_t). Action a_t is taken, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on U, D, S.\n\nThen, for collision: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in Span(T), then collision.\n\nBut when I take an action at turn T, I move to y_{T+1} at turn T+1. So at turn T, I am on y_T, and I might be colliding if 0 in span for that freeway at turn T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nThe note says: if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I won't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T, even if 0 is in span at T, because I'm not there yet. I only care about the freeway I'm currently on at each turn.\n\nSo for each turn, given y_t, I need that for all cars on freeway y_t, 0 is not in their span at that turn.\n\nNow, the car spans change over time. For a car, at turn t1, span is given. Then at turn T > t1, the span moves based on direction and speed.\n\nLet t1 = 72.\n\nFor left-moving cars (d=left), span becomes [h - s*(T - t1), τ - s*(T - t1)]? The notation is a bit messy.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T - t1), τ - s*(T - t1)]\n\nBut in the span, it's given as (head, tail), so for left-moving, if head is left of tail or what? I think I need to interpret the span properly.\n\nLook at the car state table.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nHead h = -48, tail τ = -59, direction right, speed 3.\n\nBut for right-moving, the span is [τ, h]? From the update rule:\n\nRight-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s*(T - t1), h + s*(T - t1)]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail), so for right-moving, head is the front when moving right, so tail is behind.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving.\n\nIn freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3). Since direction is right, head h = -48, tail τ = -59, so at t1, span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? But -59 < -48, so [ -59, -48 ].\n\nThen for right-moving, Span(T) = [ τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1) ] = [ -59 + 3*(T-72), -48 + 3*(T-72) ]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)], but in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving from the data.\n\nLet's list all cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h, τ, d, s) = (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nFreeway 2: (48, 37, right, 12) — but 48 and 37, 48 > 37, so head is larger if moving right? Head should be the front.\n\nIn the notation, for right-moving, head is the front, so if moving right, head should be greater than tail if we think of position increasing to the right.\n\nAssume x-axis increasing to the right.\n\nSo for right-moving car, at position x, head is at higher x, tail at lower x.\n\nSo for freeway 2: (48, 37, right, 12), so h=48, τ=37, so span [τ, h] = [37, 48] at t1.\n\nThen Span(T) = [37 + 12*(T-72), 48 + 12*(T-72)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as 2, (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 4: same\n\nFreeway 5: same\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=12, span [37,48] at t1\n\nSecond car: h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=12, span [ -11, 0 ] at t1? [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=6, span [ -59, -48 ] at t1\n\nSecond car: h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=6, span [ -11, 0 ] at t1\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,0) at turn 72. y=0 is not a freeway with cars, only y=1 to 8 have cars. y=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, since no cars mentioned there.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is y=9, also no cars.\n\nBut I need to traverse through y=1 to 8.\n\nAt each turn, when I am on a freeway y, I need that for all cars on that freeway, 0 is not in their span at that turn.\n\n0 here is the x-position, since player is always at x=0.\n\nSo for a car on freeway k, at turn T, if I am on y_T = k, then 0 should not be in Span(T) for any car on that freeway.\n\nSpan(T) is the interval of x-coordinates occupied by the car at turn T.\n\nFor collision to not happen, for the freeway I'm on, at that turn, no car should cover x=0.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nSince I start at y=0 at turn 72, and I need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H is the number of actions, and after H actions, I am at y=9.\n\nLet t be the turn index starting from t1=72.\n\nAt time t (turn t), position y_t.\n\nAction a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=72 to t=72+H-1, so after H actions, at turn 72+H, position y_{72+H} =9.\n\nt=72: position (0, y_72) = (0,0)\n\nAfter action a_72, at t=73, position y_73, and so on, up to after action a_{72+H-1}, at t=72+H, position y_{72+H} =9.\n\nSo I need y_{72+H} =9, and H is the number of actions.\n\nMinimal H means fastest way to reach y=9.\n\nBut I have to avoid collisions during the path.\n\ny can only change by -1,0,+1 each turn, so to go from 0 to 9, minimum H=9 if I go up every turn, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more.\n\nBut I should check if I can go straight up without colliding.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each future turn, when x=0 is covered by a car on that freeway.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, I can find for each freeway the times when it is unsafe to be there.\n\nDefine the time from t1=72.\n\nLet Δt = T - 72, so at Δt=0, turn 72.\n\nFor each freeway, list the cars and their span at time Δt.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, right-moving, s=3, span at Δt=0: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt time Δt, span: [ -59 + 3*Δt, -48 + 3*Δt ]\n\n0 is in span if -59 + 3*Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 3*Δt\n\nSince -59 + 3*Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 3*Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 3*Δt ≤ 0 => 3*Δt ≤ 59 => Δt ≤ 59/3 ≈ 19.666, so Δt ≤ 19 since integer? Δt is integer, turns are discrete.\n\nT is integer turn number, so Δt is integer.\n\nSo -59 + 3*Δt ≤ 0 => 3*Δt ≤ 59 => Δt ≤ 19.666, so for Δt ≤ 19\n\n3*19=57, -59+57= -2 ≤0, yes\n\n3*20=60, -59+60=1>0, not ≤0\n\nSimilarly, 0 ≤ -48 + 3*Δt => 3*Δt ≥ 48 => Δt ≥ 16\n\nSo 16 ≤ Δt ≤ 19\n\nFor Δt=16: -59 + 3*16 = -59 + 48 = -11 ≤0, and -48 + 48 =0 ≤0? 0 ≤0 is true.\n\n-48 + 3*16 = -48 + 48 =0, so 0 ≤ 0, true.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=17: -59+51= -8 ≤0, -48+51=3 ≥0, 0≤3 true.\n\nΔt=18: -59+54= -5≤0, -48+54=6≥0\n\nΔt=19: -59+57= -2≤0, -48+57=9≥0\n\nΔt=20: -59+60=1>0, not ≤0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe when Δt from 16 to 19 inclusive, i.e., turns 72+16=88 to 72+19=91.\n\nT=72 + Δt, so for T=88,89,90,91, freeway 1 has a car covering x=0.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car, (48,37,right,12), span at Δt=0: [37,48]\n\nAt Δt: [37 + 12*Δt, 48 + 12*Δt]\n\n0 in span: 37 +12*Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 48 +12*Δt\n\nBut 37 +12*Δt ≥37 >0 for all Δt≥0, so left end is always positive, so 0 cannot be ≤ left end since left end >0, so 0 never in span. Similarly, right end >0.\n\nSo for freeway 2, never unsafe, 0 never covered.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as 2, (48,37,right,12), same thing, always safe.\n\nFreeway 4: same, safe.\n\nFreeway 5: same, safe.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12), span [37,48] at Δt=0, at Δt: [37+12Δt,48+12Δt], always positive, so 0 not covered.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), at Δt=0: span [τ,h] = [-11,0]\n\nh=0, τ=-11, d=right, so span [ -11, 0 ] at Δt=0.\n\nAt Δt: [ -11 + 12*Δt, 0 + 12*Δt ] = [ -11 +12Δt, 12Δt ]\n\n0 in span: -11 +12Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 12Δt\n\nFirst: -11 +12Δt ≤ 0 => 12Δt ≤ 11 => Δt ≤ 11/12 <1, so since Δt≥0 integer, only Δt=0 possible? Δt=0: -11 +0 = -11 ≤0, 0≤0 true, so at Δt=0, 0 is in span.\n\nBut Δt=0 is turn 72.\n\nNow for Δt=1: -11+12=1 >0, not ≤0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, for Δt≥1, left end -11+12Δt ≥1 >0, so 0 not covered.\n\nSo second car covers x=0 only at Δt=0, turn 72.\n\nNow, at turn 72, for freeway 6, at that turn, if I am on y=6, I would collide, but I am not on y=6 at turn 72, I am at y=0.\n\nThe collision is only if I am on the freeway at that turn.\n\nAt turn 72, freeway 6 has a car covering x=0, but since I am at y=0, not on freeway 6, so no issue.\n\nFor future turns, for freeway 6, only unsafe at Δt=0, which is past, so for all future turns Δt≥1, freeway 6 is safe because first car never covers 0, second car covers only at Δt=0.\n\nSo freeway 6 is always safe for t≥73.\n\nΔt=0 is t=72, unsafe only at t=72, but since we start at t=72, and we might be elsewhere, for t≥73, safe.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,6), span at Δt=0: [ -59, -48 ]\n\nAt Δt: [ -59 +6Δt, -48 +6Δt ]\n\n0 in span: -59 +6Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +6Δt\n\nFirst: -59 +6Δt ≤0 => 6Δt ≤59 => Δt ≤ 59/6 ≈9.833, so Δt≤9\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 +6Δt => 6Δt ≥48 => Δt ≥8\n\nSo Δt from 8 to 9 inclusive.\n\nΔt=8: -59+48= -11≤0, -48+48=0≤0 true\n\nΔt=9: -59+54= -5≤0, -48+54=6≥0\n\nΔt=10: -59+60=1>0, not ≤0\n\nSo unsafe at Δt=8 and 9, turns 72+8=80, 72+9=81.\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: (0,-11,right,6), span at Δt=0: [ -11, 0 ]\n\nAt Δt: [ -11 +6Δt, 0 +6Δt ] = [ -11 +6Δt, 6Δt ]\n\n0 in span: -11 +6Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 6Δt\n\nFirst: -11+6Δt ≤0 => 6Δt ≤11 => Δt ≤ 11/6 ≈1.833, so Δt≤1\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 6Δt always for Δt≥0\n\nSo for Δt=0: -11≤0 and 0≤0, true\n\nΔt=1: -11+6= -5≤0, 0≤6 true\n\nΔt=2: -11+12=1>0, not ≤0\n\nSo unsafe at Δt=0 and 1, turns 72 and 73.\n\nFor freeway 7, unsafe when either car covers 0.\n\nFirst car: unsafe at Δt=8,9\n\nSecond car: unsafe at Δt=0,1\n\nSo overall unsafe at Δt=0,1,8,9 → turns 72,73,80,81.\n\nBut turn 72 is current, we are at y=0, not on freeway 7, so for future, unsafe at t=73,80,81.\n\nt=73 is future.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7, cars (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6), so same unsafe times: Δt=0,1,8,9 → turns 72,73,80,81. Unsafe for future at t=73,80,81.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, when it is unsafe to be there (x=0 covered):\n\ny=1: unsafe at t=88,89,90,91\n\ny=2: always safe\n\ny=3: always safe\n\ny=4: always safe\n\ny=5: always safe\n\ny=6: unsafe only at t=72, but since past or current, and we are not there, so always safe for t≥73\n\ny=7: unsafe at t=73,80,81\n\ny=8: unsafe at t=73,80,81\n\ny=0 and y=9: no cars, always safe.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at t=72 to y=9 at some future turn.\n\nAt t=72, I am at y=0.\n\nI need to choose actions starting from a_72 for turn 72.\n\nAction a_t at turn t affects y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t, and I take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nFor collision at turn t: I am on y_t, and if y_t between 1 and 8, and if t is unsafe for that freeway, collision.\n\ny_t is the freeway I am on at turn t.\n\nStart: t=72, y_72 = 0, which is safe.\n\nI take action a_72, which sets y_73.\n\nThen at t=73, I am at y_73, which must be safe, and so on.\n\nI need to reach y_t =9 for some t.\n\nMinimal t such that y_t=9, with t>72.\n\nThe number of turns H is such that after H actions, y_{72+H} =9.\n\ny_{72} at t=72.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t=72, y=0.\n\nAfter 1 action, at t=73, y=y_73.\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, at t=72+H, y=9.\n\nSo H is the number of steps to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal H is 9, if I go up every turn: a_t = U for t=72 to 80, then at t=81, y=9? Let's see:\n\nt=72: y=0, action U, y_73=1\n\nt=73: y=1, action U, y_74=2\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, y_{72+k} = k\n\nSet k=9, y_{81} =9.\n\nt=72+9=81, y=9.\n\nBut I need to check for each turn if I collide.\n\nNow, during this path:\n\nAt t=72: y=0, safe\n\nt=73: y=1? After action at t=72, y_73=1 (if I go up)\n\nAt t=73, I am on y=1.\n\nIs y=1 safe at t=73?\n\ny=1 unsafe at t=88,89,90,91, not at t=73, so safe.\n\nt=74: y=2, safe (y=2 always safe)\n\nt=75: y=3, safe\n\nt=76: y=4, safe\n\nt=77: y=5, safe\n\nt=78: y=6, safe (since y=6 safe for t>=73)\n\nt=79: y=7\n\nNow y=7 at t=79.\n\nIs t=79 unsafe for y=7? y=7 unsafe at t=73,80,81.\n\nt=79 not in {73,80,81}, so safe.\n\nt=80: y=8\n\ny=8 at t=80.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=73,80,81.\n\nt=80 is unsafe! So if I am on y=8 at t=80, I collide.\n\nProblem.\n\nIn the direct up path, at t=80, y=8, which is unsafe.\n\nThen t=81: y=9, safe.\n\nBut at t=80, collision.\n\nSo I cannot go directly up because at t=80, y=8 is occupied.\n\nI need to avoid that.\n\nI could go slower or faster, or change the timing.\n\nSince y=2,3,4,5 are always safe, I could stay there to adjust timing.\n\nBut I need to minimize H, so I want to go as fast as possible.\n\nMinimal H=9 might not be possible due to collision.\n\nWhat are the unsafe times for the critical freeways.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are unsafe at t=80,81.\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=73,80,81\n\ny=8 unsafe at same t=73,80,81\n\nt=73 is early, t=80,81 later.\n\nIn the direct path, I hit y=8 at t=80, which is bad.\n\nIf I go faster, but I can only go up one per turn, so minimum 9 turns to go from 0 to 9.\n\nUnless I start by staying or something, but staying would increase H.\n\nI could go up to y=5 or 6 and wait, then go up.\n\nBut that might take more turns.\n\nAnother idea: go down to y=0 and wait, but y=0 is safe, but going down from y=0 not possible, since y=0, if I go down, y=0, since min y=0.\n\ny_{t+1} = max(0, min(9, y_t + Δy)), so at y=0, D or S keeps y=0.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, U or S keeps y=9.\n\nSo I can stay at y=0 or y=9.\n\nBut staying increases time.\n\nTo reach y=9 faster, I should go up as much as possible, but avoid the collision point.\n\nThe collision is at y=8, t=80.\n\nI need not to be on y=8 at t=80 or t=81.\n\nSimilarly, for y=7 at t=80 or 81, but in the path, if I reach y=8 later.\n\nLet's list the times when I am on each y if I go directly up.\n\nAssume I start at t=72, y=0.\n\nAfter action at t=72, y_73 = y_72 + Δy, but y_72=0, if a_72=U, y_73=1\n\nThen at t=73, on y=1\n\nIf a_73=U, y_74=2, and so on.\n\nSo the time I am on y=k depends on when I arrive.\n\nDefine the turn when I first reach y=k.\n\nSince I start at y=0, and go up, I reach y=1 at t=73, y=2 at t=74, ..., y=8 at t=80, y=9 at t=81.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- At t=72, on y=0\n\n- t=73, on y=1\n\n- t=74, on y=2\n\n- t=75, on y=3\n\n- t=76, on y=4\n\n- t=77, on y=5\n\n- t=78, on y=6\n\n- t=79, on y=7\n\n- t=80, on y=8\n\n- t=81, on y=9\n\nNow, check safety:\n\nt=73: y=1, unsafe times for y=1 are t=88-91, not 73, safe.\n\nt=74: y=2, always safe\n\nt=75: y=3, safe\n\nt=76: y=4, safe\n\nt=77: y=5, safe\n\nt=78: y=6, safe for t>=73\n\nt=79: y=7, unsafe at t=73,80,81. t=79 not unsafe, safe.\n\nt=80: y=8, unsafe at t=73,80,81. t=80 unsafe! Collision.\n\nt=81: y=9, safe.\n\nSo collision at t=80.\n\nTo avoid, I need not to be on y=8 at t=80 or t=81.\n\nSimilarly, for y=7, if I am there at t=80 or 81, also unsafe, but in this path I am on y=7 at t=79, which is safe.\n\nThe problem is only at t=80 on y=8.\n\nIf I can delay being on y=8 until after t=81, or before.\n\nBut t=80 and 81 are both unsafe for y=8.\n\nUnsafe for y=8 at t=80 and 81.\n\nSo I need to be on y=8 at some t not 80 or 81.\n\nSimilarly, for y=7, unsafe at t=80,81, but also at t=73.\n\nNow, since I am going up, I will be on y=7 for one turn, y=8 for one turn, before y=9.\n\nI need to adjust when I am on y=7 and y=8.\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=7 at t=79 or earlier, or later, but t=79 is safe for y=7, as above.\n\nt=79 is safe.\n\nThen y=8 at t=80 is bad, so I need to be on y=8 at t≠80,81.\n\nBut t=82 or later, but then I reach y=9 later, increasing H.\n\nI could be on y=8 before t=80.\n\nBut to be on y=8 earlier, I need to start going up earlier, but I start from y=0 at t=72.\n\nEarliest I can be on y=8 is if I go up every turn from start: at t=80, as above.\n\nI could go slower, so I am on y=8 later.\n\nBut if I go slower, I am on y=8 later, like t=81 or later, but t=81 is unsafe for y=8.\n\nt=81 unsafe for both y=7 and y=8.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=80,81.\n\nSo if I am on y=8 at t=81, also collision.\n\nSo I need to be on y=8 at t<=79 or t>=82.\n\nt<=79: but to be on y=8 at t=79, that means at t=79, y=8.\n\nThen from y=0 at t=72, to y=8 at t=79, that is 7 steps: from t=72 to t=79, 7 actions: y from 0 to 7 in 7 steps? Let's see.\n\nAt t=72, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_72, y_73\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_78, y_79\n\nTo have y_79=8, since y_72=0, I need to increase by 8 in 7 actions? From t=72 to t=79, there are 7 actions: a_72 to a_78, determining y_73 to y_79.\n\ny_79 = y_72 + sum of Δy from t=72 to 78, 7 terms.\n\nEach Δy <=1, so max y_79 = 0 +7*1 =7, cannot reach y=8 by t=79.\n\ny_72=0\n\nAfter 1 action (a_72), y_73 <=1\n\nAfter 2 actions, y_74 <=2\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, y_{72+k} <= k\n\nTo have y_{72+k} =8, need k >=8.\n\nSimilarly, y_{72+k} =9 needs k>=9.\n\nAt turn t, y_t, after action a_t, y_{t+1}.\n\nTo be at position at time t.\n\nAt time t, y_t is the position.\n\nTo have y_t = m, for t >72.\n\nSince y_72=0, the number of up moves minus down moves from t=72 to t-1 determines y_t.\n\nFrom t=72 to t, there are (t-72) actions: a_72 to a_{t-1}, which determine y_t.\n\ny_t = y_72 + sum_{i=72}^{t-1} Δy_i = 0 + sum of Δy from i=72 to t-1.\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, so y_t between max(0, (t-72) - something) and min(9, (t-72)).\n\nBut to reach y=8, min t is when all U, y_t = t - 72.\n\nSet y_t =8, so t - 72 =8, t=80.\n\nSimilarly, y_t=9 at t=81 min.\n\nTo be on y=8 at t=80 or later.\n\nBut at t=80, unsafe; t=81, also unsafe for y=8.\n\nt=82, if I go slower.\n\nBut at t=82, y=8 might be safe, since unsafe only at 80,81.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=80,81, so for t=82, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 unsafe at t=73,80,81, so at t=82, safe.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 with minimal H.\n\nH is the number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, at t=72+H, y=9.\n\nSo I need y_{72+H} =9.\n\nThe time to reach is t=72+H.\n\nTo minimize H, but I might need to take more actions if I detour or wait.\n\nBut since y=2,3,4,5 are always safe, I can stay there to adjust timing.\n\nBut staying increases H.\n\nFirst, can I reach y=9 in H=9?\n\nThat is at t=81, y=9.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at t=81, I need to have taken 9 up moves in the actions from t=72 to t=80.\n\nActions a_72 to a_80 determine y_73 to y_81.\n\ny_81 = sum of Δy from i=72 to 80, 9 terms.\n\nTo have y_81=9, need all Δy= +1, so all actions U.\n\nThen y_t for t=73 to 81: y_73=1, y_74=2, ..., y_80=8, y_81=9.\n\nBut at t=80, y=8, unsafe, collision.\n\nIf I have one stay or down, then y_81 <9, not reach.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 at t=81 with H=9, because it requires all U, but then collision at t=80.\n\nThus H=9 is impossible.\n\nNow H=10: reach y=9 at t=82.\n\nAfter 10 actions, at t=82, y=9.\n\nSo y_82=9.\n\nNow, I need to have sum of Δy from i=72 to 81 equal to 9.\n\nSince 10 actions, sum must be 9, so net +9, meaning 9 up and 1 stay, or 10 up but min y, but y from 0 to 9, with 10 actions, I can have one stay or one down, but if one down, sum <=8, y_82<=8<9, cannot reach y=9.\n\ny_82 = sum_{i=72}^{81} Δy_i\n\nEach Δy_i in {-1,0,1}, y_72=0.\n\ny_82 = sum of 10 terms, each -1,0,1.\n\nTo have y_82=9, need sum=9, so all Δy_i must be +1 except one that is 0, or all +1 but since 10 terms, all +1 would give y_82=10>9, not possible since y<=9.\n\ny_82 = y_72 + sum_{i=72}^{81} Δy_i = 0 + sum of 10 Δy.\n\nIf all Δy=+1, y_82=10, but y=10>9, not allowed, so must be capped at 9, but in the movement, y_{t+1} = min(9, max(0, y_t + Δy)), so if y_t=8 and U, y_{t+1}=9; if y_t=9 and U, y_{t+1}=9.\n\nSimilarly for down.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I can reach it earlier and stay, but for minimal H, I want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nFor H=10, at t=82, y=9.\n\nI need to have y_82=9, which requires that in the 10 actions, the number of U minus number of D equals 9, but since y from 0 to 9, net change +9.\n\nNumber of U, S, D actions.\n\nLet U be number of up, D down, S stay, U + D + S =10\n\nNet change: U - D =9\n\nAlso, since y stays within 0 to 9, no problem at boundaries if we don't go beyond.\n\nThen U - D =9, U + D + S =10\n\nAdd: 2U + S =19, so S =19 - 2U, which must be non-negative.\n\nAlso, from U - D =9, D = U -9\n\nD >=0, so U >=9\n\nThen S =19 - 2U\n\nIf U=9, D=0, S=19-18=1\n\nIf U=10, D=1, S=19-20=-1<0 impossible\n\nSo only possibility: U=9, D=0, S=1\n\nSo 9 up, 1 stay, 0 down.\n\nI need to have one stay action somewhere.\n\nThe stay action can be used to adjust timing.\n\nNow, I need to avoid being on y=8 at t=80 or t=81.\n\nSimilarly, not on y=7 at t=80 or 81, but y=7 also unsafe at those times.\n\nIn the sequence, I will be on y=7 and y=8 at some points.\n\nNow, with one stay, I can delay the ascent.\n\nFor example, I can stay at some safe y to avoid being on y=8 at t=80.\n\nSince y=2,3,4,5 are always safe, I can stay there for one turn.\n\nNow, the critical times are t=80 and 81 for y=7 and y=8.\n\nI need to ensure that when t=80, I am not on y=7 or y=8, and similarly for t=81.\n\nBut at t=81, if I reach y=9, I am not on y=7 or 8.\n\nLet's list the times I am on each y.\n\nSuppose I go up as before, but insert a stay somewhere.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 at the beginning.\n\nt=72: y=0, action S, then y_73=0\n\nt=73: y=0, action U, y_74=1\n\nt=74: y=1, U, y_75=2\n\n...\n\nthen y_t at t=74:1, t=75:2, t=76:3, t=77:4, t=78:5, t=79:6, t=80:7, t=81:8, t=82:9\n\nNow, at t=80: y=7, but y=7 unsafe at t=80, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf I stay later.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=5 and stay there.\n\ny=5 always safe.\n\nStart: t=72: y=0, U, y_73=1\n\nt=73: y=1, U, y_74=2\n\nt=74: y=2, U, y_75=3\n\nt=75: y=3, U, y_76=4\n\nt=76: y=4, U, y_77=5\n\nt=77: y=5, now action S, y_78=5\n\nt=78: y=5, U, y_79=6\n\nt=79: y=6, U, y_80=7\n\nt=80: y=7, but t=80 y=7 unsafe! collision.\n\nStill bad.\n\nAt t=77 y=5, U to y=6 at t=78.\n\nThen t=78: y=6, U, y_79=7\n\nt=79: y=7, U, y_80=8\n\nBut t=79 y=7: is it safe? y=7 unsafe at t=73,80,81. t=79 not in, so safe.\n\nt=80: y=8, unsafe, collision.\n\nSame issue.\n\nWith the stay, I can be at y=6 later.\n\nAnother idea: go up faster initially? But I can't, max one up per turn.\n\nPerhaps go down somewhere, but with D=0, I cannot go down.\n\nIn this case, I have no down actions, only up and one stay.\n\nSo I must have the stay at some point.\n\nNow, to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at t=80.\n\nSimilarly, at t=81, if I am on y=8, unsafe, or on y=7, unsafe.\n\nBut at t=81, if I am at y=8, that would be on the way to y=9 at t=82.\n\ny_82=9.\n\nAt t=81, y_81 could be 8 or 9 or less.\n\nSince y_82=9, and action at t=81, if y_81=8, a_81=U, y_82=9; if y_81=9, a_81=S or U, y_82=9.\n\nBut if y_81=9, then I reached earlier, but with H=10, I need y_82=9, so y_81 could be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_81=9, then I reached at t=81, but with H=9 actions? Let's not confuse.\n\nt=72+H is the time when y=9.\n\nWith H actions, at time t=72+H, y=9.\n\nFor H=10, t=82, y=9.\n\nAt time t=81, I am at y_81, which is before the last action.\n\ny_81 could be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_81=8, then action U to y_82=9.\n\nIf y_81=9, then action S to y_82=9.\n\nNow, at t=81, if y_81=8, then I am on y=8 at t=81, which is unsafe.\n\nIf y_81=9, then on y=9, safe.\n\nBut y=9 is always safe.\n\nTo avoid collision at t=81, I need y_81 not on y=7 or 8, or on y=9.\n\nSimilarly for t=80.\n\nFor t=80, I need not on y=7 or 8.\n\nWith one stay, I can shift the times.\n\nLet me define the time when I am on y=7 and y=8.\n\nSuppose I have 9 up and 1 stay in 10 actions.\n\nThe stay can be at any of the 10 positions in the sequence.\n\nThe actions are from t=72 to t=81 for determining y_73 to y_82.\n\nActions: a_72 to a_81, 10 actions.\n\ny_73 to y_82.\n\ny_72=0.\n\ny_73 = y_72 + Δy_72\n\n...\n\ny_82 = y_81 + Δy_81\n\nBut y_82 =9.\n\nThe position at each time depends on the actions.\n\nLet s be the turn when I take the stay action.\n\nFor example, if I take S at some turn, it delays the increase.\n\nThe time I reach each level is delayed if I stay before.\n\nLet t_k be the turn when I first reach y=k.\n\nSince I start from y=0, and go up with one stay, I will reach y=1 at some turn, etc.\n\nEarliest t_k = 72 + k for k=1 to 8, but with stay, later.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 at t=72, then t_1 =73, t_2=74, ..., t_8=80, t_9=81? But y_9 at t=81, but with stay, if stay at t=72, y_73=0, then U at t=73, y_74=1, so t_1=74, t_2=75, ..., t_8=81, t_9=82.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay later.\n\nGenerally, with one stay, the first time I reach y=m is at turn 72 + m + d, where d=0 or 1 depending on when I stay.\n\nIf I never stay before reaching m, t_m =72+m.\n\nIf I stay at some y< m before, then t_m =72+m+1.\n\nSince I stay once, the stay adds one turn delay for all subsequent levels.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=j for some j, then for k>j, t_k is increased by 1.\n\nt_k = 72 + k if no stay before k, or 72+k+1 if stay before k.\n\nWith one stay, the sequence has one S and 9 U.\n\nThe time I spend on each level: I am on each y from 0 to 9 for at least one turn, except possibly if I stay multiple times at one level, but with one stay, I might stay at one level, so that level has two turns, others one turn each.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=5, then I am on y=5 for two turns, and other y for one turn each.\n\nThe turns: from y=0 to y=9, 10 levels, but I start at y=0, end at y=9, so I visit 10 positions, but with 10 actions, I have 11 positions from y_72 to y_82.\n\ny_72, y_73, ..., y_82, 11 positions.\n\ny_72=0, y_82=9.\n\nThe values increase from 0 to 9 with 10 steps, net +9, so exactly 9 increases and one stay, no decrease.\n\nSo the path: start y=0, then after actions, y increases to 9 with exactly one stay at some level.\n\nFor example, I stay at some y=s for one extra turn.\n\nSo I am on y=s for two consecutive turns, and on other y for one turn each.\n\nThe time when I am on each y.\n\nThe first time I reach y=k is at some turn, and I leave at next turn if I move up.\n\nBut when I stay, I am at that y for two turns.\n\nNow, the critical part is to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at t=80 or t=81.\n\nt=80 and t=81 are consecutive.\n\nSince y=7 and 8 are adjacent, it might be tight.\n\nList the possible times for being on y=7 and y=8.\n\nThe turn when I am on y=7: it could be t=79, or 80, or 81, etc., depending on the stay.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nWith H=10, t from 72 to 82.\n\ny_72=0\n\ny_82=9\n\nThe time I am on y=7: since I go from 6 to 7 to 8, or stay at 7.\n\nSimilarly for 8.\n\nLet t7 be the turn when I am on y=7.\n\nIt must be between min and max.\n\nEarliest t7: if no stay before, t7=79 (y_79=7 if all U to that point)\n\ny_72=0, all U: y_73=1, y_74=2, ..., y_79=7, so at t=79, y=7.\n\nLatest t7: if I stay early, e.g., stay at y=0 at t=72, then y_73=0, y_74=1, ..., y_80=7, so at t=80, y=7.\n\nIf I stay at y=6, for example, then y=7 at t=80 or later.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nEarliest t8: t=80 if no stay before.\n\nLatest t8: if stay early, t=81.\n\nNow, for y=7, t7 can be 79,80, or 81 if I stay at 7.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nBut I must avoid t=80 and t=81 for both y=7 and y=8.\n\nAt t=80, I cannot be on y=7 or 8.\n\nAt t=81, cannot be on y=7 or 8.\n\nBut at t=81, if I am on y=8, it is unsafe, but if I am on y=9, safe.\n\nNow, for t=80, I need to be on y <=6 or y=9, but y=9 only at later turns, so at t=80, y<=6 or y>=9, but y=9 not yet, so y<=6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=81, I need to be on y<=6 or y=9.\n\nBecause if on y=7 or 8, unsafe.\n\nWith the path to y=9 at t=82, at t=81, y_81 could be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_81=8, then at t=81 on y=8, unsafe if t=81.\n\nt=81 is unsafe for y=8.\n\nSo I must have y_81=9, so that at t=81 on y=9, safe.\n\nThen action at t=81 is S, to keep y_82=9.\n\nSimilarly, at t=80, I need y_80 <=6.\n\nBecause if y_80=7 or 8, unsafe at t=80.\n\nIf y_80=6 or less, safe.\n\nNow, with the actions.\n\ny_82=9.\n\ny_81 must be 9, so that at t=81 on y=9.\n\nThen action at t=81 is S.\n\ny_80 must be <=6.\n\ny_80 <=6.\n\nNow, from y_72=0 to y_82=9 with 10 actions, 9 up and 1 stay.\n\nSince y_81=9, and y_82=9, action at t=81 is S.\n\ny_80 <=6.\n\ny_80 to y_81: if y_80 <=6, and y_81=9, then Δy_81 = y_81 - y_80 >= 9-6=3, but Δy can only be -1,0,1, impossible!\n\ny_81 - y_80 = Δy_80, which is in {-1,0,1}, so |y_81 - y_80| <=1.\n\nBut if y_81=9 and y_80<=6, then y_81 - y_80 >=3 >1, impossible.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to have y_81=9 and y_80<=6.\n\nBecause y can only change by at most 1 per turn.\n\nSo my assumption is wrong.\n\nI cannot have both y_81=9 and y_80<=6.\n\nTherefore, for H=10, I cannot avoid the issue; either at t=80 or t=81, I might be on y=7 or 8.\n\nSpecifically, since y_80 and y_81 differ by at most 1, if y_80 <=6, then y_81 <=7, but I need y_81=9 for safety at t=81, which requires y_81=9, but y_81<=7 if y_80<=6, contradiction.\n\nIf y_80 >=7, then at t=80, if y_80=7 or 8, unsafe.\n\nIf y_80=9, but y=9 at t=80 only if I reached earlier, but with H=10, y_82=9, so y_80 <=8, since at most 8 after 8 actions? Let's see.\n\ny_80 = sum of Δy from i=72 to 79, 8 actions.\n\nMax y_80=8, min 0.\n\nSo y_80 <=8.\n\nIf y_80=7 or 8, and at t=80, unsafe if on y=7 or 8.\n\nIf y_80=6 or less, safe at t=80.\n\nThen y_81 = y_80 + Δy_80 <=6+1=7 or >=5-1=4, say, so y_81 <=7.\n\nBut I need y_81=9 for safety at t=81, but y_81<=7<9, impossible.\n\nTherefore, for H=10, it is impossible to have both t=80 and t=81 safe while reaching y=9 at t=82.\n\nSpecifically, I cannot have y_81=9 with y_80<=6.\n\nAnd if y_80>=7, it may be unsafe at t=80.\n\nThen at t=81, if y_81=8, unsafe; if y_81=7, also unsafe at t=81 for y=7.\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=81.\n\nSo if y_81=7 or 8, unsafe at t=81.\n\nIf y_81=9, safe, but as above, only possible if y_80=8 or 9, but y_80=9 not possible with 8 actions, y_80<=8.\n\nIf y_80=8, then y_81=9 with U, or 8 with S, etc.\n\nBut if y_80=8, at t=80 on y=8, unsafe.\n\nThen y_81=9 with U, at t=81 on y=9, safe, but at t=80 collision.\n\nIf y_80=7, at t=80 on y=7, if t=80 unsafe, collision.\n\nThen y_81=8 or 7 or 6, etc.\n\nBut y_81 not 9, so y_82 not 9 if I need to reach.\n\nWith H=10, y_82=9, so y_81 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_81=8, at t=81 on y=8, unsafe.\n\nIf y_81=9, at t=81 on y=9, safe, but requires y_80=8 or 9, but y_80=8 or 9, if 8, unsafe at t=80; if 9, not possible.\n\ny_80=9 only if I reached earlier, but with 8 actions from t=72, max y_80=8.\n\nSo y_80<=8.\n\nIf y_80=8, unsafe at t=80 if on y=8.\n\nIf y_80=7, and if t=80 unsafe for y=7, collision.\n\nBut t=80 is unsafe for y=7.\n\nSo in all cases for H=10, I must have a collision at t=80 or t=81.\n\nTherefore, H=10 is also impossible.\n\nNow, try H=11.\n\nReach y=9 at t=83.\n\nAfter 11 actions, at t=83, y=9.\n\nThen y_83=9.\n\nNumber of actions: 11, from a_72 to a_82.\n\ny_83 = sum of Δy from i=72 to 82, 11 terms.\n\nNet change +9, so U - D =9, U + D + S =11.\n\nThen 2U + S =20, S=20-2U\n\nU - D =9, D= U-9\n\nD>=0, U>=9\n\nS=20-2U\n\nU=9, D=0, S=2\n\nU=10, D=1, S=0\n\nU=11, D=2, S=20-22=-2 impossible\n\nSo possibilities: (U=9, D=0, S=2) or (U=10, D=1, S=0)\n\nFirst case: 9 up, 2 stay, 0 down\n\nSecond case: 10 up, 1 down, 0 stay\n\nNow, I can use the stays or down to adjust timing.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at t=80 and t=81.\n\nt=80 and 81 are the critical times.\n\nAt t=80, I need to be on y <=6 or y=9, but y=9 not yet, so y<=6.\n\nSimilarly at t=81, on y<=6 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 possible at t=81 with H=11? t=83 is y=9, so at t=81, y_81 <=8 or so.\n\nLet's set y_80 <=6 and y_81 <=6 or y_81=9, but y_81=9 only if I reach early, but with 9 actions, max y_81=9, but if y_81=9, then I reached at t=81 with fewer actions, but for H=11, I can have y_81=9, then stay or something.\n\nBut let's first try to have y_80 <=6 and y_81 <=6, so that at both times, I am on safe y, since y<=6 are safe for t=80,81 except y=6 is always safe, y=5 safe, etc.\n\ny=1 to 6: y=1 unsafe only at t=88-91, not 80,81; y=2-5 always safe; y=6 always safe for t>=73.\n\nSo y<=6 are all safe at t=80,81.\n\nSimilarly, if I am on y=9, safe.\n\nBut at t=80 and 81, y=9 not reached yet with H=11, since t=83.\n\nSo for safety at t=80 and t=81, I need to be on y<=6.\n\nThen at other times, I need to go up to 9.\n\nNow, with U=10, D=1, S=0 or U=9,S=2,D=0.\n\nFirst, let's try to have two stays.\n\nI can stay at some safe levels to spend time.\n\nFor example, stay at y=5 or y=6 for two turns.\n\nThen I can be on y=7 and y=8 after t=81.\n\nFor instance, suppose I want to be on y=7 after t=81, say at t=82 or later.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nt=82 or later.\n\nNow, y=7 and 8 unsafe only at t=80,81, so for t>=82, safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=73 is past.\n\nSo if I can be on y=7 and y=8 at t>=82, safe.\n\nAnd reach y=9 at t=83.\n\nWith two stays, I can delay.\n\nFor example, start from t=72, y=0.\n\nI need to have y_80 <=6 and y_81 <=6.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=5 and stay there for two turns.\n\ny=5 always safe.\n\nFrom y=0, to reach y=5, it takes 5 up moves.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=72: y=0, U, y_73=1\n\nt=73: y=1, U, y_74=2\n\nt=74: y=2, U, y_75=3\n\nt=75: y=3, U, y_76=4\n\nt=76: y=4, U, y_77=5\n\nNow at t=77, y=5, I can stay: action S, y_78=5\n\nt=78: y=5, stay again, action S, y_79=5\n\nt=79: y=5, U, y_80=6\n\nt=80: y=6, U, y_81=7\n\nt=81: y=7, U, y_82=8\n\nt=82: y=8, U, y_83=9\n\nNow, check safety:\n\nt=80: y=6, safe (y=6 always safe)\n\nt=81: y=7, but t=81 is unsafe for y=7! Collision.\n\nBecause y=7 unsafe at t=81.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt t=81, y=7, unsafe.\n\nI need y_81 <=6.\n\nBut in above, y_81=7.\n\nIf at t=79, I go to y=6, but let's see.\n\nt=79: y=5, U, y_80=6\n\nt=80: y=6, now if I stay, y_81=6\n\nThen t=81: y=6, safe\n\nThen U, y_82=7\n\nt=82: y=7, U, y_83=8? But I need y_83=9.\n\ny_82=7, U to y_83=8, not 9.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at t=83.\n\nIn this case, at t=83, y=8, not 9.\n\nI need another up.\n\nSequence: from t=79: y=5, U, y_80=6\n\nt=80: y=6, S, y_81=6\n\nt=81: y=6, U, y_82=7\n\nt=82: y=7, U, y_83=8\n\nBut y_83=8, not 9.

H=11 we saw impossible, so 12 is minimal.\n\nIn the sequence, I used three stays at y=5.\n\nI could have fewer stays with a down, but H=12 with three stays works.\n\nThe minimal H is 12.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the sequence of actions from t=72 to t=72+H-1, which is t=72 to 83.\n\nH=12 actions: from a_72 to a_83.\n\nIn the sequence above, actions from t=72 to t=83.\n\nt=72: U\n\nt=73: U\n\nt=74: U\n\nt=75: U\n\nt=76: U\n\nt=77: S\n\nt=78: S\n\nt=79: S\n\nt=80: U\n\nt=81: U\n\nt=82: U\n\nt=83: U\n\nAnd position at t=84: y=9.\n\nIn the action list, it should be up to turn t=83 for the last action.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can reach with H=11 using down.\n\nSuppose U=10, D=1, S=0.\n\n10 up, 1 down.\n\nNet +9.\n\nFor example, go up to y=7, down to y=6, then up to 9.\n\nBut at t=81 might be on y=7.\n\nSet times.\n\nSuppose:\n\nt=72: U, y73=1\n\n73: U, y74=2\n\n74: U, y75=3\n\n75: U, y76=4\n\n76: U, y77=5\n\n77: U, y78=6\n\n78: U, y79=7\n\n79: D, y80=6  // down to 6\n\n80: U, y81=7  // up to 7, but t=81 y=7 unsafe\n\nIf at t=80, S, y81=6, then y81=6, safe\n\nThen t=81: U, y82=7\n\nt=82: U, y83=8, not 9.\n\nNeed y83=9, so from y81=6, to y83=9, need +3 in 2 actions, impossible.\n\nIf I go down earlier.\n\nt=77: at y=5, D, y78=4\n\n78: U, y79=5\n\n79: U, y80=6\n\n80: U, y81=7  // unsafe at t=81\n\nStill.\n\nt=80: D, y81=6, then y81=6, safe\n\nThen t=81: U, y82=7\n\nt=82: U, y83=8\n\nt=83: U, y84=9, but for H=11, we need at t=83 y=9, but with actions to a82, y83=9? For H=11, at t=72+11=83, y=9.\n\nActions a72 to a82, 11 actions, y83=9.\n\nIn this case, from above, if y81=6, a81=U, y82=7\n\na82=U, y83=8<9, not 9.\n\nTo reach y83=9, need y82=8 or 9.\n\nBut from y81=6, y82<=7.\n\nIf y81=7, unsafe.\n\nSo impossible for H=11.\n\nSimilarly, with stays, same issue.\n\nThus minimal H=12.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: S\n\nTurn 78: S\n\nTurn 79: S\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nAfter a83, at t=84, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=72 to t=83, 12 actions.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nt_1=72.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: S\n\nTurn 78: S\n\nTurn 79: S\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nAnd that should be it.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 72\\) is 12.

We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nPlayer movement: \n  - U: y increases by 1 (up)\n  - D: y decreases by 1 (down)\n  - S: stay (y remains)\n\nConstraints: \n  - y must be in [0,9]. So we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nCollision condition:\n  - At turn T, if the player is at (0, y_T) and there is a car on freeway y_T such that 0 (the x-coordinate) is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nImportant note: \n  - When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on freeway y_T for the entire turn T. \n    So at turn T, we check the car on freeway y_T. We are not on freeway y_{T+1} until the next turn (T+1).\n\nCar update:\n  - Left-moving: span moves left (decreasing x) by s per turn.\n  - Right-moving: span moves right (increasing x) by s per turn.\n\nGiven car states at turn t1=78:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -59, right, 3) -> wait, note that for a right-moving car, the head should be greater than the tail? \nBut the data says: head=-48, tail=-59? and direction right? That would imply the car is moving to the right, but -48 is to the right of -59? \nActually, the representation might be: \n  For a right-moving car: [tail, head] with tail <= head? But here we have head=-48 and tail=-59 -> so the car spans from -59 to -48? \nBut the update rule for right-moving: \n  Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)] \n  Initially at t1: [tau, head] = [-59, -48]? But wait, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and then Span(T)=[tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo for freeway 1: \n  Car: head = -48, tail = -59, direction=right, speed=3.\n  So at t1=78, the car is at [tau, head] = [-59, -48]. \n  Then at a future turn T, the car will be at:\n      [ -59 + 3*(T-78), -48 + 3*(T-78) ]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 6,7,8 we have multiple cars.\n\nOur goal: go from y=0 (at turn 78) to y=9 (at some turn) without colliding.\n\nWe are to minimize H (the number of turns, so from turn 78 to turn 78+H-1, we have H actions: from t=0 to t=H-1 in the sequence, meaning the last action is at turn 78+H-1 and then we are at y=9 at that turn).\n\nWe can plan a path that might go up and down to avoid cars.\n\nWe note that the grid has 10 rows (y=0 to 9). We start at y=0 and must get to y=9.\n\nWe are only concerned with freeways 1 to 8 (for collisions) because y=0 and y=9 have no cars? The problem says \"freeways y=1,...,8\". So at y=0 and y=9, there are no cars? Then we are safe at y=0 and y=9? \n\nBut note: the collision condition says: at turn T, if we are at y_T and there is a car on freeway y_T such that 0 is in the car's span. \nBut if we are at y=0 (at some turn), then we are on freeway 0? But the problem says cars are on freeways y=1 to 8. So freeway 0 and 9 have no cars? \n\nTherefore, we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: we start at y=0 (safe) and we need to get to y=9 (safe) by passing through the dangerous freeways 1-8 without being at a freeway when a car is covering x=0 at that turn.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nApproach:\n  We can do a BFS (breadth-first search) over states (turn, y) and check for collisions. However, note that the turn number can be large? But the minimal H might be small? We start at y=0 and must get to y=9: at least 9 moves (if we go up 9 times) but we can also move down? But we want minimal turns, so we probably want to go up as much as possible.\n\nHowever, we have to avoid collisions. We can also stay (S) to wait for a car to pass.\n\nThe cars are moving continuously. We have to compute for each freeway and each car, the times (turns) at which the car covers x=0.\n\nBut note: the car spans are moving at constant speed. For a car on freeway k:\n\n  For a right-moving car: \n      The span at time T (relative to t1=78) is [tau + s*(T-78), head + s*(T-78)]\n\n  We require that 0 is in [tau + s*(T-78), head + s*(T-78)]?\n      => tau + s*(T-78) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-78)\n\n  Solve for T: \n      T >= ( - tau ) / s + 78   [from the left bound: tau + s*(T-78) <= 0 -> T-78 <= -tau/s -> T <= 78 - tau/s? Wait, note: tau is negative? Let me see the numbers.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving? But in this problem, all cars are right-moving? The directions are all \"right\".\n\nSo all cars are moving to the right.\n\nLet me list the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: tail=-59, head=-48, s=3, right.\n  The car covers x=0 when:\n      -59 + 3*(T-78) <= 0 <= -48 + 3*(T-78)\n      => 3*(T-78) >= 59? -> T-78 >= 59/3 ≈ 19.666 -> T>=78+20 = 98 (since T integer) for the left bound? \n      Actually: \n        Lower bound: -59 + 3*(T-78) <= 0  => 3*(T-78) <= 59 -> T-78 <= 59/3 ≈ 19.666 -> T <= 78+19 = 97? \n        Upper bound: 0 <= -48 + 3*(T-78) => 3*(T-78) >= 48 -> T-78>=16 -> T>=94.\n\n      So the car covers 0 from T=94 to T=97? \n\n      Let me check at T=94:\n          Lower bound: -59 + 3*(16) = -59+48 = -11 <=0 -> true\n          Upper bound: -48 + 48 = 0 -> 0<=0 -> true -> so at T=94, the car is at [-11,0]? \n          Actually: the car at T=94: \n            [ -59 + 3*(94-78) = -59+3*16 = -59+48 = -11, \n              -48 + 48 = 0 ]\n          So x=0 is the rightmost point -> covered.\n\n      At T=97: \n          [ -59 + 3*19 = -59+57 = -2, -48+57=9] -> 0 is in [-2,9] -> covered.\n\n      At T=98: \n          [ -59+3*20 = -59+60=1, -48+60=12] -> 0 is not in [1,12] -> not covered.\n\n      So the car covers freeway 1 from T=94 to T=97.\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (48,37,right,12) -> wait, head=48, tail=37? But for right-moving, we have [tau, head] and tau should be the tail? \n  But the representation is: (head, tail, direction, speed) -> so head=48, tail=37? \n  But that would be a car from 37 to 48? Then moving right at speed 12.\n\n  However, note: the update rule says for right: [tau, head] -> [tau + s*dT, head + s*dT]\n  So at T: [37+12*(T-78), 48+12*(T-78)]\n\n  When does it cover 0?\n      37+12*(T-78) <= 0 <= 48+12*(T-78)\n      Solve:\n        Left: 12*(T-78) <= -37 -> T-78 <= -37/12 ≈ -3.08 -> T <= 74.92 -> so T<=74? \n        Right: 0 <= 48+12*(T-78) -> 12*(T-78) >= -48 -> T-78>=-4 -> T>=74.\n\n      So at T=74: \n        [37+12*(74-78)=37+12*(-4)=37-48=-11, 48-48=0] -> 0 is the right endpoint -> covered.\n      T=75: [37+12*(-3)=37-36=1, 48-36=12] -> 0 not covered.\n\n      But note: we are starting at turn 78. So T>=78. \n      For T>=78: \n        Left bound: 37+12*(T-78) >= 37 (at T=78) and increasing -> always >0? \n        So 0 is never covered for T>=78? \n\n      Therefore, freeway 2 is safe at all times T>=78.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 3,4,5: same as freeway 2? \n  They all have (48,37,right,12) -> same as above. So safe.\n\nFreeway 6: two cars.\n  First car: (48,37,right,12) -> same as above: safe for T>=78.\n  Second car: (0, -11, right, 12) -> \n        [tau, head] = [-11, 0]? \n        Update: [-11+12*(T-78), 0+12*(T-78)]\n\n        Cover 0 when: \n            -11+12*(T-78) <= 0 <= 12*(T-78)\n            Left: 12*(T-78) <= 11 -> T-78 <= 11/12 < 1 -> T<=78 (but we are at T>=78)\n            Right: 0 <= 12*(T-78) -> T>=78.\n\n        At T=78: \n            [-11+0, 0] = [-11,0] -> 0 is the right endpoint -> covered? \n            But note: the condition is 0 in [-11,0] -> yes, 0 is included.\n\n        At T=79: \n            [-11+12, 12] = [1,12] -> 0 not covered.\n\n        So the second car covers freeway 6 only at T=78.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars.\n  First car: (-48,-59,right,6) -> \n        [tau, head] = [-59, -48]? \n        Then: [-59+6*(T-78), -48+6*(T-78)]\n        Cover 0 when: \n            -59+6*(T-78) <= 0 <= -48+6*(T-78)\n            Left: 6*(T-78) <= 59 -> T-78 <= 59/6 ≈9.83 -> T<=78+9=87\n            Right: 0 <= -48+6*(T-78) -> 6*(T-78)>=48 -> T-78>=8 -> T>=86.\n\n        So covered from T=86 to T=87? \n        Check:\n          T=86: [-59+6*8 = -59+48=-11, -48+48=0] -> 0 included.\n          T=87: [-59+6*9=-59+54=-5, -48+54=6] -> 0 included? yes.\n\n        Actually T=88: [-59+60=1, -48+60=12] -> 0 not included.\n\n        So covered at T=86,87.\n\n  Second car: (0,-11,right,6) -> \n        [tau, head] = [-11,0]\n        Then: [-11+6*(T-78), 0+6*(T-78)]\n        Cover 0 when: \n            -11+6*(T-78) <= 0 <= 6*(T-78)\n            Left: 6*(T-78)<=11 -> T-78<=11/6≈1.83 -> T<=79.83 -> so T=78,79\n            Right: 0<=6*(T-78) -> T>=78.\n\n        So covered at T=78 and T=79? \n          T=78: [-11,0] -> 0 included.\n          T=79: [-11+6, 6] = [-5,6] -> 0 included? yes.\n          T=80: [-11+12,12] = [1,12] -> 0 not.\n\n        So covered at T=78,79.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7? \n  First car: (-48,-59,right,6) -> covered at T=86,87\n  Second car: (0,-11,right,6) -> covered at T=78,79.\n\nSummary of dangerous times (when a car is at x=0 on a freeway) for T>=78:\n\nFreeway 1: T=94,95,96,97\nFreeway 2: never (for T>=78)\nFreeway 3: never\nFreeway 4: never\nFreeway 5: never\nFreeway 6: \n   first car: never (for T>=78) \n   second car: T=78\nFreeway 7: \n   first car: T=86,87\n   second car: T=78,79\nFreeway 8:\n   first car: T=86,87\n   second car: T=78,79\n\nSo per freeway, the dangerous turns:\n\nFreeway 1: [94,97] (i.e., 94,95,96,97)\nFreeway 6: {78}\nFreeway 7: {78,79,86,87}\nFreeway 8: {78,79,86,87}\n\nWe are at turn 78 at y=0. We want to go to y=9.\n\nWe are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nWe need to plan a path that avoids being at a freeway k on a dangerous turn for that freeway.\n\nWe can use BFS in terms of (turn, y). The state is (turn, y). The actions: U, D, S.\n\nThe turn starts at 78 and we go until we reach y=9.\n\nWe note that we can also move down to y=0 (safe) or up to y=9 (safe). But we want minimal turns.\n\nWe must avoid:\n\n  At freeway 1: turns 94,95,96,97 -> so we cannot be at freeway 1 at these turns.\n\n  At freeway 6: turn 78 -> so we cannot be at freeway 6 at turn 78.\n\n  At freeway 7: turns 78,79,86,87.\n\n  At freeway 8: turns 78,79,86,87.\n\nWe start at turn 78, y=0 (safe). \n\nWhat can we do at turn 78?\n  Actions: U, D, S.\n\n  If we do U: then at turn 78 we move to y=1? \n      But note: at turn 78, we are on freeway 0? Actually, we start at (0,0) -> freeway 0? \n      Then we move to freeway 1? \n      But the rule: when we move at turn 78, we are still at freeway 0 during turn 78? \n      The note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". \n\n      So at turn 78, we are at y=0 -> freeway 0 -> safe.\n\n      Then at the next turn (turn 79) we will be at y=1? But wait, the update: \n          y_{79} = y_{78} + Delta y_{78} = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\n      So at turn 79, we are at y=1 -> freeway 1? \n\n      But freeway 1 is dangerous only at turns 94-97? So at turn 79, freeway 1 is safe? \n\n      Therefore, moving U at turn 78: \n          turn78: y=0 -> safe (freeway0)\n          turn79: y=1 -> freeway1: safe (because dangerous at 94-97, not 79)\n\n  If we do S: then at turn78 we are at y=0 -> safe. Then at turn79 we are still at y=0 -> safe.\n\n  If we do D: we try to go down to y=-1 -> but not allowed? because y must be in [0,9]. So we cannot go below 0? \n          y_{79} = 0 - 1 = -1 -> invalid. So D is not allowed.\n\nSo at turn78, we can do U or S.\n\nBut note: we cannot do S forever. We want minimal turns.\n\nWe need to avoid freeway 6 at turn78? But we are at y=0 at turn78, so we are safe.\n\nNow, if we do U at turn78, then at turn79 we are at y=1 (freeway1) and freeway1 is safe at turn79.\n\nWe can then continue up? \n\nBut we also have to avoid freeways 7 and 8 at turns 78,79,86,87? \n\nBut freeways 7 and 8 are at y=7 and y=8. We are currently at y=1 at turn79. We have time until turn86 to avoid being at y=7 or y=8? \n\nWe must get to y=9. The minimal moves without waiting is 9 moves (all U). Then we would be at y=9 at turn78+9 = turn87.\n\nBut let's check the path for the 9-move plan:\n\n  Turn78: U -> y=1 at turn79? \n      Actually: \n        Turn78: action U -> at turn78 we are at y=0 (safe). Then at the end of the turn, we update to y=1 for the next turn.\n        So at turn79, we are at y=1.\n\n  Turn79: U -> at turn79 we are at freeway1? safe. Then at turn80 we are at y=2.\n\n  Turn80: U -> y=3 at turn81.\n\n  Turn81: U -> y=4 at turn82.\n\n  Turn82: U -> y=5 at turn83.\n\n  Turn83: U -> y=6 at turn84.\n\n  Turn84: U -> y=7 at turn85.\n\n  Turn85: U -> y=8 at turn86.\n\n  Turn86: U -> y=9 at turn87.\n\nNow, we must check collisions at each step:\n\n  Turn78: y=0 -> safe.\n  Turn79: y=1 -> freeway1: safe (dangerous only at 94-97) -> safe.\n  Turn80: y=2 -> freeway2: safe (always safe) -> safe.\n  Turn81: y=3 -> freeway3: safe -> safe.\n  Turn82: y=4 -> freeway4: safe -> safe.\n  Turn83: y=5 -> freeway5: safe -> safe.\n  Turn84: y=6 -> freeway6: \n        We are at freeway6 at turn84. \n        Dangerous at freeway6: only turn78? So turn84 is safe.\n  Turn85: y=7 -> freeway7: \n        Dangerous at freeway7: turns 78,79,86,87 -> turn85 is safe? \n        But note: 85 is not in {78,79,86,87} -> safe.\n  Turn86: y=8 -> freeway8: \n        Dangerous at freeway8: turns 78,79,86,87 -> turn86 is dangerous! \n        So at turn86, we are at freeway8 and a car is at x=0? \n        For freeway8: \n          first car: (-48,-59,right,6): at turn86: \n              [ -59 + 6*(86-78) = -59 + 6*8 = -59+48 = -11, -48+48=0] -> so 0 is included? \n          second car: (0,-11,right,6): at turn86: \n              [ -11 + 6*8 = -11+48=37, 0+48=48] -> 0 not included? \n        But the first car covers 0 at turn86? \n          The span is [-11,0] -> so 0 is included. \n        Therefore, we collide at turn86.\n\n  So we cannot be at freeway8 at turn86.\n\nTherefore, the direct 9-move plan fails at turn86.\n\nWe need to adjust.\n\nWe have two options:\n  Option 1: Slow down so that we are at freeway8 at a safe time (not 86 or 87). The next safe time for freeway8? \n        The dangerous times are 78,79,86,87. So after 87, the next? \n        For freeway8: \n          first car: covered at 86,87 -> then after 87, the car moves beyond? \n          second car: only at 78,79 -> so after 79, freeway8 is safe until 86? \n          But 80 to 85 are safe? \n          However, the first car is dangerous at 86,87 -> so from 88 onward, freeway8 is safe? \n\n        But we want to minimize turns. We are at turn86 we are at y=8 and we want to avoid being there at 86 and 87. \n        So we could wait at y=7 for two turns? Then we would be at y=7 at turn85 and turn86? \n        Then at turn86: we are at y=7 -> freeway7? \n        But freeway7 is dangerous at 86? \n          Freeway7: dangerous at 78,79,86,87 -> so at turn86, if we are at freeway7, we collide? \n          Because the first car at freeway7 at turn86: \n             [ -59 + 6*(86-78) = -59+48=-11, -48+48=0] -> 0 is included.\n\n        So we cannot be at freeway7 at turn86 either.\n\n        Therefore, we must avoid both freeway7 and freeway8 at turns 86 and 87.\n\n        How about we wait at y=6? \n          Freeway6: dangerous only at turn78 -> safe at turn86.\n\n        So plan:\n          We get to y=6 as quickly as possible? \n          Then wait at y=6 for two turns? (so that we skip the dangerous time for freeway7 and freeway8 at 86,87) \n          Then proceed to y=7 at turn88? \n\n        But note: we are at turn86 at y=6? \n          How did we get to y=6? \n          We start at turn78: \n            78: U -> y=1 at turn79\n            79: U -> y=2 at turn80\n            80: U -> y=3 at turn81\n            81: U -> y=4 at turn82\n            82: U -> y=5 at turn83\n            83: U -> y=6 at turn84\n\n          Then we wait at y=6 for two turns: \n            84: S -> stay at y=6 at turn85\n            85: S -> stay at y=6 at turn86\n            86: U -> y=7 at turn87\n            87: U -> y=8 at turn88\n            88: U -> y=9 at turn89\n\n        Now check collisions:\n\n          Turn78: y=0 -> safe.\n          Turn79: y=1 -> safe.\n          Turn80: y=2 -> safe.\n          Turn81: y=3 -> safe.\n          Turn82: y=4 -> safe.\n          Turn83: y=5 -> safe.\n          Turn84: y=6 -> safe (freeway6: dangerous only at 78 -> safe at 84).\n          Turn85: y=6 -> safe.\n          Turn86: y=6 -> safe.\n          Turn87: y=7 -> freeway7: dangerous at 78,79,86,87 -> turn87 is dangerous? \n                freeway7: \n                  first car: at turn87: [ -59+6*(87-78)= -59+6*9 = -59+54=-5, -48+54=6] -> 0 is in [-5,6] -> collide.\n\n          So we collide at turn87 at freeway7.\n\n        Why? Because we are at freeway7 at turn87, which is dangerous.\n\n        How to avoid? We must not be at freeway7 at turn87 either.\n\n        We can wait one more turn? Then we would be at y=7 at turn88? \n          So at turn87: we are still at y=6 -> safe.\n          Then at turn88: U -> y=7 at turn89 -> safe? \n          Then turn89: U -> y=8 at turn90\n          turn90: U -> y=9 at turn91.\n\n        Now check freeway7 at turn89: \n            Dangerous times for freeway7: 78,79,86,87 -> 89 is safe? \n            freeway8 at turn90: dangerous at 78,79,86,87 -> 90 is safe.\n\n        So the plan:\n\n          Turn78: U -> y=1 at turn79\n          Turn79: U -> y=2 at turn80\n          Turn80: U -> y=3 at turn81\n          Turn81: U -> y=4 at turn82\n          Turn82: U -> y=5 at turn83\n          Turn83: U -> y=6 at turn84\n          Turn84: S -> y=6 at turn85\n          Turn85: S -> y=6 at turn86\n          Turn86: S -> y=6 at turn87   [we wait one extra turn? Actually we need to skip until turn87 is over?]\n          Turn87: U -> y=7 at turn88\n          Turn88: U -> y=8 at turn89\n          Turn89: U -> y=9 at turn90\n\n        But wait, we started at turn78 and we have 12 actions? \n          Actually, we have 12 turns? The last action at turn89 (which is 89-78=11th turn) and then we are at y=9 at turn90? \n          But we want to count H: the number of turns from t1=78 to the turn we reach y=9. \n          We have actions from turn78 to turn89 (12 actions) and we are at y=9 at turn90? \n          Actually, the sequence is for t=0 to H-1: \n             t=0: turn78\n             t=1: turn79\n             ...\n             t=11: turn89 -> then at turn89 we do U and then at the end of turn89 we update to y=9? \n          So at turn89, we are at y=8? Then we do U and become y=9 at turn90? \n          But the problem: we are to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n          The action at turn t1+t (for t=0 to H-1) and then the position after H actions is at turn t1+H-1? \n          Let me see: \n            At turn78 (t1=78, t=0): we do a0 -> then at turn78 we are at y0, then we update to y1 for turn79? \n          Actually, the position at the start of turn t is (0, y_t). \n          Then we do action a_t -> then we get y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, which is the position at the start of turn t+1.\n\n          So the position at the start of turn78: y78=0.\n          After action a78 (at turn78): we get y79 = y78 + Delta.\n\n          Therefore, the position at turn79 is y79.\n\n          We want at the start of some turn T to be (0,9). \n          But note: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? \n\n          Actually: \n            We do actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1 (H actions). \n            Then the position at the start of turn t1+H is y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\n          Because:\n            Start: turn t1: position y_{t1} = 0.\n            After action at turn t1: we get y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta_{t1}\n            ...\n            After action at turn t1+H-1: we get y_{t1+H} = ... = 9.\n\n          So we are at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H.\n\n          Therefore, we need H such that at turn78+H, we are at y=9.\n\n          The minimal H is the number of actions? H.\n\n          In our plan above, we have 12 actions? \n            Actions: \n              a78: U -> y79=1\n              a79: U -> y80=2\n              a80: U -> y81=3\n              a81: U -> y82=4\n              a82: U -> y83=5\n              a83: U -> y84=6\n              a84: S -> y85=6\n              a85: S -> y86=6\n              a86: S -> y87=6\n              a87: U -> y88=7\n              a88: U -> y89=8\n              a89: U -> y90=9\n\n          So H = 12? But we can do better?\n\n        Alternatively, we might not wait that long? \n\n        We must avoid freeway7 and freeway8 at turns 86 and 87. \n\n        How about we go faster to y=6? We are already going as fast as possible: 6 moves to get to y=6 at turn84.\n\n        Then we wait at y=6 until after turn87? That would be until turn88? \n          So at turn87 we are still at y=6? Then at turn88 we move to y=7? \n\n        But then we are at:\n          turn88: y=7 -> freeway7: dangerous at 78,79,86,87 -> 88 is safe? \n          turn89: y=8 -> freeway8: 78,79,86,87 -> 89 is safe? \n          turn90: y=9 -> safe.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          turn78: U -> y79=1\n          turn79: U -> y80=2\n          turn80: U -> y81=3\n          turn81: U -> y82=4\n          turn82: U -> y83=5\n          turn83: U -> y84=6\n          turn84: S -> y85=6\n          turn85: S -> y86=6\n          turn86: S -> y87=6   [waiting at y=6 for turns84,85,86 -> three waits?]\n          turn87: U -> y88=7\n          turn88: U -> y89=8\n          turn89: U -> y90=9\n\n        That's 12 actions? But note: we have 12 actions? Actually, we did 6 moves (U) and then 3 waits (S) and then 3 moves (U): total 12 actions.\n\n        But we started at turn78 and did 12 actions: last action at turn89, so we are at y=9 at turn90.\n\n        Is there a way with 11 actions? Then we would be at y=9 at turn89? \n          That requires 9 moves (U) and 2 waits? \n          But we have to avoid freeway7 and freeway8 at 86,87.\n\n          Let's try:\n\n          We must be at y=9 at turn89? \n          How many moves: we need 9 moves. So we have 2 waits? \n\n          We start at y0 at turn78.\n\n          We have to be at y=9 at turn89. The moves: 9 moves, so we must have 2 waits? \n\n          We have to avoid:\n            At freeway7: turns78,79,86,87 -> we must not be at y=7 at these turns.\n            At freeway8: turns78,79,86,87 -> not at y=8 at these turns.\n\n          We are going to be at y=7 and y=8 at some turns. We must avoid 86 and 87.\n\n          So we must be at y=7 at a turn not in {78,79,86,87} and y=8 at a turn not in {78,79,86,87}. \n\n          The turns we are moving: \n            We have 9 moves and 2 waits. The total turns: from turn78 to turn89: 12 state changes? \n            Actually, the positions: \n              turn78: y0\n              turn79: y1\n              ...\n              turn89: y11\n\n          We want y11=9.\n\n          We can interleave waits. \n\n          Let t7 = the turn we are at y=7, and t8 = the turn we are at y=8.\n\n          We require t7 not in {78,79,86,87} and t8 not in {78,79,86,87}.\n\n          We also have to avoid freeway6 at turn78? But we are at freeway6 only when y=6? \n          Freeway6 dangerous at turn78 -> so we must not be at y=6 at turn78? But we start at y=0 -> not at y=6 at turn78.\n\n          Similarly, freeway1 at 94-97: we won't be there at those turns because we finish by turn89? \n\n          So the constraints are only for freeway7 and 8 at turns 86,87? \n\n          We must avoid being at y=7 or y=8 at turn86 and turn87.\n\n          We are traveling from y=0 to y=9 in 11 steps (with 2 waits). The minimal time to go from 0 to 9 is 9 moves, so 9 turns of movement. With 2 waits, we have 11 actions -> 11 turns? \n\n          The positions: \n            turn78: y0=0\n            turn79: y1\n            ...\n            turn89: y11=9\n\n          We are at y=7 at some turn i: \n            i = 78 + (number of steps to get to y=7) \n            Similarly for y=8.\n\n          How long does it take to get to y=7? at least 7 moves? \n          But we have 2 waits, so the total moves are 9 (for the 9 steps) and 2 waits. \n\n          We can distribute the waits arbitrarily.\n\n          Let the 2 waits be at some positions. \n\n          We require that the turn for y=7 is not 86 or 87? \n          Similarly for y=8.\n\n          The turn when we are at y=7: \n            We have done 7 moves and some waits. The total number of actions by the time we get to y=7 is 7 moves + w waits, so the turn is 78 + (7 + w).\n\n          Similarly, the turn for y=8: 78 + (8 + w') where w' is the total waits before we get to y=8.\n\n          We want:\n            78 + (7 + w) != 86 and !=87   -> 7+w !=8 and !=9 -> w !=1 and w!=2? \n            78 + (8 + w') !=86 and !=87 -> 8+w' !=8 and !=9 -> w' !=0 and !=1.\n\n          Also note: w' >= w because we get to y=7 first.\n\n          We have total waits: 2. \n\n          Possibilities for w (waits before reaching y=7): \n            We require w !=1 and w!=2? \n            So w must be 0? \n\n          Then w=0: then the turn for y=7: 78+7 = 85? \n          Then for y=8: we require w' !=0 and !=1 -> so w' must be 2? \n          Then the turn for y=8: 78 + (8+2) = 88? \n\n          How? \n            We have two waits. We can put one wait after y=7? and one after y=8? \n            But note: we have to get to y=7 at turn85, then we do one wait at y=7? then we move to y=8 at turn86? \n            But then at turn86: we are at y=8 -> dangerous? \n\n          Alternatively, we put both waits after y=7? \n            Then we get to y=7 at turn85 (with w=0: no wait before y=7). \n            Then we do two waits at y=7: \n                turn85: y=7 -> but then we are at freeway7 at turn85? safe? (because dangerous only at 78,79,86,87) -> safe.\n                turn86: still at y=7 -> safe? \n                turn87: still at y=7 -> dangerous? because 87 is dangerous for freeway7? \n            But we cannot be at y=7 at turn87.\n\n          So we must leave y=7 by turn86? \n\n          How about: \n            turn85: y=7 -> safe (turn85 not dangerous)\n            turn86: we do U? then we are at y=8 at turn87 -> but freeway8 at turn87: dangerous.\n\n          How about we leave y=7 at turn87? \n            turn85: y=7\n            turn86: S -> y=7 (safe? turn86: freeway7: dangerous? -> yes, because freeway7 is dangerous at 86? \n            So we cannot.\n\n          Therefore, we must avoid being at y=7 at turn86 and turn87? \n            So at turn85: we are at y=7 -> safe.\n            Then at turn86: we must leave? but if we move to y=8 at turn87, then at turn87 we are at y=8 -> dangerous? \n            And if we stay at y=7 at turn86: dangerous.\n\n          So we cannot be at y=7 or y=8 at turn86 or turn87.\n\n          Therefore, we must be at y=7 at a turn <86 or >=88? \n          But we are constrained: \n            We have 9 moves and 2 waits. We must be at y=9 at turn89. \n            The earliest we can be at y=7: if we do 7 moves without any wait: at turn78+7 = turn85. \n            Then we have to get from y=7 to y=9: that requires 2 moves and we have 2 waits to use? \n            But we have already used 0 waits? \n            So we have 2 waits to use. We can use them at y=7? \n            But then we must be at y=7 for two more turns? \n                turn85: y=7 -> safe (85 not dangerous)\n                turn86: y=7 -> dangerous (86 is dangerous for freeway7) -> not allowed.\n\n          Alternatively, we use one wait before y=7? But we required w=0 (because w cannot be 1 or 2). \n\n          Therefore, there is no solution with 11 actions? \n\n        So we stick with 12 actions.\n\n        But wait, we have an alternative: go down? \n          We are at y=0 at the beginning. We could go down? but we cannot go below 0. \n\n        Or we could go up to y=9 by a different route? \n\n        How about we go up to y=5, then wait? \n\n        But the dangerous times for freeway7 and 8 are 86 and 87. We must avoid being at y=7 or 8 at 86 and 87.\n\n        We can try to time our arrival at y=7 and y=8 to be at turn88 and 89? \n          Then we are safe.\n\n          To be at y=7 at turn88: \n            We start at turn78 at y=0.\n            We need 7 moves and some waits. The turn when we are at y=7: 78 + (number of actions taken to get to y=7) = 88? \n            So the number of actions taken to get to y=7 is 10? \n            But we only need 7 moves? So we have 10 actions: 7 moves and 3 waits? \n\n          Then we do:\n            From y=0 to y=7: 7 moves and 3 waits -> 10 actions -> at turn78+10-1 = turn87? \n            Actually: \n                We do 10 actions: from turn78 to turn87? \n                Then at the start of turn88, we are at y=7? \n\n          How? \n            After 10 actions, we are at turn78+10 = turn88? \n            The position at turn88 is the result of the 10th action? \n            We need to be at y=7 at the start of turn88? \n\n          The state at the start of turn78: y=0.\n          After 10 actions: we are at the start of turn88? \n          We want y88=7.\n\n          The moves: we have 7 moves (U) and 3 waits (S). \n\n          We can distribute the waits. \n\n          The turn when we are at y=7: \n            We have done 7 moves and w waits to get to y=7. The turn is 78 + (7+w). \n            We want 78+7+w = 88? -> 85+w=88 -> w=3? \n\n          So we use 3 waits before we get to y=7? \n\n          Then we get to y=7 at turn88? \n          Then we move:\n            turn88: U -> y89=8\n            turn89: U -> y90=9\n\n          Then we are at y=9 at turn90? \n\n          This is 12 actions? (10 actions to get to y=7 at turn88, then two more actions: so 12 actions) -> same as before.\n\n        How about we do the 3 waits earlier? \n          We start at y=0 at turn78.\n          We do 3 waits at y=0? \n            turn78: S -> y79=0\n            turn79: S -> y80=0\n            turn80: S -> y81=0\n          Then we start moving: \n            turn81: U -> y82=1\n            turn82: U -> y83=2\n            turn83: U -> y84=3\n            turn84: U -> y85=4\n            turn85: U -> y86=5\n            turn86: U -> y87=6\n            turn87: U -> y88=7\n            turn88: U -> y89=8\n            turn89: U -> y90=9\n\n          This is 12 actions? \n          Check freeway8 at turn89: safe? \n          But we are at y=8 at turn89: freeway8 dangerous at 78,79,86,87 -> 89 is safe.\n\n          However, we are at freeway7 at turn88: \n            turn88: freeway7: dangerous at 78,79,86,87 -> 88 is safe.\n\n          But we are at freeway6 at turn87: \n            freeway6: dangerous only at turn78 -> safe.\n\n          So this also works? \n\n          But we started with 3 waits? \n\n          However, we are at y=0 for turns78,79,80 -> safe.\n\n          Then we move up: \n            turn81: y=1 -> safe? freeway1: safe (only dangerous at 94-97) -> safe.\n            turn82: y=2 -> safe.\n            ...\n            turn87: y=6 -> safe.\n            turn88: y=7 -> safe.\n            turn89: y=8 -> safe.\n            turn90: y=9 -> safe.\n\n          But note: we are at y=9 at turn90? \n\n          And we have 12 actions: \n            turn78: S\n            turn79: S\n            turn80: S\n            turn81: U\n            turn82: U\n            turn83: U\n            turn84: U\n            turn85: U\n            turn86: U\n            turn87: U\n            turn88: U\n            turn89: U\n\n          Then at turn90: y=9.\n\n        This is 12 actions as well.\n\n        But is there a 10-action solution? \n          Then we are at y=9 at turn88? \n          We need 9 moves -> 9 actions. With one wait? total 10 actions.\n\n          We must avoid being at y=7 and y=8 at turns 86 and 87.\n\n          The turn for y=7: 78 + (7 + w) \n          We require: 85+w !=86 and !=87 -> w!=1 and w!=2 -> w=0? \n          Then turn for y=7: 85? \n          Then for y=8: 78 + (8+w') = 78+8+w' = 86+w' \n          We require w'>=w=0 -> so w'>=0. \n          And we require 86+w' !=86 and !=87 -> w'!=0 and w'!=1 -> w'>=2? \n          But we only have one wait total? so w' can be at most 1? \n          Contradiction.\n\n        Therefore, minimal H is 12.\n\n        Now, we have two 12-action plans. \n\n        We can choose the one that doesn't wait at the beginning? \n\n        The first plan: \n          We go up to y=6 as fast as possible (by turn84), then wait at y=6 for turns84,85,86 (three waits: at turn84,85,86 we do S) and then move up at turn87,88,89.\n\n        The second plan: \n          Wait at y=0 for three turns (turns78,79,80) and then go straight up.\n\n        Which one is better? They have the same H. \n\n        But note: in the first plan, we are at y=6 for turns84,85,86 -> and freeway6 is safe at those times? \n          We know freeway6 is only dangerous at turn78 -> safe.\n\n        However, we also have to consider freeway1 at 94-97? \n          But we finish at turn90, which is before 94 -> safe.\n\n        So both are safe.\n\n        We can choose either. \n\n        Let's write the first plan:\n\n          turn78: U\n          turn79: U\n          turn80: U\n          turn81: U\n          turn82: U\n          turn83: U   -> then at turn84 we are at y=6\n          turn84: S\n          turn85: S\n          turn86: S\n          turn87: U   -> then at turn88 we are at y=7\n          turn88: U   -> turn89: y=8\n          turn89: U   -> turn90: y=9\n\n        But wait: \n          At turn87: we do U -> we are at y=7 at turn88? \n          Actually, the movement: \n            At the start of turn87: we are at y=6 (from the previous action at turn86: S -> so we stayed at y=6 at turn87? \n            Then we do U at turn87 -> then at turn88 we are at y=7.\n\n          So we are at freeway7 at turn88? which is safe.\n\n        So the sequence:\n\n          Turn78: U\n          Turn79: U\n          Turn80: U\n          Turn81: U\n          Turn82: U\n          Turn83: U\n          Turn84: S\n          Turn85: S\n          Turn86: S\n          Turn87: U\n          Turn88: U\n          Turn89: U\n\n        H=12.\n\n        But note: we have 12 actions and we start at turn78 and end at turn89 (last action) and then at turn90 we are at y=9.\n\n        The problem: we are to list the actions for turns starting at t1=78 until the last action.\n\n        So we list:\n\n          Turn78: U\n          Turn79: U\n          Turn80: U\n          Turn81: U\n          Turn82: U\n          Turn83: U\n          Turn84: S\n          Turn85: S\n          Turn86: S\n          Turn87: U\n          Turn88: U\n          Turn89: U\n\n        But wait, we have 12 actions? And the last action is at turn89, which is t1+11? \n          t1=78, so t1+0:78, t1+1:79, ... t1+11:89 -> that's 12 turns.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        Alternatively, the second plan:\n\n          Turn78: S\n          Turn79: S\n          Turn80: S\n          Turn81: U\n          Turn82: U\n          Turn83: U\n          Turn84: U\n          Turn85: U\n          Turn86: U\n          Turn87: U\n          Turn88: U\n          Turn89: U\n\n        Also 12 actions.\n\n        We can choose either. \n\n        Let me see which one might be better? \n          In the first plan, we are at y=6 for turns84,85,86. \n          But freeway6 is safe at those times? \n          We know freeway6: dangerous only at turn78 -> safe.\n\n          However, we also have freeway7 and freeway8 at turns86 and 87: but we are at y=6, so not affected.\n\n        Both are safe.\n\n        Since the problem does not specify any cost for being at a particular y, we can choose the first one: because we get to a higher y earlier? \n\n        But the goal is minimal H, and both have H=12.\n\n        So we can output the first one.\n\n        But wait: is there a plan with H=11? We thought no, but let me double-check.\n\n        We need to be at y=9 at turn89 (since we do 11 actions: from turn78 to turn88, then at turn89 we are at y=9? \n          Actually: \n            Start: turn78: y0=0\n            After 11 actions: we are at turn78+11 = turn89? and the position is y89=9.\n\n          How? \n            We have 9 moves and 2 waits? \n            The moves: 9 U's -> gets us to y=9? \n            The waits: 2 S's.\n\n          So the total displacement: 9.\n\n          The path: \n            We start at y=0 at turn78.\n            We do 11 actions: 9 U and 2 S -> we end at y=9 at turn89.\n\n          We must avoid being at freeway7 at turns86,87 and freeway8 at turns86,87.\n\n          The turn when we are at y=7: \n            Let k = number of actions taken to get to y=7. \n            We require k = 7 moves + w waits (where w is the number of waits before reaching y=7) and k = (turn when we are at y=7) - 78? \n            Actually, at the start of turn (78 + i), we have done i actions? \n            And we are at y_i.\n\n          So at the start of turn (78+i), we are at y_i.\n\n          We want to be at y=7 at turn (78+i) for some i, and we require that 78+i is not 86 or 87 -> so i != 8 and i !=9.\n\n          Similarly, for y=8: we require the turn not to be 86 or 87 -> so the index i for y=8: i !=8 and i!=9.\n\n          Now, we have 11 actions: so we have states from turn78 to turn89 (index i from 0 to 11).\n\n          We must be at y=7 at some i, and y=8 at the next i? \n\n          The minimal index to reach y=7: \n            We do 7 moves and 0 waits: then at turn78+7 = turn85, we are at y=7? \n            Then we do a wait? that would be at turn85: we do S -> then we are at y=7 at turn86? -> dangerous.\n\n          How about we do a wait earlier? \n            Suppose we do one wait before y=7: then we get to y=7 at turn86? \n            But then we are at freeway7 at turn86: dangerous.\n\n          How about we do two waits before y=7? Then we get to y=7 at turn87? dangerous.\n\n          How about we do one wait after y=7? \n            We get to y=7 at turn85 (by doing 7 moves: no wait) -> safe at turn85? \n            Then we do a wait at turn85: then at turn86 we are still at y=7 -> dangerous.\n\n          How about we move from y=7 to y=8 at turn85? \n            Then at turn86 we are at y=8 -> dangerous.\n\n          How about we do two waits after y=7? \n            turn85: y=7 -> safe.\n            turn86: S -> y=7 -> dangerous?

We need 9 moves? So H-1 = 9? Then H=10? \n\n          But wait, that would be: \n            We do 9 actions: from turn78 to turn86? \n            Then at the start of turn78+9-1 = turn86? we are at y=9? \n\n          But note: \n            After 9 actions: \n              The last action is at turn78+8? -> turn86? \n              Then the position at the start of turn87? is y87 = 9? \n\n          But the problem says: we want the position at the start of turn t1+H-1 = 78+H-1 to be 9.\n\n          So we want y_{78+H-1} = 9.\n\n          How is y_{78+H-1} computed? \n            It is the result of the action at turn78+H-2? \n\n          Actually, the state at the start of turn T is y_T.\n\n          We do an action at turn T: which determines y_{T+1}.\n\n          Therefore, we require that after we do the last action (at turn t1+H-2), we get y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\n          But the last action is at turn t1+H-1? \n\n          The problem: \n            \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" \n            This means: \n                t=0: action at turn t1+0 = t1\n                t=1: action at turn t1+1\n                ...\n                t=H-1: action at turn t1+H-1\n\n          Then the position at the next turn (turn t1+H) is y_{t1+H} = ... \n\n          But we want the position at turn t1+H-1 to be 9? \n\n          This is confusing.\n\n        Let me read the problem again: \n          \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\"\n\n          And: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\n          So they want the position at the start of turn t1+H-1 to be 9.\n\n          How is that achieved? \n            We start at turn t1: y_{t1}=0.\n            After action a_{t1}: we get y_{t1+1} = 0 + Delta.\n            ...\n            After action a_{t1+H-2}: we get y_{t1+H-1} = ... \n\n          But the last action in the sequence is a_{t1+H-1}. \n\n          This implies that we are doing an action at turn t1+H-1, which would then determine y_{t1+H}. \n\n          But we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\n          Therefore, we must have achieved y=9 at turn t1+H-1 without the last action? \n\n          This suggests that the last action is not needed? \n\n          Actually, the sequence of actions has H actions, and after these H actions, the position at turn t1+H-1 is 9? \n\n          But the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and it is applied to the state at turn t1+H-1 to get the next state? \n\n          How can we have y_{t1+H-1} = 9 before applying the action at turn t1+H-1? \n\n          This is inconsistent.\n\n        Re-examining the problem statement: \n          \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\n          The indexing: \n            t from 0 to H-1: so we have H actions: \n                a_{t1+0}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}\n\n          And the condition is: y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\n          But note: the action a_{t1+H-1} is taken at turn t1+H-1. \n          Then after this action, we get y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta.\n\n          But the condition is on y_{t1+H-1} = 9, which is the state at the start of turn t1+H-1.\n\n          This means that we do not need the last action to achieve y=9? \n\n          In fact, we achieve y=9 at the start of turn t1+H-1, and then we do an action at that turn? \n\n          But then we might move away? \n\n          The problem says \"reach (0,9)\", so we want to be at (0,9) at some turn. It doesn't say we have to stay.\n\n          But the condition is y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n          So we are at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1.\n\n          How many actions have been applied? \n            The actions applied are from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2? \n            Because the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken at the start of the turn when we are already at y=9.\n\n          But the sequence includes H actions, including the one at turn t1+H-1.\n\n          This is confusing.\n\n        Let me try with a small example: \n          Suppose we start at y=0 at turn78.\n          We want to get to y=9. \n          Minimal without obstacles: 9 actions? \n          Then H should be 9? \n          Then the sequence: a78, a79, ..., a86 (9 actions: t=0 to 8) \n          Then the condition: y_{78+9-1}=y_{86}=9.\n\n          How? \n            turn78: a78=U -> then at turn79: y=1\n            turn79: U -> turn80: y=2\n            ...\n            turn86: U -> then at turn87: y=9\n\n          But we want y_{86}=9? That is, at the start of turn86, we are at y=9? \n\n          We are at y=9 at turn87, not turn86.\n\n          To be at y=9 at turn86, we would have to have done 9 actions by turn85? \n            turn78: U -> turn79:1\n            turn79: U -> turn80:2\n            ...\n            turn85: U -> turn86:9\n\n          So the last action is at turn85 (the 8th action? t=0 to t=7: 8 actions) -> then H=8? \n          Then the condition: y_{78+8-1}=y_{85}=? \n            After 8 actions, we are at turn86: y86=9? \n          But we are at y86=9 at the start of turn86? \n          How? \n            After the action at turn85, we become y86=9.\n\n          So the last action is at turn85 (which is t1+7, since 78+7=85) -> H=8 actions? \n          Then the condition: y_{78+8-1}=y_{85}=9? \n          But at the start of turn85, we are at y85=8. \n          Then we do U and become y86=9.\n\n          So the condition is not on y85 but on y86.\n\n        Therefore, the problem likely means that after H actions, the position at the start of turn t1+H is 9? \n          Then we require y_{t1+H}=9.\n\n          And the last action is at turn t1+H-1.\n\n          This is more natural.\n\n        But the problem explicitly says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\n        There might be a off-by-one.\n\n        Let me read carefully: \n          \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\n        This is: \n          We do actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1 (total H actions).\n          Then the position at the start of turn t1+H-1 is 9.\n\n        But note: at the start of turn t1+H-1, we haven't done the action at that turn yet. \n        The action at turn t1+H-1 will change it.\n\n        So how can we ensure y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\n        This implies that we are at y=9 at the beginning of the turn, and then we do an action (which might move us away).\n\n        The problem says \"reach (0,9)\", so as long as we are at (0,9) at some turn, it's fine.\n\n        But then the action at turn t1+H-1 is still taken? even though we are already at the goal? \n\n        And it might move us away? \n\n        The problem doesn't say we have to stay.\n\n        But typically, we want to be there at the last action? \n\n        However, the minimal H might be smaller if we allow to leave immediately.\n\n        But in this case, we are at y=9 at the start of turn t1+H-1, and then we do an action (which could be S, U, or D). \n        If we do U, we go to 10 which is invalid? \n        If we do D, we go to 8.\n        If we do S, we stay.\n\n        The problem: \"reach (0,9)\" and then presumably stop? but the sequence has to be provided for H turns.\n\n        Given the confusion, I'll assume that the intended meaning is that after H actions, we are at y=9 at the start of turn t1+H.\n\n        Because the note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", \n        which implies that during turn T, we are at y_T.\n\n        So to be at (0,9) at some turn T, we need to have y_T = 9.\n\n        And we want the smallest T>=78 such that there is a sequence of actions from turn78 to turn T-1 (because the action at turn T-1 updates to y_T) that gets us to y_T=9.\n\n        The number of actions is T - 78.\n\n        And we want to minimize T - 78? \n\n        But the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence has H actions.\n\n        And then the condition is y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n        If we let T = t1+H-1, then we want y_T=9, and the number of actions is H = T - 78 + 1? \n          because actions from turn78 to turn T-1: that's (T-1 - 78 + 1) = T-78 actions? \n        But the sequence has H actions.\n\n        Alternatively, if we let the actions be from turn78 to turn77+H, then the last action is at turn77+H, and then the next state is at turn78+H.\n\n        And we want y_{78+H}=9.\n\n        Then the number of actions is H.\n\n        And the turn we achieve y=9 is turn78+H.\n\n        This is clean.\n\n        But the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\n        Given the confusion, and since in the example above we have a plan that gets to y=9 at turn90 (which is 78+12), \n        and we used 12 actions, then if the problem means that we are at y=9 at turn78+12, then we have y_{78+12}=9.\n\n        But the condition in the problem is y_{78+H-1}=9 -> so if H=12, then they want y_{78+11}=9? \n\n        In our plan, at turn89 (78+11) we are at y=8, not 9.\n\n        So it doesn't meet the condition.\n\n        Therefore, we must be at y=9 at turn89.\n\n        How? \n          We need to get to y=9 by turn89.\n\n          In the plan above, we are at y=9 at turn90.\n\n          To be at y=9 at turn89, we need to arrive at y=9 one turn earlier.\n\n          We try to adjust: \n            We can save one action somewhere.\n\n          We had to wait three times. \n\n          How about we wait only twice? \n\n          We try to do 9 moves and 2 waits: total 11 actions.\n\n          We must be at y=9 at turn89.\n\n          The path: \n            turn78: U -> turn79:1\n            turn79: U -> turn80:2\n            turn80: U -> turn81:3\n            turn81: U -> turn82:4\n            turn82: U -> turn83:5\n            turn83: U -> turn84:6\n            turn84: U -> turn85:7  -> dangerous? freeway7 at turn85: safe? \n            turn85: U -> turn86:8  -> dangerous! freeway8 at turn86: dangerous.\n\n          So we cannot.\n\n          How about we wait at y=6 for only two turns? \n            turn78: U ->79:1\n            ...\n            turn83: U ->84:6\n            turn84: S ->85:6\n            turn85: S ->86:6  [waiting at y=6 for turns84,85 -> two waits]\n            turn86: U ->87:7  -> dangerous! freeway7 at turn87: dangerous.\n            turn87: U ->88:8  -> freeway8 at turn88: safe? \n            turn88: U ->89:9  -> safe.\n\n          So we collide at turn87.\n\n          How about we wait at a different location? \n\n          How about we wait at y=5 for two turns? \n            turn78: U\n            turn79: U\n            turn80: U\n            turn81: U\n            turn82: U  -> turn83:5\n            turn83: S  -> turn84:5\n            turn84: S  -> turn85:5\n            turn85: U  -> turn86:6\n            turn86: U  -> turn87:7  -> dangerous\n            turn87: U  -> turn88:8  -> dangerous?

\n            Then we wait at y=7 for two turns: turn85: S -> turn86:7 (dangerous) -> not allowed.\n\n          How about we get to y=7 at turn88: \n            actions: \n              turn78: U ->1 at79\n              turn79: U ->2 at80\n              turn80: U ->3 at81\n              turn81: U ->4 at82\n              turn82: U ->5 at83\n              turn83: U ->6 at84\n              turn84: U ->7 at85 -> dangerous? freeway7 at85: safe, but then we are at y=7 at turn85.\n            then we wait at y=7 for three turns? \n                turn85: S ->86:7 (dangerous) -> not allowed.\n\n          We have to leave y=7 by turn86? \n\n          How about: \n            turn85: from y=7 move to y=8 -> turn86:8 (dangerous) -> not allowed.\n\n        Therefore, it seems impossible with 11 actions.\n\n        How about we do 9 moves and 2 waits, and arrange to be at y=7 at turn88 and y=8 at turn89? \n          We want to be at y=7 at turn88: \n            number of actions to get to y=7: 7 moves and w waits = 7+w.\n            turn = 78 + (7+w) = 85+w.\n            Set 85+w=88 -> w=3? but then we use 3 waits, total actions=7+3+2=12? \n\n        Given the above, we output the plan for H=12, but we set the actions such that we are at y=9 at turn89 (78+11) if that is what the problem wants.\n\n        But in our plan, we are at y=9 at turn90 (78+12).\n\n        To be at y=9 at turn89, we need to do one less action? \n\n        Let's assume the problem means that we are at y=9 at the start of turn t1+H.\n\n        Then for our plan, we have H=12 and turn90=78+12.\n\n        But the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", so they want turn89=78+11.\n\n        So we must have a plan that gets to y=9 at turn89.\n\n        How? \n          We do 11 actions: \n            We need to achieve 9 moves in 11 actions? then we have 2 waits.\n\n          We must be at y=9 at turn89.\n\n          The only way is to avoid the three waits? \n\n          But we need to avoid freeway7 and freeway8 at turns86,87.\n\n          We try a different route: \n            Go up to y=8 by turn86? but then at turn86 we are at y=8 -> dangerous.\n            Go up to y=9 by turn86? -> then we would be at y=9 at turn87? \n               turn78:U->1 at79\n               turn79:U->2 at80\n               turn80:U->3 at81\n               turn81:U->4 at82\n               turn82:U->5 at83\n               turn83:U->6 at84\n               turn84:U->7 at85\n               turn85:U->8 at86 -> dangerous at freeway8\n               turn86:U->9 at87\n\n            So at turn87: y=9 -> safe, but we are at freeway8 at turn86: dangerous.\n\n          How about we wait at a lower floor? \n            turn78: U\n            turn79: U\n            turn80: U\n            turn81: U\n            turn82: U\n            turn83: S  // wait at y=5? \n            turn84: U ->6\n            turn85: U ->7\n            turn86: U ->8 // dangerous at freeway8 at turn86\n            turn87: U ->9\n\n          Collide.\n\n          turn78: U\n          turn79: U\n          turn80: U\n          turn81: S // at y=3\n          turn82: U // y=4\n          turn83: U // y=5\n          turn84: U // y=6\n          turn85: U // y=7\n          turn86: U // y=8 at turn87 -> freeway8 at turn87: dangerous.\n\n          Collide.\n\n        After 6 moves, we are at y=6 at turn84.\n        Then we wait at turn84: y=6\n        turn85: U -> y=7 at turn86 -> freeway7 at turn86: dangerous.\n\n        wait two at y=6:\n          turn84: S\n          turn85: S\n          turn86: U -> y=7 at turn87: dangerous for freeway7.\n          turn87: U -> y=8 at turn88: safe for freeway8? \n          turn88: U -> y=9 at turn89: safe.\n\n        So we have:\n          turn78: U //1\n          turn79: U //2\n          turn80: U //3\n          turn81: U //4\n          turn82: U //5\n          turn83: U //6\n          turn84: S // still6\n          turn85: S // still6\n          turn86: U //7 at turn87 -> dangerous for freeway7 at turn87? \n             freeway7 at turn87: dangerous ( as we've seen: [ -59+6*(87-78) = -59+54 = -5, -48+54=6] -> covers 0)\n          So collide.\n\n        wait one at y=5 and one at y=6:\n          turn78: U //1\n          turn79: U //2\n          turn80: U //3\n          turn81: U //4\n          turn82: U //5\n          turn83: S // wait at y=5\n          turn84: U //6\n          turn85: S // wait at y=6\n          turn86: U //7 at turn87 -> dangerous\n\n        wait at y=4 and y=5:\n          turn83: S // at y=4? \n          turn84: U //5\n          turn85: S //5\n          turn86: U //6\n          turn87: U //7 at turn88 -> safe for freeway7? \n          turn88: U //8 at turn89 -> safe for freeway8? \n          turn89: U //9 at turn90 -> but we want 9 at turn89? \n\n        So not.\n\n        Therefore, it appears impossible to achieve in 11 actions.\n\n        Given the above, and since the problem might have a off-by-one, I will output the plan that gets to y=9 at turn90 and has 12 actions, and in the boxed answer, we put the sequence for 12 actions.\n\n        If the problem intended for the last action to achieve the goal at the next turn, then our plan is for H=12 with the understanding that we reach at turn90.\n\n        But the problem says: y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n        So to meet that, we need to be at y=9 at turn78+12-1= turn89.\n\n        So we need a plan that gets to y=9 at turn89.\n\n        We must therefore have 12 actions and be at y=9 at turn89.\n\n        How? \n          We have to achieve y=9 in 11 actions? because the state at turn89 is the result of 11 actions? \n          actions from turn78 to turn88: 11 actions.\n\n          then the state at turn89 is y89=9.\n\n          So we need 9 moves and 2 waits in 11 actions.\n\n          We must avoid being at y=7 or y=8 at turns86,87.\n\n          We distribute the two waits.\n\n          We want to be at y=7 at a turn not in {86,87} and y=8 not in {86,87}.\n\n          The turn for y=7: 78 + (7 + w) = 85 + w.\n          Must have 85+w !=86 and !=87 -> w!=1 and w!=2 -> w=0.\n\n          Then turn for y=7: 85.\n          Then for y=8: 78 + (8 + w') = 86 + w' (>=86 because w'>=0).\n          Must have 86+w' !=86 and !=87 -> w'!=0 and w'!=1 -> w'>=2.\n\n          So we need at least 2 waits after y=7.\n\n          But we only have 2 waits in total. \n          So we use 0 waits before y=7, and 2 waits after y=7? \n          Then the turn for y=7: 85.\n          turn85: we are at y=7 -> safe.\n          then we wait:\n             turn85: S -> turn86: y=7 -> dangerous (freeway7 at turn86) -> collide.\n\n        So we cannot.\n\n        Therefore, there is no solution with 11 actions that avoids the obstacles and achieves y=9 at turn89.\n\n        What if we use more than 2 waits? then we would need more than 11 actions.\n\n        So the minimal H for which we can achieve y_{78+H-1}=9 is 12, and we use 12 actions.\n\n        In our first plan, we are at y=9 at turn90, which is 78+12, so if we want y_{78+12-1}=y_{89}=9, then we need to be at y=9 at turn89.\n\n        So we modify the plan to have the last move at turn88: \n          We want to be at y=9 at turn89.\n          We need to be at y=8 at turn88, and then do U at turn88 to get to y=9 at turn89.\n\n        So the entire plan must get to y=8 at turn88.\n\n        We need 8 moves and some waits.\n\n        The number of actions: 12, so we have 8 moves and 4 waits.\n\n        We must avoid being at y=7 or y=8 at turns86,87.\n\n        The turn for y=7: 78 + (7 + w) = 85 + w.\n        Must have 85+w !=86 and !=87 -> w!=1 and w!=2 -> so w=0 or w>=3.\n        Similarly, for y=8: 78 + (8 + w') = 86 + w'.\n        Must have 86+w' !=86 and !=87 -> w'!=0 and w'!=1 -> w'>=2.\n\n        Also, w' = w + w7, where w7 is the number of waits at y=7.\n\n        Total waits = w + w7 + w8 = 4.\n\n        We then require w' = w + w7 >=2.\n\n        And for y=7: if we set w=0, then turn for y=7=85.\n        then we are at y=7 at turn85.\n        then we need to wait at least 2 times before moving to y=8? \n        so at least 2 waits at y=7: then turn for y=8 = 85 + 2 + 1 = 88? \n           because after two waits (at turn85 and turn86) we are still at y=7.\n           then at turn87: we move to y=8.\n\n        turn for y=8 = 88.\n\n        Then we have:\n          actions to get to y=7: 7 moves and 0 waits: 7 actions.\n          then at y=7 for two waits: \n             turn85: S (action7)\n             turn86: S (action8) -> still y=7 at turn87? \n             turn87: U (action9) -> y=8 at turn88.\n          then at turn88: we are at y=8 -> freeway8 at turn88: safe.\n          then we need to move to y=9: \n             turn88: U (action10) -> y=9 at turn89.\n\n          then we have two more actions to do? but we only have 12 actions, and we've used 10 actions.\n\n          We can do two more S at turn89 and turn90? but that would be 12 actions, and at turn89 we are at y=9, then turn90: still at y=9.\n\n          But the problem: we only need to reach (0,9) and we are there at turn89. The extra actions might be not needed, but the problem asks for a sequence of exactly H actions.\n\n          However, the condition is only on y_{78+H-1}=9, which is turn89 when H=12.\n\n          So at turn89, we are at y=9, and then we do action11 and action12? \n          action11 at turn89: we are at y=9, we can do S.\n          action12 at turn90: we are at y=9, we can do S.\n\n          This is safe.\n\n        So the plan:\n\n          turn78: U -> y79=1\n          turn79: U -> y80=2\n          turn80: U -> y81=3\n          turn81: U -> y82=4\n          turn82: U -> y83=5\n          turn83: U -> y84=6\n          turn84: U -> y85=7   [7 actions, and we are at y=7 at turn85]\n\n          turn85: S -> y86=7   [action8]\n          turn86: S -> y87=7   [action9]\n          turn87: U -> y88=8   [action10]\n          turn88: U -> y89=9   [action11]\n          turn89: S -> y90=9   [action12]  // or any action, but we are at y=9, so S is fine.\n          // But note, we only need to provide 12 actions, and the condition is that at turn89=78+12-1=89, we are at y=9.\n\n          At the start of turn89, we are at y=9? \n             No, at the start of turn89, we are at y=8 (because action88: U -> then at turn89 we become y=9).\n\n          So at the start of turn89, we are at y=8.\n\n          Then we do action89: U? -> that would be invalid because then we are at y=9 and do U -> y=10.\n\n          So we should do S or D.\n\n          But the condition is only that at the start of turn89 we are at y=9? -> we are not.\n\n        We are at y=9 at the start of turn90.\n\n        So to have y89=9, we need to be at y=9 at the start of turn89.\n\n        That means we must have become y=9 at turn89 from the action at turn88.\n\n        So the action at turn88: U from y=8 to y=9.\n\n        Then at the start of turn89, we are at y=9.\n\n        So the last action (action12) is not needed? \n\n        But the sequence has to have 12 actions.\n\n        We can do a extra action at turn89: which is S or U or D, but if we are at y=9, U would be invalid, so we do S or D.\n\n        But then the state at turn90 might change.\n\n        However, the condition is only on turn89.\n\n        So the plan for 12 actions that has y89=9 is:\n\n          turn78: U  // action0\n          turn79: U  //1\n          turn80: U  //2\n          turn81: U  //3\n          turn82: U  //4\n          turn83: U  //5\n          turn84: U  //6\n          turn85: S  //7: wait at y=7\n          turn86: S  //8: wait at y=7\n          turn87: U  //9: -> y=8 at turn88\n          turn88: U  //10: -> y=9 at turn89\n          turn89: S  //11: -> still y=9 at turn90, but we don't care as long as at turn89 we are at y=9.\n\n        Now check collisions:\n          turn78: y=0 -> safe.\n          turn79: y=1 -> safe.\n          turn80: y=2 -> safe.\n          turn81: y=3 -> safe.\n          turn82: y=4 -> safe.\n          turn83: y=5 -> safe.\n          turn84: y=6 -> safe.\n          turn85: y=7 -> freeway7: turn85 is safe (dangerous at 78,79,86,87) -> safe.\n          turn86: y=7 -> freeway7: turn86 dangerous! -> and we are there.\n\n        Oh, collide at turn86.\n\n        So we cannot wait at y=7 at turn86.\n\n        Therefore, we must not be at y=7 at turn86.\n\n        Then how about we do the two waits not at y=7 but at a safe floor?

The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) as follows:\n\n- **Initial state (turn 78)**: Player is at \\((0, 0)\\), which is safe (no cars on \\(y = 0\\) or \\(y = 9\\)).\n- **Actions**:\n  - Moves up (U) for the first 6 turns to reach \\(y = 6\\) by turn 84.\n  - Waits (S) for 3 turns at \\(y = 6\\) (turns 84, 85, 86), as freeway 6 is safe at these times (dangerous only at turn 78).\n  - Moves up (U) for the final 3 turns to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 90.\n\nThe sequence ensures the player is never on a freeway \\(y\\) at a turn \\(T\\) where a car covers \\(x = 0\\):\n- Freeway 1 is dangerous at turns 94-97; avoided by finishing earlier.\n- Freeway 6 is dangerous only at turn 78; avoided by being at \\(y = 6\\) only from turn 84 onward.\n- Freeways 7 and 8 are dangerous at turns 78, 79, 86, 87; avoided by:\n  - Being at \\(y = 6\\) (safe) during turns 86 and 87.\n  - Reaching \\(y = 7\\) at turn 88 and \\(y = 8\\) at turn 89, which are safe for freeways 7 and 8.\n\nThe actions are:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 78\\!: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 79\\!: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 80\\!: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 81\\!: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 82\\!: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 83\\!: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 84\\!: & \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 85\\!: & \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 86\\!: & \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 87\\!: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 88\\!: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 89\\!: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 0) at turn t1 = 84. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. Each action U, D, or S changes the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. Importantly, when the player moves to a new y, they are not considered on that new y until the next turn. So, at turn T, the player is on y_T, and if they move, at turn T+1 they are on y_{T+1}.\n\nNow, the cars are given for each freeway k from 1 to 8. I need to figure out where the cars are at any future turn based on their initial state at t1=84.\n\nThe car update rules:\n\n- For left-moving cars: span at T is [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the notation, for left-moving, it has Span(t1) = [h, τ], and h and τ are given. Similarly for right-moving.\n\nLooking at the car states:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nBut direction is right, so it should be right-moving.\n\nThe notation says: for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h]? Let's see:\n\n\"Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor right-moving, head is at h, tail at τ, and since it's moving right, head should be to the right, so h > τ? But let's see the values.\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3). So h = -48, τ = -59. Since it's right-moving, and h = -48, τ = -59, so τ < h, so the span is from τ to h, I think? But in the update, for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1, it's (h, τ, d, s) = (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nSince direction is right, and τ = -59, h = -48, so τ < h, so the car is from -59 to -48, and moving right.\n\nAt T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-59 + 3(T-84), -48 + 3(T-84)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAlso, collision only if 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway y_T.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0, but freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0, there are no cars, I assume. Similarly, y=9 is the goal, no cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways with cars, only y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nAt turn T, if player is at y_T, and y_T between 1 and 8, then we check for cars on that freeway.\n\nNow, player starts at (0,0) at t1=84.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal number of turns: since y=0 to y=9, if no cars, min H=9, with all U actions. But with cars, we might need to wait or go down sometimes to avoid collisions.\n\nBut going down might not help since we start at y=0, and y>=0, so going down from y=0 would stay at 0, I think? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y in [0,9], so if at y=0 and action D, y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1) =0, I assume? The update says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy = +1 for U, -1 for D, 0 for S, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so it must be clipped, but since we start at 0, D or S keeps us at 0.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, U or S keeps us at 9.\n\nBut we start at y=0, so initially, we can only go up or stay; down does nothing.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y=9, we need to move up.\n\nNow, let's list the car positions over time.\n\nFirst, define ΔT = T - t1 = T - 84.\n\nFor each freeway, for each car, the span at time T.\n\nAlso, collision if for freeway y_T, 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at T.\n\nNow, let's list all cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h, τ, d, s) = (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nSince right-moving, span at T: [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [-59 + 3ΔT, -48 + 3ΔT]\n\nSet 0 in this interval: -59 + 3ΔT <= 0 <= -48 + 3ΔT\n\nSo -59 + 3ΔT <= 0 => 3ΔT <= 59 => ΔT <= 59/3 ≈ 19.666, so ΔT <= 19\n\nAnd 0 <= -48 + 3ΔT => 48 <= 3ΔT => ΔT >= 16\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision when ΔT between 16 and 19 inclusive.\n\nΔT >=16 and ΔT <=19.\n\nNow, freeway 2: (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nBut (head, tail, dir, speed) = (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nSince right-moving, span at t1: [τ, h] = [37, 48]? No.\n\nIn the state, it's given as (h, τ) = (48, 37), and direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, span should be from τ to h, I think, but τ=37, h=48, so τ < h, so car from 37 to 48, moving right.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [37 + 12 ΔT, 48 + 12 ΔT]\n\n0 in this interval: 37 + 12ΔT <= 0 <= 48 + 12ΔT\n\nBut 37 + 12ΔT <= 0? 12ΔT <= -37, which is impossible since ΔT >=0, so 37+12ΔT >=37>0, so 0 is never <= 37+12ΔT? Let's see inequality.\n\nThe span is [low, high] where low = τ + s ΔT = 37 + 12 ΔT, high = h + s ΔT = 48 + 12 ΔT\n\n0 in [low, high] means low <= 0 <= high.\n\nBut low = 37 + 12ΔT >= 37 > 0 for all ΔT, so low > 0, so 0 < low <= high, so 0 is not in [low, high] since low >0. So no collision possible on freeway 2 at any time. Because the car is always to the right of 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (48, 37, right, 12) — identical to freeway 2.\n\nIn the table:\n\n| 2 | (48, 37, right, 12) |\n\n| 3 | (48, 37, right, 12) |\n\nSame for freeway 4 and 5: all (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 6 has two cars: (48, 37, right, 12) and (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: same as above, no collision possible.\n\nSecond car: (h, τ, d, s) = (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nSince right-moving, span at T: [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [-11 + 12 ΔT, 0 + 12 ΔT] = [-11 + 12 ΔT, 12 ΔT]\n\n0 in this: low <= 0 <= high\n\nlow = -11 + 12 ΔT <= 0 => 12 ΔT <= 11 => ΔT <= 11/12 < 1, so since ΔT integer, ΔT <=0? ΔT = T - t1 >=0, so for ΔT=0, low = -11 +0 = -11 <=0, high=0, so 0 <= high=0, so 0 is included? 0 <= high, and low <=0, so yes.\n\nAt ΔT=0, T=t1, span is [-11,0], so 0 is the head, so 0 is included, collision if player is on freeway 6 at T=t1.\n\nBut player starts at y=0 at t1, which is not freeway, so no car at y=0.\n\nFreeway 6 is y=6, I think? Freeway k means y=k, I assume.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to 8, so freeway k corresponds to y=k.\n\nAt turn T, if player is on y_T, and y_T between 1 and 8, we check cars on that freeway.\n\nAt T=t1=84, player is at y=0, so not on any freeway, no collision.\n\nFor car on freeway 6: second car (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nAt T, span: [-11 + 12 ΔT, 12 ΔT]\n\n0 in [low, high] when low <= 0 <= high\n\nlow <= 0: -11 + 12 ΔT <= 0 => 12 ΔT <= 11 => ΔT <= 11/12 < 1, so ΔT=0 only, since ΔT integer >=0.\n\nAt ΔT=0, low = -11 <=0, high=0, 0<=0, so 0 is in span.\n\nFor ΔT=1, low = -11+12=1, high=12, 1 to 12, 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSimilarly for other ΔT, low = -11 +12ΔT >=1 for ΔT>=1, so 0 not in span.\n\nSo for freeway 6, second car, collision only at ΔT=0, i.e., T=t1.\n\nBut at T=t1, if player were on y=6, but player is at y=0, so no issue.\n\nNow, freeway 7: two cars: (-48, -59, right, 6) and (0, -11, right, 6)\n\nFirst car: (h,τ,d,s) = (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nRight-moving, span at T: [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [-59 + 6 ΔT, -48 + 6 ΔT]\n\n0 in this: -59 + 6 ΔT <= 0 <= -48 + 6 ΔT\n\nFirst: -59 + 6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=59 => ΔT <= 59/6 ≈9.833, so ΔT <=9\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 6ΔT => 48 <= 6ΔT => ΔT >= 8\n\nSo ΔT from 8 to 9 inclusive.\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: (0, -11, right, 6)\n\nSpan at T: [-11 + 6 ΔT, 0 + 6 ΔT] = [-11 + 6 ΔT, 6 ΔT]\n\n0 in this: low <=0 <= high\n\n-11 + 6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=11 => ΔT <=11/6≈1.833, so ΔT=0 or 1\n\nAt ΔT=0: low=-11<=0, high=0, 0<=0, in.\n\nAt ΔT=1: low=-11+6=-5<=0, high=6, 0<=6, in.\n\nAt ΔT=2: low=-11+12=1>0, high=12, 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo for second car, collision when ΔT=0 or 1.\n\nFreeway 7: collision if player on y=7 when:\n\n- For first car: ΔT=8 or 9\n\n- For second car: ΔT=0 or 1\n\nSo overall, on freeway 7, collision at ΔT=0,1,8,9\n\nFreeway 8: similar, two cars: (-48, -59, right, 6) and (0, -11, right, 6)\n\nSame as freeway 7, since same cars and speed.\n\nFreeway 8: cars (-48, -59, right, 6) and (0, -11, right, 6)\n\nSo collision at same times: for first car ΔT=8,9; second car ΔT=0,1; so collision at ΔT=0,1,8,9 if on y=8.\n\nNow, freeway 1: we had collision at ΔT=16 to 19.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5: only the (48,37,right,12) cars, which are always positive, no collision possible.\n\nFreeway 6: first car (48,37,right,12) no collision; second car (0,-11,right,12) collision only at ΔT=0, which is not relevant since player not on freeway at t1.\n\nSo for freeway 6, no collision at any time except possibly at t1, but irrelevant.\n\nNow, freeway 1 has collision at ΔT=16-19.\n\nFreeways 7 and 8 have collision at ΔT=0,1,8,9.\n\nBut ΔT=0 is t1, player at y=0, not on freeway.\n\nSo for player, when moving, we care about times when on freeways.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at t=84.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0, but since we start at 0 and want to go to 9, and min steps, probably mostly U, but need to avoid collisions when on y=1 to 8 at times when collision possible.\n\ny must be integer, so positions 0 to 9.\n\nThe freeways with possible collisions are:\n\n- y=1: collision at ΔT=16-19\n\n- y=7: collision at ΔT=1,8,9? For y=7, collision at ΔT=1 (from second car), and ΔT=8,9 (from first car)\n\nSimilarly y=8: collision at ΔT=1 (second car), ΔT=8,9 (first car)\n\ny=1: only freeway 1 has car, collision at ΔT=16-19.\n\nOther freeways: y=2,3,4,5,6 have no collision possible at any time, as we saw.\n\ny=6: freeway 6, we have cars but no collision except at t1, irrelevant.\n\nSo y=2,3,4,5,6 are safe at all times.\n\ny=1 is dangerous only at ΔT=16-19.\n\ny=7 dangerous at ΔT=1,8,9\n\ny=8 dangerous at ΔT=1,8,9\n\nΔT = T - t1 = T - 84.\n\nNow, player starts at t=84, y=0.\n\nAt each turn, we choose action, which determines next y.\n\nThe time when we are on a freeway depends on the path.\n\nSince we want min turns to y=9, and no obstacles on y=2-6, we should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on y=1 at t when ΔT=16-19, or on y=7 or y=8 at t when ΔT=1,8,9.\n\nΔT is relative to t1=84.\n\nSet t = turn number.\n\nt1 = 84, so ΔT = t - 84.\n\nPlayer at time t, position y_t.\n\ny_t determines which freeway we are on if 1<=y_t<=8.\n\nCollision if at time t, for that y_t, 0 is in car span.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H -1} =9, so at turn t1 + H -1, we reach y=9.\n\nSince we start at t=84, y=0, and after H turns, at turn 84 + H -1, we are at y=9? Let's see.\n\nDefine the sequence.\n\nAt turn t1 (84), player position is given, we choose action a_{t1}, which determines y_{t1+1}.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}, choose a_{t1+1}, and so on, up to after H actions, at turn t1 + H, we are at y_{t1+H}, and we want y_{t1+H} =9? No.\n\nThe turn sequence: at turn t, we choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy based on a_t.\n\nStarting at turn t1, position (0, y_{t1}) = (0,0).\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{a_{t1}}\n\nSimilarly, after action a_{t1+k}, at turn t1+k+1, position y_{t1+k+1}\n\nWe want to reach (0,9), so we need that at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nThe turn when we reach y=9 is after the last action.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1, so H actions, and after H actions, at turn t1+H, we are at y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nFor example, if we do nothing, at turn t1, y=0, after 0 actions, still at turn t1, y=0.\n\nAfter first action, at turn t1+1, y could be 0 or 1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1+H, y = y_{t1} + sum of Δy from t= t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSince y_{t1} =0, and each Δy is -1,0, or +1, to reach y=9, we need exactly 9 net up moves, and H >=9.\n\nMinimal H is 9 if we go up every turn.\n\nBut with cars, we might need to wait or detour.\n\nNow, in this case, since y=2 to6 are always safe, we can go directly up, but need to avoid being on y=1 at bad times or y=7,8 at bad times.\n\nThe bad times:\n\nFor y=1: collision if at that time, ΔT = t - 84 is between 16 and 19 inclusive, i.e., t=84+16=100 to t=84+19=103.\n\nΔT = t - 84, so for y=1, collision if t from 100 to 103.\n\nSimilarly, for y=7: collision at ΔT=1,8,9 → t=84+1=85, 84+8=92, 84+9=93.\n\nSimilarly for y=8: same t=85,92,93.\n\nΔT=1: t=85\n\nΔT=8: t=92\n\nΔT=9: t=93\n\nSo y=7 and y=8 have collision at t=85,92,93.\n\nNow, y=1 has collision at t=100,101,102,103.\n\nPlayer starts at t=84, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9 in min steps.\n\nPossible to go up directly, but need to be not on y=7 or y=8 at t=85,92,93, and not on y=1 at t=100-103.\n\nSince we start at t=84, y=0, and min time to reach y=9 is 9 turns: if we go up every turn, at turn t=85, y=1; t=86,y=2; ... t=93,y=9.\n\nBut let's see the times:\n\n- At t=85, if y=1, but t=85, ΔT=1, for y=1, is there collision? y=1 collision only at t=100-103, not at t=85. At t=85, on y=1, no collision since y=1 only dangerous at t=100-103.\n\ny=1 collision only at specific times.\n\nAt t=85, if player is on y=1, it should be safe, since only dangerous at t=100-103.\n\nSimilarly, in the direct path:\n\nt=84: y=0\n\na_t= U, then t=85, y=1\n\na_t=U, t=86, y=2\n\n...\n\nUp to t=93, y=9.\n\nNow, check when on freeways:\n\nAt t=85, y=1: freeway 1, at ΔT=1, but for y=1, collision only if ΔT=16-19, which is not now, so safe.\n\nt=86, y=2: freeway 2, but no collision possible, safe.\n\nSimilarly t=87,y=3 safe; t=88,y=4 safe; t=89,y=5 safe; t=90,y=6 safe.\n\nt=91,y=7: freeway 7, at time t=91, ΔT=91-84=7.\n\nFor y=7, collision at ΔT=1,8,9. ΔT=7 not in {1,8,9}, so safe? ΔT=7, not 1,8,9.\n\nSimilarly, t=92,y=8: freeway 8, ΔT=92-84=8, which is in {1,8,9}, so collision at t=92 if on y=8.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt t=92, if y=8, collision.\n\nSimilarly, t=93,y=9, but y=9 is goal, no freeway, safe.\n\nIn the direct path:\n\nAt t=91, y=7, ΔT=7, not collision time for y=7 (which are 1,8,9), so safe.\n\nAt t=92, y=8, ΔT=8, which is collision time for y=8, so if we are on y=8 at t=92, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nSimilarly, at t=93, y=9, safe.\n\nBut at t=92, collision if on y=8.\n\nSo direct path has collision at t=92 on y=8.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=8 at t=92.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at t=92 is not dangerous, only at t=85,92,93? t=92 for y=7: ΔT=8, which is collision time.\n\ny=7 collision at t=85 (ΔT=1), t=92 (ΔT=8), t=93 (ΔT=9)\n\nSimilarly y=8 at same times.\n\nIn direct path, at t=91, y=7, ΔT=7, safe.\n\nt=92, y=8, ΔT=8, collision.\n\nt=93, y=9, safe.\n\nTo avoid, we can either delay reaching y=8 or be elsewhere at t=92.\n\nSince y=7 at t=92 might be possible, but at t=92, if on y=7, ΔT=8, which is collision time for y=7.\n\nAt t=92, both y=7 and y=8 are dangerous.\n\nt=92, ΔT=8.\n\nFor y=7, collision at ΔT=8; for y=8, collision at ΔT=8.\n\nSimilarly at t=93, ΔT=9, both dangerous.\n\nAt t=85, ΔT=1, both dangerous.\n\nIn the min time path, we reach y=7 at t=91 (safe), then to y=8 at t=92, but t=92 dangerous for y=8.\n\nWe could stay on y=7 at t=92, but if we do S at t=91, then at t=92, y=7, but ΔT=8, collision on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=8 at t=92, collision.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=7 or y=8 at t=92.\n\nt=92 is bad for both.\n\nSimilarly, at t=93, if we are on y=8, it would be bad, but if we go to y=9 at t=93, safe.\n\nBut in the sequence, to reach y=9 at t=93, we need to be at y=8 at t=92 or earlier.\n\nSince we move step by step.\n\nLet's list the times when we can be on each freeway safely.\n\nFirst, y=1: safe except when t=100,101,102,103\n\ny=2,3,4,5,6: always safe\n\ny=7: safe except when t=85,92,93\n\ny=8: safe except when t=85,92,93\n\nNow, for min time to y=9, we start at t=84, y=0.\n\nWe can go up to y=6 quickly, since safe.\n\nThen from y=6, we need to go to y=7, then y=8, then y=9.\n\nBut y=7 and y=8 have dangerous times at t=85,92,93.\n\nt=85 is early, we might not be there yet if we start from y=0.\n\nIn min time, we reach y=7 at t=91, as before.\n\nt=91 is safe for y=7.\n\nThen at t=92, we need to be not on y=7 or y=8.\n\nBut if we are on y=6 at t=92, that is safe, since y=6 always safe.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut we might need to wait or something.\n\nSince we need to avoid t=92 for y=7 and y=8.\n\nSimilarly, t=93 is dangerous for y=7 and y=8, but if we can be at y=9 at t=93, that's fine.\n\nNow, let's plan the path.\n\nStart: t=84, y=0\n\nAction: must go up or stay; going down does nothing.\n\nTo make progress, go up.\n\nSo suppose at t=84, action U, then t=85, y=1\n\nNow, at t=85, y=1, ΔT=1, is it dangerous? For y=1, dangerous only at t=100-103, not now, so safe.\n\nAction: we can go U or S or D, but D to y=0, not progress, so U or S.\n\nIf U, t=86, y=2\n\nSimilarly, we can go up to y=6 quickly.\n\nt=84: y=0\n\na=U: t=85, y=1\n\na=U: t=86, y=2\n\na=U: t=87, y=3\n\na=U: t=88, y=4\n\na=U: t=89, y=5\n\na=U: t=90, y=6\n\nNow at t=90, y=6, safe.\n\nNow, next action: to go to y=7, we need to move up.\n\nIf we go U at t=90, then t=91, y=7\n\nAt t=91, y=7, ΔT=7, not dangerous (danger at 1,8,9), so safe.\n\nNow at t=91, we need to choose action.\n\nIf we go U, t=92, y=8, but t=92, ΔT=8, dangerous for y=8, collision.\n\nIf we stay S, t=92, y=7, but t=92, ΔT=8, dangerous for y=7, collision.\n\nIf we go down D, to y=6 at t=92, then y=6 safe.\n\nBut then we are at y=6, need to go up later.\n\nBut at t=92, y=6, safe.\n\nThen we can go up to y=7 at t=93.\n\nBut t=93, if y=7, ΔT=9, dangerous for y=7, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=92, y=6, and we go U to y=7 at t=93, then at t=93 y=7, collision.\n\nIf we stay at y=6 at t=92, then at t=93, if we go U to y=7, t=93 y=7, collision.\n\nIf we stay at y=6, no progress.\n\nProblem.\n\nFrom t=91, y=7, safe.\n\nInstead of moving at t=91, we could stay or go down.\n\nBut if we go down to y=6 at t=92, safe.\n\nThen at t=92, y=6, we can stay or go up or down.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to go up.\n\nIf at t=92, y=6, action U: t=93, y=7\n\nBut t=93, y=7, ΔT=9, dangerous, collision.\n\nIf we stay at t=92, y=6, action S: t=93, y=6, still safe, but not progress.\n\nThen later we need to go up.\n\nBut t=93 is dangerous for y=7 and y=8, but y=6 is fine.\n\nWe need to wait until after t=93.\n\nAfter t=93, the dangerous times for y=7 and y=8 are over? Only at t=85,92,93, so after t=93, no more danger for y=7 and y=8.\n\nt=93 is the last dangerous time.\n\nThen we can proceed.\n\nFor example, at t=92, y=6, we can stay: action S, then t=93, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=93, action U: t=94, y=7\n\nNow t=94, y=7, ΔT=10, not dangerous (danger only 1,8,9), so safe.\n\nThen action U: t=95, y=8, ΔT=11, not dangerous, safe.\n\nThen action U: t=96, y=9, reached.\n\nSo H=12 turns? Let's count.\n\nActions from t=84 to t=84+H-1, and at t=84+H, y=9.\n\nStart t=84, y=0\n\nAfter actions: let's list turns and y after action.\n\nAt turn t, after choosing a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSequence:\n\nt=84: choose a_{84}, y_{85} = y_{84} + Δy_{a_{84}} = 0 + Δy\n\nIf a_{84}=U, y_{85}=1\n\nThen t=85: choose a_{85}, y_{86} = y_{85} + Δy, etc.\n\nWe want y_{t} for t from 85 onwards.\n\nSet t=84: position y=0\n\nChoose a_{84}: if U, then at t=85, y=1\n\nIn the sequence above for min time but avoiding:\n\nFrom t=84 to t=90: as before, with U each time.\n\nt=84: a=U → t=85 y=1\n\nt=85: a=U → t=86 y=2\n\nt=86: a=U → t=87 y=3\n\nt=87: a=U → t=88 y=4\n\nt=88: a=U → t=89 y=5\n\nt=89: a=U → t=90 y=6\n\nNow at t=90, we are at y=6 (position at t=90)\n\nChoose a_{90}: if U, then t=91 y=7\n\nBut at t=91 y=7, safe, as ΔT=7\n\nThen at t=91, choose action.\n\nInstead of going up, we need to avoid being at y=7 or 8 at t=92 and t=93.\n\nSo at t=91, we can go down to y=6 at t=92.\n\na_{91}=D, then y_{92} = y_{91} -1 =7-1=6\n\nThen at t=92, y=6, safe.\n\nNow at t=92, choose action.\n\nWe can stay or go up.\n\nIf go up, a_{92}=U, then y_{93}=6+1=7\n\nBut at t=93, y=7, ΔT=93-84=9, dangerous, collision.\n\nIf stay, a_{92}=S, y_{93}=6\n\nThen at t=93, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=93, we can go up: a_{93}=U, y_{94}=7\n\nt=94, y=7, ΔT=10, not dangerous, safe.\n\nThen a_{94}=U, y_{95}=8, ΔT=11, safe.\n\na_{95}=U, y_{96}=9, reached.\n\nSo at t=96, y=9.\n\nNow, number of actions: from t=84 to t=95, actions a_{84} to a_{95}, that's 12 actions? t=84 to t=95 inclusive is 12 turns? Let's index.\n\nActions: a_{84}, a_{85}, ..., a_{95}\n\nThat's from k=0 to 11, 12 actions.\n\nAfter 12 actions, at turn t=84 + 12 = 96, y=9.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut we started at t=84, after H actions at t=84+H, y=9.\n\nWith H=12, t=96.\n\nBut earlier min was 9, but we added 3 turns: we stayed at y=6 for t=92 and t=93? In the sequence:\n\nAfter a_{90} at t=90, we have y=6 at t=90? Positions:\n\nAfter actions:\n\n- After a_{84} at t=84: y_{85}=1\n\n- After a_{85} at t=85: y_{86}=2\n\n- ...\n\n- After a_{89} at t=89: y_{90}=6? Let's list y at time t.\n\nAt time t=84: y=0 (initial)\n\nAfter action a_{84}: at time t=85, y=1\n\nAfter a_{85}: at t=86, y=2\n\nAfter a_{86}: at t=87, y=3\n\nAfter a_{87}: at t=88, y=4\n\nAfter a_{88}: at t=89, y=5\n\nAfter a_{89}: at t=90, y=6\n\nNow at t=90, we choose a_{90}. In the avoiding path:\n\nAt t=90, choose a_{90}: if we go U, y_{91}=7\n\nBut then at t=91, we need to go down or something.\n\nIn my earlier plan, I had:\n\nAt t=90, after y_{90}=6, we choose a_{90}.\n\nTo go to y=7 at t=91, which is safe.\n\nThen at t=91, choose a_{91}: D, so y_{92} = y_{91} -1 =7-1=6\n\nThen at t=92, y=6\n\nThen at t=92, choose a_{92}: S, so y_{93} = y_{92} +0 =6\n\nThen at t=93, y=6\n\nThen a_{93}: U, y_{94}=7\n\na_{94}: U, y_{95}=8\n\na_{95}: U, y_{96}=9\n\nNow, actions taken: from t=84 to t=95: a_{84} to a_{95}, that's 12 actions.\n\nThe sequence of actions: a_{84}=U, a_{85}=U, a_{86}=U, a_{87}=U, a_{88}=U, a_{89}=U, a_{90}=U, a_{91}=D, a_{92}=S, a_{93}=U, a_{94}=U, a_{95}=U\n\nAt t=96, y=9.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nWe could go slower at the beginning to avoid the problem.\n\nFor example, start later.\n\nBut min time should be faster.\n\nAnother idea: since y=1 has danger later, but we go through y=1 early, which is fine.\n\nThe issue is only at y=7 and y=8 around t=92-93.\n\nWe need to be not on y=7 or 8 at t=92 and t=93.\n\nIn the direct path, we are on y=8 at t=92 and y=9 at t=93.\n\nBut t=92 y=8 collision.\n\nSo we need to be at y<=6 or y=9 at t=92 and t=93.\n\ny=9 at t=93 is possible, but to be at y=9 at t=93, we need to be at y=8 at t=92 or earlier, but t=92 is bad for y=8.\n\nIf we can be at y=8 before t=92 or after.\n\nBut before t=92: t=91, if y=8 at t=91, ΔT=7, for y=8, dangerous times are 1,8,9, ΔT=7 not in, so safe.\n\nThen at t=91 y=8, safe.\n\nThen at t=92, if we go U to y=9, t=92 action U, y_{93}=9, and at t=93 y=9, not on freeway, safe.\n\nBut at t=92, when we are on y=8? At turn t, we are at y_t.\n\nAt time t=91, y=8, we choose action a_{91}.\n\nIf a_{91}=U, then at t=92, y=9.\n\nNow, at turn t=92, we are at y=9, not on freeway, so no collision.\n\nAnd for the action, at turn t=91, we are on y=8, which at t=91, ΔT=7, not dangerous, safe.\n\nThen at t=92, we are at y=9, safe.\n\nBut we reached at t=92? y=9 at t=92.\n\nIn this case:\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=91.\n\nt=91, y=8.\n\nHow to get there.\n\nStart from t=84 y=0.\n\nEach step up increases y by 1.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=91, that means from t=84 to t=91, 7 turns? t=84 to t=91 is 7 steps? Time from t=84 to t=91 is 7 intervals, but positions.\n\nAt t=84, y=0\n\nAfter 7 up actions: a_{84} to a_{90}, then at t=91, y=7? Let's see.\n\nAfter a_{84}: t=85 y=1\n\nAfter a_{85}: t=86 y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{90}: t=91 y=7? Actions from t=84 to t=90: 7 actions, to y=7 at t=91.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=91, we need 8 up actions.\n\nAfter k up actions, y at t=84 + k.\n\nAfter 0 actions: t=84 y=0\n\nAfter 1 action: t=85 y=1\n\nAfter 2: t=86 y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter m actions: at t=84 + m, y=m\n\nTo have y=8 at time t, t=84 + m, so m=8, t=92.\n\nAt time t=92, after 8 actions, y=8.\n\nBut we want y=8 at time t=91.\n\nt=91, y=8.\n\nBut at t=91, y=8, that means after some actions.\n\nAt time t, y_t.\n\nFor y_t = y at time t.\n\ny_{84} =0\n\ny_{85} = y_{84} + Δy_{a_{84}} = 0 + Δy\n\nIf we do U at t=84, y_{85}=1\n\nSimilarly, y_{86} = y_{85} + Δy_{a_{85}}, etc.\n\nTo have y_{91} =8.\n\nThat means from t=84 to t=91, we have 7 steps (from t=85 to t=91, 6 intervals? Let's think of net displacement.\n\ny_{91} = y_{84} + sum_{k=84}^{90} Δy_{a_k}\n\nSince y_{84}=0, y_{91} = sum_{k=84}^{90} Δy_{a_k}\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1.\n\ny_{91} =8, so sum of 7 terms (k=84 to 90 inclusive, that's 7 actions) must be 8.\n\nBut each |Δy| <=1, so sum <=7, cannot be 8. Impossible to have y=8 at t=91 with actions from t=84 to 90.\n\nMaximum y at t=91 is 7, if all U.\n\ny_{91} = number of up moves from actions a_{84} to a_{90}, which affect y_{85} to y_{91}.\n\nActions a_t at turn t affect y_{t+1}.\n\na_{84} affects y_{85}\n\na_{85} affects y_{86}\n\n...\n\na_{90} affects y_{91}\n\nSo y_{91} depends on a_{84} to a_{90}, 7 actions.\n\nEach can add at most +1, so y_{91} <=7.\n\nSimilarly, y_{92} <=8, etc.\n\nSo earliest to reach y=8 is at t=92, with all U: y_{92}=8.\n\nBut at t=92, if y=8, collision.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 at t=93 with all U.\n\nBut at t=92, y=8 collision.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=8 at t=92.\n\nWe must be below or above.\n\nBut above not possible, so below: y<=6 or y=7 but y=7 also collision at t=92.\n\nAt t=92, we must not be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nSo must be on y<=6 or y=9.\n\ny=9 at t=92 requires y_{92}=9, which needs 9 up moves by t=92, but from t=84 to t=92, actions a_{84} to a_{91}, 8 actions, y_{92} <=8, so y_{92}=9 impossible.\n\nThus at t=92, we must be on y<=6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=93, if we are on y=7 or 8, collision, so must be on y<=6 or y=9.\n\ny=9 at t=93 possible with all U: y_{93}=9.\n\nIn min path, we can aim to be at y=9 at t=93, but to do that, we need to be at y=8 at t=92, but t=92 y=8 collision, contradiction.\n\nIf we are at y=8 at t=91, which is safe, then at t=91, action U, to y=9 at t=92.\n\nThen at t=92, y=9, safe.\n\nAnd at t=91, y=8, ΔT=7, safe.\n\nNow, how to be at y=8 at t=91.\n\nBut as above, y_{91} <=7, cannot be 8.\n\ny_{91} maximum 7.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=8 before t=92.\n\nThus, the only way is to be below at t=92 and t=93, then go up after.\n\nAs in my first plan: reach y=6 at t=90, then stay or go down to be at y=6 for t=92 and t=93, then go up to y=9 by t=96.\n\nBut H=12.\n\nPerhaps we can reach higher earlier and wait.\n\nFor example, go up to y=6 quickly, then at t=90, y=6, instead of going up, we stay or something.\n\nBut we need to kill time until after t=93.\n\nThe dangerous times are only t=92 and t=93 for y=7 and y=8, but since we can't be on them safely at those times, we avoid being on them.\n\nWe can be on y=7 or y=8 at other times.\n\nFor example, we can go to y=7 at t=91, safe, then at t=91, go down to y=6 at t=92, safe.\n\nThen at t=92, we can go up to y=7 at t=93, but t=93 y=7 collision.\n\nSo we must not go up at t=92 if it leads to y=7 at t=93.\n\nAt t=92, if we are at y=6, we can stay: a_{92}=S, y_{93}=6, safe.\n\nThen after t=93, go up.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we should go up as fast as possible until y=6, then wait at y=6 for two turns (t=92 and t=93), then go up to y=9 in three more turns.\n\nFrom start: to reach y=6: need 6 up actions.\n\nFrom t=84 to t=89: actions a_{84} to a_{89}, with U each, then after a_{89}, y_{90}=6.\n\nActions: a_{84} U: y85=1\n\na85 U: y86=2\n\na86 U: y87=3\n\na87 U: y88=4\n\na88 U: y89=5\n\na89 U: y90=6\n\nNow at t=90, y=6, we need to be at y=6 for t=92 and t=93.\n\nAt t=90, we choose a_{90}.\n\nIf we do S, then y_{91}=6\n\nThen at t=91, y=6, choose a_{91}: if S, y_{92}=6\n\nThen at t=92, y=6, choose a_{92}: S, y_{93}=6\n\nThen at t=93, y=6, now we can go up.\n\na_{93} U: y_{94}=7\n\na_{94} U: y_{95}=8\n\na_{95} U: y_{96}=9\n\nNow, actions: from a_{84} to a_{95}, 12 actions, same as before.\n\nBut at t=91, we are at y=6, which is fine, but we could have gone to y=7 and back.\n\nIn the first version, I went to y=7 at t=91 and down to y=6 at t=92.\n\nThat also takes the same time.\n\nIn terms of turns to reach, both reach at t=96.\n\nBut in the go-up-and-down, we have an extra move: to y=7 and back, which doesn't progress.\n\nIn the stay version, we stay at y=6 from t=90 to t=93, with actions S.\n\nIn both cases, we reach y=9 at t=96 with 12 actions.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nSuppose we go slower at the beginning.\n\nFor example, at some point, we wait at lower y.\n\nBut since y=1 to 6 except y=1 later, but we pass y=1 early, no issue.\n\ny=1 danger at t=100-103, which is late, so if we go fast, we are past y=1 by then.\n\nIn min time to y=6, we are at y=6 by t=90.\n\nThen we need to wait until t=93 to start going up again, because from y=6 to y=9, min 3 turns, but we can start going up at t=93 to reach y=9 at t=96.\n\nIf we go up at t=93, y94=7; t=94 y95=8; t=95 y96=9.\n\nBut at t=94 y=7, ΔT=10, safe; t=95 y=8, ΔT=11, safe.\n\nYes.\n\nBut we need to be at y=6 at t=93 to start.\n\nAt t=93, y=6.\n\nHow to be at y=6 at t=93.\n\nFrom start, we can reach y=6 earlier and stay, or go slower.\n\nFor example, if we take more time to reach y=6.\n\nBut that might not help, since we can reach y=6 at t=90, and stay until t=93, then go up.\n\nMin H: the constraining point is that we cannot be on y=7 or 8 from t=92 to t=93, but since we need to cross them, we must cross before or after.\n\nBefore: we can be on y=8 at t=91, safe, but we cannot reach y=8 before t=92.\n\nAfter: we can go up after t=93.\n\nSo after t=93, we can go up safely.\n\nThus the min time is to reach y=6 as fast as possible, by t=90, then stay at y=6 for turns t=91,92,93? Positions.\n\nAt t=90, y=6\n\nWe need to have y=6 at t=93 to go up at t=93.\n\nAt t=93, y=6.\n\nFrom t=90 y=6 to t=93 y=6, we need to stay for three turns? But with actions.\n\nAt t=90, we choose a_{90}, to set y_{91}.\n\nIf we want y_{91}=6, we can do S or D, but D to 5, not good.\n\nSo a_{90}=S, then y_{91}=6\n\nThen at t=91, a_{91}=S, y_{92}=6\n\nAt t=92, a_{92}=S, y_{93}=6\n\nThen at t=93, a_{93}=U, y_{94}=7\n\netc.\n\nSo we have three stay actions at t=90,91,92 to keep y=6 for t=91,92,93.\n\nt=91 y=6, t=92 y=6, t=93 y=6.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut at t=93, we go to y=7 at t=94.\n\nNow, total actions: to reach y=6: actions from t=84 to t=89, 6 actions (a84 to a89), y90=6\n\nThen a90=S, y91=6\n\na91=S, y92=6\n\na92=S, y93=6\n\nThen a93=U, y94=7\n\na94=U, y95=8\n\na95=U, y96=9\n\nSo actions a84 to a95, 12 actions, same as before.\n\nIn the first go-up-down: we had a90=U, y91=7; a91=D, y92=6; a92=S, y93=6; then a93=U, y94=7; etc.\n\nStill 12 actions.\n\nBut in go-up-down, we used a90=U and a91=D, which cancel, so net no progress, same as staying.\n\nSo H=12 is min?\n\nBut we have y=1 danger at t=100-103, but since we reach y=9 by t=96, which is before t=100, no issue with y=1.\n\nt=96 <100, so y=1 not a problem.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=11?\n\nSuppose we reach y=6 at t=90 with 6 actions.\n\nThen we need to reach y=9 by t=95? After H actions, at t=84+H, y=9.\n\nWith H=11, t=84+11=95.\n\ny_{95}=9.\n\ny_{95} = sum of Δy from a84 to a94, 11 actions.\n\nEach Δy <=1, so y_{95} <=11, but we need y=9, possible.\n\nBut we must be not on y=7 or 8 at t=92 and t=93.\n\nt=92 and t=93 must have y<=6 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 at t=92 or t=93 impossible as before.\n\nSo at t=92 and t=93, y<=6.\n\nNow, y_{95}=9.\n\ny_{92} <=6.\n\ny_{93} <=6.\n\nThen from y_{93} <=6 to y_{95}=9, in two steps? From t=93 to t=95, actions a93 and a94 affect y94 and y95.\n\ny_{94} = y_{93} + Δy_{a93}\n\ny_{95} = y_{94} + Δy_{a94}\n\ny_{95} = y_{93} + Δy_{a93} + Δy_{a94}\n\ny_{93} <=6, and y_{95}=9, so Δy_{a93} + Δy_{a94} >=3, but each <=1, impossible.\n\nThus, with y_{93} <=6, we can have y_{95} <= 6 + 2 = 8 < 9, cannot reach y=9 by t=95.\n\nSimilarly, if H=10, t=94, y=9, even worse.\n\nThus min H=12, reaching at t=96.\n\nBut with H=12, t=96.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we can choose to stay or go up and down.\n\nIn the answer, we need the sequence.\n\nAlso, in the beginning, we have y=1 at t=85, which is safe, as established.\n\nNow, another thing: freeway 6 has cars, but we said no collision, so safe.\n\nIn the sequence, let's write it.\n\nStart at t=84, y=0\n\nWe can do the stay version or the up-down version.\n\nPerhaps the stay version is simpler.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 84: U  (to y=1 at t=85)\n\nTurn 85: U  (y86=2)\n\nTurn 86: U  (y87=3)\n\nTurn 87: U  (y88=4)\n\nTurn 88: U  (y89=5)\n\nTurn 89: U  (y90=6)\n\nNow at t=90, we need to stay at y=6 for the next positions.\n\nTo have y=6 at t=91,92,93.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 90: S  (so y91=6)\n\nTurn 91: S  (y92=6)\n\nTurn 92: S  (y93=6)\n\nNow at t=93, go up.\n\nTurn 93: U  (y94=7)\n\nTurn 94: U  (y95=8)\n\nTurn 95: U  (y96=9)\n\nNow, we have actions from turn 84 to 95, that's 12 actions: t=84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95.\n\nAt turn 96, y=9.\n\nIn the answer, we need to list actions for turns starting from t1=84.\n\nThe sequence is for t=84 to t=84+H-1.\n\nHere H=12, so turns t=84 to t=95.\n\nActions: U,U,U,U,U,U,S,S,S,U,U,U\n\nIn the up-down version:\n\nTurn 84: U (y85=1)\n\n85: U (y86=2)\n\n86: U (y87=3)\n\n87: U (y88=4)\n\n88: U (y89=5)\n\n89: U (y90=6)\n\n90: U (y91=7)  // go to y=7 at t=91, safe\n\n91: D (y92=6)  // down to y=6 at t=92, safe\n\n92: S (y93=6)  // stay, y=6 at t=93\n\n93: U (y94=7)\n\n94: U (y95=8)\n\n95: U (y96=9)\n\nSame number, and we have an extra move to y=7 and back, but same H.\n\nNow, in this case, at t=91 we were on y=7, which is safe, no issue.\n\nBut we don't need to, the stay is fine.\n\nNow, about y=1 danger: at t=100-103, but we are done by t=96, so no problem.\n\nIn the sequence, we are never on y=1 at that time.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nSo minimal H=12.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1 collision at t=100 to 103, which is after we finish, so irrelevant.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo I think H=12 is min.\n\nNow for the answer, we need to output the sequence.\n\nIn the format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 84: a_{84}\nTurn 85: a_{85}\n...\n}\n\nWith actions.\n\nI'll use the first stay version.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: S\n\nTurn 91: S\n\nTurn 92: S\n\nTurn 93: U\n\nTurn 94: U\n\nTurn 95: U\n\nAfter that, at turn 96, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, last action at turn 95.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut let's write the turns from 84 to 95.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 84: U\nTurn 85: U\nTurn 86: U\nTurn 87: U\nTurn 88: U\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: S\nTurn 91: S\nTurn 92: S\nTurn 93: U\nTurn 94: U\nTurn 95: U\n}\n\nBut is there a way with H=11? We saw not, because of the need to be low at t=92,93.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=5 or something, but same.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 and y=8 are safe at other times, we could go to y=7 earlier and stay, but earlier times: for example, at t=85, y=7 is dangerous, but we can't reach y=7 that early.\n\nMin to reach y=7 is t=91 with all U.\n\nt=91 is safe, but then t=92 dangerous.\n\nIf we reach y=7 at t=91, and stay, but at t=92, y=7 collision.\n\nSo cannot stay on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, only option is to be below during t=92,93.\n\nThus, H=12 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 84\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 12. This sequence involves moving up to \\(y = 6\\) as quickly as possible, waiting at \\(y = 6\\) during turns 91, 92, and 93 to avoid collisions on freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) at critical times, and then moving up to \\(y = 9\\).\n\n### Collision Avoidance Reasoning:\n- Freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\) are safe at all times, as no cars on these freeways can cause a collision at position \\(x = 0\\) for any turn.\n- Freeway \\(y = 1\\) has collision risk at turns \\(t = 100\\) to \\(103\\) (relative \\(\\Delta T = 16\\) to \\(19\\)), but the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) by turn 96, so this is not encountered.\n- Freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) have collision risks at turns \\(t = 85, 92, 93\\) (relative \\(\\Delta T = 1, 8, 9\\)):\n  - At \\(t = 92\\) and \\(t = 93\\), being on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) causes a collision.\n  - To avoid this, the player must be at \\(y \\leq 6\\) or \\(y = 9\\) at \\(t = 92\\) and \\(t = 93\\). Since \\(y = 9\\) is not possible by \\(t = 93\\) with minimal actions, the player stays at \\(y = 6\\) during these turns.\n\n### Sequence Details:\n- Turns 84 to 89: Move up to reach \\(y = 6\\) by turn 90.\n- Turns 90 to 92: Stay at \\(y = 6\\) (actions S) to avoid being on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 92\\) and \\(t = 93\\).\n- Turns 93 to 95: Move up to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 96.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{84 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{11}\\) (for \\(H = 12\\)) is as follows:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 84: U \\\\\nTurn 85: U \\\\\nTurn 86: U \\\\\nTurn 87: U \\\\\nTurn 88: U \\\\\nTurn 89: U \\\\\nTurn 90: S \\\\\nTurn 91: S \\\\\nTurn 92: S \\\\\nTurn 93: U \\\\\nTurn 94: U \\\\\nTurn 95: U\n}\n\nAfter these 12 actions, at turn 96, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) safely. This sequence is minimal, as \\(H = 11\\) or fewer turns would require being on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 92\\) or \\(t = 93\\), leading to collision, or failing to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 95.",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 0) at turn t₁ = 90, and needs to get to (0, 9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The vertical position y ranges from 0 to 9.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S) each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, but y must stay within [0,9]. Since we're going from y=0 to y=9, moving down isn't useful except possibly to avoid cars, but since we start at 0 and need to go to 9, and 0 is the bottom, down might not be needed. y=0 is probably safe since there are no cars there; cars are only on y=1 to 8.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, if there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn, then collision occurs. But note: if you move to a new freeway, you're not considered on it until the next turn. Specifically, it says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nLet me parse that. At turn T, you are on freeway y_T. If you choose an action that changes y, so y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, and if Δy ≠ 0, then at turn T, you are still on y_T, and you will be on y_{T+1} starting from turn T+1.\n\nThe collision check is only for the freeway you are currently on at that turn. So at turn T, you are on freeway y_T, and you check if for that freeway k = y_T, there is a car with 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nIf you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, so you check cars on y_T at turn T. Then at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so you check cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe note clarifies that when you move to a new row, you don't get collided during the move; only when you are stationary on a row do you check for that row.\n\nIn this case, since we're moving vertically, and cars are on horizontal freeways, the collision is per row per turn.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=0 to y=9, passing through y=1 to y=8, but I can skip some or move up and down, but since we want minimal turns, probably we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoiding the cars.\n\nThe minimal number of turns to go from 0 to 9 with only up moves is 9 turns: U, U, U, ..., U nine times to go from y=0 to y=9. But y starts at 0, after one U, y=1, after two, y=2, ..., after nine U, y=9. So H=9 turns if no cars.\n\nBut there are cars, so we might need to delay or something to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's list the car states at turn t₁=90.\n\nFor each freeway k, there are cars with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: right means moving right, so as time increases, the car moves to the right, so the span increases in position.\n\nFrom the update:\n\nLeft-moving: span [h, τ] becomes [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] for Δt = T - t₁\n\nRight-moving: span [τ, h]? No, for right-moving, it says: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nI need to interpret head and tail.\n\nFor example, on freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, head should be the front, I think.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, at t₁, Span = [τ, h], so τ is left end, h is right end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h left, τ right? Let's see.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nSince it's moving left, decreasing position, so if h and τ, with h being head, probably head is the front, so for left-moving, front is left, so h is smaller than τ? In this case, h = -48, τ = -59, so h = -48, τ = -59, so h > τ since -48 > -59.\n\nPosition: I assume increasing to the right, so left is smaller position, right is larger.\n\nSo for a car, head is the front, tail is the rear.\n\nFor left-moving car, front is left, so head is left end, tail is right end? But in the span, it's given as [h, τ] for left-moving.\n\nIn freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, head should be the right end, tail left end.\n\nIn the span definition for right-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] so τ is tail, h is head, with τ < h since moving right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] with h head, τ tail, and since moving left, h > τ? In this case for freeway 1, it's right, so let's not confuse.\n\nGeneral: for a car, head is the front, tail is the rear, relative to direction.\n\nFor right-moving: front is right, so head is larger position, tail is smaller.\n\nSpan is from tail to head, so [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nFor left-moving: front is left, so head is smaller position, tail is larger, span [h, τ] with h < τ? But in the update, for left-moving, [h, τ] → [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt], so if moving left, positions decrease, so h and τ both decrease, and since head is left, h < τ, so [h, τ] with h left, τ right.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nDirection right, so head should be right end, tail left end. But here h = -48, τ = -59, so -48 > -59, so h = -48, τ = -59, so tail is -59, head is -48, so tail left, head right, yes τ < h.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision: at turn T, for a freeway, if the player is on that freeway, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\n0 is the position, I assume, where the player is always at x=0, so we care if a car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when cars cover x=0 between turns.\n\nBut since the player moves vertically, we need to know for each turn and each row if it's safe to be there.\n\nFirst, let's define the time from t₁=90.\n\nSet τ = t - t₁, so at τ=0, turn 90.\n\nWe need to find actions from τ=0 to τ=H-1, with y_{τ} starting from y_0=0 at τ=0.\n\nAfter H turns, at τ=H, we have y_H =9? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to H-1, so at time t₁ + t, action a, for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter action at t₁ + t, position at t₁ + t +1.\n\nDefine: at turn T, we apply action a_T, then position y_{T+1} is set.\n\nBut collision is checked at each turn T based on y_T.\n\nStart: at turn t₁=90, position (0, y_{t₁}) = (0,0), so y_{90} =0.\n\nThen we apply action a_{90} at turn 90, which determines y_{91} = y_{90} + Δy_{90}.\n\nThen at turn 91, position y_{91}, check collision on freeway y_{91} at turn 91.\n\nSimilarly, after H actions, at turn t₁ + H, position should be (0,9), so y_{90 + H} =9.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so actions at times t₁ to t₁ + H -1, resulting in positions from y_{t₁} to y_{t₁ + H}.\n\ny_{t₁} is given, after H actions, y_{t₁ + H} should be 9.\n\nIn this case, y_{90} =0, we want y_{90 + H} =9 after H actions.\n\nEach action changes y, so from y=0 to y=9, with each U increasing y by 1, so minimum 9 U actions, but we can have S or D, which might be needed to wait or avoid, so H >=9.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need exactly 9 net up movements, but since we can move down or stay, H could be more than 9 if we have S or D.\n\nBut to minimize H, we want as few S or D as possible, so ideally H=9 with all U, but we need to avoid collisions.\n\nNow, for each freeway k=1 to 8, we need to find the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when some car covers x=0.\n\nThen for the player, when on that row at that time, collision.\n\nSince the player moves row by row, we need to be on row k at a time when it is safe.\n\nBut the player can be on a row for multiple turns, or skip it quickly.\n\nAlso, when moving, at the turn when you are on a row, it must be safe.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway the times when x=0 is covered by a car.\n\nTime is in terms of τ = t - t₁, so at τ=0, turn 90.\n\nFor a car, at time T (absolute), Δt = T - t₁ = τ.\n\nSo for a car, Span at time T is given by the update.\n\nFirst, for right-moving car: initial span at t₁: [τ, h], so at T, span [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: initial [h, τ] to [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nx=0 is covered if min(span) <= 0 <= max(span)\n\nSince span is an interval.\n\nNow for each freeway, list the cars.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nSo tail τ = -59, head h = -48, direction right, speed 3.\n\nAt time T, span [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-59 + 3(τ), -48 + 3(τ)] since Δt = τ.\n\nx=0 covered if -59 + 3τ <= 0 <= -48 + 3τ\n\nSo -59 + 3τ <= 0 => 3τ <= 59 => τ <= 59/3 ≈ 19.666, so τ <= 19 since τ integer? Time is in turns, so τ integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -48 + 3τ => 48 <= 3τ => τ >= 16.\n\nSo for τ from 16 to 19 inclusive, x=0 covered.\n\n-59 + 3τ <= 0 <= -48 + 3τ\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 3τ <= 0 => 3τ <= 59 => τ <= 19.666, so since τ integer, τ <= 19\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 + 3τ => 48 <= 3τ => τ >= 16\n\nSo for τ=16,17,18,19, unsafe on freeway 1.\n\nNow freeway 2: (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nCars: only one? The table says for freeway 2: (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nBut head=48, tail=37, direction right.\n\nSo at t₁, span [τ, h] = [37, 48]\n\nAt T, [37 + 12τ, 48 + 12τ]\n\nx=0 covered if 37 + 12τ <= 0 <= 48 + 12τ\n\nBut 37 + 12τ <=0? Since τ >=0, 37+12τ >=37>0, so left part always false, so never covered? 37 +12τ >0 for all τ, so min span >0, so 0 not covered, always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, (48,37,right,12), same thing, min position 37+12τ >0, so always safe.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (48,37,right,12), always safe.\n\nFreeway 5: same, (48,37,right,12), always safe.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12), same as above, min position 37+12τ >0, so never covers x=0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12)\n\nHead=0, tail=-11, direction right.\n\nAt t₁, span [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T, [-11 + 12τ, 0 + 12τ] = [-11 + 12τ, 12τ]\n\nx=0 covered if -11 + 12τ <= 0 <= 12τ\n\nFirst: -11 +12τ <=0 => 12τ <=11 => τ <= 11/12 <1, so since τ >=0 integer, τ=0: -11 <=0 true, but 0<=12τ, for τ=0, 0<=0 true, so at τ=0, covered.\n\n-11 +12τ <=0 => τ <= 11/12, so τ <=0 since τ integer >=0, τ=0.\n\nAnd 0 <= 12τ always true for τ>=0.\n\nAt τ=0, -11 +0 = -11 <=0 <=0, yes 0 is included.\n\nFor τ=1, -11+12=1 >0, so min=1>0, not covered.\n\nSo only at τ=0, unsafe for this car.\n\nBut on freeway 6, there is another car which is always safe, but this one makes it unsafe at τ=0.\n\nNow, freeway 7: two cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nTail τ = -59, head h = -48, direction right.\n\nAt T, span [-59 + 6τ, -48 + 6τ]\n\nx=0 covered if -59 +6τ <=0 <= -48 +6τ\n\nFirst: -59 +6τ <=0 => 6τ <=59 => τ <= 59/6 ≈9.833, so τ <=9\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +6τ => 48 <=6τ => τ >=8\n\nSo for τ=8,9\n\n-48 +6τ, at τ=8: -48+48=0, so 0<=0 true.\n\nAt τ=7: -48+42= -6 <0, so 0 <= -6 false? 0 <= -48 +6τ\n\nAt τ=7: -48 +42 = -6, 0 <= -6 false.\n\nAt τ=8: -48+48=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nAt τ=9: -48+54=6, 0<=6 true.\n\nAnd first inequality: -59+6τ <=0\n\nAt τ=8: -59+48= -11 <=0 true\n\nτ=9: -59+54= -5 <=0 true\n\nτ=10: -59+60=1>0 false\n\nSo for τ=8 and 9, covered.\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: (0,-11,right,6)\n\nHead=0, tail=-11, direction right.\n\nAt T, span [-11 +6τ, 0 +6τ] = [-11+6τ, 6τ]\n\nx=0 covered if -11+6τ <=0 <=6τ\n\n-11+6τ <=0 => 6τ <=11 => τ <= 11/6 ≈1.833, so τ<=1\n\nAnd 0<=6τ always for τ>=0.\n\nSo at τ=0: -11<=0<=0 true? 0<=0 true.\n\nτ=1: -11+6= -5 <=0 <=6 true? 0<=6 true, and -5<=0 true.\n\nAt τ=1, min=-5, max=6, so 0 in between.\n\nτ=2: min=-11+12=1, max=12, min=1>0, not covered.\n\nSo for this car, unsafe at τ=0 and τ=1.\n\nNow for freeway 7, both cars: first car unsafe at τ=8,9; second car unsafe at τ=0,1.\n\nSo overall, freeway 7 unsafe when either, so τ=0,1,8,9.\n\nNow freeway 8: similar, two cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6) same as freeway 7.\n\nSo unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9.\n\nNow freeway 1 we have unsafe τ=16,17,18,19.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5: always safe, as established.\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe only at τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, for freeway 6, the second car covers x=0.\n\nBut τ=0 is turn t₁=90.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at τ=0.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway with cars, freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nAt τ=0, player is on y=0, which has no cars, so safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nNow, for each freeway k=1 to 8, we have the unsafe times.\n\nk=1: unsafe τ=16,17,18,19\n\nk=2: always safe\n\nk=3: always safe\n\nk=4: always safe\n\nk=5: always safe\n\nk=6: unsafe at τ=0 only\n\nk=7: unsafe τ=0,1,8,9\n\nk=8: unsafe τ=0,1,8,9\n\nThe player must be on each row at some point, but not necessarily, since we can go directly, but to go from 0 to 9, we need to pass through each row, but we can be on a row for multiple turns or skip quickly.\n\nThe minimal way is to go up each turn, but we need to avoid being on a row when it is unsafe.\n\nWe start at τ=0, y=0.\n\nAfter action, we move to y at next turn.\n\nLet me denote the position at time τ, but time τ corresponds to turn t₁ + τ.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nFor turn T, when we are on y_T, it must be safe at that turn.\n\nThe sequence:\n\nAt turn 90 (τ=0), y=0, safe.\n\nWe apply action a_{90}, which determines y_{91}.\n\nThen at turn 91 (τ=1), y_{91}, must be safe on that row.\n\nSimilarly for subsequent turns.\n\nWe want y_{90 + H} =9.\n\nSince we start at y=0 and end at y=9, and each U increases y by 1, the minimal actions involve 9 U moves, and possibly some S or D, but D would decrease y, which might not be efficient, so probably only S or U.\n\nTo minimize H, we should use U as much as possible, and S only when necessary to wait.\n\nD might be used if we need to go down to avoid, but from 0 to 9, down from 0 is impossible since y=0, D would try to go to -1, but y must be in [0,9], so if y=0 and D, probably y stays 0 or something? The update says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=0 and a_t=D, Δy=-1, y_{t+1} = -1, but must be >=0, so probably clamped to 0? Not specified.\n\nLook at player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if it goes out of bound, it should be clamped.\n\nBut not specified, but to be safe, assume it is clamped, so from y=0, D would keep y=0, similarly at y=9, U would keep y=9.\n\nBut in this case, since we start at 0 and go to 9, D is not useful, so actions should be U or S only.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, U does nothing.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nSo possible actions U or S.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, S keeps y same.\n\nTo go from 0 to 9, we need exactly 9 U actions, and some S actions, so H = 9 + number of S.\n\nMinimal H is 9 if possible with all U, but we need to avoid collisions.\n\nNow, the path: we need to be at each y from 1 to 8 at some turn, but not necessarily sequentially if we stay, but since we can only change by 0 or ±1, we must pass through each integer y between min and max, but since we start at 0 and end at 9, we will hit each y from 0 to 9, but y=0 and 9 are safe, so we care about y=1 to 8.\n\nAt each turn, when we are on a row y, it must be safe at that time.\n\nNow, time τ from 0.\n\nWe need to assign for each row the time when we are on it, but the times are constrained by the movement.\n\nLet t_k be the turn when we first reach row k or something, but since we can stay, it's the set of times when on row k.\n\nBut for collision, at each time we are on a row, it must be safe.\n\nTo minimize time, we want to go up as fast as possible, so we should spend as little time as possible on the rows, meaning we should not stay unnecessarily, only stay to avoid.\n\nSince all U might not be possible, we need to find when to stay.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=0.\n\nAfter action at τ=0, y at τ=1.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some τ.\n\nSince we start at y=0, after H actions, y_{90+H} =9.\n\nThe position at time τ is y_τ, which depends on the actions.\n\nLet s_τ be the action at time τ (relative to t₁, so at turn t₁ + τ).\n\ns_τ = U, D, or S.\n\nBut D not useful, so s_τ = U or S.\n\ny_{τ} for τ=0 is 0.\n\nThen y_{τ+1} = y_τ + 1 if s_τ = U, or y_τ if s_τ = S.\n\ny_{τ+1} is after action at τ.\n\nDefine the state at the beginning of turn.\n\nAt turn t₁ + τ, position y_{t₁ + τ}, then we apply action, get y_{t₁ + τ +1}.\n\nCollision checked at turn t₁ + τ based on y_{t₁ + τ}.\n\nFor simplicity, let τ be the time index from 0.\n\nAt time τ, position y_τ (at turn t₁ + τ).\n\nThen action a_τ, then y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ.\n\nCollision at time τ if y_τ is between 1 and 8, and for that row, unsafe at time τ.\n\ny_τ is the row at time τ.\n\nWe start at τ=0, y_0=0, safe.\n\nWe need y_H =9 for some H.\n\nThe sequence y_τ must satisfy y_{τ+1} = y_τ or y_τ ±1, but since D not useful, y_{τ+1} = y_τ or y_τ +1.\n\nAnd y_τ in [0,9].\n\ny_0=0, y_H=9.\n\nThe number of U actions is exactly the increase in y, from 0 to 9, so 9 U actions, and S actions for waiting.\n\nH = number of turns, which includes all actions.\n\nSince we have 9 U, and some S, H = 9 + number of S.\n\nMinimal H when number of S is minimal, ideally 0.\n\nBut we need to avoid unsafe times.\n\nNow, for each row, the unsafe times:\n\nList for each k, unsafe τ.\n\nk=1: unsafe at τ=16,17,18,19\n\nk=2: always safe\n\nk=3: always safe\n\nk=4: always safe\n\nk=5: always safe\n\nk=6: unsafe at τ=0\n\nk=7: unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9\n\nk=8: unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9\n\nNote that at τ=0, y_0=0, which is not k=1-8, so no issue.\n\nThe player needs to be on k=1 at some time not in {16,17,18,19}, similarly for others.\n\nSince we move step by step, we need to consider the sequence.\n\nWe want to go up quickly.\n\nSuppose we try to go up each turn: actions all U from τ=0 to 8.\n\nThen:\n\nAt τ=0, y=0, action U, y_1=1\n\nτ=1, y=1, action U, y_2=2\n\n...\n\nτ=8, y=8, action U, y_9=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt τ=0: y=0, safe.\n\nτ=1: y=1, which is freeway 1. At τ=1, is it safe? k=1 unsafe at τ=16-19, τ=1 not in, so safe? But we need to check for the row at that time.\n\nAt τ=1, y_τ=1, row 1, which is unsafe only at τ=16-19, so τ=1 safe.\n\nSimilarly, τ=2: y=2, row 2, always safe.\n\nτ=3: y=3, row 3, safe.\n\nτ=4: y=4, row 4, safe.\n\nτ=5: y=5, row 5, safe.\n\nτ=6: y=6, row 6. At τ=6, is row 6 safe? k=6 unsafe only at τ=0. τ=6 ≠0, so safe.\n\nτ=7: y=7, row 7. k=7 unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9. τ=7 not in, so safe? τ=7, not 0,1,8,9, so safe.\n\nτ=8: y=8, row 8. k=8 unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9. τ=8 is unsafe! Oh, problem.\n\nAt τ=8, y=8, which is row 8, and k=8 unsafe at τ=8.\n\nSo collision if we are on row 8 at τ=8.\n\nIn this sequence, at τ=8, y=8, and row 8 unsafe at τ=8, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up, at τ=8 we are on y=8 when it is unsafe.\n\nAlso, at τ=9, we would be on y=9, safe, but we have a problem at τ=8.\n\nIn the sequence above, at τ=8, y=8, action U, so we move to y=9 at τ=9.\n\nBut at the turn when we are on y=8, which is τ=8, it must be safe, but it's not.\n\nSo we cannot be on row 8 at τ=8.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 at τ=8 would be safe, but in the sequence we are at different rows.\n\nWe need to adjust.\n\nFor row 8, it is unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9.\n\nτ=0 and 1 are early, τ=8 and 9 are when we might be there.\n\nSimilarly for row 7, same unsafe times.\n\nNow, we also have row 1 unsafe later at τ=16-19, but since we are going fast, we might not be affected if we pass early.\n\nIn the all U sequence, we are on row 8 at τ=8, which is unsafe.\n\nWe need to avoid being on row 8 at τ=8 or τ=9? τ=8 and 9 are both unsafe for row 8.\n\nUnsafe times: τ=0,1,8,9 for row 8.\n\nSo we cannot be on row 8 at τ=8 or 9.\n\nSimilarly, for row 7, cannot be at τ=0,1,8,9.\n\nNow, in the fast path, we are on row 7 at τ=7, which is not unsafe (unsafe 0,1,8,9, τ=7 safe), and row 8 at τ=8, unsafe.\n\nSo to fix, we need to be on row 8 at a different time.\n\nSince we can stay or move slower.\n\nFor example, we can stay on some row to delay.\n\nWe need to reach row 8 when it is safe.\n\nRow 8 is safe except at τ=0,1,8,9.\n\nSo safe for τ=2,3,4,5,6,7,10,... etc.\n\nSimilarly for row 7, safe except τ=0,1,8,9.\n\nNow, we also have row 6, which is unsafe only at τ=0, but τ=0 we are at y=0, so when we are on row 6, as long as not at τ=0, safe. Since τ starts from 0, and we start at y=0, when we first reach row 6, τ>=1, so safe.\n\nNo issue with row 6.\n\nRows 2,3,4,5 always safe.\n\nRow 1 unsafe at τ=16-19, but if we pass early, no problem.\n\nThe critical part is rows 7 and 8 around τ=8,9.\n\nIn the fast path, we are on row 7 at τ=7 (safe), then to row 8 at τ=8 (unsafe).\n\nWe need to be on row 8 at τ≠8,9.\n\nFor example, we could stay on row 7 for one turn.\n\nSequence:\n\nStart τ=0, y=0, action U? Or S? Let's list actions.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0, we can do U to go to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nSince y=0 safe, and we want to move.\n\nOption: at τ=0, action S, stay y=0, then at τ=1 y=0, but row 0 safe, but we waste time.\n\nBetter to move up if possible.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0, action U, so y_1=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=1, which is row 1. Now row 1 unsafe only at τ=16-19, τ=1 not in, so safe. Action U, y_2=2.\n\nτ=2, y=2, row 2 safe, U, y_3=3\n\nτ=3, y=3, row 3 safe, U, y_4=4\n\nτ=4, y=4, row 4 safe, U, y_5=5\n\nτ=5, y=5, row 5 safe, U, y_6=6\n\nτ=6, y=6, row 6 safe (since τ=6≠0), U, y_7=7\n\nτ=7, y=7, row 7. Now row 7 unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9. τ=7 not in, so safe. But if we do U, y_8=8 at τ=8, which is unsafe for row 8.\n\nInstead, at τ=7, we can do S, stay on y=7.\n\nThen at τ=8, y=7 (since action S at τ=7, y_8=7)\n\nNow at τ=8, y=7, row 7. But row 7 is unsafe at τ=8! Because τ=8 is one of unsafe times for row 7.\n\nk=7 unsafe at τ=8, yes.\n\nIf we stay on row 7 at τ=8, it is unsafe.\n\nBut row 7 unsafe at τ=8, so we cannot be on row 7 at τ=8.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on row 8 at τ=8.\n\nIn fact, for both row 7 and 8, τ=8 and τ=9 are unsafe.\n\nNow, at τ=7, if we are on row 7, and it is safe at τ=7, but if we stay, at τ=8 we are on row 7 which is unsafe.\n\nIf we go up to row 8 at τ=8, also unsafe.\n\nSo we need to not be on row 7 or 8 at τ=8 or τ=9.\n\nWe need to pass row 7 before τ=8 or after τ=9.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nSince we are at row 7 at τ=7, which is safe, but we need to leave before τ=8 or something.\n\nAt τ=7, y=7, safe.\n\nWe can go up to row 8 at τ=8, but unsafe.\n\nOr stay, but at τ=8, if we stay on row 7, also unsafe.\n\nOr go down, but from row 7, down to row 6.\n\nBut row 6 is safe at all times except τ=0, which is past.\n\nSo possible to go down.\n\nBut going down might increase time.\n\nTo minimize H, we should avoid going down if possible.\n\nAnother option: delay reaching row 7.\n\nFor example, stay earlier.\n\nBut let's see the times.\n\nWe need to reach row 9 eventually.\n\nThe unsafe window for rows 7 and 8 is τ=8 and 9.\n\nSo if we can be on row 7 before τ=8 or after τ=9.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nFor example, be on row 7 at τ=7 (safe), and then since at τ=8 we cannot be on row 7 or 8, we could go down to row 6 at τ=8.\n\nThen at τ=8, y=6 (if we go down from row 7).\n\nAction at τ=7: if we do D, from y=7, y_8=6.\n\nThen at τ=8, y=6, which is row 6, safe since τ=8≠0.\n\nThen from there, we can go up again.\n\nBut we were at row 7, then down to 6, then need to go up to 7 and 8 later, which costs extra turns.\n\nSimilarly, we could have stayed longer on lower rows to delay.\n\nBut let's see if we can avoid going down.\n\nAnother idea: since rows 2-6 are safe except row 6 at τ=0, but we pass later, so all safe.\n\nWe can spend time on those rows to wait until after τ=9.\n\nFor example, at some point before reaching row 7, we stay for a few turns.\n\nThen reach row 7 after τ=9.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nBut row 7 and 8 have same unsafe times, but we need to be on both.\n\nThe minimal delay.\n\nCurrently in fast path, we reach row 7 at τ=7.\n\nWe need to be on row 7 at τ ≠ 0,1,8,9. Since τ=7 is ok, but the problem is the next step.\n\nAt τ=7, we are on row 7, safe.\n\nIf we go to row 8 at τ=8, unsafe.\n\nIf we stay, at τ=8 on row 7, unsafe.\n\nIf we go down to row 6 at τ=8, then safe, but then at τ=8, y=6.\n\nThen we need to go back to row 7.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt τ=7, y=7, instead of U or S, do D, so y_8=6.\n\nThen at τ=8, y=6, row 6 safe, action U, y_9=7\n\nAt τ=9, y=7, row 7. But row 7 unsafe at τ=9! Because τ=9 is unsafe.\n\nk=7 unsafe at τ=9.\n\nAt τ=9, y=7, row 7, unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\nAction at τ=8: y=6, we could do S or U.\n\nIf at τ=8, y=6, action U, y_9=7.\n\nThen at τ=9, y=7, row 7, which is unsafe at τ=9.\n\nIf we do S at τ=8, y=6, stay, y_9=6, then at τ=9, y=6, row 6 safe, but we are not on row 7 yet.\n\nThen later we need to go up.\n\nBut at τ=9, if we are on row 7, it is unsafe.\n\nSo to avoid being on row 7 at τ=9.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 at τ=9 unsafe.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nAfter going down to row 6 at τ=8, we can stay on row 6 for a while.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt τ=7, y=7, action D, y_8=6\n\nτ=8, y=6, action S, y_9=6 (stay)\n\nτ=9, y=6, action U, y_10=7\n\nNow at τ=10, y=7, row 7. Now τ=10, is it safe? k=7 unsafe only at τ=0,1,8,9, so τ=10 safe.\n\nThen action U, y_11=8\n\nAt τ=11, y=8, row 8. τ=11, unsafe times for row 8 are τ=0,1,8,9, so τ=11 safe.\n\nThen U to y=9 at τ=12.\n\ny_12=9.\n\nNow, we started from y=0 at τ=0.\n\nActions:\n\nτ=0: U to y=1\n\nτ=1: U to y=2\n\n...\n\nUp to τ=6: from y=6 U to y=7 at τ=7\n\nAt τ=6, y=6, action U, y_7=7\n\nτ=7, y=7, action D, y_8=6\n\nτ=8, y=6, action S, y_9=6\n\nτ=9, y=6, action U, y_10=7\n\nτ=10, y=7, action U, y_11=8\n\nτ=11, y=8, action U, y_12=9\n\nNow y_12=9, so after 12 actions, y=9.\n\nH=12 turns? Let's list the turns.\n\nτ from 0 to 11 for actions, 12 actions.\n\ny at τ=0: 0\n\nAfter action at τ=0: y_1=1\n\n...\n\nAfter action at τ=11: y_12=9\n\nSo we have y_12=9, so H=12.\n\nBut we used one D and one S, so extra turns.\n\nCan we do with fewer?\n\nH=12, but minimal possible is 9, but we have delay.\n\nWe could avoid going down by waiting earlier.\n\nFor example, stay on a safe row before reaching row 7.\n\nIn the fast path, we reach row 6 at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=6, y=6, which is safe.\n\nInstead of going up immediately, we can stay on row 6 for a few turns until after τ=9.\n\nThen go up.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt τ=6, y=6, action S (stay) instead of U.\n\nThen at τ=7, y=6 (if we did S at τ=6), action S again? Or go up.\n\nWe need to wait until τ=10 or later to go to row 7, since row 7 unsafe at τ=8,9.\n\nUnsafe τ=8,9 for row 7.\n\nSo we should not be on row 7 at τ=8 or 9.\n\nSimilarly, we can be on row 7 at τ=7 or τ=10, etc.\n\nIn this case, at τ=6, if we stay, y=6.\n\nτ=7, y=6, we can stay or go up.\n\nIf we go up at τ=7 to y=7, then at τ=7, y=7 safe, but then at τ=8, if we go to y=8, unsafe, or stay y=7 unsafe.\n\nSame problem.\n\nSo at τ=7, if we are on y=6, we can choose to go to y=7 or not.\n\nBut if we go to y=7 at τ=7, we are stuck for next turn.\n\nBetter to wait on row 6.\n\nStay on row 6 until τ=9, then go up.\n\nFor example:\n\nUp to τ=5: let's list from start.\n\nτ=0: y=0, U to y=1\n\nτ=1: y=1, U to y=2\n\nτ=2: y=2, U to y=3\n\nτ=3: y=3, U to y=4\n\nτ=4: y=4, U to y=5\n\nτ=5: y=5, U to y=6  // now at τ=6, y=6\n\nAt τ=6: y=6, instead of U, do S, so y_7=6 (stay)\n\nAt τ=7: y=6, action S, y_8=6 (stay)\n\nAt τ=8: y=6, action S, y_9=6 (stay)\n\nNow at τ=9: y=6, row 6 safe.\n\nNow, we need to go to row 7.\n\nAction U, y_10=7\n\nAt τ=10: y=7, row 7. τ=10, safe (not 0,1,8,9)\n\nAction U, y_11=8\n\nτ=11: y=8, row 8, τ=11 safe (not 0,1,8,9)\n\nAction U, y_12=9\n\nSame as before, H=12 with three S actions.\n\nWorse than previous with D and S.\n\nIn previous with down, we had H=12 with actions: U,U,U,U,U,U,U,D,S,U,U,U? Let's count.\n\nIn first workaround: actions from τ=0 to 11.\n\nτ=0: U (to y=1)\n\nτ=1: U (y=2)\n\nτ=2: U (y=3)\n\nτ=3: U (y=4)\n\nτ=4: U (y=5)\n\nτ=5: U (y=6)\n\nτ=6: U (y=7) // at τ=7 y=7\n\nτ=7: D (y=6) // to y=6 at τ=8\n\nτ=8: S (y=6) // stay, y=6 at τ=9\n\nτ=9: U (y=7) // to y=7 at τ=10\n\nτ=10: U (y=8) // to y=8 at τ=11\n\nτ=11: U (y=9) // to y=9 at τ=12\n\ny_12=9, so 12 actions.\n\nWith only staying: at τ=6,7,8 we stay on y=6, then τ=9 U to y=7, τ=10 U to y=8, τ=11 U to y=9, same 12 actions but with three S instead of D and S.\n\nSlightly worse, but same H.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nNotice that row 7 and 8 are both safe at τ=7, for example.\n\nBut at τ=7, we can be on row 7, safe.\n\nThen at τ=8, we cannot be on row 7 or 8.\n\nSo if we go down to row 6 at τ=8, as before.\n\nBut then at τ=9, we are on row 6, but row 7 is unsafe at τ=9, so we cannot go to row 7 immediately at τ=9.\n\nWe have to wait until τ=10 to go to row 7.\n\nSimilarly, we could be on row 6 at τ=8 and τ=9.\n\nThen go to row 7 at τ=10.\n\nBut we lost time.\n\nAnother idea: after being on row 7 at τ=7, instead of going down, we go up to row 8 at a different time, but we can't because of the timing.\n\nPerhaps we can reach row 7 later by staying earlier.\n\nBut we start from low, so to delay, we need to stay on lower rows.\n\nFor example, stay on row 5 or something.\n\nBut row 5 is always safe, so we can stay.\n\nSuppose we stay on row 5 for two turns.\n\nFor example:\n\nτ=0: U to y=1\n\nτ=1: U to y=2\n\nτ=2: U to y=3\n\nτ=3: U to y=4\n\nτ=4: U to y=5  // at τ=5 y=5\n\nAt τ=5: action S, y_6=5 (stay)\n\nAt τ=6: action S, y_7=5 (stay)  // now at τ=7 y=5\n\nThen at τ=7: U to y=6\n\nAt τ=8: y=6, U to y=7? But at τ=8, if we go to y=7, then at τ=8 y=7, but row 7 unsafe at τ=8.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt τ=8: y=6, we can do S, y_9=6\n\nThen at τ=9: y=6, U to y=7\n\nAt τ=10: y=7, U to y=8\n\nAt τ=11: y=8, U to y=9\n\nBut now, when did we pass row 6?\n\nAt τ=7: from y=5 U to y=6, so at τ=8 y=6? Let's sequence:\n\nAt τ=7: position y=5, action U, so y_8=6\n\nAt τ=8: y=6, action S or U.\n\nIf at τ=8, y=6, action S, then y_9=6\n\nτ=9: y=6, action U, y_10=7\n\nτ=10: y=7, action U, y_11=8\n\nτ=11: y=8, action U, y_12=9\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt τ=8, y=6, if we go U to y=7, then at τ=8 y=7, unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo we have to avoid row 7 at τ=8.\n\nSimilarly, we need to reach row 7 after τ=9.\n\nEarliest after τ=9 is τ=10.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nIn the sequence, we can be on row 6 at τ=6, then stay on row 6 until τ=9, then at τ=9 go to row 7? But at τ=9, if we go to row 7, at time τ=9 we are on row 7, but τ=9 unsafe for row 7.\n\nWhen we go to row 7 at τ=9, at turn τ=9, position y_9.\n\nIf we apply action at τ=9 to go to y=7, that means from y_9 to y_{10}=7.\n\nAt turn τ=9, position is y_9, which is before action.\n\nTo be on row 7 at turn τ, we need y_τ =7.\n\nFor example, to be on row 7 at τ=10, we need y_10=7.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the sequence, from row 6, if at turn τ, y_τ=6, and we do U, then y_{τ+1}=7, so at turn τ+1, we are on row 7.\n\nTo be on row 7 at τ=10, we need to apply U at τ=9 when y_9=6, then y_10=7.\n\nSimilarly, to be on row 8 at τ=11, for example.\n\nNow, back to delaying.\n\nWe need to be on row 7 at some τ not in {0,1,8,9}, so τ=2,3,4,5,6,7,10,11,... but since we are coming from below, τ=10 or later.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nThe fastest is to be on row 7 at τ=10, row 8 at τ=11, row 9 at τ=12.\n\nNow, we need to reach row 6 by some time.\n\nIn the early part, we can go fast to row 6.\n\nFrom start: to reach row 6.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0, U to y=1 at τ=1\n\nτ=1, y=1, U to y=2 at τ=2\n\n...\n\nτ=5, y=5, U to y=6 at τ=6\n\nSo at τ=6, y=6.\n\nWe can stay on row 6 from τ=6 to τ=9.\n\nAt τ=6, y=6, do S, y_7=6\n\nτ=7, y=6, do S, y_8=6\n\nτ=8, y=6, do S, y_9=6\n\nThen at τ=9, y=6, do U, y_10=7\n\nAt τ=10, y=7, do U, y_11=8\n\nAt τ=11, y=8, do U, y_12=9\n\nH=12.\n\nWe have three S actions on row 6.\n\nBut row 6 is safe at all times except τ=0, so fine.\n\nCan we reach row 6 later? No, because we start from below.\n\nWe could stay on lower rows to reduce the stay on row 6.\n\nFor example, stay on row 5 for one turn.\n\nAt τ=4, y=4, U to y=5 at τ=5\n\nAt τ=5, y=5, instead of U, do S, so y_6=5\n\nThen at τ=6, y=5, U to y=6, so y_7=6\n\nNow at τ=7, y=6\n\nThen we need to stay on row 6 until after τ=9.\n\nAt τ=7, y=6, do S, y_8=6\n\nτ=8, y=6, do S, y_9=6\n\nτ=9, y=6, U to y_10=7\n\nThen as before, y_11=8, y_12=9\n\nBut now we reached row 6 at τ=7 instead of τ=6, and we still have two S on row 6, and one S on row 5, so H=12 same.\n\nWorse because we stayed extra on row 5.\n\nIn the first down move version, we had only one extra S and one D, but D might be as costly as S in terms of time, since both don't progress.\n\nIn terms of H, both take extra turns.\n\nBut in the down move, we used a D, which might be avoidable.\n\nAnother idea: since row 1 is unsafe at τ=16-19, but we pass early, no issue.\n\nBut we can use that to our advantage? Probably not, since we are fast.\n\nPerhaps we can go to row 8 before τ=8.\n\nFor example, reach row 7 earlier.\n\nBut we start from y=0 at τ=0.\n\nTo reach row 7, minimal at τ=7, since each U takes one turn.\n\nAt τ=7, y=7.\n\nWe can be on row 7 at τ=7, safe.\n\nThen at τ=8, we need to not be on row 7 or 8.\n\nSo we must go down to row 6.\n\nThen at τ=8, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at τ=9, we cannot go to row 7 because row 7 unsafe at τ=9.\n\nSo we must stay on row 6 or go down, but go down not useful.\n\nStay on row 6 at τ=9.\n\nThen at τ=10, go to row 7.\n\nSo same as before.\n\nPerhaps from row 6 at τ=8, we can go to row 5 or something, but that would take more time.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, minimal H seems to be 12.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can do H=11.\n\nSuppose we reach row 7 at τ=7.\n\nThen instead of down, is there another way? No.\n\nReach row 7 later, but we can't reach before τ=7.\n\nUnless we start with S, but that delays more.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, S, stay y=0, then at τ=1 y=0, U to y=1 at τ=2, then slower, reach row 7 later, say at τ=8 or something, but row 7 unsafe at τ=8, so we need to reach at τ=10, which takes more initial delay, H larger.\n\nFor example, to reach row 7 at τ=10, we need to have y=6 at τ=9, so we must be at lower rows longer.\n\nFor instance, stay on row 0 or something, but y=0 safe, but we can go up to row 1,2,etc. and stay on safe row.\n\nBut to reach y=6 by τ=9, for example.\n\nAt τ=0: U to y=1\n\nτ=1: U to y=2\n\nτ=2: U to y=3\n\nτ=3: U to y=4\n\nτ=4: U to y=5  // y_5=5 at τ=5\n\nτ=5: S, y_6=5\n\nτ=6: S, y_7=5?

But to reach row 8 at τ=7, we need to be at row 7 at τ=6, row 6 at τ=5, etc.\n\nAt τ=0: y=0, U to y=1 at τ=1\n\n...\n\nτ=5: y=5, U to y=6 at τ=6\n\nτ=6: y=6, U to y=7 at τ=7\n\nτ=7: y=7, U to y=8 at τ=8\n\nBut at τ=8, y=8, row 8 unsafe.\n\nIf at τ=7, we go directly to row 8, but at τ=7, from y=7, U to y=8, then at τ=8 y=8, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nReach row 8 at τ=10, but then we need to be on row 7 at τ=9 or something, but row 7 unsafe at τ=9.\n\nFor example, to be on row 8 at τ=10, need to apply U at τ=9 from y=7.\n\nSo y_9=7, then U to y=8 at τ=10.\n\nBut at turn τ=9, y=7, row 7, and τ=9 unsafe, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nTo be on row 8 at τ=10, we need y_10=8, so at turn τ=10, position y=8.\n\nApplied action at τ=9 from y=7.\n\nBut at τ=9, y=7, which must be safe, but row 7 unsafe at τ=9, so we cannot be on row 7 at τ=9 to go to row 8.\n\nSimilarly, if we go from row 6 at τ=9 to row 7 at τ=10, but then row 8 at τ=11.\n\nAs before.\n\nSo impossible to have row 8 at τ=10 without being on row 7 at τ=9 or something.\n\nThus H=12 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need the sequence.\n\nIn the down move sequence, we have a D, which might be acceptable.\n\nTo avoid D, we can use the stay-only sequence.\n\nBut D is allowed, and it works.\n\nPerhaps we can have a sequence with H=11 by careful timing, but I think not.\n\nAnother point: row 6 is unsafe only at τ=0, but we are not on it then.\n\nIn our sequences, fine.\n\nSo I think H=12.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nUsing the down move sequence for variety.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nTurn 92: U\n\nTurn 93: U\n\nTurn 94: U\n\nTurn 95: U  // to y=6 at turn 96?

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 0) on turn t_1 = 96. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns H, by moving up (U), down (D), or staying (S) each turn, without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where there is a car that spans the x=0 position at that exact turn. Also, when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn, so they only check for collision on their current y at the start of the turn.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t_1=96, and I need to compute where they are at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\n- Freeway 2: one car, (48, 37, right, 12)  -- head 48, tail 37? That seems odd because for right-moving, head should be greater than tail? Let me check the notation.\n\nIn the car update, for left-moving: span [h, τ] moves to [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt]\n\nFor right-moving: span [τ, h] moves to [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt]\n\nIn the state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor right-moving, it should be that head is the leading part, so for right-moving, head > tail, and span is [tail, head] or something? Let's read carefully.\n\nIn the freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nh = -48, τ = -59, d = right.\n\nSince d=right, it's right-moving, so the span should be [τ, h] = [-59, -48] at t=96.\n\nThen at future turn T, span = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-59 + 3(T-96), -48 + 3(T-96)]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nh=48, τ=37, d=right, so span at t=96 is [τ, h] = [37, 48]\n\nAt T, [37 + 12(T-96), 48 + 12(T-96)]\n\nBut 37 to 48, that's a small car, length 11, moving right at speed 12.\n\nFreeway 3,4,5 same as freeway 2: all (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: same as above, span [37,48] at t=96\n\nSecond car: h=0, τ=-11, d=right, so span [τ, h] = [-11, 0] at t=96\n\nThen at T, [ -11 + 12(T-96), 0 + 12(T-96) ] = [12(T-96) -11, 12(T-96)]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, span [τ,h] = [-59,-48] at t=96\n\nAt T: [ -59 + 6(T-96), -48 + 6(T-96) ]\n\nSecond car: h=0, τ=-11, d=right, span [τ,h] = [-11,0] at t=96\n\nAt T: [ -11 + 6(T-96), 0 + 6(T-96) ]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at turn 96.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway with cars, so no collision there. Freeways are y=1 to y=8.\n\nPlayer needs to go to y=9, which is also not a freeway, so no cars there.\n\nThe path is through y=1 to y=8, and we need to avoid when cars are at x=0.\n\nCollision at turn T if player is on freeway k, and for that freeway, at turn T, there is a car where 0 is in its span, meaning min(span) <= 0 <= max(span).\n\nSince the span is an interval.\n\nFor example, for a car, at time T, if left-moving, span [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt], and if this interval contains 0, collision.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] contains 0.\n\nΔt = T - t_1 = T - 96\n\nNow, player movement: each turn, can change y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nStart at y=0, need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns would be at least 9, if we go up every turn, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 9.\n\nBut we need minimal H, so probably we want to go up as much as possible, but avoid the times when cars are at x=0.\n\nSince the cars move, we need to find when it's safe to be on each freeway.\n\nThe player is on a freeway only when they are at that y, and at that turn, we check for collision.\n\nAlso, when moving to a new y, at turn T, if we move to y_{T+1}, at turn T we are still on y_T, so we only care about cars on y_T at turn T for collision.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are on y_{T+1}, so we care about cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nSo for each freeway k, I need to find the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when there is a car on k with 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nThen, for the player, when traversing from y=0 to y=9, we need to be on each freeway only when it's safe.\n\nBut since we can stay or move down, we can delay or adjust the path.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the set of turns when it is unsafe.\n\nDefine Δt = T - 96, so at Δt=0, it's turn 96.\n\nFor freeway 1: k=1\n\nCars: only one, (-48,-59,right,3)\n\nSpan at Δt: [ -59 + 3*Δt, -48 + 3*Δt ]\n\nSet min = -59 + 3Δt, max = -48 + 3Δt\n\n0 in span if min <= 0 <= max, so -59 + 3Δt <= 0 and -48 + 3Δt >= 0\n\nWhich is 3Δt <= 59 and 3Δt >= 48\n\nSo Δt <= 59/3 = 19.666, so Δt <= 19 since integer\n\nΔt >= 48/3 = 16\n\nSo for Δt from 16 to 19 inclusive, unsafe.\n\nΔt = T-96, so turns T=96+16=112 to T=96+19=115.\n\nT=112,113,114,115 unsafe for freeway 1.\n\nNow freeway 2: k=2\n\nCars: (48,37,right,12)\n\nSpan at Δt: [37 + 12Δt, 48 + 12Δt]\n\nMin = 37 + 12Δt, max = 48 + 12Δt\n\nBoth positive since at Δt=0, min=37>0, so for all Δt, min >=37>0, so 0 never in span. So always safe? 37 to 48, all positive, moving right, so indeed, span is always positive, never contains 0. So freeway 2 is always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same car, (48,37,right,12), same as above, always safe.\n\nFreeway 4: same, always safe.\n\nFreeway 5: same, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 6: k=6\n\nTwo cars:\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) same as above, span [37+12Δt, 48+12Δt], always >0, never contains 0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12)\n\nh=0, τ=-11, d=right, span at Δt: [ -11 + 12Δt, 0 + 12Δt ] = [12Δt -11, 12Δt]\n\nSet 0 in span: min <= 0 <= max\n\n12Δt -11 <= 0 and 12Δt >= 0\n\n12Δt >=0 always for Δt>=0\n\n12Δt -11 <=0 => 12Δt <=11 => Δt <= 11/12 = 0.916, so Δt <=0 since integer Δt\n\nΔt <=0, but Δt >=0, so only at Δt=0: min = 12*0 -11 = -11 <=0, max=0, so 0 is included? min=-11, max=0, so yes, 0 is in [-11,0], so at Δt=0, it contains 0.\n\nAt Δt=1, min=12*1-11=1, max=12, both >0, 0 not in [1,12]\n\nFor Δt>0, min >=1>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSo for second car, unsafe only at Δt=0.\n\nBut Δt=0 is turn T=96.\n\nNow for freeway 6, at turn T, unsafe if either car has 0 in span.\n\nFirst car never, second car only at Δt=0.\n\nSo freeway 6 is unsafe only at turn 96 (Δt=0).\n\nNow freeway 7: k=7\n\nTwo cars:\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nSpan at Δt: [ -59 + 6Δt, -48 + 6Δt ]\n\n0 in span: -59 + 6Δt <=0 and -48 + 6Δt >=0\n\n6Δt <=59 => Δt <= 59/6=9.833, so Δt <=9\n\n6Δt >=48 => Δt >=8\n\nSo Δt from 8 to 9 inclusive.\n\nT=96+8=104 to 96+9=105.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6)\n\nSpan at Δt: [ -11 + 6Δt, 0 + 6Δt ] = [6Δt -11, 6Δt]\n\n0 in span: 6Δt -11 <=0 and 6Δt >=0\n\n6Δt >=0 always\n\n6Δt -11 <=0 => 6Δt <=11 => Δt <= 11/6 ≈1.833, so Δt <=1\n\nSo unsafe for Δt=0 and Δt=1.\n\nΔt=0: min=-11<=0, max=0\n\nΔt=1: min=6*1-11=-5<=0, max=6>0, so yes, 0 in [-5,6]\n\nΔt=2: min=12-11=1>0, not <=0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSo second car unsafe at Δt=0 and 1.\n\nNow for freeway 7, unsafe if either car has issue.\n\nFirst car unsafe at Δt=8,9\n\nSecond car unsafe at Δt=0,1\n\nSo overall unsafe at Δt=0,1,8,9\n\nT=96,97,104,105\n\nFreeway 8: k=8\n\nSame as freeway 7: cars (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nSo same unsafe times: Δt=0,1,8,9 → T=96,97,104,105\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway when unsafe:\n\ny=1: unsafe at T=112,113,114,115\n\ny=2: always safe\n\ny=3: always safe\n\ny=4: always safe\n\ny=5: always safe\n\ny=6: unsafe only at T=96\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=96,97,104,105\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=96,97,104,105\n\ny=6 is unsafe only at T=96, but since player starts at y=0 at T=96, and y=6 is not current, so when player is on y=6, it might be later.\n\nNow, player starts at T=96, y=0.\n\nAt each turn, player chooses action: U, D, or S, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, with y clamped to [0,9].\n\nGoal: reach y=9 in min turns.\n\nSince we start at y=0 and end at y=9, and can only change by 1 per turn, min possible H is 9, if we go up every turn from T=96 to T=104, for example: T=96: y=0, then U to y=1 at T=97, ..., up to T=104: y=8, then U to y=9 at T=105? Let's see:\n\nAt turn T, after action, position is for that turn.\n\nTurn T=96: start at y=0\n\nAfter action at T=96, y_{97} = y_96 + Δy, but position at turn T is (0, y_T)\n\nThe state: at turn t, position is (0, y_t)\n\nThen action a_t determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nBut for collision, at turn T, we care about y_T and the cars on that freeway at that turn.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nT=96: y=0, not on freeway, no collision.\n\nThen action a_96: if U, y_{97} =1\n\nThen at T=97, y=1, on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo reach y=9 at some turn, say at turn T_final, y_{T_final} =9.\n\nSince y starts at 0, and increases by at most 1 per turn, to reach y=9, we need at least 9 up moves, so H >=9.\n\nH is the number of turns including start, but from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nStart at turn 96, position y=0.\n\nAfter H turns, we have done H actions, from t=96 to t=96 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H-1\n\nAfter action at t, we have y_{t+1}, but at turn t, we have y_t.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t is set, then we perform action a_t, which sets y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\nAt turn t, we check collision based on y_t and cars at t.\n\nThen for turn t+1, we have y_{t+1}, check cars at t+1, and so on.\n\nAt the start, turn t_1=96, y_{96}=0.\n\nAfter actions, at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe actions are from t=96 to t=96 + H -1, H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, we have H new positions, from y_{97} to y_{96+H}, but the last position is at turn 96+H.\n\nSet t = turn number.\n\nStart: turn 96, y=0\n\nAfter action a_96, y_97 is set.\n\nTurn 97: y_97, then action a_97, sets y_98, and so on.\n\nAt turn T, we have y_T defined, and we check collision for that turn.\n\nWe want at some turn T_final = 96 + H -1, y_{96 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe number of actions is H, from t=96 to t=96+H-1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, action at t=96, then at turn 97, y_97 should be 9, but from y_96=0, we can only go to y=1,0, or -1 but clamped, so min y=0, so cannot reach y=9 in 1 action. Min H is 9: from y=0 to y=9, need 9 up moves, so at least 9 actions.\n\nAfter 9 actions: actions at t=96 to t=104, then at turn 105, y_105 =9? Let's see:\n\nTurn 96: y=0\n\na_96: U, then y_97=1\n\nTurn 97: y=1\n\na_97: U, y_98=2\n\n...\n\na_104: U, y_105=9\n\nTurn 105: y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nBut during the path, we need to be safe on freeways y=1 to 8 at the turns we are there.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 97: y=1, on freeway 1\n\nTurn 98: y=2, freeway 2\n\n...\n\nTurn 104: y=8, freeway 8\n\nTurn 105: y=9, no freeway.\n\nNow, freeway 1 is unsafe at T=112,113,114,115. But T=97 is 96+1=97, which is Δt=1, and unsafe starts at 112, which is later, so at T=97, freeway 1 should be safe? Let's check the unsafe times.\n\nFor freeway 1, unsafe at T=112,113,114,115, which is Δt=16 to 19.\n\nT=97 is Δt=1, which is not in 16-19, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 always safe.\n\nFreeway 3,4,5 always safe.\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe at T=96, but at T=102? In the sequence, when is player on freeway 6.\n\nIn the direct path:\n\nTurn 97: y=1\n\n...\n\nTurn 102: y=6 (since 96:0, 97:1, ..., 102:6)\n\ny at turn T: T=96:0, T=97:1, T=98:2, T=99:3, T=100:4, T=101:5, T=102:6, T=103:7, T=104:8, T=105:9\n\nSo on freeway 6 at turn T=102.\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe only at T=96, which is earlier, so at T=102, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 at T=103? T=103: y=7\n\nUnsafe at T=96,97,104,105\n\nT=103 is not in that list, so safe.\n\nFreeway 8 at T=104, unsafe at T=104 and 105? T=104 is in unsafe for y=8? Freeway 8 unsafe at T=104 and 105.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn T=104, y=8, which is freeway 8, and T=104 is unsafe.\n\nOh, problem.\n\nAt turn 104, y=8, freeway 8 is unsafe at T=104 and 105.\n\nSo collision if we are there.\n\nSimilarly, at T=105, y=9, not on freeway, but at T=104, we are on y=8, which is unsafe.\n\nSo in the direct path, we collide at T=104 on freeway 8.\n\nAlso, freeway 7 at T=103: y=7, unsafe times T=96,97,104,105, T=103 not included, so safe.\n\nBut y=8 at T=104 is unsafe.\n\nWe need to avoid that.\n\nAlso, for y=7, unsafe at T=104 and 105, but at T=103 it is safe.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9, so we need to be at y=8 at some point before going to y=9.\n\nBut at T=104 and 105, y=8 is unsafe.\n\nSo we need to be on y=8 at a different time when it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 might have issues at other times.\n\nFirst, let's list all unsafe times for each freeway:\n\ny=1: unsafe T=112,113,114,115\n\nBut these are late, since min H is around 9, T=105 for direct, but 112 is later, so if we go slowly, we might hit that, but we want min H, so probably we finish before that, so y=1 unsafe times might not affect us if we go early.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 unsafe only at T=96, which is start, but we are on y=6 at T=102, which is fine.\n\ny=7 unsafe at T=96,97,104,105\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=96,97,104,105\n\nNow, for min H, we want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nStart at T=96, y=0.\n\nWe need to be on y=8 at some turn when it is safe.\n\ny=8 safe except at T=96,97,104,105.\n\nT=96 and 97 are early, we might not be on y=8 then.\n\nT=104 and 105 are when we would be there in direct path.\n\nBut we can be on y=8 at other times.\n\nFor example, if we go slower or faster.\n\nSince we start from y=0, to reach y=9, we need to pass through y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe critical part is y=7 and y=8 around T=104-105.\n\ny=7 is unsafe at 104,105, but safe at other times, like T=103 or earlier or later.\n\nSimilarly y=8.\n\nIn the direct path, we are at y=7 at T=103, which is safe, then at T=104 we go to y=8, but y=8 is unsafe at T=104.\n\nIf we stay on y=7 for one more turn, but at T=104, y=7 is unsafe.\n\ny=7 unsafe at T=104,105.\n\nAt T=103, y=7 is safe, but if we stay, at T=104, y=7, unsafe.\n\nIf we go up to y=8 at T=104, also unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\nSo at around T=104, both y=7 and y=8 are unsafe.\n\nSpecifically, y=7 unsafe at T=104 and T=105.\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=104 and T=105.\n\nSo from T=104 to T=105, both freeways 7 and 8 are unsafe.\n\nBut we need to be on one of them to cross.\n\nFor example, to be on y=7 at T=103 (safe), then at T=103 action, we can go to y=8 at T=104, but T=104 y=8 unsafe.\n\nOr stay on y=7 at T=104, but T=104 y=7 unsafe.\n\nOr go down to y=6, but that might delay.\n\nSimilarly, at T=105, if we are on y=8, unsafe, or y=7 unsafe.\n\nBut y=9 is safe.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 during T=104 and T=105.\n\nWe can be on y=7 before or after, and y=8 before or after.\n\nFor example, we can be on y=7 at T=103, which is safe, then we need to go to y=8, but not at T=104 or T=105.\n\nSimilarly, we can go to y=8 at T=106 or later, but that increases H.\n\nSince min H is desired, we want to reach y=9 asap.\n\nCurrently, in direct path, we reach y=9 at T=105 with H=9 actions? Actions from t=96 to t=104, 9 actions, last position T=105.\n\nBut stuck at y=8 unsafe.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, to reach at T=105, H=10? Let's clarify.\n\nStart: turn t_1 =96, y=0\n\nAfter H actions: actions at t=96,97,...,96+H-1\n\nThen the position after action at t=96+H-1 sets y for turn (96+H-1)+1 = 96+H\n\nWe want y_{96+H} =9 for some turn.\n\nAt turn 96+H, y=9.\n\nFor example, if H=9, actions at t=96 to 104, y_{105} =9.\n\nTurn 105: y=9.\n\nThe turns we are on freeways: for y=k, we are at turn when y_T =k.\n\nFor k from 1 to 8.\n\nIn the sequence, T=97:y=1, T=98:y=2, ..., T=104:y=8.\n\nThen T=105:y=9.\n\nNow, at T=104, y=8, unsafe.\n\nTo avoid, we can delay or advance the time we are on y=8.\n\ny=8 is safe except T=96,97,104,105.\n\nT=96 and 97 are too early, we start at y=0, cannot be at y=8 at T=97 unless we go up fast, but we can only go up one per turn, so earliest at y=8 is T=104: from T=96:0, T=97:1, ..., T=104:8.\n\nSo T=104 is the earliest possible for y=8.\n\nBut at T=104, y=8 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, T=105 is also unsafe for y=8.\n\nNext possible is T=106, but that would require delaying.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 earliest at T=103.\n\nAt T=103, y=7 is safe, but if we go to y=8 at T=104, unsafe.\n\nIf we stay on y=7 at T=104, but y=7 unsafe at T=104.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=7 or y=8 at T=104 or T=105.\n\nTherefore, we must be on a different freeway at T=104 and T=105.\n\nFor example, at T=104, we could be on y=6 or y=5, etc., but then we need to reach y=9 later.\n\nSimilarly at T=105.\n\nBut that will increase the number of turns.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are both unsafe at T=104-105, we need to cross them before or after.\n\nBefore: we can be on y=7 at T=103 (safe), but then to go to y=8, we need to do it at some turn.\n\nIf we go to y=8 at T=104, unsafe.\n\nThe only other times y=8 is safe are before T=104 or after T=105.\n\nBefore: T=98 to 103? But y=8 at T=98 would require starting from higher, but we start from y=0.\n\nFrom y=0 at T=96, we can reach y=8 at T=104 earliest, as above.\n\nLater: T=106 or later.\n\nSimilarly for y=7, earliest T=103, and at T=103 safe, but we need to leave before T=104 if we stay.\n\nBut let's list possible safe times for y=7 and y=8.\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): unsafe at T=96,97,104,105, so safe for T <=95 or T=98 to 103 or T>=106, but T=96 is current, so from T=98 to 103 and T>=106.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8 (y=8): unsafe at T=96,97,104,105, so safe for T=98 to 103 and T>=106.\n\nNow, since we start at T=96 y=0, we can reach y=7 at T=103 (since 96:0,97:1,98:2,99:3,100:4,101:5,102:6,103:7)\n\nAt T=103, y=7 is safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go to y=8 at T=104, but T=104 y=8 unsafe.\n\nGo to y=6 at T=104, but that means down from y=7, then we have to come back, increasing turns.\n\nOr stay on y=7 at T=104, but unsafe.\n\nSo the only option is to be on y=7 at a different time.\n\nBut at T=103 is the only early time we can be on y=7 safely, but we cannot proceed to y=8 safely at that point.\n\nWe can be on y=7 later, but that requires delaying the ascent.\n\nFor example, if we go slower to y=7.\n\nBut to reach y=7 later, say at T=106.\n\nThen from y=0 at T=96, we need to get to y=7 at T=106.\n\nBut that means we spend more turns at lower y, so H increases.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nLet's think about the sequence.\n\nWe need to reach y=9, so we must have a turn where we are on y=8 and then go to y=9.\n\nThe turn before reaching y=9, we are on y=8 or y=9 directly, but from y=8 to y=9.\n\nAt that turn when we are on y=8, it must be safe.\n\nSimilarly, for y=7, when we are on it, safe.\n\nIn the critical period T=104-105, both y=7 and y=8 are unsafe, so we should not be on them during those turns.\n\nTherefore, we can either:\n\n- Be on y=8 before T=104, but earliest is T=104, impossible earlier.\n\n- Or after T=105, so at T=106 or later.\n\nSimilarly for y=7.\n\nSo the earliest we can be on y=8 safely is T=106.\n\nAt T=106, y=8 is safe, since unsafe only at 104,105.\n\nThen we can go to y=9 at T=107.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=8 at T=106.\n\nFrom start, at T=96 y=0, to y=8 at T=106, that means we need to have y=8 at turn 106.\n\nFrom turn 96 to 106, that's 11 turns, but positions from y_96 to y_106.\n\ny_96=0, y_106=8.\n\nThe change in y is +8, over 10 steps (from t=96 to t=105 actions determine y_97 to y_106).\n\nActions from t=96 to t=105, 10 actions, to set y_97 to y_106.\n\ny_106 = y_96 + sum of Δy from t=96 to t=105.\n\ny_96=0, y_106=8, so sum of 10 Δy must be +8.\n\nSince each |Δy| <=1, the only way is 8 up and 2 stay, or 8 up, 1 down, 1 up, but net +8 in 10 actions.\n\nMin actions to go from 0 to 8 is 8 actions, but here we have 10 actions for 8 net up, so we have 2 extra actions where we stay or move down and up.\n\nBut we need to fill the time, and be safe at all points.\n\nSpecifically, we need to be on y=8 at T=106, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nNow, during the path, we need to avoid unsafe times.\n\nAlso, at T=104 and T=105, we should not be on y=7 or y=8, so we should be on lower or higher y.\n\nSince we are coming from below, probably on lower y, like y=6 or below.\n\nNow, let's list all unsafe times again to see if there are constraints on other freeways.\n\ny=1 unsafe T=112-115, late, not issue if we finish early.\n\ny=2,3,4,5 always safe.\n\ny=6 unsafe only at T=96, which is start, and we are on y=6 later, not at T=96, so safe when we pass.\n\ny=7 unsafe T=96,97,104,105\n\ny=8 unsafe T=96,97,104,105\n\nFor y=7, we can be safe at T=103, as before, or later.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nIn the new plan, we want to be on y=8 at T=106.\n\nThen y_106=8, then action a_106: U, y_107=9.\n\nAt T=107, y=9, goal.\n\nNow, H: from start turn 96, to turn when y=9, which is T=107.\n\nActions from t=96 to t=106, 11 actions? Let's see.\n\nTurn 106: y=8, then after action a_106, y_107=9.\n\nSo at turn 107, y=9.\n\nWe need the turn to be t_1 + H -1 =96 + H -1 =107, so 96 + H -1 =107, thus H-1=11, H=12.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =107, t_1=96, so 96 + H -1 =107, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nActions from t=96 to t=96+H-1 = t=96 to t=96+11=107? t_1 + H -1 =96 +12 -1=107, yes turn 107.\n\nNumber of actions H=12.\n\nBut earlier min is 9, now 12, but we have to because of the delay.\n\nWe might do better by going faster to some point or slower.\n\nBut since we have to avoid T=104-105 for y=7 and y=8, and we can't be earlier, we have to be later.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=6 or y=5 during T=104-105.\n\nNow, to reach y=8 at T=106.\n\ny_106=8.\n\ny_96=0.\n\nSo from turn 96 to 106, 10 actions (t=96 to 105) to go from y_96=0 to y_106=8.\n\nNet +8 in 10 steps, so we need exactly 8 up moves and 2 other moves, which could be stay or down and up, but net +8.\n\nThe other moves must not decrease y, so probably 8 up and 2 stay, or 9 up and 1 down, etc., but since we start from y=0, we can go down to y=0 and stay, but y=0 is safe.\n\nNow, we need to ensure that at each turn, when on a freeway, it is safe.\n\nSpecifically, for y=6,7,8 we have unsafe times.\n\ny=6: unsafe only at T=96, so as long as not at T=96, safe. We will be on y=6 later, so safe.\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=96,97,104,105. We need to avoid being on y=7 at these times.\n\nSimilarly y=8: same.\n\nIn our path to y=8 at T=106, we will be on y=7 at some point.\n\nFor example, to have y_106=8, and we come from y=7.\n\ny_106=8, so at turn 106, y=8.\n\nThen at turn 105, y_105 must be such that after action, y_106=8.\n\nIf at T=105, y_105=7, then a_105=U, y_106=8.\n\nOr y_105=8, a_105=S, y_106=8.\n\nOr y_105=9, a_105=D, but y=9 not yet, we are going to.\n\nBut probably from y=7 up or y=8 stay.\n\nSimilarly, at T=104, etc.\n\nWe need to avoid y=7 and y=8 at T=104 and T=105.\n\nAt T=104 and T=105, we should not be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nSo possible to be on y<=6 or y=9, but y=9 not yet.\n\nSo at T=104 and T=105, we must be on y<=6.\n\nThen at T=106, we can be on y=8.\n\nBut y=8 at T=106, so at T=105, we need to be at y=7 or y=8, but at T=105, we cannot be on y=7 or y=8 because unsafe.\n\nContradiction?\n\nAt T=105, if we are on y=7 or y=8, unsafe.\n\nBut to have y_106=8, we need y_105 such that y_106 = y_105 + Δy_105.\n\nIf y_105 <=6, then to reach y_106=8, we need Δy_105 = +2 or something, impossible, max +1 per action.\n\ny_106 can be at most y_105 +1.\n\nSo if y_105 <=6, y_106 <=7.\n\nBut we want y_106=8, so y_105 must be at least 7.\n\ny_105 >=7.\n\nBut at T=105, if y_105 >=7, then since y=7 or 8, and both unsafe at T=105.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to have y_106=8 because it requires y_105=7 or 8, which are unsafe at T=105.\n\ny_105 must be 7 or 8 to have y_106=8.\n\nBut at T=105, y=7 or 8 is unsafe.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on y=8 at T=106 if it requires being on y=7 or 8 at T=105.\n\nSimilarly for other times.\n\nWe need to have y=8 at a time when it is safe, and the previous position is safe.\n\nFor example, at T=103, y=8 is possible? But at T=103, y=8 requires from start: y_103=8.\n\nT=103: from T=96:0, actions to y_103.\n\nNumber of actions from t=96 to t=102? Actions t=96 to t=102 set y_97 to y_103.\n\n7 actions for net +8 from y_96=0 to y_103=8? y_103 - y_96 = sum Δy from t=96 to t=102.\n\ny_96=0, y_103=8, so 7 actions (t=96 to 102) for +8, but each action max +1, so max y_103 can be y_96 +7 =7, if all up.\n\ny_103 <= y_96 +7 =7, since 7 actions.\n\nSo y_103 <=7, cannot be 8.\n\nEarliest y=8 is T=104: y_104 = y_96 +8 =8, with 8 actions t=96 to 103.\n\nActions t=96 to 103 set y_97 to y_104.\n\ny_104 = y_96 + sum_{t=96 to 103} Δy_t\n\n8 actions, each +1 max, so y_104 <= 0+8=8.\n\nAchieved with all U: y_97=1, y_98=2, ..., y_104=8.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at T=104, or later.\n\nBut at T=104, y=8 unsafe.\n\nNext, T=105: y_105=8, but if from previous, or stay.\n\nBut at T=105, y=8 unsafe.\n\nT=106: y_106=8.\n\nTo have y_106=8, with y_96=0.\n\nActions t=96 to 105, 10 actions, net +8, so possible.\n\ny_106 = y_96 + sum_{t=96 to 105} Δy_t = 0 + sum of 10 Δy_t =8.\n\nSo sum Δy_t =8 for t=96 to 105.\n\nEach Δy_t in {-1,0,1}, so for example, 8 up, 2 stay; or 9 up, 1 down, etc.\n\nNow, at turn T=105, y_105 must be such that y_106 = y_105 + Δy_105.\n\nIf y_106=8, then y_105 + Δy_105 =8.\n\nSince |Δy_105|<=1, y_105 must be 7,8, or9.\n\nBut y_105=9 not possible since we are going to y=9 later, and y=9 not freeway.\n\nSo y_105 must be 7 or 8.\n\nBut at T=105, if y_105=7 or 8, it is unsafe, as both freeways unsafe.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to have y_106=8 because it requires y_105=7 or 8, which are both occupied at T=105 and unsafe.\n\nSimilarly for any later time, the same issue: to be on y=8 at turn T, it requires that at turn T-1, we are on y=7,8, or9, but y=9 not, so y=7 or8, and at turn T-1, if T-1 is unsafe for that y, problem.\n\nBut the unsafe times are specific.\n\nFor example, to be on y=8 at T=106, safe, but it requires that at T=105, y_105 is 7 or 8.\n\nT=105 is unsafe for both y=7 and y=8.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nSimilarly, at T=103, y=8 impossible, as y_103<=7.\n\nT=104: y=8 possible, but unsafe.\n\nT=107: y_107=8.\n\nThen to have y_107=8, from y_96=0, with 11 actions t=96 to 106, net +8.\n\nAt turn T=106, y_106 must be 7,8, or9 for y_107=8.\n\ny_106=7 or8 or9.\n\nAt T=106, is y=7 or8 safe?\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 unsafe at T=104,105, but at T=106, it should be safe.\n\nT=106, Δt=106-96=10.\n\nFor y=7: unsafe at Δt=0,1,8,9 so T=96,97,104,105.\n\nT=106 not unsafe, so safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 same.\n\nAlso y=9 safe.\n\nSo at T=106, y=7 or8 is safe.\n\nThen we can have, for example, y_106=7, then a_106=U, y_107=8.\n\nOr y_106=8, a_106=S, y_107=8.\n\nBoth possible at T=106.\n\nThen at T=107, y=8, safe? T=107, Δt=11, not in 104,105, so safe.\n\nThen from there go to y=9.\n\nBut let's first confirm.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nWith y=8 at T=107, then go to y=9 at T=108.\n\nNow, for the path, we need to have y_107=8.\n\nThen actions to set that.\n\nFirst, at T=105 and T=104, we need to not be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nSo at T=104 and T=105, we must be on y<=6.\n\nSince y=6 and below are safe except y=6 at T=96, but not at T=104,105.\n\ny=5,4,etc always safe.\n\nNow, let's outline the sequence.\n\nStart T=96, y=0, safe.\n\nWe need to reach a point where at T=107, y=8, for example.\n\nThen y_107=8.\n\ny_96=0.\n\nNumber of actions from t=96 to t=106 to determine y_97 to y_107.\n\n11 actions.\n\nNet change: y_107 - y_96 = sum_{t=96 to 106} Δy_t = 8 - 0 =8.\n\n11 actions, net +8, so we need 8 up and 3 other actions that are down or stay, but since we start from y=0, down to negative not possible, y min 0, so we can stay or go down to 0 and stay, or go up, etc.\n\nThe other actions can be stay or down, but down only if y>0.\n\nNow, to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at T=104 and T=105.\n\nAt T=104, we must have y_104 <=6.\n\nAt T=105, y_105 <=6.\n\nThen at T=106, y_106 must be 7 or 8 to reach y_107=8.\n\nAnd at T=106, y=7 or 8 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=107, y=8 safe.\n\nThen to y=9.\n\nNow, let's set the positions.\n\nSuppose we want y_107=8.\n\nThen at T=107, y=8.\n\nNow, at T=106, y_106 must be 7 or 8.\n\nIf y_106=7, then a_106=U to y_107=8.\n\nIf y_106=8, a_106=S to y_107=8.\n\nNow, at T=105, y_105 <=6, and y_106 = y_105 + Δy_106.\n\nSince y_106 >=7 (since 7 or 8), and y_105 <=6, so Δy_106 must be +1, and y_105 must be exactly 6, so that y_106 = y_105 +1 =7.\n\nIf y_105 <=5, y_106 <=6, cannot be 7.\n\nSo y_105 must be 6, and a_106=U, so y_106=7.\n\nThen y_107=8 with a_107=U? a_106 sets y_107.\n\na_t at time t sets y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn T, y_T, then action a_T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nFor example, at T=105, y_105, then a_105 determines y_106.\n\nAt T=106, y_106, a_106 determines y_107.\n\nSo for y_107=8, with y_106=7, then a_106=U.\n\nOr with y_106=8, a_106=S.\n\nBut from above, at T=105, y_105 <=6, and y_106 must be 7 or 8.\n\nSince y_105 <=6, and y_106 >=7, so y_106 = y_105 + Δy_105 >=7.\n\nBut y_105 <=6, so must have y_105 =6 and Δy_105 = +1, so that y_106 =7.\n\nThen y_107 = y_106 + Δy_106 =7 + Δy_106.\n\nIf Δy_106=+1, y_107=8; if Δy_106=0, y_107=7; etc.\n\nBut we want y_107=8, so with y_106=7, we need a_106=U, so Δy_106=+1, y_107=8.\n\nWe could have y_106=8, but if y_105 <=6, and y_106=8, then Δy_105 must be +2, impossible, so only possibility is y_105=6, a_105=U, y_106=7, then a_106=U, y_107=8.\n\nIf we want y_106=8 directly, but y_105 <=6, cannot, so only way is through y_106=7.\n\nThus, for y_107=8, we must have:\n\ny_105 =6\n\na_105 = U, so y_106=7\n\nThen a_106 = U, so y_107=8\n\nAt T=106, y=7, which is safe since T=106 not unsafe.\n\nAt T=107, y=8, safe.\n\nNow, at T=105, y_105=6, which is freeway 6, and at T=105, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe only at T=96, T=105 is Δt=9, not 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=104, we need y_104 <=6, and since y_105=6, so y_105 = y_104 + Δy_104\n\ny_105=6, so if y_104 <=6, possible.\n\nSpecifically, if y_104 =6, then Δy_104 could be 0 or -1 or +1, but y_105=6, so if y_104=6, Δy_104=0 or if y_104=5, Δy_104=+1, or y_104=7, Δy_104=-1, etc.\n\nBut at T=104, we need y_104 <=6, so y_104 <=6.\n\nSince y_105=6, we have cases:\n\n- If y_104 =5, then a_104=U to y_105=6\n\n- If y_104=6, then a_104=S to y_105=6\n\n- If y_104=7, then a_104=D to y_105=6, but at T=104, y=7 is unsafe, so we cannot be at y_104=7 because unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, y_104=8 also unsafe.\n\nBut we already have y_104 <=6 to avoid unsafe, so y_104 <=6, so y_104 cannot be 7 or 8, so only possibilities: y_104=5 or 6.\n\nThen to have y_105=6:\n\n- If y_104=5, a_104=U\n\n- If y_104=6, a_104=S\n\nNow, we need to set the path from start.\n\nAlso, we need to be on y=7 at T=106, which is fine.\n\nNow, let's list the turns and required y.\n\nWe need:\n\nAt T=104: y_104 <=6, specifically 5 or 6\n\nAt T=105: y_105=6\n\nAt T=106: y_106=7\n\nAt T=107: y_107=8\n\nThen to y=9, a_107=U, y_108=9\n\nAt T=108, y=9, goal.\n\nNow, H: to reach y=9 at T=108.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =108, t_1=96, so 96 + H -1=108, H-1=12, H=13.\n\nActions from t=96 to t=107? t_1 to t_1 + H -1 =96 to 96+13-1=108.\n\nAt turn 108, y=9.\n\nNow, from start, we need to reach the above points.\n\nStart T=96, y=0.\n\nWe need to get to T=104 with y_104=5 or 6.\n\nSimilarly, other points.\n\nNow, the time from T=96 to T=104: 9 turns? Positions y_96 to y_104.\n\ny_96=0, y_104 = ? we need y_104=5 or 6.\n\nActions from t=96 to t=103 determine y_97 to y_104.\n\n8 actions.\n\ny_104 = y_96 + sum_{t=96 to 103} Δy_t = 0 + sum of 8 Δy_t\n\nWe need y_104 =5 or 6.\n\nSo sum of 8 Δy_t =5 or 6.\n\nSince each |Δy|<=1, possible with 5 or 6 up and the rest stay or down, but min y=0.\n\nSimilarly, we need to ensure that at each turn, when on freeway, safe.\n\nBut y=2,3,4,5 always safe.\n\ny=6 safe except T=96, but T=104 not 96.\n\ny=1 unsafe at T=112-115, but T=104 is earlier, so safe if we are on it.\n\nNow, to minimize H, but H=13 seems large, but necessary due to constraints.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 earlier by going to y=8 later but with fewer actions, but net from 0 to 9, min 9 actions, but with delays.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 is safe at T=103, and we can be on it, but then at T=104, we need to not be on y=7, so we could go down to y=6 at T=104.\n\nBut at T=104, y=6 is safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go up later.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach y=9 at T=107 or earlier.\n\nSuppose we want to be on y=7 at T=103, which is safe.\n\nThen at T=103, action: if we go up to y=8 at T=104, but T=104 y=8 unsafe.\n\nGo down to y=6 at T=104, then at T=104, y=6 safe.\n\nThen at T=104, action: we can go to y=7 or y=5, etc.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to go up eventually.\n\nAt T=105, y=7 or 8 unsafe, so we cannot be on them.\n\nIf at T=104, y=6, then a_104: U to y_105=7, but T=105 y=7 unsafe.\n\nS to y_105=6, then at T=105, y=6 safe.\n\nD to y_105=5, etc.\n\nThen at T=105, if y=6, safe.\n\nThen we can go to y=7 at T=106, safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at T=107, safe, etc.\n\nBut this takes more turns.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=103: y=7 (safe)\n\na_103: D, so y_104=6\n\nT=104: y=6 (safe)\n\na_104: S or D, but we need to go up later.\n\nSay a_104: S, y_105=6\n\nT=105: y=6 (safe)\n\na_105: U, y_106=7\n\nT=106: y=7 (safe, since T=106 not unsafe)\n\na_106: U, y_107=8\n\nT=107: y=8 (safe)\n\na_107: U, y_108=9\n\nT=108: y=9\n\nSame as before.\n\nFrom T=103 y=7, a_103: D to y_104=6\n\nThen a_104: U to y_105=7, but at T=105 y=7 unsafe, not allowed.\n\nSo must stay or go down at T=104.\n\nThus, the delay is necessary.\n\nTo have fewer turns, we could go up faster to higher y earlier, but since we have to avoid T=104-105 for y=7-8, and we can't be on high y earlier, we have to be lower during that time.\n\nThus, min H is 13, with y=9 at T=108.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nFirst, from T=96 to T=103, we need to reach y_103=7.\n\nBecause in the first scenario, we have y_103=7.\n\nIn the sequence above, at T=103, y=7.\n\ny_103=7.\n\ny_96=0.\n\nActions t=96 to t=102: 7 actions, net y_103 - y_96 =7, so all U possible.\n\ny_97=1, y_98=2, ..., y_103=7.\n\nAt each turn:\n\nT=97: y=1, freeway 1, safe since T=97 < 112\n\nT=98: y=2, safe\n\nT=99: y=3, safe\n\nT=100: y=4, safe\n\nT=101: y=5, safe\n\nT=102: y=6, freeway 6, T=102, not 96, safe\n\nT=103: y=7, freeway 7, T=103, not in unsafe 96,97,104,105, so safe. Yes.\n\nNow, at T=103, action a_103: since we need to go to y=6 at T=104? In the plan, at T=104, y_104 should be 6 or less, but we have y_103=7.\n\na_103: to set y_104.\n\nWe need y_104 <=6, so a_103 must be D, so y_104=6.\n\nThen T=104: y=6, freeway 6, safe (not T=96)\n\nThen action a_104: we need y_105=6.\n\nSince y_104=6, a_104 can be S or D.\n\nIf S, y_105=6; if D, y_105=5.\n\nBut we need y_105=6 exactly for the earlier derivation? In the first plan, we had y_105=6.\n\nHere, if a_104=S, y_105=6.\n\nIf a_104=D, y_105=5.\n\nBut at T=105, we need y_105=6 for the sequence to y_106=7.\n\nIf y_105=5, then to have y_106=7, need +2, impossible.\n\nSo we must have y_105=6, so from y_104=6, a_104 must be S, so y_105=6.\n\nThen T=105: y=6, safe.\n\nAction a_105: U, so y_106=7\n\nT=106: y=7, freeway 7, T=106, not unsafe, safe.\n\nAction a_106: U, so y_107=8\n\nT=107: y=8, freeway 8, T=107, not 104,105, safe.\n\nAction a_107: U, so y_108=9\n\nT=108: y=9, goal.\n\nNow, the actions:\n\nAt t=96: since we go up to y=1, a_96=U\n\nSimilarly, all actions from t=96 to t=102 are U, to go up to y=7 at T=103.\n\nt=96 to t=102: actions for y_{97} to y_{103}, 7 actions, all U.\n\nThen at t=103: action a_103, which is D to set y_104=6\n\nThen at t=104: action a_104=S to set y_105=6\n\nThen at t=105: action a_105=U to set y_106=7\n\nThen at t=106: action a_106=U to set y_107=8\n\nThen at t=107: action a_107=U to set y_108=9\n\nNow, the sequence of actions from t=96 to t=107.\n\nt=96: U\n\nt=97: U (to y=2)\n\n...\n\nUp to t=102: U (to y=7 at T=103?

The unsafe times for each relevant freeway are:\n\n- Freeway 1: Unsafe at turns 112, 113, 114, 115 (but these are late and do not affect the minimal path).\n- Freeway 6: Unsafe only at turn 96.\n- Freeway 7: Unsafe at turns 96, 97, 104, 105.\n- Freeway 8: Unsafe at turns 96, 97, 104, 105.\n- Freeways 2, 3, 4, 5: Always safe.\n\nThe direct upward path (all \"U\" actions) would reach \\(y=9\\) by turn 105 but collides at turn 104 on freeway 8, which is unsafe. To avoid collisions, the player must delay the ascent through freeways 7 and 8 around turns 104 and 105. The minimal path involves reaching \\(y=7\\) at turn 103 (safe), moving down to \\(y=6\\) at turn 104 to avoid freeway 7 being unsafe, staying at \\(y=6\\) at turn 105 to avoid both freeways 7 and 8 being unsafe, and then proceeding upward to \\(y=9\\) by turn 108.\n\nThe sequence of actions minimizes \\(H\\) to 12 turns, with the player reaching \\(y=9\\) at turn 108. The actions from turn 96 to turn 107 are:\n\n- Turns 96 to 102: \"U\" to ascend quickly to \\(y=7\\) by turn 103, avoiding unsafe times on lower freeways.\n- Turn 103: \"D\" to descend to \\(y=6\\) at turn 104, avoiding freeway 7 at turn 104.\n- Turn 104: \"S\" to stay at \\(y=6\\) at turn 105, avoiding freeways 7 and 8 at turn 105.\n- Turns 105 to 107: \"U\" to ascend to \\(y=9\\) by turn 108, with freeways 7 and 8 safe at turns 106 and 107.\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions:\n- At turn 104 (\\(y=6\\)): Freeway 6 is safe (unsafe only at turn 96).\n- At turn 105 (\\(y=6\\)): Freeway 6 is safe.\n- At turn 106 (\\(y=7\\)): Freeway 7 is safe (unsafe at 96, 97, 104, 105; 106 not unsafe).\n- At turn 107 (\\(y=8\\)): Freeway 8 is safe (similarly, 107 not unsafe).\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H = 12\\), with actions from turn 96 to turn 107.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 96: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 97: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 98: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 99: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 100: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 101: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 102: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 103: & D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 104: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 105: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 106: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 107: & U \\end{array} }",
