        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 through y=8. The player moves vertically, and cars move horizontally on their respective freeways. Collision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn T.\n\nFirst, since I start at y=0 and need to reach y=9, and I can only move up, down, or stay each turn, the minimum number of turns to move 9 units up is 9, if I go up every turn. But I have to avoid the freeways when cars are present at x=0.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to y=8, so I need to cross each of them, but I might not need to stop on each; I just need to pass through without being there when a car is at x=0.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if y_T = k for some k=1 to 8, and for that freeway, there is a car with 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nAlso, when I move from y to y+1 or y-1, at turn T, I am at y_T, and if I move, I will be at y_{T+1} on the next turn, but during turn T, I'm only on y_T, not on y_{T+1} yet. So when I decide to move to a different row, I'm only considered on the starting row during that turn.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars and their movements.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1 = 0.\n\nFor each freeway, I have cars with head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nDirection: left or right. In the car update, for left-moving, span moves left with speed s, so head decreases, tail decreases. Similarly for right-moving, head and tail increase.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, it's given as [h, τ] with h and τ, but it says head at h, tail at τ, and for left-moving, it becomes [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)], so if it's left-moving, h and τ decrease over time.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ, h] becomes [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)], so τ and h increase.\n\nBut in the car state table, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor freeway 1: one car: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] with t_1=0.\n\nSince direction right, and it says span(t_1) = [τ, h] for right-moving? Let's check the notation.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nRight-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h], meaning from tail to head, with head being larger since it's moving right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, span at t_1 is [h, τ], with head smaller.\n\nBut in the collision condition, we care about whether 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nAlso, for each freeway, there might be multiple cars, so I need to consider all for that freeway.\n\nLet's list for each freeway the cars and their positions over time.\n\nt_1 = 0.\n\nFreeway 1: k=1\n\nCars: only one: head h=-48, tail τ=-95, direction right, speed 48.\n\nSince direction right, span at t=0: [τ, h] = [-95, -48]\n\nAt time T, span = [ -95 + 48T, -48 + 48T ] because s=48, t_1=0.\n\nGeneral: for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s T, h + s T] since t_1=0.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(T) = [h - s T, τ - s T]\n\nIn this case, freeway 1: right-moving, s=48, τ=-95, h=-48\n\nSpan(T) = [ -95 + 48T, -48 + 48T ]\n\n0 is in span if -95 + 48T <= 0 <= -48 + 48T\n\nSo 48T <= 48 and -95 + 48T <=0 <= -48 + 48T\n\nFirst inequality: 0 <= -48 + 48T ⇒ 48T >= 48 ⇒ T >=1\n\nSecond inequality: -95 + 48T <= 0 ⇒ 48T <= 95 ⇒ T <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so T <=1 since T integer? T is turn, so integer.\n\nT is turn number, so integer.\n\nSo 48T >=48 and 48T <=95, T>=1 and T<=1.979, so T=1 only? T=1: 48*1=48, -48 +48=0, so 0 is included. T=1: lower bound -95+48= -47? -95 +48*1 = -95+48= -47, upper bound -48+48=0, so span [ -47, 0], so 0 is included? Upper bound is 0, so 0 is included if it's inclusive.\n\nThe span is [lower, upper], and it includes the endpoints? I think so, since it's a closed interval for collision.\n\nIn the problem, it says \"0 ∈ Span(T)\", so if 0 is one of the endpoints, it is included.\n\nFor T=1: Span(1) = [ -95 +48*1, -48 +48*1] = [ -47, 0], so 0 is in [ -47, 0], yes.\n\nFor T=2: [ -95 +96, -48 +96] = [1, 48], 0 not in.\n\nT=0: [ -95, -48], 0 not in.\n\nSo on freeway 1, car is at x=0 only at T=1.\n\nNow freeway 2: k=2\n\nCars: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nSecond car: (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nBoth right-moving, speed 12.\n\nFirst car: head h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s T, h + s T] = [ -59 +12T, -48 +12T ]\n\n0 in span: -59 +12T <= 0 <= -48 +12T\n\nSo 12T <= 48 and -59 +12T <=0 <= -48 +12T\n\n0 <= -48 +12T ⇒ 12T >=48 ⇒ T>=4\n\n-59 +12T <=0 ⇒ 12T <=59 ⇒ T <= 59/12 ≈4.916, so T<=4\n\nT>=4 and T<=4.916, so T=4.\n\nT=4: lower bound -59+48= -11? -59 +12*4= -59+48= -11, upper bound -48+48=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nT=5: [ -59+60=1, -48+60=12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nHead h=0, tail τ=-11, direction right.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s T, h + s T] = [ -11 +12T, 0 +12T ] = [ -11 +12T, 12T ]\n\n0 in span: -11 +12T <= 0 <= 12T\n\n0 <= 12T always for T>=0, but T=0: [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\n-11 +12T <=0 ⇒ 12T <=11 ⇒ T <= 11/12 ≈0.916, so T=0 only? T=0: [ -11, 0], 0 in.\n\nT=1: [ -11+12=1, 12], 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=0, 0 in span for second car.\n\nBut at T=0, for freeway 2, there are two cars.\n\nFirst car at T=4 only, second car at T=0 only.\n\nNow, collision if at turn T, player is on freeway 2 and 0 in span for any car on that freeway.\n\nSo for freeway 2, unsafe at T=0 (because of second car) and T=4 (because of first car).\n\nT=0: second car has [ -11,0], includes 0.\n\nFirst car at T=4.\n\nNow freeway 3: k=3\n\nCars: one car (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nHead h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right, speed 3.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s T, h + s T] = [ -59 +3T, -48 +3T ]\n\n0 in span: -59 +3T <= 0 <= -48 +3T\n\nSo 3T >=48 and -59+3T <=0\n\n3T >=48 ⇒ T>=16\n\n-59+3T <=0 ⇒ 3T <=59 ⇒ T <=59/3≈19.666, so T<=19\n\nT>=16 and T<=19\n\nT=16: lower -59+48= -11, upper -48+48=0? -48 +3*16= -48+48=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 in.\n\nT=17: [ -59+51= -8, -48+51=3], 0 in? -8 <=0<=3, yes.\n\nT=18: [ -59+54= -5, -48+54=6], 0 in.\n\nT=19: [ -59+57= -2, -48+57=9], 0 in.\n\nT=20: [ -59+60=1, -48+60=12], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 3 unsafe for T=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow freeway 4: k=4\n\nCars: one car (-48, -59, right, 3) same as freeway 3.\n\nHead h=-48, tail τ=-59, right, speed 3.\n\nSpan at T: [ -59 +3T, -48 +3T ]\n\n0 in span: same as above, T=16 to 19.\n\nT=16: [ -59+48= -11, -48+48=0], [ -11,0]\n\nT=17: [ -8,3]\n\nT=18: [ -5,6]\n\nT=19: [ -2,9]\n\nT=20: [1,12] no.\n\nSo unsafe T=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow freeway 5: k=5\n\nCars: one car (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so head h=48, tail τ=83? Let's see.\n\nFor left-moving, span(t_1) = [h, τ], and direction left.\n\nGiven (head h=48, tail τ=83, left, speed 36)\n\nSpan at t_1=0: [h, τ] = [48, 83]? But head should be the front, for left-moving, head is smaller x? Let's see the update.\n\nLeft-moving: Span(T) = [h - s T, τ - s T]\n\nSince span(t_1) = [h, τ], and for left-moving, it moves left, so h decreases, τ decreases.\n\nIn this case, h=48, τ=83, but if it's moving left, and head at 48, tail at 83, that might mean tail is behind, so if moving left, head should be on the left, so smaller x.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, span(t_1) = [h, τ] with h the head, τ the tail, so if moving left, head has smaller x than tail, so [h, τ] with h < τ.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nIn freeway 5, (48, 83, left, 36), so head h=48, tail τ=83, since left-moving, h < τ, 48<83, yes.\n\nSpan at T: [h - s T, τ - s T] = [48 - 36T, 83 - 36T]\n\n0 in span: 48 - 36T <= 0 <= 83 - 36T\n\nSo 48 - 36T <= 0 and 0 <= 83 - 36T\n\nFirst: 48 - 36T <=0 ⇒ 36T >=48 ⇒ T >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so T>=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= 83 - 36T ⇒ 36T <=83 ⇒ T <= 83/36 ≈2.305, so T<=2\n\nThus T=2 only.\n\nT=2: lower 48-72= -24, upper 83-72=11, so [ -24,11], 0 in.\n\nT=1: [48-36=12, 83-36=47], 0 not in.\n\nT=3: [48-108= -60, 83-108= -25], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 5 unsafe only at T=2.\n\nNow freeway 6: k=6\n\nCars: one car (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\nHead h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right, speed 4.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s T, h + s T] = [ -59 +4T, -48 +4T ]\n\n0 in span: -59 +4T <= 0 <= -48 +4T\n\nSo 4T >=48 and -59+4T <=0\n\n4T >=48 ⇒ T>=12\n\n-59+4T <=0 ⇒ 4T <=59 ⇒ T <=59/4=14.75, so T<=14\n\nT>=12 and T<=14\n\nT=12: [ -59+48= -11, -48+48=0], [ -11,0]\n\nT=13: [ -59+52= -7, -48+52=4], 0 in\n\nT=14: [ -59+56= -3, -48+56=8], 0 in\n\nT=15: [ -59+60=1, -48+60=12], 0 not\n\nSo unsafe T=12,13,14\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: k=7\n\nCars: one car (-48, -59, right, 4) same as above.\n\nUnsafe T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 8: k=8\n\nCars: one car (-48, -59, right, 4) same.\n\nUnsafe T=12,13,14\n\nNow, summary for each freeway, times when it is unsafe (car at x=0):\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): unsafe at T=1\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2): unsafe at T=0 and T=4\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): unsafe T=16 to 19\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): unsafe T=16 to 19\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): unsafe T=2\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): unsafe T=12 to 14\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): unsafe T=12 to 14\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): unsafe T=12 to 14\n\nAlso, I start at T=0, position y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nEach turn, I can go up, down, or stay, but since I need to go up, down might not be efficient, but I might need to wait sometimes.\n\nThe minimal H is at least 9, since I need to move up 9 steps.\n\nBut I might need to delay if unsafe.\n\nNow, I need to be on each freeway row only when it is safe.\n\nThe rows are y=1 to y=8.\n\nAt turn T, if I am on row k, it must be safe at that T.\n\nSince I move one row at a time, I will be on each row exactly once if I go directly up, but I might stay or move down to avoid unsafe times.\n\nBut to minimize H, I probably want to go up as fast as possible, only delaying when necessary.\n\nStart at T=0, y=0.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe player position: at turn T, y_T.\n\nI start at T=0, y=0.\n\nNow, when I am on a freeway row, I must not be there when unsafe.\n\nAlso, when I move from y to y+1, at turn T, I am at y, and I move to y+1 at T+1.\n\nBut at turn T, I am on row y, so if y is a freeway, it must be safe at T.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T, if I am on row k, freeway k, must be safe at T.\n\nNow, rows y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, always safe.\n\ny=0 is start, y=9 is target, no cars on them.\n\nSo I only care about y=1 to 8.\n\nNow, I need to assign a time when I am on each row from 1 to 8, and that time must be safe for that row.\n\nSince I move step by step, the times when I am on consecutive rows are consecutive turns, except if I stay or move down.\n\nLet S be the turn when I am on row 1, then row 2 at S+1 or later, etc.\n\nDefine T_k as the turn when I am on row k, for k=1 to 8.\n\nThen T_{k+1} >= T_k + 1, since I need at least one turn to move to the next row, but I can stay multiple turns or move down, so T_{k+1} > T_k, and T_{k+1} - T_k >=1.\n\nThe difference can be more than 1 if I stay or move away.\n\nBut for efficiency, T_{k+1} = T_k + d for some d>=1.\n\nThen the time to reach y=9: since I start at y=0 at T=0, and I need to be at y=9 at some T.\n\nWhen I am at y=9, I must have arrived from y=8 at some turn.\n\nLet T_0 = 0, y=0\n\nThen for k from 1 to 8, T_k when on row k\n\nT_9 when on row 9\n\nThen T_9 - T_0 is the number of turns, but since I might move down or stay, the path may not be direct.\n\nBut to minimize time, I should go directly up, with possible waiting on safe rows.\n\nThe minimal H is achieved by going up as fast as possible, only waiting when necessary to avoid unsafe times.\n\nSince I can only move one step per turn, the time to go from y=0 to y=9 is at least 9 turns.\n\nI need to choose the times to be on each freeway row when it is safe.\n\nNow, the unsafe times for each row:\n\nRow 1 (y=1): unsafe at T=1, so safe for T not 1, i.e., T=0,2,3,... except T=1.\n\nBut T=0: I am at y=0, not on row 1.\n\nAt T=0, I am on y=0.\n\nI can be on row 1 only for T>=1, since I start at T=0 y=0.\n\nSimilarly, row 1 can be occupied at T=1 or later.\n\nUnsafe at T=1, so row 1 must be occupied at some T !=1, so T=2,3,4,... or T=0? T=0 I am at y=0, not on row 1. So row 1 can be first visited at T=1 or later, but T=1 unsafe, so must be T>=2.\n\nSimilarly, row 2: unsafe at T=0 and T=4.\n\nBut T=0 I am at y=0, so for row 2, I can be on it at T=1 or later.\n\nUnsafe at T=0 and T=4, so safe at T=1,2,3,5,6,... except T=0 and T=4.\n\nSince I can be on row 2 only for T>=1 (after moving from y=1 or something), safe at T=1,2,3,5,...\n\nRow 3: unsafe T=16-19, so safe for T<16 or T>19, i.e., T<=15 or T>=20.\n\nSimilarly row 4: same, unsafe T=16-19, safe T<=15 or T>=20.\n\nRow 5: unsafe T=2, safe T!=2.\n\nRow 6: unsafe T=12-14, safe T<12 or T>14, i.e. T<=11 or T>=15.\n\nSimilarly row 7: same, unsafe T=12-14, safe T<=11 or T>=15.\n\nRow 8: same, unsafe T=12-14, safe T<=11 or T>=15.\n\nNow, I need to assign T_k for k=1 to 8 such that:\n\nT_{k+1} > T_k for each k, since I move to next row later.\n\nAnd T_k must be safe for row k.\n\nAlso, T_1 >=1, since at T=0 I am at y=0.\n\nSimilarly, T_9 >= T_8 +1, etc.\n\nThe total turns: I start at T=0 y=0, end at T when y=9.\n\nThe minimal T is at least max over k of the earliest possible T_k.\n\nBut I need to find a sequence.\n\nSince the constraints are loose except for some rows, I can go up quickly by avoiding the unsafe times.\n\nList the safe times for each row:\n\nRow 1: safe for T>=2 (since T=1 unsafe, T=0 not possible)\n\nRow 2: safe for T=1,2,3,5,6,... (not T=0,4)\n\nBut T=0 not possible, so safe T=1,2,3,5,6,7,...\n\nRow 3: safe T<=15 or T>=20\n\nRow 4: safe T<=15 or T>=20\n\nRow 5: safe T!=2, so all except T=2\n\nRow 6: safe T<=11 or T>=15\n\nRow 7: same, safe T<=11 or T>=15\n\nRow 8: same, safe T<=11 or T>=15\n\nNow, I need to go from row 1 to row 8 with T_k increasing.\n\nI should go as early as possible.\n\nStart from y=0 at T=0.\n\nI need to move to y=1 at some point.\n\nThe first move: at turn T=0, I am at y=0, I choose action a_0, which determines y_1.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t, I choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y.\n\nSo from (t, y_t) to (t+1, y_{t+1})\n\nTo be on row 1, it must be at some turn t where y_t =1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI can think of the time when I first reach each row.\n\nBut I might revisit rows, but to minimize time, I probably don't revisit, just go up with possible waiting.\n\nAssume I only move up, no down or stay except when waiting.\n\nSo I move up each turn unless I need to wait on a safe row.\n\nBut I can only wait on a row if it is safe, but the safe rows to wait might be limited.\n\nFirst, row 1 is only safe from T=2 onwards.\n\nSo I cannot be on row 1 at T=1, so I must not be on row 1 until T>=2.\n\nSimilarly, I start at T=0 y=0.\n\nAt T=0, I choose a_0: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go up, y_1 =1, but at T=1, if y_1=1, row 1 is unsafe at T=1, so collision.\n\nSo I cannot go up at T=0, because that would put me on row 1 at T=1 when it is unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, y_1=0, at T=1 I am still at y=0.\n\nOr if I go down, but y=0 is the bottom, y_{t+1} in [0,9], so I can go down to 0, but it stays 0.\n\nBut y=0 is safe.\n\nSo at T=0, I must not go up, because if I go up, y_1=1 at T=1, unsafe.\n\nSo I must choose S or D at T=0.\n\nBut D: if I go down, y_1 = max(0, y_0 -1) =0, since y_0=0.\n\nSimilarly, S: y_1=0.\n\nSo effectively, at T=0, I must stay at y=0, so y_1=0.\n\nThen at T=1, I am at y=0.\n\nNow, row 1 is unsafe only at T=1, but at T=1 I am at y=0, not on row 1, so safe.\n\nNow, I can choose to go up at T=1 or later.\n\nIf I go up at T=1, y_2 = y_1 +1 =0+1=1, so at T=2, I am at y=1.\n\nNow, at T=2, row 1: is it safe? Row 1 safe for T>=2, except T=1, so T=2 is safe.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I stay at T=1, y_2=0, then later go up.\n\nBut that would delay, so better to go up at T=1 to be at y=1 at T=2.\n\nSo assume I do that.\n\nSo at T=0: S or D, but same, y_1=0\n\nAt T=1: U, so y_2=1\n\nNow at T=2, y=1, which is safe.\n\nNow, from here, I need to go to row 2.\n\nRow 2 is at y=2.\n\nUnsafe at T=4.\n\nSafe at T=1,2,3,5,...\n\nAt T=2, I am at y=1.\n\nI can choose to go up to y=2 or stay or down, but down not useful.\n\nIf I go up at T=2, then y_3 = y_2 +1 =1+1=2, so at T=3, I am at y=2.\n\nT=3, is row 2 safe? Yes, T=3 is safe for row 2.\n\nIf I stay at T=2, y_3=1, still on row 1, but row 1 is safe for T>1, so I can stay, but that delays, so better to go up.\n\nSimilarly, go up at T=2 to be at y=2 at T=3.\n\nT=3 is safe for row 2.\n\nNow, next, to row 3, y=3.\n\nRow 3 unsafe T=16-19, safe for T<=15 or T>=20.\n\nCurrently at T=3, y=2.\n\nIf I go up at T=3, y_4 =3, so at T=4, y=3.\n\nBut row 3 at T=4: T=4 <=15, and not in 16-19, so safe? T=4 <16, so safe.\n\nUnsafe only 16-19, so T=4 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 4 same, safe at T=4.\n\nBut let's confirm.\n\nRow 3 safe T<=15 or T>=20, T=4<=15, safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 4 same.\n\nBut I need to go through each.\n\nAt T=3, y=2, I go up, so y_4=3, at T=4, y=3.\n\nNow, row 3 is safe at T=4.\n\nNow, to row 4, y=4.\n\nSimilarly, if I go up at T=4, y_5=4, at T=5, y=4.\n\nRow 4 safe at T=5? T=5<=15, safe.\n\nNow, but row 5: y=5.\n\nRow 5 unsafe only at T=2.\n\nBut T=2 is past, I am at T=5 now.\n\nRow 5 safe all except T=2, so T=5 safe.\n\nGo up at T=5, y_6=5, at T=6, y=5.\n\nNow, row 6: y=6.\n\nRow 6 unsafe T=12-14, safe T<=11 or T>=15.\n\nAt T=6, which is <=11, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 and 8 same.\n\nBut I need to go to y=6 at some turn.\n\nAt T=6, y=5, I can go up to y=6 at T=7? Let's see.\n\nIf I go up at T=6, y_7=6, at T=7, y=6.\n\nT=7 <=11, so row 6 safe.\n\nSimilarly, go up at T=7, y_8=7, at T=8, y=7.\n\nRow 7 unsafe T=12-14, T=8<=11, safe.\n\nGo up at T=8, y_9=8, at T=9, y=8.\n\nRow 8 unsafe T=12-14, T=9<=11, safe.\n\nNow, from y=8, go up to y=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=8, go up, y_10=9, at T=10, y=9, done.\n\nH=10 turns? Turns from t=0 to t=9, that's 10 actions? Let's see the sequence.\n\nTurns: t=0 to t=9, that's 10 turns, but I reach y=9 at t=10? Let's index carefully.\n\nDefine the turn and position.\n\nAt turn t=0: position y=0\n\nAction a_t at turn t affects y_{t+1}.\n\nAfter H turns, I am at turn t=H, position y_H.\n\nI need y_H =9 for some H.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nAfter H actions, at t=H, y_H.\n\nI need y_H=9.\n\nIn this plan:\n\nt=0: y=0, I must not go up, so choose S or D, say S, so a_0=S, then y_1=0\n\nt=1: y=1=0, I choose U, so a_1=U, then y_2=1\n\nt=2: y=2=1, I choose U, a_2=U, y_3=2\n\nt=3: y=3=2, choose U, a_3=U, y_4=3\n\nt=4: y=4=3, choose U, a_4=U, y_5=4\n\nt=5: y=5=4, choose U, a_5=U, y_6=5\n\nt=6: y=6=5, choose U, a_6=U, y_7=6\n\nt=7: y=7=6, choose U, a_7=U, y_8=7\n\nt=8: y=8=7, choose U, a_8=U, y_9=8\n\nt=9: y=9=8, choose U, a_9=U, y_10=9\n\nNow at t=10, y=9.\n\nH=10 turns, from t=0 to t=9, actions a_0 to a_9.\n\nBut is this safe?\n\nNow, when was I on each freeway row?\n\nAt t=2, y=1, row 1: T=2, which is safe (only unsafe at T=1)\n\nAt t=3, y=2, row 2: T=3, which is safe (unsafe at T=0,4; T=3 not 4)\n\nAt t=4, y=3, row 3: T=4, which is <=15, not in 16-19, safe\n\nAt t=5, y=4, row 4: T=5<=15, safe\n\nAt t=6, y=5, row 5: T=6, not 2, safe\n\nAt t=7, y=6, row 6: T=7<=11, not in 12-14, safe\n\nAt t=8, y=7, row 7: T=8<=11, safe\n\nAt t=9, y=8, row 8: T=9<=11, safe\n\nAnd I reach y=9 at t=10.\n\nBut is there a problem with row 6,7,8 at T=7,8,9?\n\nRow 6 unsafe T=12-14, T=7<12, safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut row 2 was unsafe at T=4, but at T=4 I was at y=3, not on row 2.\n\nAt T=4, y=3, row 3.\n\nNo issue.\n\nIn this sequence, I used T=4 for row 3, which is safe.\n\nBut row 3 can be safe at T=4.\n\nNow, can I do it faster?\n\nI started with a delay at t=0, I stayed, so I lost one turn.\n\nCould I have started earlier?\n\nAt t=0, I had to stay because going up would put me on row 1 at t=1 unsafe.\n\nSo I must stay at least one turn at start.\n\nThen I went up every turn.\n\nH=10.\n\nBut minimal possible is 9, but since I had to wait at start, 10 is minimum? Let's see if I can do in 9.\n\nSuppose I want to be at y=9 at t=9.\n\nThen I need to be on y=1 at some t, etc.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at t=9, I must be at y=8 at t=8 or earlier, but since I move step by step, if I go up each turn, y_t = t for t=0 to 9.\n\ny_0=0, y_1=1, y_2=2, ..., y_9=9.\n\nThen at t=1, y=1, but row 1 unsafe at t=1, collision.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=9 at t=9 by going straight up.\n\nI could be slower or faster, but faster not possible since min 9 moves.\n\nIf I go up slower, I might avoid, but H larger.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 for one turn, then go up, y_1=0, y_2=1, y_3=2, ..., y_10=9, same as before.\n\nIf I go up later, worse.\n\nSo H=10 seems necessary.\n\nBut in my sequence, I have y_10=9 at t=10.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 earlier if I don't start immediately.\n\nt=0 to t=9 actions, position at t=10.\n\nMinimal H actions to reach y=9 from y=0.\n\nSince I must increase y by 9, and each action can increase y by at most 1, so min H=9, but in this case, due to collision, I need at least 10.\n\nIn the straight path, at t=1, collision, so I must not be on row 1 at t=1, so I must delay by at least one turn.\n\nThus min H=10.\n\nNow, in my sequence, I have to check if all are safe.\n\nIn the sequence above, I have:\n\nt=0: a_0=S, y_1=0\n\nt=1: a_1=U, y_2=1\n\nt=2: a_2=U, y_3=2\n\nt=3: a_3=U, y_4=3\n\nt=4: a_4=U, y_5=4\n\nt=5: a_5=U, y_6=5\n\nt=6: a_6=U, y_7=6\n\nt=7: a_7=U, y_8=7\n\nt=8: a_8=U, y_9=8\n\nt=9: a_9=U, y_10=9\n\nNow, positions at each turn:\n\nTurn t=0: y=0 (safe, not freeway)\n\nt=1: y=0 (safe)\n\nt=2: y=1 (row 1, safe at t=2)\n\nt=3: y=2 (row 2, safe at t=3, since unsafe at t=0,4; t=3 not 4)\n\nt=4: y=3 (row 3, t=4 <=15, safe)\n\nt=5: y=4 (row 4, t=5<=15, safe)\n\nt=6: y=5 (row 5, t=6 !=2, safe)\n\nt=7: y=6 (row 6, t=7 <=11, safe)\n\nt=8: y=7 (row 7, t=8<=11, safe)\n\nt=9: y=8 (row 8, t=9<=11, safe)\n\nt=10: y=9 (safe)\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is there an issue with row 6,7,8 at t=7,8,9?\n\nt=7: row 6, unsafe only 12-14, t=7<12, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut row 6 safe T<=11 or T>=15, t=7<=11, yes.\n\nNow, but earlier I thought about row 2 unsafe at t=4, but at t=4 I am on row 3, not row 2.\n\nNo problem.\n\nCould I have gone faster to row 5 or something?\n\nFor example, if I could be on row 1 earlier, but I couldn't because of t=1 unsafe.\n\nPerhaps I can stay on some row to avoid later issues, but in this case, no need, since I reached early.\n\nAnother thing: at row 5, it is safe except t=2, but t=2 is early, I passed at t=6, fine.\n\nNow, but I have to reach y=9, and in this path, I used 10 turns.\n\nBut let me confirm if I can do with 9 turns.\n\nSuppose I want y_9=9.\n\nThen the positions: y_t for t=0 to 9.\n\ny_0=0\n\ny_9=9\n\nSince each step y changes by at most 1, and y increases from 0 to 9, it must be that y_t = t for t=0 to 9, because if I stay or go down, y would not reach 9 in 9 turns.\n\nFor example, if at some point I stay, y_t = y_{t+1}, then to increase by 9 in 9 steps, I must never stay or go down, so y_t = t for all t.\n\nThen y_1=1 at t=1, but row 1 unsafe at t=1, collision.\n\nThus impossible to reach in 9 turns.\n\nTherefore min H=10.\n\nIn the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nIn my sequence, a_0=S, then a_1 to a_9=U.\n\nBut a_0=S, which is stay.\n\nNow, the actions are for turns starting from t_1=0.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nt_1=0.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\n...\n\nup to Turn 9: U\n\nBut let's list.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to t=9.\n\nt=0: S\n\nt=1: U\n\nt=2: U\n\nt=3: U\n\nt=4: U\n\nt=5: U\n\nt=6: U\n\nt=7: U\n\nt=8: U\n\nt=9: U\n\nAfter these 10 actions, at t=10, y=9.\n\nThe sequence is for turns t=0 to t=9, H=10 actions.\n\nIn the task, it says \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt_1=0, so actions a_0 to a_{H-1}, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nt_1 + H = 0 + H.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H.\n\nIn this case, after a_0 to a_{9}, that's 10 actions, at turn 10, y=9.\n\nH=10.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1=9.\n\nNow, but I think I missed something.\n\nIn the car states, for freeway 2, there was a car at T=0, but since I was not on row 2 at T=0, no issue.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, at the turn I am on the current row only.\n\nIn this path, all seems fine.\n\nBut let me double-check row 3 at t=4.\n\nt=4, y=3, row 3.\n\nUnsafe times: 16,17,18,19. t=4 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 4 at t=5, same.\n\nRow 5 at t=6, fine.\n\nBut row 6 at t=7: row 6 unsafe 12-14, t=7<12, safe.\n\nt=7 is 7, less than 12, yes.\n\nSimilarly for 7 and 8.\n\nBut row 6 safe T<=11 or T>=15, T=7<=11, yes.\n\nNow, is there any constraint that I might hit later if I go too fast? I don't think so.\n\nPerhaps I can save a turn by going to row 1 later, but I don't see how.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 for multiple turns, but that would increase H.\n\nOr go down, but no point.\n\nSo H=10 seems minimal.\n\nBut in the output, I need to list the actions.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5: row 5, unsafe at T=2, I was at T=6, fine.\n\nNow, another thing: in freeway 2, there was a car at T=0, but I was at y=0 or y=2 later.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo I think the sequence is fine.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I did.\n\nNow, the answer should be:\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nIn the sequence, from turn 0 to turn 9, that's 10 turns.\n\nBut in the action list, for each turn.\n\nPerhaps I can write it as:\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nAnd after turn 9, position at turn 10 is (0,9).\n\nIn the boxed answer.\n\nBut the player position is (0,y), so x=0 always, only y changes.\n\nIn the output, it should be the actions.\n\nBut let me see if I can start with down, but at y=0, down stays at 0, same as stay.\n\nSo S or D, but S is fine.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 2, at T=0, there is a car with span including 0, but since I was on y=0, not on freeway 2, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 1, I am at y=0, and I choose U, so I move to y=1 at next turn.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo minimal H=10.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 10. This is because:\n- Moving directly upward in 9 turns (i.e., \\(y_t = t\\) for \\(t = 0\\) to \\(9\\)) would result in a collision on row \\(y = 1\\) at turn \\(t = 1\\), as row 1 is unsafe at \\(t = 1\\).\n- To avoid this collision, the player must stay at \\(y = 0\\) for the first turn (turn 0), delaying the upward movement by one turn. Thus, the minimum \\(H\\) is 10.\n\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_t\\}_{t=0}^{9}\\) ensures that the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 10 without collisions:\n- At turn 0, staying (S) avoids moving to row 1 at turn 1 when it is unsafe.\n- From turn 1 to turn 9, moving up (U) each turn progresses the player upward through the freeways at safe times:\n  - Row 1 is occupied at turn 2 (safe, as unsafe only at turn 1).\n  - Row 2 is occupied at turn 3 (safe, as unsafe at turns 0 and 4; turn 3 is safe).\n  - Row 3 is occupied at turn 4 (safe, as unsafe at turns 16–19; turn 4 ≤ 15 is safe).\n  - Row 4 is occupied at turn 5 (safe, same as row 3).\n  - Row 5 is occupied at turn 6 (safe, as unsafe only at turn 2; turn 6 ≠ 2).\n  - Row 6 is occupied at turn 7 (safe, as unsafe at turns 12–14; turn 7 ≤ 11 is safe).\n  - Row 7 is occupied at turn 8 (safe, same as row 6).\n  - Row 8 is occupied at turn 9 (safe, same as row 6).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: S \\\\\nTurn 1: U \\\\\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 1, and the player starts at (0,0). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to y=8).\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S) at each turn. Note that the player's y-position is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if the player is at position (0, y_T) and y_T is between 1 and 8 (i.e., on a freeway), then we must check the car on that freeway. Collision occurs if the car's span at turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nImportant: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, note that at the moment of turn T, the player is still on y_T and then moves to y_{T+1} for the next turn. So at turn T, we are on freeway y_T and we check the car on freeway y_T at turn T. We are not yet on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nWe are given the car state at turn t1=1. For future turns, the cars move according to their direction and speed.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions from turn 1 (current) until we reach y=9.\n\nNote: Once we are at y=9, we are safe (since cars are only on freeways 1-8).\n\nLet me list the car information for each freeway at turn 1 (t1=1):\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h=0, tau=-47, d=right, s=48)\n  - This car is right-moving. So at time t1=1, the span is [tau, h] = [-47, 0]. But note the representation: for right-moving, they give (head, tail) as (h, tau) and then the span is [tau, h]. So at turn1: span = [-47, 0].\n  - The car moves right, so at time T, the span becomes [tau + s*(T-1), h + s*(T-1)] = [-47 + 48*(T-1), 0 + 48*(T-1)]\n\nFreeway 2: two cars: \n  - Car1: (h=-36, tau=-47, d=right, s=12) -> span at t1: [tau, h] = [-47, -36]\n  - Car2: (h=12, tau=1, d=right, s=12) -> span at t1: [1,12] (because tau=1, h=12, and it's right-moving so [tau, h] = [1,12])\n\nFreeway 3: one car: (h=-45, tau=-56, d=right, s=3) -> span at t1: [tau, h] = [-56, -45]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3: (h=-45, tau=-56, d=right, s=3) -> span: [-56, -45]\n\nFreeway 5: (h=12, tau=47, d=left, s=36) \n  - Note: left-moving car: the representation is (head, tail) and then the update: for left-moving, the span at T is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n  - But note: the given is (head, tail) = (12,47). For left-moving, the head is the front? Actually, the update rule for left-moving: \n        Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n    and at t1: we have [h, tau] = [12,47]? But wait, the rule says: at t1 the car span is [h, tau] for left-moving? Actually, the rule says for left-moving: at t1 the span is [h, tau] and then at T it becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n  - However, in the table, the car on freeway5 is given as (12,47,left,36). So at t1=1, the span is [12,47]? But that would be from 12 to 47, which is a long car. But note: the representation for left-moving: the head is at 12 and tail at 47? Actually, for a left-moving car, the head is the leftmost? But the update rule subtracts s*(T-t1) so the entire car moves left.\n\n  Let me clarify: the update rule for left-moving: \n      Span(t1) = [h, tau]   -> then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  But note that if the car is moving left, then the head (which is the front) should be at the left? Actually, the problem states: \"head\" and \"tail\". For left-moving, the head is the leading part (which is the leftmost if moving left). So the car spans from h to tau? But if h=12 and tau=47, then that would be from 12 to 47? But then moving left, the entire segment moves left.\n\n  However, in the update rule, the initial span is [h, tau] and then we subtract s*(T-t1). So at t1, the car covers [12,47]. Then at T, it covers [12 - 36*(T-1), 47 - 36*(T-1)].\n\nFreeway 6: (h=-44, tau=-55, d=right, s=4) -> span at t1: [tau, h] = [-55,-44]\n\nFreeway 7: same as 6: [-55,-44]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 6: [-55,-44]\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,0) at turn1. We must avoid being at a freeway (y from 1 to 8) at a turn T when the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that turn T.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence of actions.\n\nSince the goal is to go from y=0 to y=9, and we can only change by -1,0,1 per turn, the minimal number of turns without any obstacles would be 9 (if we go up every turn: 0->1->...->9). But we must avoid collisions.\n\nWe must check for each freeway we step on, at the exact turn we are on that freeway, whether the car on that freeway covers 0.\n\nWe can also choose to stay at a freeway for multiple turns? But we want minimal turns so we would prefer to move up as much as possible.\n\nWe can also move down? But that might be necessary to avoid a collision? However, since we start at 0 and want to go to 9, moving down might be counterproductive. But note: if we are forced to wait, then staying or moving down might be needed to avoid a collision and then go up later.\n\nHowever, we are bounded by y>=0, so we cannot go below 0.\n\nLet me try to simulate the minimal path: always moving up. Then:\n\nTurn1: at y0=0 -> action U: then at turn2, we are at y1=1. Then we are on freeway1 at turn2? Actually, at turn1 we are at y0=0 (which is not a freeway, so safe). Then at turn2, we are at y1=1 (freeway1). We must check freeway1 at turn2.\n\nFreeway1 at turn2 (T=2, so T-t1=1):\n  For the car: [ -47 + 48*(2-1), 0 + 48*(2-1) ] = [1, 48]. So the car covers [1,48] at turn2. The player is at x=0. Is 0 in [1,48]? No. So safe.\n\nTurn2: we are at y=1. Then we do U again -> at turn3, we are at y=2.\n\nAt turn3, we are on freeway2. We must check freeway2 at turn3 (T=3, so T-t1=2).\n\nFreeway2 has two cars:\n  Car1: at turn3: [ -47 + 12*(3-1), -36 + 12*(3-1) ] = [ -47+24, -36+24 ] = [-23, -12] -> does not cover 0.\n  Car2: [ 1 + 12*(3-1), 12 + 12*(3-1) ] = [1+24, 12+24] = [25,36] -> does not cover 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTurn3: at y=2 -> action U -> turn4: y=3.\n\nAt turn4 (T=4, T-t1=3): on freeway3.\n  Car: [ -56 + 3*(4-1), -45 + 3*(4-1) ] = [ -56+9, -45+9 ] = [-47, -36] -> no 0.\n\nTurn4: U -> turn5: y=4.\n  Freeway4: same as freeway3? \n      [ -56 + 3*(5-1), -45 + 3*(5-1) ]? Wait, T=5? Actually, turn5: T=5, T-t1=4.\n      -> [ -56 + 3*4, -45 + 3*4 ] = [ -56+12, -45+12] = [-44, -33] -> no 0.\n\nTurn5: U -> turn6: y=5.\n  Freeway5: left-moving car. At turn6 (T=6, T-t1=5): \n      [12 - 36*(6-1), 47 - 36*(6-1)] = [12 - 180, 47-180] = [-168, -133] -> no 0.\n\nTurn6: U -> turn7: y=6.\n  Freeway6: at turn7 (T=7, T-t1=6): \n      [ -55 + 4*(7-1), -44 + 4*(7-1) ] = [-55+24, -44+24] = [-31, -20] -> no 0.\n\nTurn7: U -> turn8: y=7.\n  Freeway7: same as freeway6? \n      [ -55 + 4*(8-1), -44 + 4*(8-1) ] = [-55+28, -44+28] = [-27, -16] -> no 0.\n\nTurn8: U -> turn9: y=8.\n  Freeway8: at turn9 (T=9, T-t1=8): \n      [ -55 + 4*(9-1), -44 + 4*(9-1) ] = [-55+32, -44+32] = [-23, -12] -> no 0.\n\nTurn9: U -> turn10: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo the sequence: \n  Turn1: U -> (0,1) at turn2? Actually, we are at turn1: we start at (0,0). We take action at turn1: U -> then at the end of turn1, we update to y1 = 0+1 = 1? But the problem says: \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\", and the action at time t affects y_{t+1}. \n\nSo:\n  At turn1: we are at (0,0). We choose a_1: then we will be at y2 at turn2? \n\nBut note: the player position at turn t is given as (0, y_t). So at turn1, we are at (0, y1)= (0,0). Then we choose a_1. Then at turn2, we are at (0, y2) = (0, y1 + Delta y_1).\n\nSo the state at turn2 is y2 = y1 + Delta y_1.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of positions:\n\nTurn1: start at y1=0, then we choose a_1 -> then y2 = 0 + (1 if U, -1 if D, 0 if S)\n\nWe want to be at y_{t1+H-1} = 9. Since we start at turn1, we want at turn (1+H-1) = turn H to be at y_H=9.\n\nIn the above plan:\n\n  Turn1: a_1 = U -> then at turn2: y2=1.\n  Turn2: a_2 = U -> turn3: y3=2.\n  Turn3: a_3 = U -> turn4: y4=3.\n  Turn4: a_4 = U -> turn5: y5=4.\n  Turn5: a_5 = U -> turn6: y6=5.\n  Turn6: a_6 = U -> turn7: y7=6.\n  Turn7: a_7 = U -> turn8: y8=7.\n  Turn8: a_8 = U -> turn9: y9=8.\n  Turn9: a_9 = U -> turn10: y10=9.\n\nSo H = 10? Because we take 9 actions (from turn1 to turn9) and then at turn10 we are at y=9. But the problem says: we take actions from t=0 to H-1? Actually, the sequence is {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1. Here t1=1, so t=0 corresponds to a_{1+0}=a_1, and the last action is a_{1+H-1}. Then at the next turn (turn1+H) we are at the position after the last action.\n\nBut the problem says: we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9. \n\nLet me clarify: \n  At turn t1 (turn1) we are at (0, y1)= (0,0). \n  Then we take actions: \n      a_1 (at turn1) -> then we are at turn2: y2 = y1 + Delta a_1.\n      a_2 (at turn2) -> then turn3: y3 = y2 + Delta a_2.\n      ...\n      a_{H-1} (at turn1+H-1) -> then at turn (1+H) we are at y_{1+H} = ... \n\nBut the condition is: at turn (t1 + H - 1) we are at 9? \n\nThat would be: at turn (1+H-1) = turn H, we are at y_H = 9.\n\nSo we must have the last action taken at turn H-1? And then at turn H we are at 9.\n\nIn our plan, we are at y10=9 at turn10. So H=10? Then the last action is at turn9 (which is t1+8) and the turn when we are at 9 is turn10 = t1+9? \n\nBut the problem says: we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9. So:\n\n  t1 + H - 1 = 10  => 1 + H - 1 = 10 => H=10.\n\nSo we take actions from t=0 to t=8 (9 actions) for H=10.\n\nBut wait: the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1? That would be H actions? But then we are at turn (1 + H) at the end? \n\nLet me read the problem: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" \n\nThis means: \n  t=0: a_{t1+0} = a_1\n  t=1: a_2\n  ...\n  t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1} = a_{1+H-1}\n\nThen after taking the last action (at turn 1+H-1), we update to the next turn: turn (1+H). \n\nBut we require that at turn (t1+H-1) we are at 9? \n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nBut note: the position at turn t is (0, y_t). The action a_t is taken at turn t and then we get y_{t+1}. \n\nSo to be at y_t = 9 at turn t, we must have already taken the actions that led to that. \n\nIn our plan: \n  We want at turn10: y10=9. \n  So the turn we are at 9 is turn10. \n  Then we require: t1+H-1 = 10 -> 1+H-1=10 -> H=10.\n\nBut note: the last action we take is at turn9 (which is t1+8) and that action (U) leads to y10=9.\n\nSo the sequence has H=10 actions? Actually, the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, so that is H actions. But H=10? Then we have 10 actions? \n\nBut we only took 9 actions: from turn1 to turn9.\n\nThe problem: \n  The sequence is {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1. \n  t0: a1, t1: a2, ..., t8: a9. That is 9 actions. So H-1=8? Then H=9? \n\nBut then we would be at turn (t1+H-1)=1+9-1=9. We want to be at y9=9. \n\nIn our plan, at turn9 we are at y9=8 (because we did U at turn9 to become 9 at turn10). \n\nSo we are not at 9 at turn9.\n\nTherefore, we must adjust: we need to be at y=9 at the turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn the minimal plan without obstacles, we would start at turn1: y1=0. Then we take 9 actions (U at each turn) and then at turn10 we are at 9. But the condition is to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1. So if we set H=10, then t1+H-1=1+10-1=10 -> turn10. That matches.\n\nBut the sequence of actions: \n  We take actions at turns: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 -> 9 actions. \n  The sequence index: t from 0 to 8 (H-1=9? but 9-1=8) so that is 9 actions. So H=9? \n\nWait, the problem says: the sequence is from t=0 to H-1. So if we have 9 actions, then H-1=8 -> H=9. But then the turn we are at 9 would be turn (1+9)=10? \n\nBut the condition is: at turn (t1+H-1)=1+9-1=9 we are at 9? \n\nThat is not the case: at turn9 we are at 8 (if we have taken 8 actions) and then we take the 9th action at turn9 to become 9 at turn10. \n\nSo to be at 9 at turn9, we would have to have taken the 9th action at turn8? \n\nBut then we start at turn1:0, then at turn2:1, turn3:2, ..., turn9:8? Then at turn9 we are at 8. \n\nSo to be at 9 at turn9, we must have taken an action at turn8 that moved us to 9 at turn9. But then we only took 8 actions? \n\nActually, if we take 8 consecutive U actions starting at turn1, then at turn9 we would be at 8. \n\nWe need 9 consecutive U actions to get to 9? Then the last action (the 9th) is taken at turn9? Then at turn10 we are at 9. \n\nTherefore, to be at 9 at turn10, we set H=10. Then the condition is: at turn (t1+H-1)=1+10-1=10, we are at 9. \n\nAnd the sequence of actions: from t=0 to t=9 (H-1=9) -> 10 actions? But we only need 9.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me re-read: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nSo the actions are taken at the turns: t1, t1+1, ... , t1+H-1. \n\nAnd then the position at the next turn (after the last action) is at turn t1+H. \n\nBut we require the position at turn (t1+H-1) to be (0,9). \n\nSo the last action is taken at turn (t1+H-1) and that action leads to the position at turn (t1+H). But we require the position at turn (t1+H-1) to be 9? \n\nThat means we must be at 9 at the turn when we are taking the last action? \n\nBut the position at turn t is the state at the beginning of the turn? Or at the end?\n\nThe problem says: \"Player Position: (0,0) at turn t1=1\". Then we take an action a_{t1} (at turn1) and then the player updates to the new position for the next turn.\n\nSo at turn1, we are at (0,0). Then we take action a1. Then at turn2, we are at (0, y2).\n\nTherefore, the position at turn1 is 0. To be at 9 at turn (t1+H-1), we must have taken actions that make us at 9 at the beginning of turn (t1+H-1). \n\nBut note: we take actions at each turn. The last action we take is at turn (t1+H-1). Then we update to turn (t1+H). \n\nBut we require that at turn (t1+H-1) we are at 9. \n\nThat means we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn (t1+H-1) and we do not necessarily need to move? \n\nSo if we are at 9 at turn (t1+H-1), then we don't need to take an action that turn? But the sequence requires H actions. \n\nAlternatively, we might take an action at turn (t1+H-1) but we are already at 9? Then if we take U or D, we leave 9? So we must take S.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is such that we are at 9 at the beginning of turn (t1+H-1) and then we take S at that turn? But that would be one extra turn? \n\nBut the problem says: we take H actions and then at the turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. \n\nSo we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? Then we take an action at that turn? But we are already at 9. Then if we take U, we go to 10 which is invalid? Actually, the movement is bounded: if we are at 9 and take U, we stay at 9? The problem says: y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and take U, we remain at 9? \n\nBut the problem states: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, and then clamped to [0,9]? Or is it that we cannot move beyond? \n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\". So if we are at 9 and take U, we get 10 which is invalid? Then we must have y_{t+1} = min(9, y_t+1) or something? \n\nLooking back: \n  \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_{t}, ... , y_{t+1} in [0,9]\"\n\nBut it doesn't specify what happens if we go beyond. We must assume that we are bounded: so if y_t=9 and we do U, then y_{t+1}=9. Similarly, if y_t=0 and we do D, then y_{t+1}=0.\n\nSo we can take U at 9 and stay at 9.\n\nBut to minimize H, we want to get to 9 as soon as possible.\n\nSo the minimal H is the minimal number such that we can be at 9 at turn (t1+H-1). \n\nHow many moves? Without obstacles, we can be at 9 at turn (1+9)=10? \n\nBut we start at turn1 at 0. \n  After 1 move (at turn1): at turn2 we are at 1.\n  After 2 moves: turn3 at 2.\n  ...\n  After 9 moves: at turn10 we are at 9.\n\nSo to be at 9 at turn10, we set H such that: \n  t1+H-1 = 10  -> 1+H-1=10 -> H=10.\n\nAnd we take 10 actions? But we only need 9 moves (U) to get from 0 to 9. \n\nBut note: the sequence has H actions: from a1 to a10. \n\nBut at turn10, we are already at 9? Then what is the 10th action? \n\nWe must take an action at turn10? But we are at 9 at the beginning of turn10. Then we take an action at turn10 to stay at 9? \n\nBut we don't need to: the problem says we must reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So if we are at 9 at turn10 (which is t1+9, so H=10: t1+H-1=1+10-1=10), then we are done. But we have to output H actions? \n\nThe sequence is for t=0 to H-1: that is H actions. \n\nBut in the minimal path, we only need 9 actions? \n\nHowever, the condition is: at turn (t1+H-1) we must be at 9. And we take H actions. \n\nSo if we are at 9 at turn10, then we set H=10 and we have taken 9 actions (from turn1 to turn9) and then we need a 10th action at turn10? \n\nBut then the position at turn10 (after the 9th action) is 9. Then at turn10 we take an action? But we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn10. Then we take an action at turn10. But the problem says we are done when we are at 9 at turn (t1+H-1). So if we are at 9 at turn10, then we are done. We don't need to take an action at turn10? \n\nBut the sequence requires H actions. \n\nSo perhaps the last action is taken at turn (t1+H-1) and then we are at 9 at that same turn? That is not possible because the action changes the position for the next turn.\n\nTherefore, I think there is a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternative interpretation: \n  The sequence of actions is taken from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1 (H actions). Then after these actions, we are at turn t1+H. \n  But the problem says we require the player to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nLet me read carefully: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nAnd the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\n\nSo the actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ... , t1+H-1. \n\nThen after taking the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we are at turn t1+H. \n\nBut we require that at turn t1+H-1 (before taking the action?) we are at (0,9)? \n\nThe problem says: \"Player Position: (0,0) at turn t1=1\". This is the state at the beginning of turn1. \n\nThen we take action a1 at turn1, and then at the beginning of turn2 we are at y2.\n\nSo the state at the beginning of turn t is y_t.\n\nWe require that at the beginning of turn (t1+H-1) we are at 9.\n\nAnd we take actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2? Because the last action that affects the state at turn (t1+H-1) is taken at turn (t1+H-2).\n\nThe actions:\n  a_{t1} (at turn t1) -> affects y_{t1+1}\n  a_{t1+1} (at turn t1+1) -> affects y_{t1+2}\n  ...\n  a_{t1+H-2} (at turn t1+H-2) -> affects y_{t1+H-1}\n\nThen we are at 9 at turn (t1+H-1) without taking an action at turn (t1+H-1)? \n\nBut the sequence requires an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nThe problem says: we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ... , t1+H-1. And we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at some state. Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1}. Then we update to turn t1+H.\n\nBut we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we take an action. But the action might move us away? Or we take S and stay.\n\nSo to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1, we must have arrived at 9 by turn t1+H-1 (from the previous actions). Then at turn t1+H-1, we take an action (which might be S to stay).\n\nTherefore, the minimal H such that we can arrive at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nAnd then we take an action (S) at that turn to stay.\n\nIn the obstacle-free case: \n  We start at turn1:0.\n  We take U at turn1: then turn2:1.\n  U at turn2: turn3:2.\n  ...\n  U at turn8: turn9:8.\n  U at turn9: turn10:9. \n\nBut we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn? turn10? Then we set H=10: \n  We require to be at 9 at the beginning of turn (1+10-1)=10.\n  Then we take an action at turn10: which must be S (or U/D but then we remain at 9).\n\nBut note: at turn10, we are already at 9 at the beginning. Then we take an action at turn10: say S, and then we are still at 9 at turn11.\n\nBut the problem doesn't require to stay, only to reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo the action at turn10 is part of the sequence.\n\nHowever, we only needed to get to 9 by turn10. The action at turn10 is then not necessary for reaching, but we have to output it.\n\nTherefore, in the obstacle-free case, we would do:\n  Turn1: U\n  Turn2: U\n  ...\n  Turn9: U  -> then at turn10 we are at 9? But wait, with 9 actions we get to 9 at turn10. But then we need a 10th action? \n\nThe sequence has H actions, and H=10. So we have to do 10 actions. \n\nBut we can do:\n  Turn1: U -> to 1 at turn2\n  Turn2: U -> to 2 at turn3\n  ...\n  Turn9: U -> to 9 at turn10\n  Turn10: S (or U) -> and then we are still at 9 at turn11.\n\nBut we are done at turn10: we are at 9 at turn10. So the action at turn10 is not needed for reaching, but we have to output it.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". In this case, at turn10 we are at 9. So we are done at turn10. But then why do we need to take an action at turn10? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is the number of turns we use from start until the turn we reach 9, and then we output the actions that got us there. And the last action is the one that caused us to be at 9 at the next turn. \n\nBut the problem says the sequence has H actions and we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nTo resolve, let's assume that we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1 (which might be S) and then we are at 9 at turn t1+H, but that doesn't matter.\n\nFor the obstacle-free case, we can be at 9 at turn10 (t1+9) by taking 9 U actions from turn1 to turn9. Then at turn10, we are at 9. So we set H=10? Because t1+H-1=10 -> H=10. Then the actions are from a1 to a10. But a10 is taken at turn10. At turn10, we are already at 9 at the beginning. Then we take a10, which can be S. \n\nSo the sequence would be 9 U's and then one S.\n\nBut that is not minimal in terms of time? We are at 9 at turn10, but we could have been at 9 at turn10 without the last S.\n\nHowever, the problem requires H actions. And H=10 in this case.\n\nAlternatively, we might be able to be at 9 earlier? But in this case, we can't.\n\nNow, in the given problem, there might be obstacles that force us to wait, so H might be larger than 10.\n\nBut in our initial simulation, the direct 9 U's seemed safe. But let me double-check the cars at the turns we pass.\n\nWe passed:\n  Turn2: freeway1 -> car1: at T=2: [ -47+48*1, 0+48*1] = [1,48] -> 0 not in [1,48] -> safe.\n  Turn3: freeway2 -> cars: \n        car1: [-47+12*2, -36+12*2] = [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n        car2: [1+12*2, 12+12*2] = [25,36] -> safe.\n  Turn4: freeway3: [-56+3*3, -45+3*3] = [-56+9, -45+9] = [-47,-36] -> safe.\n  Turn5: freeway4: [-56+3*4, -45+3*4] = [-44,-33] -> safe.\n  Turn6: freeway5: left-moving: [12-36*5, 47-36*5] = [12-180,47-180] = [-168,-133] -> safe.\n  Turn7: freeway6: [-55+4*6, -44+4*6] = [-55+24,-44+24] = [-31,-20] -> safe.\n  Turn8: freeway7: [-55+4*7, -44+4*7] = [-55+28,-44+28] = [-27,-16] -> safe.\n  Turn9: freeway8: [-55+4*8, -44+4*8] = [-55+32, -44+32] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n  Turn10: we are at y=9, not on any freeway.\n\nSo the direct path works.\n\nThen the sequence would be:\n  Turn1: U\n  Turn2: U\n  Turn3: U\n  Turn4: U\n  Turn5: U\n  Turn6: U\n  Turn7: U\n  Turn8: U\n  Turn9: U\n  Turn10: S   (because we are at 9 at the beginning of turn10, and we must take an action? But we are already at 9, so we can take S to stay)\n\nBut note: after the action at turn9 (U), we are at 9 at turn10. Then at turn10, we take action S, and then at turn11 we are still at 9. But the condition is that at turn10 (t1+H-1=1+10-1=10) we are at 9. We are at 9 at the beginning of turn10. So we are done. The action at turn10 is taken, but it doesn't affect the fact that we are at 9 at turn10.\n\nHowever, is there a way with H=9? \n  We would then be at 9 at turn (1+9-1)=9.\n  How to be at 9 at turn9? \n      We start at turn1:0.\n      We need to be at 9 at turn9: that requires 8 moves? Because from 0 to 9: 9 steps? \n      Actually, to be at 9 at the beginning of turn9, we must have taken 8 ups: then at turn9 we are at 8+1? \n\n      Turn1: U -> turn2:1\n      Turn2: U -> turn3:2\n      ...\n      Turn8: U -> turn9:9? -> but that is 8 actions. Then we set H=9, and we take actions from turn1 to turn8? But the sequence requires H=9 actions? Then we take 9 actions? \n\n      We would have to do 9 actions in 8 moves? That is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\nBut the last action (at turn10) is not necessary for reaching 9, but we have to include it.\n\nAlternatively, can we reach 9 earlier by moving faster? We can only move one per turn.\n\nSo we output:\n\nTurn1: U\nTurn2: U\nTurn3: U\nTurn4: U\nTurn5: U\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: S\n\nBut note: the action at turn10 is S. We could also do U and stay at 9? Or D and then go to 8? But that would be bad. So we do S.\n\nBut is there a reason to do U or D? No, we are at 9 and we are done. So S is fine.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"avoiding collisions\" and at turn10 we are at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision check. Then we can do any action? But the goal is to reach (0,9) at turn10. We have reached, so the action at turn10 is inconsequential. We choose S.\n\nHowever, in the initial simulation, we did 9 U's and then one S. But let me confirm if at any turn we would have a collision.\n\nWe already checked turns 2 to 9: safe.\n\nBut what about turn1? We are at y=0 (not a freeway) -> safe.\n\nAnd turn10: y=9 -> safe.\n\nSo the plan is valid.\n\nBut is there a shorter plan? H=10 is the minimal because we need to cover 9 units.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: S\n}\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=10. Is there a plan with H=9? \n\nTo be at 9 at turn (1+9-1)=9, we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn9.\n\nHow to get from 0 at turn1 to 9 at turn9? That would require 8 moves: 0->1->...->9 in 8 moves? But we can only move one per turn. In 8 moves we can go to 8 at turn9. \n\nSo it's impossible.\n\nHence, H=10 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway5 at turn6: \n  At turn6 (T=6, so T-t1=5): \n      freeway5: left-moving car: [12 - 36*5, 47 - 36*5] = [12-180, 47-180] = [-168, -133] -> 0 not in there.\n\nAnother potential issue: freeway2 has two cars. At turn3, we are at freeway2. We checked both cars: [-23,-12] and [25,36] -> both don't include 0.\n\nfreeway1 at turn2: [1,48] -> 0 not included.\n\nSo it seems safe.\n\nBut note: the representation for freeway2 car2: at turn1 it is (head=12, tail=1, right, s=12). For a right-moving car, the span at t1 is [tau, head] = [1,12]. Then at turn3 (T=3, so 2 turns later): [1+12*(3-1), 12+12*(3-1)] = [1+24,12+24]=[25,36]. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, freeway5: the car is left-moving, so at T=6 (5 turns after t1): [12-36*5, 47-36*5] = [12-180,47-180]=[-168,-133]. \n\nBut note: the car on freeway5: given as (head=12, tail=47). For a left-moving car, the initial span is [head, tail] = [12,47]. Then moving left, at T: [12 - 36*(T-1), 47 - 36*(T-1)].\n\nAt T=6: [12-180,47-180] = [-168,-133]. \n\nBut what if T is not an integer? It is, since we move by discrete turns.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: S\n}\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" for H=10, so t from 0 to 9. \n\nThis corresponds to:\n  t=0: a_{1+0}=a1 = U\n  t=1: a2=U\n  ...\n  t=8: a9=U\n  t=9: a10=S\n\nSo the last action is at turn10 (t1+9).\n\nAnd we are at 9 at turn10 (t1+9) = 1+9 = 10? But the requirement is to be at 9 at turn (t1+H-1)=1+10-1=10 -> turn10.\n\nYes.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\) is \\(H = 10\\). The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) as follows:\n\n- At turn 1, the player is at \\(y = 0\\) (not a freeway), so no collision check is needed. Moving up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 2 is safe.\n- At turn 2, the player is at \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1). The car on freeway 1 at turn 2 has a span of \\([1, 48]\\) (calculated as \\([-47 + 48 \\times (2-1), 0 + 48 \\times (2-1)] = [1, 48]\\)). Since 0 is not in \\([1, 48]\\), moving up to \\(y = 2\\) is safe.\n- At turn 3, the player is at \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2). The cars on freeway 2 at turn 3 have spans:\n  - First car: \\([-47 + 12 \\times (3-1), -36 + 12 \\times (3-1)] = [-23, -12]\\)\n  - Second car: \\([1 + 12 \\times (3-1), 12 + 12 \\times (3-1)] = [25, 36]\\)\n  Since 0 is not in \\([-23, -12]\\) or \\([25, 36]\\), moving up to \\(y = 3\\) is safe.\n- At turn 4, the player is at \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3). The car on freeway 3 at turn 4 has a span of \\([-56 + 3 \\times (4-1), -45 + 3 \\times (4-1)] = [-47, -36]\\). Since 0 is not in \\([-47, -36]\\), moving up to \\(y = 4\\) is safe.\n- At turn 5, the player is at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4). The car on freeway 4 at turn 5 has a span of \\([-56 + 3 \\times (5-1), -45 + 3 \\times (5-1)] = [-44, -33]\\). Since 0 is not in \\([-44, -33]\\), moving up to \\(y = 5\\) is safe.\n- At turn 6, the player is at \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5). The car on freeway 5 (left-moving) at turn 6 has a span of \\([12 - 36 \\times (6-1), 47 - 36 \\times (6-1)] = [-168, -133]\\). Since 0 is not in \\([-168, -133]\\), moving up to \\(y = 6\\) is safe.\n- At turn 7, the player is at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6). The car on freeway 6 at turn 7 has a span of \\([-55 + 4 \\times (7-1), -44 + 4 \\times (7-1)] = [-31, -20]\\). Since 0 is not in \\([-31, -20]\\), moving up to \\(y = 7\\) is safe.\n- At turn 8, the player is at \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7). The car on freeway 7 at turn 8 has a span of \\([-55 + 4 \\times (8-1), -44 + 4 \\times (8-1)] = [-27, -16]\\). Since 0 is not in \\([-27, -16]\\), moving up to \\(y = 8\\) is safe.\n- At turn 9, the player is at \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8). The car on freeway 8 at turn 9 has a span of \\([-55 + 4 \\times (9-1), -44 + 4 \\times (9-1)] = [-23, -12]\\). Since 0 is not in \\([-23, -12]\\), moving up to \\(y = 9\\) is safe.\n- At turn 10, the player is at \\(y = 9\\) (not a freeway), so no collision check is needed. The action \"S\" (stay) is chosen to remain at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns 1 to 10 (i.e., \\(t_1 + t\\) for \\(t = 0\\) to \\(H-1 = 9\\)) ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 1 + 10 - 1 = 10\\).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: U \\\\\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the initial position at turn t1=2: (0,1). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0) in the y-direction, and must stay within y in [0,9].\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y = y_T and at that same turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that the car's span at turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nImportant note: when moving from freeway y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is only considered to be on freeway y_T during turn T. Therefore, at turn T, the player is at (0, y_T) and we check the cars on freeway y_T at turn T. Then at turn T+1, the player is at (0, y_{T+1}) and we check the cars on freeway y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting at turn t1 (which is 2) until we reach y=9.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1=2.\n\nLet me note the car states at turn 2 for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): one car: (head=48, tail=1, direction=right, speed=48)\n  - Since it's right-moving, the span at turn 2 is [tau, h] = [1,48] (because tail=1, head=48, and right-moving so the tail is at the left and head at the right? Actually the problem says: for right-moving, the span at t1 is [tau, h] and then at T it becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. \n  - But note: the representation in the table is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). However, the update rule for right-moving uses the initial span as [tau, h] and then moves by adding s*(T-t1). So we need to interpret the given (head, tail) appropriately.\n\nBut note the example in the update rule for right-moving: \n  Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo the car on freeway 1: (head=48, tail=1, right, 48). Then at turn 2, the span is [1,48]. \n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: two cars: \n  (-24, -35, right, 12) -> at turn 2: span = [-35, -24] (because tau=-35, h=-24? But wait, the representation is (head, tail) and then for right-moving we use [tail, head] as the initial span? \n\nThe problem says: \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\" and then for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\". So:\n\nCar1 on freeway2: head=-24, tail=-35 -> so span at t1=2 is [tail, head] = [-35, -24]\nCar2 on freeway2: head=24, tail=13 -> span at t1=2 is [13,24]\n\nSimilarly, freeway3: one car: (-42, -53, right, 3) -> span at turn2: [-53, -42]\n\nFreeway4: same as freeway3: [-53, -42]\n\nFreeway5: (-24, 11, left, 36) -> for left-moving, the update rule: Span(t1)=[h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  So at turn2: the car is left-moving, so span is [head, tail] = [-24, 11]? But note: the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" and then moves by subtracting s*(T-t1). \n\nHowever, the representation in the table is (head, tail, direction, speed). For the left-moving car: head=-24, tail=11. Then the span at turn2 is [head, tail] = [-24, 11]? But wait, that would be from -24 to 11, which is increasing? However, the direction is left, meaning the car is moving leftward. The problem doesn't specify the order of head and tail in terms of left/right, but note the update: for left-moving, the entire car moves left. \n\nBut observe: the update for left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. So the head is the leftmost at the beginning? Actually, the problem says: for left-moving, the initial span is [h, tau] and then we subtract. So the head h is the rightmost? Because when moving left, the head (which was at h) moves to h - s*(T-t1) and the tail (which was at tau) moves to tau - s*(T-t1). So if h > tau, then the car is from tau to h? But the representation (head, tail) might be arbitrary? \n\nLooking at the data: \n  freeway5: (-24, 11, left, 36) -> head=-24, tail=11. Then the initial span is [h, tau] = [-24, 11]. But that would be a car from -24 to 11, which is 35 units long? Then when moving left, the car will move to the left.\n\nBut note: the collision condition: we require that the player is at (0, y) and at turn T, the car on that freeway has 0 in its span. So for freeway5 at turn2: the car spans [-24,11]. Then 0 is in [-24,11]? Yes. So at turn2, if the player is on freeway5, then collision. \n\nSimilarly, freeway6: (-40, -51, right, 4) -> right-moving: span at turn2: [tail, head] = [-51, -40]\nfreeway7: same as 6: [-51, -40]\nfreeway8: same: [-51, -40]\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,1) at turn2. So at turn2, the player is on freeway1 (y=1). We must check the car on freeway1 at turn2: the car spans [1,48]. The player is at x=0. Is 0 in [1,48]? No. So no collision at turn2.\n\nOur goal is to move from y=1 to y=9 in minimal turns, avoiding collisions at every turn.\n\nWe must plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) such that at each turn, the player's y-position is in [0,9] and that at each turn T, the car(s) on the freeway y_T do not have 0 in their span at T.\n\nWe are to minimize the number of turns H.\n\nWe start at turn2, and the first action is at turn2? Actually, the problem says: the sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. So at turn2 (which is t1), we take action a_2, then at turn3 (t1+1) we take a_3, ... until we have taken H actions and then at the last action we are at y=9.\n\nNote: after H actions, the turn index of the last step is t1+H-1. We require that at that turn, y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nWe start at y_2=1.\n\nWe need to simulate the car positions at each future turn. Since the cars move at constant speed, we can compute their spans at any turn T (relative to t1=2: so T=2,3,4,...).\n\nLet me define the time relative to t1: let t = 0,1,2,... correspond to absolute turns t1, t1+1, t1+2, ... so at relative time t (which is t steps after t1), the absolute turn is T = t1 + t = 2+t.\n\nThen the car on freeway i at absolute turn T (relative time t) is:\n\nFor a car with initial (at t1=2) head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s:\n\nIf d is right:\n  span at T = [tau + s*(T-2), head + s*(T-2)] = [tau + s*t, h + s*t]   [since T-2 = t]\n\nIf d is left:\n  span at T = [h - s*(T-2), tau - s*(T-2)] = [h - s*t, tau - s*t]\n\nWe are only concerned with whether 0 is in the span.\n\nNow, the problem: we start at y=1 at turn2 (relative t=0). We need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of moves without any cars would be 8 moves (all U: from 1 to 9: 8 steps). But we have to avoid cars.\n\nWe must simulate for each freeway at each time step if the car spans include 0.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway and for a few turns (t=0,1,2,...) whether there is a car that covers x=0.\n\nWe'll denote for freeway i, at relative time t (absolute turn 2+t), the condition for collision: if the player is on freeway i at that turn, then we require that none of the cars on freeway i have 0 in their span at that turn.\n\nFreeway1 (y=1): one car: (h=48, tau=1, d=right, s=48)\n  At t: span = [1 + 48*t, 48 + 48*t]\n  0 in span? -> 1+48*t <= 0 <= 48+48*t? \n  Since t>=0, the smallest value is 1 (at t=0) which is >0, so 0 is never in the span. \n  Therefore, freeway1 is always safe? \n\nBut wait at t=0: [1,48] does not contain 0 -> safe.\nAt t=1: [1+48, 48+48] = [49,96] -> no 0.\nSo freeway1 is safe at all times.\n\nFreeway2 (y=2): two cars:\n  Car1: (h=-24, tau=-35, d=right, s=12) -> span = [ -35 + 12*t, -24 + 12*t ]\n  Car2: (h=24, tau=13, d=right, s=12) -> span = [13 + 12*t, 24 + 12*t]\n\nFor Car1: \n  0 in [ -35+12t, -24+12t] ? \n  Solve: -35+12t <= 0 <= -24+12t \n  => 12t <= 35 -> t <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so t<=2\n      and 0 >= -24+12t -> 12t <= 24 -> t<=2\n  Actually: \n    -35+12t <= 0  => t <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916 -> so t=0,1,2 are possible for the lower bound.\n    -24+12t >= 0  => t >= 24/12 = 2.\n  So at t=2: \n    lower = -35+24 = -11, upper = -24+24=0 -> so 0 is included (since the interval is [-11,0] and 0 is the upper bound). \n    Therefore, at t=2 (absolute turn 4), the car1 on freeway2 has 0 in its span.\n\n  At t=0: [-35,-24] -> no 0.\n  t=1: [-23, -12] -> no 0.\n  t=2: [-11,0] -> 0 is included -> unsafe at t=2.\n\n  For Car2:\n    [13+12t, 24+12t] -> 0 in that? \n    Since 13+12t >=13>0, so never.\n\n  Therefore, freeway2 is unsafe at t=2 (absolute turn 4) because of car1.\n\n  But safe at t=0,1,3,4,... for t>=3: \n    t=3: car1: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> no 0.\n\nFreeway3 (y=3): one car: (h=-42, tau=-53, d=right, s=3) -> span = [-53+3t, -42+3t]\n  0 in [-53+3t, -42+3t]?\n  Solve: \n    -53+3t <= 0 <= -42+3t\n    => 3t <= 53 -> t <= 53/3 ≈ 17.66\n        and 0 <= -42+3t -> 3t>=42 -> t>=14.\n  So for t in [14,17] (inclusive) the car covers 0? \n  But we are only concerned with small t? Let's check t=0 to 20? But we are minimizing H (which is the number of steps, so we hope H is small, say less than 10).\n\n  At t=0: [-53,-42] -> no 0.\n  t=1: [-50,-39] -> no\n  ... until t=14: [-53+42, -42+42] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included (at the upper bound) -> unsafe at t=14.\n  t=15: [-53+45, -42+45] = [-8,3] -> 0 is included? yes, -8<=0<=3 -> unsafe.\n  t=16: [-5,6] -> unsafe.\n  t=17: [-2,9] -> unsafe.\n  t=18: [1,12] -> safe.\n\n  But since we are looking for minimal H (probably around 8), we don't need to worry about t>=14.\n\n  So freeway3 is safe for t=0,1,...,13 and then unsafe for t=14 to 17.\n\nFreeway4 (y=4): same as freeway3: (h=-42, tau=-53, right, 3) -> same as above: unsafe at t=14,15,16,17. Safe otherwise.\n\nFreeway5 (y=5): one car: (h=-24, tau=11, left, 36) \n  For left-moving: span at t: [h - 36*t, tau - 36*t] = [-24 - 36*t, 11 - 36*t]\n  Note: the car is moving left, so the entire segment is decreasing.\n\n  0 in [-24-36t, 11-36t]?\n  Since the car is moving left, the segment is [a, b] with a = -24-36t, b=11-36t. Note that a < b? Actually, at t=0: [-24,11] -> which does include 0. So at t=0 (absolute turn2) the car on freeway5 has 0 in its span -> unsafe at t=0.\n\n  At t=1: [-24-36, 11-36] = [-60, -25] -> no 0.\n  t=2: [-96, -61] -> no.\n\n  So freeway5 is unsafe at t=0 (and also at negative times?) but safe for t>=1.\n\nFreeway6 (y=6): (h=-40, tau=-51, right, 4) -> wait, the representation: head=-40, tail=-51, right -> so span at t: [tau+4t, h+4t] = [-51+4t, -40+4t]\n  0 in [-51+4t, -40+4t]?\n  Solve: \n    -51+4t <= 0 <= -40+4t\n    => 4t <= 51 -> t <= 12.75\n        and 0 <= -40+4t -> 4t>=40 -> t>=10.\n  So for t in [10,12] (inclusive) the car covers 0.\n\n  t=10: [-51+40, -40+40] = [-11,0] -> 0 included? yes (at upper bound) -> unsafe.\n  t=11: [-51+44, -40+44] = [-7,4] -> 0 in it -> unsafe.\n  t=12: [-51+48, -40+48] = [-3,8] -> unsafe.\n  t=13: [1,12] -> safe.\n\n  So freeway6 is unsafe for t=10,11,12.\n\nFreeway7 (y=7): same as freeway6: (h=-40, tau=-51, right,4) -> same: unsafe at t=10,11,12.\n\nFreeway8 (y=8): same: unsafe at t=10,11,12.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=1 (freeway1) at t=0 (absolute turn2). We must avoid:\n\n- At freeway5 (y=5) at t=0: unsafe -> so we cannot be at y=5 at t=0? But we start at y=1, so we are not at y=5 at t=0.\n\nWe are at y=1 at t=0. We are safe.\n\nWe need to move to y=9. The minimal moves would be 8 steps (if we go up every time). But we have to avoid:\n\n- freeway2 at t=2: unsafe -> if we are at freeway2 (y=2) at absolute turn4 (t=2) then we crash.\n\n- freeway5 at t=0: unsafe, but we are not there at t=0.\n\n- freeway6,7,8 at t=10,11,12: unsafe, but we hope to finish in less than 10 steps? 8 steps would get us to t=8 (absolute turn10) and then we would be at y=9 at the last step (turn10). But note: at t=8, we are at freeway? We start at y=1 at t=0, then after 8 Ups: y=1+8=9 at t=8 (absolute turn10). \n\nBut we must check the entire path: at each step t (0 to 8) we are at a freeway and must be safe.\n\nThe path for 8 Ups:\n\nt=0: y=1 -> safe (as we saw)\nt=1: y=2 -> freeway2: at relative time t=1 (absolute turn3) -> check freeway2 at t=1: \n   freeway2: car1: [-35+12*1, -24+12*1] = [-23,-12] -> no 0 -> safe? \n        car2: [13+12,24+12]=[25,36] -> safe.\nt=2: y=3 -> freeway3: at t=2: freeway3: car: [-53+3*2, -42+3*2] = [-53+6, -42+6] = [-47,-36] -> no 0 -> safe.\nt=3: y=4 -> freeway4: at t=3: car: [-53+9, -42+9] = [-44,-33] -> safe.\nt=4: y=5 -> freeway5: at t=4: car: [h-36*4, tau-36*4] = [-24-144, 11-144] = [-168,-133] -> safe (since 0 not in that interval).\nt=5: y=6 -> freeway6: at t=5: car: [-51+4*5, -40+4*5] = [-51+20, -40+20] = [-31,-20] -> safe.\nt=6: y=7 -> freeway7: at t=6: car: [-51+24, -40+24] = [-27,-16] -> safe.\nt=7: y=8 -> freeway8: at t=7: car: [-51+28, -40+28] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\nt=8: y=9 -> no freeway at y=9? The freeways are y=1 to 8. At y=9, there are no cars, so safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of 8 Ups is safe.\n\nBut wait: at t=2 (absolute turn4) we are at freeway3 (y=3), and we are safe. However, note that freeway2 at t=2 is unsafe, but we are not on freeway2 at t=2. We were on freeway2 at t=1 and then moved to freeway3 at t=2. So we avoid freeway2 at t=2.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n\nTurn2: U -> y=2\nTurn3: U -> y=3\nTurn4: U -> y=4\nTurn5: U -> y=5\nTurn6: U -> y=6\nTurn7: U -> y=7\nTurn8: U -> y=8\nTurn9: U -> y=9\n\nBut note: the problem says the sequence of actions for t from t1 to t1+H-1. We start at turn2 (t1=2) and do 8 actions? Then the last action is at turn2+7=9? Then the player position after 8 actions: \n  y_2 = 1\n  after a2: y3 = 1+1 = 2\n  after a3: y4 = 2+1 = 3\n  after a4: y5 = 3+1 = 4\n  after a5: y6 = 4+1 = 5\n  after a6: y7 = 5+1 = 6\n  after a7: y8 = 6+1 = 7\n  after a8: y9 = 7+1 = 8? \n  We are at y=8 at turn9? Then we need one more to get to y=9.\n\nI think I miscounted: \n  At turn2 (start): y=1.\n  Then we take an action at turn2 to move to the next position at turn3.\n\n  So:\n    At turn2: we take action a2 -> then at turn3, we are at y2 + Delta(a2).\n\n  We need to get to y=9 at the last turn of the sequence. The sequence has H actions: from turn2 to turn2+H-1.\n\n  After H actions, the turn index is 2+H-1 = 1+H, and we are at y_{1+H} = 9.\n\n  How many steps? \n      Start: turn2: y2=1.\n      After 1st action (a2): at turn3, y3 = 1 + d2.\n      After 2nd action (a3): at turn4, y4 = y3 + d3.\n      ...\n      After k actions: at turn2+k, y_{2+k} = 1 + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} d_{2+i}\n\n  We want y_{2+H} = 9? Actually, the last state after H actions is at turn2+H. But the problem says: the sequence of actions is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so the last action is at turn t1+H-1 = 2+H-1 = 1+H. Then the resulting position is at turn 2+H.\n\n  And we require that at turn 2+H, the player is at (0,9). \n\n  Therefore, we need to have y_{2+H} = 9.\n\n  How many moves? We start at 1 and need to get to 9: that is 8 moves up. So H=8? Then the last action is at turn2+7=9, and the position at turn10 is 9.\n\n  The moves:\n      turn2: a2 -> y3 = 1 + (if a2=U then +1) \n      turn3: a3 -> y4 = y3 + ...\n      ...\n      turn9: a9 -> y10 = ... \n\n  We want y10 = 9.\n\n  The net displacement: from 1 to 9: +8. So we need 8 Ups. Then H=8.\n\n  The sequence of actions: 8 Ups.\n\n  The path in terms of turns and freeways:\n\n      At turn2: we are at y2=1 (freeway1) -> safe (as computed).\n      Then we take a2=U -> so at turn3: y3=2 (freeway2) -> relative time t=1: freeway2 safe? yes (t=1: freeway2 safe as computed above).\n      Then a3=U -> turn4: y4=3 (freeway3) -> t=2: freeway3: safe? at t=2: freeway3: [-53+3*2, -42+3*2] = [-47,-36] -> safe.\n      Then a4=U -> turn5: y5=4 (freeway4) -> t=3: freeway4: [-53+3*3, -42+3*3] = [-44,-33] -> safe.\n      Then a5=U -> turn6: y6=5 (freeway5) -> t=4: freeway5: [-24-36*4, 11-36*4] = [-24-144, 11-144] = [-168, -133] -> safe.\n      Then a6=U -> turn7: y7=6 (freeway6) -> t=5: freeway6: [-51+4*5, -40+4*5] = [-31,-20] -> safe.\n      Then a7=U -> turn8: y8=7 (freeway7) -> t=6: freeway7: [-51+24, -40+24] = [-27,-16] -> safe.\n      Then a8=U -> turn9: y9=8 (freeway8) -> t=7: freeway8: [-51+28, -40+28] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n      Then at turn10: y10=9 -> no car check (freeway9 doesn't exist? but the problem says freeways y=1..8, so y=9 is safe).\n\n  Therefore, the sequence of 8 Ups works.\n\nBut note: at the last step, after the last action (at turn9) we are at y9=8? Then the next state is at turn10: y10=9. The problem says: we require that at turn 2+H-1 (the last action) we are at (0,9)? Actually, no: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at the turn after the last action? \n\nRe-read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nWait: the problem says: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nBut note: \n  t1 = 2.\n  The actions: \n      a_{t1+0} = a_2 -> then at turn t1+1 = 3, we have y_3 = y_2 + Delta(a_2)\n      a_{t1+1} = a_3 -> then at turn t1+2 = 4, we have y_4 = y_3 + Delta(a_3)\n      ...\n      a_{t1+H-1} = a_{2+H-1} = a_{1+H} -> then at turn t1+H = 2+H, we have y_{2+H} = ... \n\nBut the condition is: y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nThat is: y_{2+H-1} = y_{1+H} = 9.\n\nThis means: at the turn immediately after the last action? Actually, the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1 = 2+H-1 = 1+H. Then the state at the next turn (turn 2+H) is y_{2+H}? But the condition is for the state at turn 1+H to be 9.\n\nWait, let me index:\n\nAt turn2: we start at y2=1.\n\nThen we take an action at turn2 (a2) and then the next state is at turn3: y3.\n\nSo the state at turn k is the state after the action at turn k-1? \n\nActually, the update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo the state at turn t+1 is the result of action at turn t.\n\nTherefore, after taking action at turn t, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\n  Action at turn2: leads to state at turn3: y3.\n  Action at turn3: leads to state at turn4: y4.\n  ...\n  Action at turn (2+H-1) = 1+H: leads to state at turn (1+H+1) = 2+H.\n\nBut the condition is: y_{t1+H-1} = 9, that is y_{2+H-1} = y_{1+H} = 9.\n\nThis implies that the state at turn 1+H must be 9. How do we achieve that?\n\nNote: the state at turn2 is y2=1.\n\nThen:\n  After action a2 (at turn2): y3 = y2 + d2.\n  After action a3 (at turn3): y4 = y3 + d3 = y2 + d2 + d3.\n  ...\n  After action a_{k} (at turn k): y_{k+1} = ... \n\nWe want the state at turn 1+H to be 9. The turn index 1+H is the state after the action taken at turn H? \n\nActually, the actions are taken at turns: 2, 3, ..., 2+H-1.\n\nThe last action is taken at turn (2+H-1) = 1+H. Then the state after that last action is at turn (1+H+1)=2+H.\n\nBut the condition is for the state at turn 1+H to be 9. So that state must be achieved by an action taken at turn H? \n\nWait, we have:\n\n  Turn2: state y2=1 -> then we take a2 -> leads to state y3 at turn3.\n  We want the state at turn (1+H) to be 9.\n\n  How many actions are taken by the time we get to state at turn (1+H)? \n\n  The state at turn2 is the initial state (no action taken at turn2? But we are about to take an action at turn2 to get to turn3).\n\n  The state at turn k is achieved by the actions taken at turns 2,3,...,k-1.\n\n  Specifically, the state at turn k: \n      k=2: initial, no action so far.\n      k=3: after one action (at turn2)\n      k=4: after two actions (at turn2 and turn3)\n      ...\n      k = 2 + j: after j actions.\n\n  We want the state at turn (1+H) to be 9. \n\n  Set 2+j = 1+H -> j = H-1.\n\n  So we take H-1 actions to get from turn2 to turn (1+H). But we are to take H actions? \n\n  This seems inconsistent.\n\nRe-read the problem: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\n  So the sequence of actions: \n      t=0: a_{t1+0} = a_2\n      t=1: a_3\n      ...\n      t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1} = a_{2+H-1} = a_{1+H}\n\n  Then the condition: y_{t1+H-1} = y_{2+H-1} = 9.\n\n  But note: the state at turn (2+H-1) = 1+H is the result of the action taken at turn (1+H-1)? \n\n  How is the state updated? \n      We start at turn2: y2=1.\n      Then we take a2 (at turn2) and get y3 = y2 + d2.\n      Then we take a3 (at turn3) and get y4 = y3 + d3.\n      ...\n      Then we take a_{1+H-1} at turn (1+H-1) and get y_{1+H} = ... \n\n  The last action we take is at turn (1+H) (which is the last element of the sequence: a_{1+H})?

How? \n\n        The state y9 is the result of the action at turn8. \n\n        The actions: \n            a2 (turn2) -> y3\n            a3 (turn3) -> y4\n            ...\n            a8 (turn8) -> y9\n\n        So we require that the action at turn8 (the 7th action? because t from 0 to 7: 8 actions) gives y9 = y8 + d8 = 9.\n\n        But y8 is the state at turn8 (which is the result of action at turn7). \n\n        We have:\n            y2=1\n            y3 = 1+d2\n            y4 = 1+d2+d3\n            ...\n            y8 = 1 + d2+d3+...+d7\n            y9 = 1 + d2+d3+...+d7+d8\n\n        We require y9=9 -> 1 + (d2+...+d8)=9 -> sum=8.\n\n        So if we use 8 Ups: then d2=d3=...=d8=1 -> then y9=1+8=9.\n\n        Therefore, the sequence: 8 Ups: a2=U, a3=U, a4=U, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U? \n\n        But wait, the sequence has 8 actions: from a2 to a9? \n\n        The indices: \n            t=0: a_{2+0}=a2\n            t=1: a_{3}\n            t=2: a4\n            t=3: a5\n            t=4: a6\n            t=5: a7\n            t=6: a8\n            t=7: a9\n\n        So yes, the last action is a9.\n\n        But note: the condition is on the state at turn t1+H-1 = 2+8-1 = 9, which is y9. And we have y9=9.\n\n        How do we compute the state at turn9? It is the result of the action at turn8? and then the last action is at turn9? But the last action (a9) is taken at turn9, and it would affect y10. But we don't care about y10.\n\n        The state at turn9 is already determined by the actions up to turn8: \n            y9 = y8 + d8 (from the action at turn8) \n            and then we take an action at turn9? but that action is the last in the sequence and we require that after that action we are at y10? But the condition is y9=9.\n\n        This implies that the last action (a9) is taken at turn9, but it does not affect y9? \n\n        Actually, the state at turn9 is already fixed by the previous actions. The action at turn9 will affect the state at turn10. But the condition is only on y9. \n\n        Therefore, the last action (a9) is taken at turn9, but it does not change the fact that at turn9 we are at y9=9. \n\n        However, we must check for collisions at the state when we are at turn9: we are at (0,9). \n\n        But note: at turn9, we are at freeway9? There are no cars on freeway9, so it's safe. \n\n        However, the problem says: we are at (0,9) at turn9. \n\n        But also note: the action at turn9 is taken while we are at turn9: and the rule says that when we take an action at turn9, we are at freeway9? Then we move to freeway10? But the grid only goes to y=9? \n\n        Actually, the update: \n            y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, and y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]. \n\n        If we are at y9=9 and we take action U, then y10=10 -> invalid. \n\n        But the condition only requires that at turn9 (the state) we are at (0,9). The action at turn9 is part of the sequence, but we don't require to be at (0,9) after the action? \n\n        However, the condition is only on y_{t1+H-1}=y9=9. \n\n        And we are at turn9: so we are at (0,9). \n\n        But the action taken at turn9: we must choose an action that is valid? \n\n        Since we are already at y9=9, we cannot go up. We can only go down or stay. \n\n        However, if we go down at turn9, then we would leave (0,9) at the next state, but the condition is satisfied at turn9. \n\n        But the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn9. \n\n        However, we are required to provide the action for turn9. But we don't care about the state after turn9? \n\n        The problem says: the sequence of actions until we reach (0,9). Once we are at (0,9) at turn9, we have reached. So the action at turn9 could be anything? But it must be valid. \n\n        Since we are at y9=9, we cannot choose U (because then y10=10 which is invalid). We must choose S or D. \n\n        But if we choose D, then at the next state we are at y10=8, but we don't care. \n\n        However, the problem does not say we must remain at (0,9). It just says to reach at turn9. \n\n        Therefore, we can choose S for the last action? \n\n        But note: the condition is on the state at turn9, which is before the last action? \n\n        Actually, the state at turn9 is the state that we have at the beginning of turn9. Then we take an action at turn9. \n\n        So at the beginning of turn9, we are at (0,9). Then we take an action at turn9. \n\n        We must avoid collisions at turn9: we are at freeway9? There are no cars on freeway9, so safe. \n\n        Therefore, we can choose S (stay) at turn9. \n\n        But wait: the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1: that is turn2 to turn9 (since H=8 -> t1+H-1=2+8-1=9). \n\n        And the condition is that at turn9 (the state) we are at (0,9). \n\n        So the minimal sequence is 8 Ups? But then:\n\n          a2=U: turn2 -> then at turn3: y3=2\n          a3=U: turn3 -> turn4: y4=3\n          a4=U: turn4 -> turn5: y5=4\n          a5=U: turn5 -> turn6: y6=5\n          a6=U: turn6 -> turn7: y7=6\n          a7=U: turn7 -> turn8: y8=7\n          a8=U: turn8 -> turn9: y9=8? \n          Then we are at y9=8, not 9.\n\n        What went wrong? \n\n        We need 8 Ups to go from 1 to 9? But the state at turn9 is the result of 7 actions: \n          actions at turn2,3,...,8: that's 7 actions. \n          Then the state at turn9 = 1 + 7*1 = 8.\n\n        Then we need one more action to get to 9? \n\n        So we need 8 Ups, but then the last action must be taken at turn9? and we want the state at turn9 to be 9? \n\n        But the state at turn9 is 8, then we take an action at turn9 (U) and then at turn10 we become 9. But the condition is for the state at turn9 to be 9, which is not.\n\n        Alternatively, if we take 8 Ups, then the state at turn10 is 9. But the condition is for turn9.\n\n        Therefore, we must be at 9 at turn9. \n\n        How many actions? \n          Let j = number of actions from turn2 to turn8 (inclusive) to get from y2=1 to y9=9? \n          The states: \n            turn2: y2=1\n            turn3: y3 = 1+d2\n            ...\n            turn9: y9 = 1 + d2+d3+...+d8   (because we have taken actions at turn2 to turn8: 7 actions) \n\n          Then we require 1 + (d2+...+d8) = 9 -> 8. \n\n          But we can only add 1 per action. So we need 8 in the sum -> 8 Ups. But we only have 7 actions? \n\n        So we need 8 actions: from turn2 to turn9. Then:\n          y10 = 1 + (d2+...+d9) = 9 -> so we need 8 Ups. \n\n          But then the state at turn10 is 9. \n\n          And the condition is for y_{t1+H-1}=y_{2+H-1}=9. \n\n          We want y_{2+H-1}=9. \n\n          With H=9: then y_{2+9-1}=y10=9 -> that works.\n\n        Therefore, H=9: 9 actions.\n\n        The sequence: 8 Ups and then one more action? But we are already at 9 at turn10. \n\n        How do we get to 9 at turn9? \n\n        Alternatively, we can go faster? But we can only move one step per turn.\n\n        Actually, we start at turn2: y2=1.\n        We want y9=9: that is 7 turns later? \n          y3 = 1 + d2\n          y4 = 1 + d2+d3\n          ...\n          y9 = 1 + d2+...+d8 -> 7 actions (from turn2 to turn8) -> 7 steps? Then we need to cover 8 units in 7 moves? \n          So we need to average more than 1 per move? But we can only do at most 1 per move.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot get to 9 at turn9? \n\n        But wait, we start at turn2: we have 7 moves (at turn2,3,...,8) to get to turn9. \n\n        The net displacement: 8. \n\n        So we need 8 moves? \n\n        Then we would get to y10=9.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H such that we are at y_{2+H-1}=9 must be at least 9: \n          H=9: then state at turn 2+9-1=10: y10=9 -> that's acceptable? \n\n        But the problem says: we require the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9. \n\n        With H=9, we have y_{2+9-1}=y10=9 -> satisfied.\n\n        The sequence: 8 Ups and then one more action? But the last action (at turn10) is not taken? \n\n        The sequence: \n            t=0: a2\n            t=1: a3\n            ...\n            t=8: a10\n\n        Then we have 9 actions: a2 to a10.\n\n        And then the state at turn11? \n\n        We want the state at turn10 to be 9. How? \n\n        We have:\n          y2=1\n          y3 = 1 + d2\n          ...\n          y10 = 1 + d2+...+d9\n\n        We require y10=9 -> 1 + (d2+...+d9)=9 -> sum=8.\n\n        So we can do 8 Ups and 1 Stay? \n\n        For example: \n          a2 to a9: U (8 times) -> then at turn10: y10 = 1+8=9.\n          Then we take a10: but we don't need to move? but the sequence requires 9 actions. \n\n          We can set a10=S.\n\n        Then the state at turn11: y11=9+0=9, but we don't care.\n\n        And at turn10: we are at (0,9) -> satisfied.\n\n        But note: we must avoid collisions at every turn from turn2 to turn10? \n\n        Specifically, at the state at turn k (for k=2 to 10) we must be safe.\n\n        The state at turn10: y10=9 -> no cars, safe.\n\n        And the path we computed earlier for 8 Ups (which got us to y10=9) was safe? \n\n        Actually, the path we computed for 8 Ups (with actions at turn2 to turn9) led to:\n          turn3: y=2 (freeway2) at t=1: safe.\n          turn4: y=3 (freeway3) at t=2: safe.\n          turn5: y=4 (freeway4) at t=3: safe.\n          turn6: y=5 (freeway5) at t=4: safe.\n          turn7: y=6 (freeway6) at t=5: safe.\n          turn8: y=7 (freeway7) at t=6: safe.\n          turn9: y=8 (freeway8) at t=7: safe.\n          turn10: y=9: safe.\n\n        But note: we are now taking an extra action at turn10: a10=S. \n\n        At turn10: we are at freeway9? safe.\n\n        And the action at turn10 is taken at turn10: then the next state is turn11: but we don't care.\n\n        However, we must check the safety at the state at turn10: which we did (safe).\n\n        But the problem is: we also have to be safe at every intermediate state. \n\n        The states are at turns: 2,3,4,...,10.\n\n        We already checked turns 2 to 9 in the 8 Ups scenario. \n\n        At turn2: we are at y2=1: safe (as computed).\n        At turn3: y3=2: safe (freeway2 at t=1: safe).\n        ...\n        At turn10: y10=9: safe.\n\n        And the actions: \n          turn2: U\n          turn3: U\n          ...\n          turn9: U\n          turn10: S   (or we could choose D? but that would make y11=8, but we don't care, but also we are at turn10: we are at y10=9, which is safe. However, if we choose D, then at turn10 we are at freeway9? and then move to freeway8 at turn11? but we don't care about turn11. But we must check collision at turn10: we are at freeway9 at turn10: safe. \n\n        But note: if we choose U at turn10, we would go to 10, which is invalid. So we cannot choose U. \n\n        So we choose S.\n\n        Therefore, the sequence:\n\n          Turn2: U\n          Turn3: U\n          Turn4: U\n          Turn5: U\n          Turn6: U\n          Turn7: U\n          Turn8: U\n          Turn9: U\n          Turn10: S\n\n        H=9.\n\n        But is there a way to do it in H=8? \n\n        We would require y_{2+8-1}=y9=9.\n\n        How? \n          y9 = 1 + d2+d3+...+d8 = 9 -> so d2+...+d8=8.\n\n          So we need 8 Ups in 7 actions? (because actions from turn2 to turn8: 7 actions) -> impossible.\n\n        Therefore, minimal H is 9.\n\n        But wait, what if we go faster by moving down at some point? \n\n        We need to cover 8 units upward in 7 moves: impossible. \n\n        Therefore, we must use 8 Ups, which requires 8 actions? but then we are at y10=9, so we need 9 actions to have the state at turn10=9.\n\n        And the condition is for the state at turn 2+H-1 to be 9. With H=9: turn2+9-1=10 -> y10=9.\n\n        So that matches.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is 9 actions.\n\n        But let me verify the turns and the safety for the entire path:\n\n          Turn2: y2=1 -> safe (freeway1 at t=0: [1,48] doesn't cover 0)\n          Action a2=U -> then at turn3: y3=2.\n\n          Turn3: y3=2 -> freeway2 at t=1 (relative time t=1: absolute turn3 = 2+1, so relative t=1): \n              car1: [-35+12*1, -24+12*1] = [-23,-12] -> no 0 -> safe.\n              car2: [13+12,24+12]=[25,36] -> safe.\n          Action a3=U -> turn4: y4=3.\n\n          Turn4: y4=3 -> freeway3 at t=2: [-53+6, -42+6]=[-47,-36] -> safe.\n          Action a4=U -> turn5: y5=4.\n\n          Turn5: y5=4 -> freeway4 at t=3: [-53+9, -42+9]=[-44,-33] -> safe.\n          Action a5=U -> turn6: y6=5.\n\n          Turn6: y6=5 -> freeway5 at t=4: [-24-144, 11-144] = [-168, -133] -> safe.\n          Action a6=U -> turn7: y7=6.\n\n          Turn7: y7=6 -> freeway6 at t=5: [-51+20, -40+20]=[-31,-20] -> safe.\n          Action a7=U -> turn8: y8=7.\n\n          Turn8: y8=7 -> freeway7 at t=6: [-51+24, -40+24]=[-27,-16] -> safe.\n          Action a8=U -> turn9: y9=8.\n\n          Turn9: y9=8 -> freeway8 at t=7: [-51+28, -40+28]=[-23,-12] -> safe.\n          Action a9=U would be invalid, so we do a9=S? But wait, we are required to have the last action in the sequence at turn10? \n\n          Actually, the sequence has 9 actions: from turn2 to turn10.\n\n          Turn9: we are at y9=8. Then we take a9 at turn9: but we want to be at y10=9? \n          So we must do U at turn9? but then y10=9, but we are at turn10: then we take a10 at turn10: but we are at y10=9 and then we do a10=S.\n\n          However, we only have 9 actions: a2 to a10. \n\n          The actions:\n            a2: U (at turn2) -> y3=2\n            a3: U -> y4=3\n            a4: U -> y5=4\n            a5: U -> y6=5\n            a6: U -> y7=6\n            a7: U -> y8=7\n            a8: U -> y9=8\n            a9: U -> y10=9   [at turn10: we are at 9]\n            a10: S (or D, but S is safe) at turn10: then y11=9.\n\n          Then the state at turn10 (which is 2+9-1=10) is y10=9 -> satisfied.\n\n          And the safety at turn10: freeway9: no cars -> safe.\n\n          But what about the action at turn10? We are at turn10: we are at (0,10)? No, we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn10. Then we take a10=S -> then we stay at (0,9) for turn11? but we don't care.\n\n          However, at the beginning of turn10, we are at (0,9) -> that is the state that matters for collision? and it's safe.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n            Turn2: U\n            Turn3: U\n            Turn4: U\n            Turn5: U\n            Turn6: U\n            Turn7: U\n            Turn8: U\n            Turn9: U   [this gets us to y10=9 at turn10]\n            Turn10: S   [we are already at 9, so we stay]\n\n          But note: the action at turn9 (U) is taken when we are at y9=8 (freeway8) at turn9: which is safe (as computed above). \n\n          Then at turn10: we are at y10=9: safe.\n\n          And the action at turn10: we are at freeway9: safe.\n\n        Therefore, the sequence is:\n\n          Turn2: U\n          Turn3: U\n          Turn4: U\n          Turn5: U\n          Turn6: U\n          Turn7: U\n          Turn8: U\n          Turn9: U\n          Turn10: S\n\n        However, we could also do Turn10: D? but that would move us down to 8 at turn11, but we don't care. But it's not necessary.\n\n        Alternatively, we could do the last action as S at turn9 and then we are at y10=8? but then we need to get to 9 at turn10? no, we are at turn10 and we want y10=9. So we must do U at turn9 to get to 9 at turn10.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal sequence is 8 Ups and one Stay at the end.\n\n        But note: we could avoid the extra action by not doing the last Stay? \n\n        However, the sequence must have H=9 actions. So we must include an action at turn10.\n\n        Therefore, we output 9 actions.\n\n        But let me confirm the state at turn10: \n          We start at turn2: y2=1.\n          After a2 (U) at turn2: y3=2.\n          ... \n          After a9 (U) at turn9: y10=9.\n          Then a10 (S) at turn10: y11=9.\n\n        And the condition is for the state at turn10 (which is y10=9) to be 9 -> satisfied.\n\n        And we avoid collisions at every state from turn2 to turn10.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        But note: at turn9, when we are at y9=8, and we take action U, then during turn9 we are at freeway8. We already checked freeway8 at relative time t=7 (absolute turn9) is safe.\n\n        Therefore, we are good.\n\n        But wait: the problem says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1, ..., 8\". At turn10, we are at freeway9? which is not in 1..8, so safe.\n\n        So the answer is:\n\n          Turn2: U\n          Turn3: U\n          Turn4: U\n          Turn5: U\n          Turn6: U\n          Turn7: U\n          Turn8: U\n          Turn9: U\n          Turn10: S\n\n        However, we could also do:\n\n          Turn2: U\n          Turn3: U\n          Turn4: U\n          Turn5: U\n          Turn6: U\n          Turn7: U\n          Turn8: U\n          Turn9: U\n          Turn10: D   -> then y11=8, but we don't care. And at turn10: we are at freeway9: safe.\n\n        But we choose S for clarity.\n\n        Alternatively, we could do without the last action? But the problem requires a sequence of H actions that gets the state at turn (2+H-1) to 9. With H=8, we would have the state at turn9 = y9 = 8, which is not 9. So we need H=9.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 9.\n\n        But is there a way to get there in fewer than 9 actions? We need 8 upward moves, and we start at turn2 and the state after 8 upward moves is at turn10. And we need the state at turn10 to be 9. So we must have 9 actions to cover the 8 moves and then an extra action (which is necessary to meet the condition on the state index).\n\n        However, note that the condition is on the state at turn (2+H-1) to be 9. We can get to 9 at turn10 by taking 8 Ups and then one more action (which is a no-op) at turn10. \n\n        We cannot get to 9 earlier because of the move constraints.\n\n        Therefore, we output the above sequence.\n\n        However, let me see if we can get to 9 at an earlier turn by moving down and then up? But that would take more moves. For example, if we move down at some point, we would have to compensate by an extra up. That would increase the total moves.\n\n        So minimal H is 9.\n\n        Final answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: S\n}\n\n        But note: the absolute turn indices: \n          t1 = 2, then the actions are for turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\n        And the last state is at turn 2+H-1 = 2+9-1 = 10: y10=9.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so for t=0 to 8 (H=9, so t=0..8). \n          t=0: a2\n          t=1: a3\n          ...\n          t=8: a10\n\n        So the last action is at turn10.\n\n        And we output the actions for turns 2 to 10.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) is 9. The sequence of actions is designed to move the player upward by one unit per turn for eight consecutive turns, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 10, followed by a stay action to satisfy the sequence length requirement.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 3, and the player is at (0,2). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0). The vertical position is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player is always 0).\n\nNote: When moving from freeway y to y' at turn T, at the moment of turn T the player is still on freeway y. Then at the next turn (T+1) the player will be on freeway y'. Therefore, when moving, we only check the freeway we are currently on for collision.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1=3. We need to compute the car spans at future turns.\n\nCar update:\n- For a car at turn t1: \n  - If moving left: at turn T (T>=t1), the span is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  - If moving right: the span is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the representation for right-moving cars is given as (head, tail) but in the update for right-moving, the head is the rightmost? Actually, the problem says:\n  - Right-moving: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo in the initial state, for a right-moving car, the head is the larger number? Let me check the example:\n\nFor freeway 1: (96,49,right,48) -> at turn 3, the car is at [49,96]? But the update rule says: for right-moving, the span at t1 is [tau, h] and then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So in the initial state, they gave (head, tail) but note that for right-moving, the head is the front (which is the larger coordinate) and tail is the back? Actually, the problem says: \"for car k: (head h, tail tau, ...)\" and then for right-moving: [tau, h] -> ... So in the state, for a right-moving car, the head h is the rightmost (larger) and tail tau is the leftmost (smaller). Similarly, for left-moving, the head is the leftmost (smaller) and tail is the rightmost? Actually, the update for left-moving: [h, tau] -> [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. So in the state, for a left-moving car, h is the leftmost and tau is the rightmost? But note the example: freeway 5: (-60, -25, left, 36). Then at turn 3, the span is [h, tau] = [-60, -25]. Then at a future turn T, it becomes [-60 -36*(T-3), -25-36*(T-3)].\n\nSo to summarize:\n- Right-moving: at turn t1: the car spans from tau (left end) to h (right end). So tau <= h.\n- Left-moving: at turn t1: the car spans from h (left end) to tau (right end). So h <= tau? But in the example, for freeway5: h=-60, tau=-25 -> h<tau, so the span is from -60 to -25.\n\nBut note: the problem says for left-moving: [h, tau] and then it moves left. So the entire car moves left.\n\nNow, collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (which is y=k) and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that turn T.\n\nWe are at turn 3, starting at y=2. We must avoid collisions on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway and for each future turn, whether a car on that freeway would have 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nBut note: we only care about the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nWe are to find a sequence of actions (U, D, S) that moves the player from y=2 to y=9 in minimal H, avoiding collisions.\n\nWe can use BFS in the state space: (turn, y) but note that the turn is increasing and the cars move deterministically.\n\nHowever, the state space in time might be large? But we can compute the car positions at any future turn.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute for each freeway and for each turn (starting from turn 3) the safety: whether at that turn, if the player is on that freeway, then there is a car that has 0 in its span.\n\nBut note: a freeway might have multiple cars. We must check all cars on that freeway.\n\nWe are given the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (96,49,right,48)\nFreeway 2: two cars: (-12,-23,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\nFreeway 3: one car: (-39,-50,right,3) -> note: for right-moving, the initial span is [tau, h] = [-50, -39]? \nBut wait: the representation is (head, tail). For right-moving, head is the front (larger) and tail is the back (smaller). So the car spans from tail to head: [tail, head]. So for freeway3: tail=-50, head=-39 -> so the car is from -50 to -39? Then at turn 3, the car is at [-50, -39]. Then at turn T, it is [-50 + 3*(T-3), -39 + 3*(T-3)].\n\nSimilarly, freeway4: same as freeway3? (-39,-50,right,3) -> same as above? But wait: the representation is (head, tail) and for right-moving, we use [tail, head]. So head=-39, tail=-50 -> so [tail, head] = [-50, -39]. So same as freeway3.\n\nFreeway5: (-60,-25,left,36) -> for left-moving: the span is [h, tau] = [-60, -25]. Then at turn T: [-60 -36*(T-3), -25 -36*(T-3)].\n\nFreeway6,7,8: each has (-36,-47,right,4) -> so for right-moving: [tail, head] = [-47, -36]. Then at turn T: [-47 + 4*(T-3), -36 + 4*(T-3)].\n\nNow, we need to check for each freeway k and for each turn T (>=3) whether 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nBut note: if a freeway has multiple cars, we must check each one.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway the times when 0 is in the span of at least one car.\n\nWe define a function for a car: \n  For a right-moving car: span at T: [A + s*(T-3), B + s*(T-3)] where A=tail, B=head (so A<=B).\n  We require 0 in [A + s*(T-3), B + s*(T-3)] \n  => A + s*(T-3) <= 0 <= B + s*(T-3)\n\n  => (0 - B) / s <= T-3 <= (0 - A) / s   [but note: if s>0, then the inequalities are reversed?]\n\nActually: \n  A + s*(T-3) <= 0  => T-3 <= (0 - A) / s   [if s>0, then the inequality direction is same]\n  and 0 <= B + s*(T-3)  => T-3 >= (0 - B) / s\n\nSo: ceil((0-B)/s) <= T-3 <= floor((0-A)/s)\n\nBut note: T-3 must be integer, so we can compute the integer T for which this holds.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: \n  [h - s*(T-3), tau - s*(T-3)] \n  => h - s*(T-3) <= 0 <= tau - s*(T-3)\n  => h <= s*(T-3) and 0 <= tau - s*(T-3) \n  => T-3 >= ceil(h/s) and T-3 <= floor(tau/s)   [because s>0]\n\nBut note: for left-moving, the car moves to the left, so the entire segment is decreasing.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n  h - s*(T-3) <= 0  => T-3 >= ceil(h/s)   [if s>0]\n  and 0 <= tau - s*(T-3) => s*(T-3) <= tau => T-3 <= floor(tau/s)\n\nSo the condition for a left-moving car to have 0 in its span at turn T is:\n  ceil(h/s) <= T-3 <= floor(tau/s)\n\nNow, let's compute for each car:\n\nFreeway1: (96,49,right,48) -> [49,96] at T=3? Actually, at T=3: [49,96]. Then at T: [49+48*(T-3), 96+48*(T-3)]\n\nWe require 0 in [49+48*(T-3), 96+48*(T-3)]\n  49+48*(T-3) <= 0 <= 96+48*(T-3)\n\nThe second inequality: 0<=96+48*(T-3) is always true for T>=3? Because 96+48*(T-3) >= 96>0? So only the first: 49+48*(T-3) <=0\n  => 48*(T-3) <= -49 -> T-3 <= -49/48 ≈ -1.02 -> which is impossible. So this car never has 0 in its span? \n\nBut wait: at T=3: the car is from 49 to 96, which is to the right of 0. As time increases, it moves right, so it will never cover 0. So freeway1 is always safe.\n\nFreeway2: two cars.\n\nCar1: (-12,-23,right,12) -> [tail=-23, head=-12] at T=3? Actually, the representation is (head, tail) and for right-moving: [tail, head] = [-23, -12]. Then at T: [-23+12*(T-3), -12+12*(T-3)]\n\nCondition for 0 in this car: \n  -23+12*(T-3) <= 0 <= -12+12*(T-3)\n\nFirst: -23+12*(T-3) <=0 -> 12*(T-3)<=23 -> T-3 <= 23/12 ≈ 1.916 -> so T-3 <= 1 -> T<=4\nSecond: 0<=-12+12*(T-3) -> 12*(T-3)>=12 -> T-3>=1 -> T>=4\n\nSo T-3=1 -> T=4.\n\nAt T=4: \n  lower = -23+12*1 = -11\n  upper = -12+12*1 = 0\n  So the span is [-11,0]. Then 0 is included? Yes, because the upper bound is 0.\n\nSo at T=4, this car has 0 in its span.\n\nCar2: (36,25,right,12) -> [tail=25, head=36] at T=3? Actually, (head=36, tail=25) so [25,36] at T=3. Then at T: [25+12*(T-3),36+12*(T-3)]\n\nCondition for 0: \n  25+12*(T-3) <=0 and 0<=36+12*(T-3)\n\nThe first: 25+12*(T-3)<=0 -> 12*(T-3)<=-25 -> T-3<= -25/12 ≈ -2.08 -> impossible.\n\nSo only car1 on freeway2 is dangerous at T=4.\n\nTherefore, freeway2 is unsafe at T=4, and safe at other times.\n\nBut note: we are at turn 3, and we are going to consider future turns.\n\nFreeway3: (-39,-50,right,3) -> [tail=-50, head=-39] at T=3. Then at T: [-50+3*(T-3), -39+3*(T-3)]\n\nCondition: \n  -50+3*(T-3) <= 0 <= -39+3*(T-3)\n\nFirst: -50+3*(T-3)<=0 -> 3*(T-3)<=50 -> T-3<=50/3≈16.666 -> T<=19\nSecond: 0<=-39+3*(T-3) -> 3*(T-3)>=39 -> T-3>=13 -> T>=16\n\nSo T-3 in [13,16] -> T in [16,19]\n\nAt T=16: [-50+3*13, -39+3*13] = [-50+39, -39+39] = [-11,0] -> includes 0.\nAt T=17: [-50+42, -39+42] = [-8,3] -> includes 0.\nAt T=18: [-50+45, -39+45] = [-5,6] -> includes 0.\nAt T=19: [-50+48, -39+48] = [-2,9] -> includes 0.\n\nSo freeway3 is unsafe at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nFreeway4: same as freeway3? The car is (-39,-50,right,3) -> same as freeway3. So unsafe at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nFreeway5: (-60,-25,left,36) -> for left-moving: [h=-60, tau=-25] at T=3. Then at T: [-60-36*(T-3), -25-36*(T-3)]\n\nCondition: \n  -60 -36*(T-3) <= 0 <= -25 -36*(T-3)\n\nBut note: the car is moving left, so the entire segment is moving left. The segment at T=3: from -60 to -25, which is to the left of 0. As time increases, it moves further left, so 0 will never be in the segment? \n\nCheck condition:\nFirst: -60 -36*(T-3) <=0 -> always true? because negative numbers.\nSecond: 0 <= -25 -36*(T-3) -> 36*(T-3) <= -25 -> which is impossible for T>=3.\n\nSo freeway5 is always safe.\n\nFreeway6: (-36,-47,right,4) -> [tail=-47, head=-36] at T=3. Then at T: [-47+4*(T-3), -36+4*(T-3)]\n\nCondition:\n  -47+4*(T-3) <=0 <= -36+4*(T-3)\n\nFirst: -47+4*(T-3)<=0 -> 4*(T-3)<=47 -> T-3<=47/4=11.75 -> T<=14\nSecond: 0<=-36+4*(T-3) -> 4*(T-3)>=36 -> T-3>=9 -> T>=12\n\nSo T in [12,14] -> T=12,13,14.\n\nAt T=12: [-47+4*9, -36+4*9] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> includes 0.\nAt T=13: [-47+40, -36+40] = [-7,4] -> includes 0.\nAt T=14: [-47+44, -36+44] = [-3,8] -> includes 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7 and freeway8 are the same? The table says for freeway7 and 8: same car: (-36,-47,right,4). So they are unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nSummary of unsafe freeways by turn:\n\nTurn 4: freeway2 is unsafe.\nTurns 12,13,14: freeways 6,7,8 are unsafe.\nTurns 16,17,18,19: freeways 3,4 are unsafe.\n\nNow, we are at turn 3, at y=2.\n\nWe need to move to y=9. The minimal number of moves? The vertical distance is 7. But we can also move down? But we start at 2 and need to go to 9, so we need to move up. However, we can also move down to avoid a collision? But we are at y=2 at turn 3.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k (for k=1..8) at a turn when that freeway is unsafe.\n\nNote: the freeway we are on at turn T is y_T.\n\nWe are at turn 3: y=2 (so we are on freeway 2? Actually, freeways are for y=1 to 8. The player is at (0,y). So if the player is at y=0 or y=9, then there are no cars? And we are safe. But the goal is to be at (0,9). At the moment we are at (0,2) which is freeway2? Actually, freeway1 is y=1, freeway2 is y=2, etc.\n\nSo at turn 3, we are on freeway2. But at turn 3, is freeway2 unsafe? We computed for T>=3. For freeway2, at T=3: \n  Car1: [-23, -12] -> does not include 0? Because -23 to -12, which is negative. So safe.\n  Car2: [25,36] -> positive, so safe.\n\nBut note: the unsafe time for freeway2 is only T=4. So at turn 4, if we are still on freeway2, we crash.\n\nTherefore, we must not be on freeway2 at turn4.\n\nWe can either move up (to freeway3) or down (to freeway1) or stay (still on freeway2) at turn3. But if we stay, then at turn4 we are on freeway2 and crash. So we must move.\n\nSo at turn3, we cannot stay. We can move up to y=3 (freeway3) or down to y=1 (freeway1).\n\nBut note: we are at turn3: we are at y=2. Then we choose an action at turn3 that will update the position to y_{4} = y_3 + action.\n\nSo at turn3 (current turn), we are at y=2. Then we choose a_{3}. Then at the end of turn3, we update to y_4 = y_3 + delta.\n\nBut note: the collision check at turn3: we are at y=2 at turn3 -> we check freeway2 at turn3: which is safe. Then at turn4, we are at the new y.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn3: we are at y=2 -> safe (freeway2 at turn3: safe)\nThen we choose an action: \n  If we choose S: then at turn4 we are still at y=2 -> freeway2 at turn4: unsafe -> crash -> not allowed.\n  If we choose U: then at turn4 we are at y=3 -> freeway3 at turn4: is freeway3 unsafe at turn4? \n        We computed freeway3 unsafe at T=16,17,18,19 -> so turn4 is safe for freeway3.\n  If we choose D: then at turn4 we are at y=1 -> freeway1 at turn4: we know freeway1 is always safe.\n\nSo both U and D are safe.\n\nBut we want to minimize the number of turns. We need to go to 9. So moving down to 1 would be going away? So probably moving up is better.\n\nBut note: we might have to avoid future collisions.\n\nWe must plan a path from y=2 to y=9 in minimal steps, avoiding:\n\n- At turn4: we cannot be on freeway2.\n- At turns12,13,14: we cannot be on freeways 6,7,8.\n- At turns16,17,18,19: we cannot be on freeways 3,4.\n\nWe start at turn3, y=2.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The minimal number of steps is at least 7 (if we go up 7 times). But we might have to wait sometimes? \n\nWe can use BFS: state (turn, y). The turn starts at 3 and we want to minimize the number of turns.\n\nThe state: (t, y) meaning at the beginning of turn t (just after having moved to y) we are at y. Then at turn t, we choose an action that will update our position for the next turn.\n\nBut note: at the beginning of turn t, we are at y. Then we choose an action a_t, and then at turn t+1 we will be at y + delta, and we must check that at turn t (the current turn) we are safe: that if we are on a freeway (y between 1 and 8) then the freeway at turn t is safe.\n\nAnd then at turn t+1, we will check again.\n\nWe start at turn3: we are at y=2. We must check that at turn3, freeway2 is safe -> which we know it is.\n\nThen we choose an action for turn3.\n\nThe goal: we must be at y=9 at some turn T. And then we stop. But note: we are at (0,9) and there are no cars at y=9, so we are safe.\n\nBut note: the problem says: we must avoid collisions on freeways y=1..8. So at y=0 and y=9, we are safe.\n\nWe are starting at (0,2) and we want to end at (0,9).\n\nWe can model the states: (t, y) for t>=3 and y in {0,1,...,9}. We want to reach (t,9) for some t.\n\nThe actions: U, D, S. But note: if we are at y=0 and choose D, then we stay at 0. Similarly, at y=9 and choose U, we stay at 9.\n\nWe must avoid states (t,y) where if y is between 1 and 8, then the freeway y at turn t is safe (i.e., not unsafe as computed).\n\nWe precomputed the unsafe freeways at specific turns:\n\nFreeway1: always safe.\nFreeway2: unsafe only at turn4.\nFreeway3: unsafe at turns 16,17,18,19.\nFreeway4: unsafe at turns 16,17,18,19.\nFreeway5: always safe.\nFreeway6: unsafe at turns12,13,14.\nFreeway7: unsafe at turns12,13,14.\nFreeway8: unsafe at turns12,13,14.\n\nSo for a state (t,y) to be safe:\n  If y=0 or y=9: safe.\n  Else (y in [1,8]): \n        if y=2 and t=4 -> unsafe.\n        if y=3 and t in {16,17,18,19} -> unsafe.\n        if y=4 and t in {16,17,18,19} -> unsafe.\n        if y=6,7,8 and t in {12,13,14} -> unsafe.\n        else safe.\n\nWe are at (3,2). We want to get to (t,9) for the smallest t.\n\nWe can do BFS (by time and position). We consider the next turn.\n\nWe note that we can move at most 1 per turn.\n\nWe'll simulate:\n\nAt turn3: (3,2) -> safe.\n\nWe have three actions: U, D, S.\n\nBut if we do S: then at turn4 we are at (4,2) -> unsafe -> skip.\n\nIf we do U: then at turn4 we are at (4,3) -> check: y=3 at turn4: safe? because unsafe turns for y=3 are 16,17,18,19 -> so safe.\n\nIf we do D: then at turn4 we are at (4,1) -> safe (freeway1 always safe).\n\nSo from (3,2) we can go to (4,3) or (4,1).\n\nWe then continue.\n\nWe want to minimize the turn number. The minimal turn to reach y=9: at least turn3+7 = turn10.\n\nBut we have unsafe turns at 12,13,14 for freeways 6,7,8 and at 16-19 for freeways 3,4.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeway 6,7,8 at turns 12,13,14 and freeway3,4 at turns16-19.\n\nWe can try to go as fast as possible: from y=2 at turn3, we go up every time.\n\nTurn3: y=2\nTurn4: y=3 (by U)\nTurn5: y=4 (U)\nTurn6: y=5 (U)\nTurn7: y=6 (U) -> but at turn7, we are at y=6: safe? because unsafe for y=6 only at 12,13,14 -> so safe.\nTurn8: y=7 -> safe\nTurn9: y=8 -> safe\nTurn10: y=9 -> goal.\n\nBut wait: at turn10 we are at y=9 -> goal achieved.\n\nCheck the unsafe turns: \n  turn10 is not 12,13,14, so freeways 6,7,8 are safe at turn10? Actually we are not on them at turn10? We are at y=9.\n\nBut let's check the path:\n\nTurn3: at y=2 -> safe (freeway2 at turn3: safe)\nTurn4: at y=3 -> safe (freeway3 at turn4: safe)\nTurn5: at y=4 -> safe (freeway4 at turn5: safe, because unsafe only at 16-19)\nTurn6: at y=5 -> safe (freeway5 always safe)\nTurn7: at y=6 -> safe (turn7 not in {12,13,14})\nTurn8: at y=7 -> safe (turn8 not in {12,13,14})\nTurn9: at y=8 -> safe (turn9 not in {12,13,14})\nTurn10: at y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo we can reach in 7 moves (from turn3 to turn10: 7 actions? Let me count: \n\nAt turn3: we take an action that moves us to the next state at turn4. Then we take an action at turn4 to get to turn5, etc.\n\nWe take actions at turns: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9 -> 7 actions, and at turn10 we are at y=9.\n\nSo the sequence of actions: \n  turn3: U -> to y=3 at turn4\n  turn4: U -> to y=4 at turn5\n  turn5: U -> to y=5 at turn6\n  turn6: U -> to y=6 at turn7\n  turn7: U -> to y=7 at turn8\n  turn8: U -> to y=8 at turn9\n  turn9: U -> to y=9 at turn10\n\nBut note: at turn10, we have reached the goal, so we don't need an action at turn10? The problem says: we need a sequence of actions until we reach (0,9). The last action is at turn9, which moves us to y=9 at turn10.\n\nThe minimal H is 7? Because we take 7 actions and then at the next turn (turn10) we are at y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: we are to output the actions for turns t1, t1+1, ... until the last action at turn t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H we are at (0,9). So H=7.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? The minimal number of moves is 7 (because we need to go from 2 to 9: 7 steps up). So we cannot do it in less than 7 moves.\n\nTherefore, we can do it in 7 moves.\n\nBut wait: what if we go down first? That would take more moves. So the direct up is the fastest.\n\nBut we must check if any of the intermediate states are unsafe? We did: they are safe.\n\nBut let me double-check the unsafe conditions:\n\nAt turn7: we are at y=6 -> freeway6. Is freeway6 unsafe at turn7? Our unsafe turns for freeways 6,7,8 are 12,13,14. Turn7 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn8: y=7 -> freeway7: safe (turn8<12)\nTurn9: y=8 -> freeway8: safe (turn9<12)\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut what about the freeway we are on at each turn:\n\nTurn3: y=2 -> freeway2: safe (only unsafe at turn4)\nTurn4: y=3 -> freeway3: safe (unsafe at 16-19, turn4 is safe)\nTurn5: y=4 -> freeway4: safe\nTurn6: y=5 -> freeway5: safe (always)\nTurn7: y=6 -> freeway6: safe (turn7 not in {12,13,14})\nTurn8: y=7 -> freeway7: safe\nTurn9: y=8 -> freeway8: safe\nTurn10: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo the sequence of actions: all U.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1? Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t=0 corresponds to t1, t=1 to t1+1, etc.\n\nSo for H=7, we have actions at:\n  t1+0 = 3\n  t1+1 = 4\n  ...\n  t1+6 = 9\n\nSo 7 actions.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". Here H=7.\n\nBut the player reaches y=9 at turn10, which is after 7 actions.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n}\n\nBut let me check if we can avoid the unsafe turns by a different path? Actually, the direct path is safe and minimal.\n\nHowever, what if we go down? Then we go to y=1 at turn4. Then we have to go up from 1 to 9: that would be 8 moves? So it would be longer.\n\nBut we don't need to consider because we have a path of 7 moves.\n\nBut wait: is there a possibility that we can wait and then go faster? For example, if we get stuck in a safe freeway for a while? But we don't need to because the direct path is safe.\n\nTherefore, we have the minimal sequence.\n\nBut note: what if we are forced to wait at some point? For example, if we were to be at freeway8 at turn12, we would crash. But in our path, we are at freeway8 at turn9, which is safe.\n\nSo we are good.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) is 7. The sequence of actions is determined by moving upwards (U) at every turn to minimize the number of steps, as the vertical distance from y=2 to y=9 is 7 units. The path avoids collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8 based on the following analysis:\n\n- **Freeway Safety**:\n  - Freeway 1: Always safe (no collision at any turn).\n  - Freeway 2: Unsafe only at turn 4 (collision occurs).\n  - Freeway 3: Unsafe at turns 16, 17, 18, 19.\n  - Freeway 4: Unsafe at turns 16, 17, 18, 19.\n  - Freeway 5: Always safe.\n  - Freeway 6: Unsafe at turns 12, 13, 14.\n  - Freeway 7: Unsafe at turns 12, 13, 14.\n  - Freeway 8: Unsafe at turns 12, 13, 14.\n\n- **Path Validation**:\n  - Turn 3: Start at y=2 (freeway 2). At turn 3, freeway 2 is safe. Action U moves to y=3 at turn 4.\n  - Turn 4: At y=3 (freeway 3). Turn 4 is safe (unsafe only at turns 16-19). Action U moves to y=4 at turn 5.\n  - Turn 5: At y=4 (freeway 4). Turn 5 is safe. Action U moves to y=5 at turn 6.\n  - Turn 6: At y=5 (freeway 5). Always safe. Action U moves to y=6 at turn 7.\n  - Turn 7: At y=6 (freeway 6). Turn 7 is safe (unsafe at turns 12-14). Action U moves to y=7 at turn 8.\n  - Turn 8: At y=7 (freeway 7). Turn 8 is safe. Action U moves to y=8 at turn 9.\n  - Turn 9: At y=8 (freeway 8). Turn 9 is safe. Action U moves to y=9 at turn 10.\n  - Turn 10: Reached y=9 (goal), no car collisions as y=9 has no freeway.\n\nThe sequence of 7 actions (all U) ensures the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 10 without any collisions. No shorter path is possible, as 7 moves are required to cover the vertical distance of 7 units.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 3: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ } U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The current turn is t1=4, and I start at y=3. Actions are U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), or S (stay, y no change). y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T where for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that turn. The note says that if I move to a different freeway, I'm not on that new freeway until the next turn, so I don't collide with cars there at the turn I'm moving.\n\nFirst, I need to model where the cars are at each turn. Since t1=4, I'll consider turns starting from t=4.\n\nThe car positions are given for turn t1=4. For each car, I have head, tail, direction, and speed. Direction tells if it's left or right moving.\n\nLet me list the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head -48, tail -95, direction right, speed 48. Since direction is right, at turn T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]. Head and tail: I think head is the front, so for right-moving, head should be greater than tail? Let me check the update rule.\n\nFor left-moving: span at T is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the input, for freeway 1: head -48, tail -95, direction right. Since it's right-moving, head should be the right end, so head > tail, but here head=-48, tail=-95, so -48 > -95, yes, that makes sense. Similarly for others.\n\nFreeway 1: right-moving, head h=-48, tail τ=-95, speed s=48.\n\nAt turn T, span = [τ + s(T-4), h + s(T-4)] = [-95 + 48(T-4), -48 + 48(T-4)]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: head 0, tail -11, direction right, speed 12.\n\nSince right-moving, head should be greater, 0 > -11, yes.\n\nSecond car: head 48, tail 37, direction right, speed 12. 48 > 37, yes.\n\nFreeway 3: one car: head -36, tail -47, direction right, speed 3. -36 > -47.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? head -36, tail -47, right, speed 3. Identical to freeway 3? But different freeways, so separate.\n\nFreeway 5: head 48, tail 83, direction left, speed 36. Left-moving, so head should be left end? For left-moving, span update: [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)], and head is the front when moving left, so if left-moving, head is smaller? Let's see: head 48, tail 83, 48 < 83, and direction left, so yes, head is left end.\n\nIn general, for left-moving, head is the leftmost point, tail is rightmost? No.\n\nLet's clarify the span notation.\n\nFor left-moving car: \"head at h, tail at τ\" and direction left. Then update: span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, decreasing x, so at time T, the left end is h minus movement, right end is τ minus movement.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)], so τ is left end, h is right end when not moving? I think I need to be consistent.\n\nIn the input, for left-moving, head and tail are given, but head is the front, so for left-moving, front is left, so head is smaller x, tail is larger x.\n\nFor right-moving, front is right, so head is larger x, tail is smaller x.\n\nIn freeway 5: left-moving, head 48, tail 83, so head=48, tail=83, since left-moving, head is left end, tail is right end.\n\nAt T, span = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [48 - 36(T-4), 83 - 36(T-4)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 6: head -32, tail -43, direction right, speed 4. Right-moving, so head=-32, tail=-43, head > tail.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(T-4), h + s(T-4)] = [-43 + 4(T-4), -32 + 4(T-4)]\n\nFreeway 7: same as 6? head -32, tail -43, right, speed 4. Identical to freeway 6? But different freeway.\n\nFreeway 8: same, head -32, tail -43, right, speed 4.\n\nFreeway 3 and 4 are also identical, both head -36, tail -47, right, speed 3.\n\nAnd freeway 6,7,8 all the same car? No, probably separate cars but same parameters.\n\nNow, collision: at turn T, if I am on freeway k, and for some car on freeway k, 0 is in its span at T.\n\nI need to be on y=9, which is not a freeway, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be safe, but I start at y=3, need to go to y=9.\n\ny=0 to 9, freeways y=1 to 8 have cars, y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume.\n\nThe player position is (0,y), and cars are on x-axis, so collision is when x=0 is in the car's span for the freeway I'm on.\n\nNow, I need to move from y=3 to y=9 in min turns.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nSince I need to go up, from 3 to 9, min steps would be 6 up moves, but I might need to stay or move down to avoid collisions, so H might be more than 6.\n\nBut I need min H, so I should try to go up as fast as possible, avoiding collisions.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when a car has 0 in its span.\n\nSince collision depends on the freeway I'm on at turn T, and the car positions at that exact turn.\n\nI need to simulate for each turn what cars are dangerous on each row.\n\nLet me define the time from t=4 onward.\n\nSet τ = T - 4, so τ=0 is turn 4, τ=1 is turn 5, etc.\n\nFor each freeway and each τ, I can find if there is a car where 0 is in the span.\n\nThen, when I am on a freeway y at time τ, I collide if for that y and τ, 0 is in some car's span on that freeway.\n\nNow, for freeway 1: one car, right-moving, h=-48, τ=-95, s=48, direction right.\n\nSpan at time T: since t1=4, let τ = T-4, so at relative time τ, span = [τ_car + s τ, h + s τ] where τ_car is tail, h is head.\n\nIn notation, for right-moving: [tail + s (T-t1), head + s (T-t1)] = [-95 + 48τ, -48 + 48τ]\n\n0 in span if -95 + 48τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 48τ\n\nSo -95 + 48τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 48τ\n\nFirst inequality: -95 + 48τ ≤ 0 => 48τ ≤ 95 => τ ≤ 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so τ ≤ 1 since τ integer? τ is integer turn, so τ ≤ 1\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -48 + 48τ => 48τ ≥ 48 => τ ≥ 1\n\nSo both: τ ≥1 and τ ≤1, so τ=1\n\nThus at τ=1 (turn T=5), 0 is in span.\n\nFor other τ, not.\n\nNow, freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: head=0, tail=-11, direction right, s=12\n\nSpan: [tail + s τ, head + s τ] = [-11 + 12τ, 0 + 12τ] = [-11 + 12τ, 12τ]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 12τ ≤ 0 ≤ 12τ\n\nFirst: -11 + 12τ ≤ 0 => 12τ ≤ 11 => τ ≤ 11/12 ≈ 0.916, so τ ≤ 0? τ integer, τ=0,1,2,... so τ ≤ 0.916 means τ=0\n\nτ=0: -11 +0 = -11 ≤0 ≤0? 0≤0 true, but -11≤0 true, and 0≤0 true.\n\n0 ≤ 12τ is 0≤0 for τ=0.\n\nBut let's see: span at τ=0: [-11, 0], so 0 is included, since ≤ and ≥, I think inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, for τ=0: -11 +0 = -11 ≤0, and 0≤0, so yes.\n\nBut τ=0 is turn t=4.\n\nNow, second inequality: 0 ≤ 12τ, for τ=0, 0≤0, true.\n\nFor τ=1: -11+12=1 ≤0? 1≤0 false, so not.\n\nSo only at τ=0 for first car.\n\nSecond car on freeway 2: head=48, tail=37, direction right, s=12\n\nSpan: [37 + 12τ, 48 + 12τ]\n\n0 in span? 37 +12τ ≤0 ≤48 +12τ? 37+12τ ≤0? 12τ ≤ -37, τ ≤ -37/12 negative, impossible since τ≥0. So never, 0 not in span for this car.\n\nSo for freeway 2, only at τ=0 (turn 4), the first car has 0 in span.\n\nNow freeway 3: one car, head=-36, tail=-47, direction right, s=3\n\nSpan: [tail + s τ, head + s τ] = [-47 + 3τ, -36 + 3τ]\n\n0 in span if -47 +3τ ≤0 ≤ -36 +3τ\n\nFirst: -47 +3τ ≤0 => 3τ ≤47 => τ ≤ 47/3 ≈15.666, so τ≤15\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -36 +3τ => 3τ ≥36 => τ ≥12\n\nSo both: τ ≥12 and τ ≤15, so τ=12,13,14,15\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same as freeway 3, since same parameters, so also at τ=12,13,14,15\n\nFreeway 5: head=48, tail=83, direction left, s=36\n\nFor left-moving, span at τ: [h - s τ, τ - s τ] = [48 - 36τ, 83 - 36τ]\n\nh=48, τ=83? tail is τ, but in notation, it's tail, which is right end for left-moving.\n\nSpan: [head - s τ, tail - s τ] = [48 - 36τ, 83 - 36τ]\n\n0 in span if 48 -36τ ≤0 ≤83 -36τ\n\nFirst: 48 -36τ ≤0 => -36τ ≤ -48 => 36τ ≥48 => τ ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so τ≥2 since integer\n\nSecond: 0 ≤83 -36τ => 36τ ≤83 => τ ≤ 83/36 ≈2.305, so τ≤2\n\nThus τ≥2 and τ≤2, so τ=2\n\nAt τ=2, span: 48-72= -24, 83-72=11, so [-24,11], 0 in it.\n\nNow freeway 6: head=-32, tail=-43, direction right, s=4\n\nSpan: [tail + s τ, head + s τ] = [-43 +4τ, -32 +4τ]\n\n0 in span if -43 +4τ ≤0 ≤ -32 +4τ\n\nFirst: -43 +4τ ≤0 => 4τ ≤43 => τ ≤ 43/4 =10.75, τ≤10\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -32 +4τ => 4τ ≥32 => τ≥8\n\nSo τ≥8 and τ≤10, τ=8,9,10\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same, τ=8,9,10\n\nFreeway 8: same, τ=8,9,10\n\nNow, freeway 1: only at τ=1\n\nFreeway 2: at τ=0 only\n\nFreeway 3 and 4: τ=12 to 15\n\nFreeway 5: τ=2\n\nFreeway 6,7,8: τ=8 to 10\n\nI start at y=3 at τ=0 (turn 4).\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nAt each turn, I choose action U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, 0, but y must be in 0-9.\n\nI need to avoid being on a freeway when for that freeway and time, 0 is in a car's span.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, turn 4, I am at y=3.\n\nNow, freeway 3: y=3, is it dangerous? Freeway 3 has cars, but at τ=0, for freeway 3: we have τ=12 to15 dangerous, τ=0 not, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all other freeways at τ=0: freeway 1: dangerous only τ=1, freeway 2: dangerous at τ=0, but freeway 2 is y=2, I am at y=3, not on y=2.\n\nAt turn τ, I am on freeway y_τ.\n\nAt τ=0, I am on y=3.\n\nFreeway 3: at τ=0, not dangerous, since dangerous only τ=12-15.\n\nSimilarly, no other freeway is dangerous at τ=0 except freeway 2 at τ=0, but I am not on y=2.\n\nSo I am safe at τ=0, y=3.\n\nNow, I can take action at turn 4 (τ=0) to move to next y.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nMin steps: from y=3 to y=9, need +6, so min H=6 if I go up every turn, but I might collide or need to wait.\n\nLet me see the dangerous times for each row.\n\nList for each freeway y and time τ when it is occupied (0 in span).\n\ny=1: freeway 1, dangerous only at τ=1\n\ny=2: freeway 2, dangerous only at τ=0\n\ny=3: freeway 3, dangerous at τ=12,13,14,15\n\nBut freeway 3 and 4 both at y=3? No, each freeway is a separate y.\n\nFreeway k is for row y=k.\n\nSo:\n\ny=1: dangerous at τ=1\n\ny=2: dangerous at τ=0\n\ny=3: dangerous at τ=12,13,14,15\n\ny=4: same as y=3, dangerous at τ=12,13,14,15\n\ny=5: dangerous at τ=2\n\ny=6: dangerous at τ=8,9,10\n\ny=7: dangerous at τ=8,9,10\n\ny=8: dangerous at τ=8,9,10\n\ny=0 and y=9: always safe.\n\nNow, I start at τ=0, y=3.\n\ny=3 is safe at τ=0.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1, so I need at least 6 moves up.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on y when it is dangerous at that time.\n\nAlso, when I move, I am not on the new row until the next turn.\n\nThe note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nAt turn T, I am on y_T.\n\nIf I choose to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, I am still on y_T, and at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}.\n\nFor collision at turn T, only y_T matters.\n\nFor turn T+1, y_{T+1} matters.\n\nThe note says that if at turn T, I move to a different y, I don't collide with cars on the new row at turn T because I'm not there yet.\n\nBut at turn T+1, I am there, so if it's dangerous at T+1, I collide.\n\nThe point is that for the row I'm moving to, I might avoid a collision if the car was there at T but not at T+1, but since I arrive at T+1, I care about T+1.\n\nIn this case, since I care about the time I am on the row.\n\nBack to planning.\n\nI need a sequence of actions from τ=0 to some H-1, ending at y=9.\n\nSet t=0 for τ=0, turn 4.\n\nStart: t=0, y=3, safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9 asap.\n\nPossible to go up directly?\n\nSuppose I go up every turn.\n\nAt t=0: y=3, action U, to y=4 at t=1? Let's see timeline.\n\nAfter action at turn T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nTurn T: I am at y_T, I choose action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nFor collision: at turn T, I am on y_T, and we check if for y_T, at time T, 0 in span.\n\nIn terms of τ: τ = T - 4.\n\nAt relative time τ, I am at y_τ.\n\nDefine y_τ for τ=0,1,2,...\n\nStart: τ=0, y=3\n\nAfter action, at τ=1, y depends on action at τ=0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAt τ=0: y=3, which is safe since y=3 dangerous only at τ=12-15.\n\nI can take action.\n\nIf I go up: a=U, then at τ=1, y=4\n\nNow τ=1: y=4, what is y=4? Freeway 4, dangerous at τ=12-15, not at τ=1, so safe.\n\nThen I can go up again: a=U, at τ=2, y=5\n\ny=5 at τ=2: freeway 5 dangerous at τ=2? Yes, τ=2 is dangerous for y=5.\n\nAt τ=2, on y=5, collision.\n\nBecause freeway 5 has car with 0 in span at τ=2.\n\nSo if I go up directly: at τ=0, U to y=4 at τ=1\n\nτ=1, U to y=5 at τ=2\n\nAt τ=2, y=5, which is dangerous, collide.\n\nSo cannot go directly up at that time.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=5 at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, other constraints.\n\nNow, y=5 is dangerous only at τ=2, so I should not be on y=5 at exactly τ=2.\n\nAt other times, it might be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 dangerous only τ=1, etc.\n\nNow, I start at y=3, τ=0.\n\ny=3 safe at τ=0.\n\nOptions: I can go up, down, or stay.\n\nIf I go up to y=4 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=4.\n\ny=4 dangerous at τ=12-15, not τ=1, so safe.\n\nNow at τ=1, I can choose action.\n\nIf I go up to y=5 at τ=2.\n\nBut y=5 dangerous at τ=2, collide.\n\nSo cannot go up from y=4 at τ=1.\n\nI could go down to y=3 at τ=2.\n\nOr stay at y=4 for τ=2.\n\nOr go down.\n\nFirst, if I stay at τ=1 on y=4: action S, then at τ=2, still y=4.\n\ny=4 at τ=2: safe, since dangerous only τ=12-15.\n\nThen at τ=2, I am on y=4, and I can go to y=5 at τ=3.\n\nNow τ=3, y=5.\n\ny=5 dangerous only at τ=2, not τ=3, so safe.\n\nThen I can go up to y=6 at τ=4.\n\nNow τ=4, y=6.\n\ny=6 dangerous at τ=8,9,10. τ=4 not, so safe.\n\nI can continue up.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=6 safe at τ=4.\n\nGo up to y=7 at τ=5.\n\ny=7 at τ=5: dangerous at τ=8,9,10, τ=5 not, safe.\n\nGo up to y=8 at τ=6.\n\ny=8 at τ=6: dangerous τ=8,9,10, τ=6 not, safe.\n\nGo up to y=9 at τ=7.\n\ny=9 safe, no cars.\n\nSo at τ=7, I reach y=9.\n\nNow, how many turns: from τ=0 to τ=7, that's 7 actions? Let's list the turns.\n\nStart: τ=0, y=3\n\nAction at τ=0: U, to y=4 at τ=1\n\nAt τ=1, y=4, action S (stay), to y=4 at τ=2? Action at τ=1: S, then y_{τ=2} = y_τ=1 +0 =4\n\nThen at τ=2, y=4, action U, to y=5 at τ=3\n\nAt τ=3, y=5, action U, to y=6 at τ=4\n\nAt τ=4, y=6, action U, to y=7 at τ=5\n\nAt τ=5, y=7, action U, to y=8 at τ=6\n\nAt τ=6, y=8, action U, to y=9 at τ=7\n\nAt τ=7, y=9, done.\n\nI reached at τ=7, which is turn T=4+7=11.\n\nBut is this minimal? I used 7 actions: from τ=0 to τ=6 actions? Let's count the actions.\n\nActions taken at turns: turn t1=4 (τ=0), action U\n\nTurn t1+1=5 (τ=1), action S\n\nTurn t1+2=6 (τ=2), action U\n\nTurn t1+3=7 (τ=3), action U\n\nTurn t1+4=8 (τ=4), action U\n\nTurn t1+5=9 (τ=5), action U\n\nTurn t1+6=10 (τ=6), action U\n\nThen at turn t1+6=10 (τ=6), I move to y=9 at next turn, but after action, at time t1+7=11 (τ=7), I am at y=9.\n\nThe position after action is at the next turn.\n\nIn the sequence, after H actions, I am at y=9 at turn t1 + H.\n\nIn this case, actions at t=4 to t=10, that's 7 actions, H=7, and at turn t=11, y=9.\n\nBut I need to be at (0,9) at some turn, and the turn when I first reach y=9 is when I arrive there.\n\nIn the action sequence, after last action, I am at y=9.\n\nHere, after action at t=10, I go to y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut the turn when I am at y=9 is t=11.\n\nThe minimal H should be the number of actions to reach.\n\nI could do with fewer.\n\nFor example, instead of staying at τ=1, I could do something else.\n\nAt τ=0, y=3, I could stay instead of going up.\n\nBut that might delay.\n\nI could go down to y=2.\n\nBut y=2 is dangerous at τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, if I go down to y=2 at τ=1? At τ=0, I am at y=3, I choose action.\n\nIf I choose D, down, then at τ=1, y=2.\n\ny=2 at τ=1: freeway 2 dangerous only at τ=0, not τ=1, so safe? Freeway 2 dangerous at τ=0, which is turn 4.\n\nAt τ=1, y=2, not dangerous, since only τ=0.\n\nThen at τ=1, I can go up to y=3 at τ=2.\n\ny=3 at τ=2: dangerous at τ=12-15, not now, safe.\n\nThen go up to y=4 at τ=3.\n\ny=4 at τ=3 safe.\n\nThen to y=5 at τ=4.\n\ny=5 at τ=4: dangerous only τ=2, not τ=4, safe.\n\nThen to y=6 at τ=5.\n\ny=6 at τ=5: dangerous τ=8-10, τ=5 not, safe.\n\nTo y=7 at τ=6.\n\ny=7 at τ=6 safe.\n\nTo y=8 at τ=7.\n\ny=8 at τ=7: dangerous τ=8-10, not τ=7, safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at τ=8.\n\nSo at τ=8, y=9.\n\nBut this took longer: from start, actions: τ=0 D to y=2 at τ=1\n\nτ=1 U to y=3 at τ=2\n\nτ=2 U to y=4 at τ=3\n\nτ=3 U to y=5 at τ=4\n\nτ=4 U to y=6 at τ=5\n\nτ=5 U to y=7 at τ=6\n\nτ=6 U to y=8 at τ=7\n\nτ=7 U to y=9 at τ=8\n\nSo 8 actions, worse than previous 7.\n\nNot better.\n\nBack to first plan: with stay at τ=1.\n\nBut in first plan, I used 7 actions to reach at τ=7.\n\nCan I reach faster?\n\nSuppose at τ=0, I go up to y=4 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, instead of staying, I go down to y=3 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=3, go up to y=4 at τ=3.\n\nThen to y=5 at τ=4, etc.\n\nBut let's see: from y=4 at τ=1, go D to y=3 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=3, go U to y=4 at τ=3.\n\nThen U to y=5 at τ=4.\n\ny=5 at τ=4 safe.\n\nThen to y=6 at τ=5, etc., to y=9 at τ=8, same as before, 8 actions, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nAt τ=0, stay at y=3.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=3, go U to y=4 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=4, go U to y=5 at τ=3? y=5 at τ=3 safe, since dangerous only τ=2.\n\nThen to y=6 at τ=4, etc.\n\nSequence:\n\nτ=0: y=3, action S, so at τ=1, still y=3? Action S, y_{τ+1} = y_τ\n\nAt τ=0, action S, then at τ=1, y=3\n\nThen at τ=1, action U, to y=4 at τ=2\n\nAt τ=2, y=4, action U, to y=5 at τ=3\n\nAt τ=3, y=5, action U, to y=6 at τ=4\n\nAt τ=4, y=6, action U, to y=7 at τ=5\n\nAt τ=5, y=7, action U, to y=8 at τ=6\n\nAt τ=6, y=8, action U, to y=9 at τ=7\n\nSame as first plan, but I stayed at τ=0 instead of going up, but I reached at τ=7 still.\n\nIn first plan, I went up at τ=0 to y=4 at τ=1, then stayed at τ=1 to remain at y=4 for τ=2, then up.\n\nHere I stayed at τ=0, then up at τ=1 to y=4 at τ=2, same as above.\n\nIn this sequence: at τ=0 action S (stay at y=3 for τ=1? No.\n\nAt time τ, I am at y_τ.\n\nAction at τ determines y_{τ+1}.\n\nStart τ=0, y=3\n\nAction at τ=0: if S, then y_{τ=1} =3\n\nIf U, y_{τ=1}=4\n\nIn the sequence where I stay at τ=0:\n\nAction at τ=0: S, so y_{τ=1} =3\n\nThen at τ=1, y=3, action U, so y_{τ=2}=4\n\nThen action at τ=2: U, y_{τ=3}=5\n\nThen U, y_{τ=4}=6\n\nU, y_{τ=5}=7\n\nU, y_{τ=6}=8\n\nU, y_{τ=7}=9\n\nSo at τ=7, y=9, with actions: τ=0 S, τ=1 U, τ=2 U, τ=3 U, τ=4 U, τ=5 U, τ=6 U. That's 7 actions, same as before.\n\nBut in the first sequence, I had: τ=0 U, τ=1 S, τ=2 U, τ=3 U, ..., τ=6 U.\n\nAlso 7 actions.\n\nNow, can I do with 6 actions?\n\nMinimal is 6, if no obstacles.\n\nBut there is obstacle at y=5, τ=2.\n\nIf I can avoid being on y=5 at τ=2.\n\nSuppose I go up faster or slower.\n\nAt τ=0, y=3, go U to y=4 at τ=1\n\nNow at τ=1, y=4, I need to go to y=5, but if I go at τ=1 to y=5 at τ=2, collide.\n\nIf I go at τ=1 to y=5 at τ=3, but from y=4, to go to y=5, I need to take U at some point.\n\nI could stay at y=4 for multiple turns, but that delays.\n\nOr, I could go to y=3 or something.\n\nAnother idea: since y=5 is only dangerous at τ=2, I can be at y=5 at other times.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=5 at τ=1 or τ=3, etc.\n\nBut at τ=1, I am at y=4, if I go U to y=5 at τ=2, which is bad.\n\nIf I could be at y=5 earlier, but at τ=0, I am at y=3, I can only go to y=4 at τ=1, not directly to y=5.\n\nSimilarly, later.\n\nAt τ=0, I go U to y=4 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, instead of staying or down, I could go up but to y=5 at τ=2 is bad, so not.\n\nUnless I go down to y=3 at τ=2.\n\nBut then I need to come back.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=6 directly or something, but I can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nAnother point: the dangerous times for other rows.\n\nFor example, y=6,7,8 dangerous at τ=8,9,10.\n\nIn my plan, I am at y=6 at τ=4, which is before τ=8, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut if I can reach earlier, I might avoid the later dangers, but in this case, since I reach y=9 at τ=7, before τ=8, so y=6,7,8 not dangerous yet.\n\nNow, back to y=5 at τ=2.\n\nI need to not be on y=5 at τ=2.\n\nIn the sequence, if I can arrange to be on y=5 at τ=1 or τ=3.\n\nBut at τ=1, I can be at y=4 or y=3 or y=2, etc., not y=5.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSuppose at τ=0, I go up to y=4 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, I stay at y=4 for τ=2, as I did, then go to y=5 at τ=3.\n\nThat seems necessary to avoid τ=2.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to y=3 at τ=2, but then I go to y=4 at τ=3, y=5 at τ=4, which is later.\n\nFor example: τ=0: U to y=4 τ=1\n\nτ=1: D to y=3 τ=2\n\nτ=2: U to y=4 τ=3\n\nτ=3: U to y=5 τ=4\n\nThen y=5 at τ=4 safe.\n\nThen to y=6 τ=5, y=7 τ=6, y=8 τ=7, y=9 τ=8, which is 8 actions, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nAt τ=0, I stay: S to y=3 τ=1\n\nThen U to y=4 τ=2\n\nThen U to y=5 τ=3, as before.\n\nSame as first.\n\nSo seems 7 is the min so far.\n\nBut let me check if I can reach by τ=6.\n\nSuppose at τ=0, U to y=4 τ=1\n\nThen at τ=1, I need to be not at y=5 at τ=2, so I must not take U to y=5 at τ=1 action.\n\nSo I have to take S or D.\n\nIf S, then at τ=2, y=4, then U to y=5 τ=3.\n\nThen to y=6 τ=4, etc., to y=9 τ=7.\n\nIf at τ=1, I go D to y=3 τ=2, then at τ=2, y=3, U to y=4 τ=3, U to y=5 τ=4, etc., to y=9 τ=8.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo no way to reach before τ=7.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster to higher y, but I have to go through each y.\n\nUnless I stay or something.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=2 or y=1, but might be dangerous.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, I am at y=3, I can go down to y=2 at τ=1.\n\nBut y=2 at τ=1: is it dangerous? Freeway 2 dangerous only at τ=0, so at τ=1, safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, I can go down to y=1 at τ=2.\n\ny=1 at τ=2: freeway 1 dangerous at τ=1, not τ=2, so safe? τ=1 dangerous, τ=2 not.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=1, I can go up to y=2 at τ=3.\n\ny=2 at τ=3: safe.\n\nThen to y=3 τ=4, y=4 τ=5, y=5 τ=6, etc.\n\nBut this is slower: y=5 at τ=6, then to y=6 τ=7, y=7 τ=8, but at τ=8, y=7, but y=6,7,8 dangerous at τ=8,9,10.\n\nAt τ=8, if I am on y=7, which is freeway 7, dangerous at τ=8, so collide if on y=7 at τ=8.\n\nIn this sequence: let's list.\n\nτ=0: start y=3, action D, to y=2 at τ=1\n\nτ=1: y=2, action D, to y=1 at τ=2? Or U?\n\nIf I go to y=1.\n\nτ=1: action D, to y=1 at τ=2\n\nAt τ=2, y=1, action U, to y=2 at τ=3\n\nτ=3: y=2, action U, to y=3 at τ=4\n\nτ=4: y=3, action U, to y=4 at τ=5\n\nτ=5: y=4, action U, to y=5 at τ=6\n\nτ=6: y=5, action U, to y=6 at τ=7\n\nNow at τ=7, y=6.\n\ny=6 dangerous at τ=8,9,10, τ=7 not, safe.\n\nThen action U to y=7 at τ=8\n\nBut at τ=8, y=7, which is dangerous because freeway 7 dangerous at τ=8.\n\nCollide.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nFrom y=6 at τ=7, I could stay: action S, to y=6 at τ=8, but y=6 at τ=8 dangerous, collide.\n\nOr go down to y=5 at τ=8, but y=5 at τ=8 safe, but then I am going down, not up.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nSo better to avoid going to low y.\n\nThus, my first plan seems best: delay one turn at y=4 to skip the dangerous time for y=5.\n\nIn the sequence, by staying at y=4 for τ=2, I avoid being on y=5 at τ=2.\n\nNow, about y=6,7,8: in my sequence, I am at y=6 τ=4, y=7 τ=5, y=8 τ=6, all before τ=8, so safe, since dangerous starts τ=8.\n\nThen I go to y=9 at τ=7.\n\nτ=6 to y=8, then U to y=9 at τ=7.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, the actions: for turn t1=4, which is τ=0.\n\nAction at turn 4: U (to y=4 at turn 5)\n\nTurn 5 (τ=1): S (stay, so at turn 6, y=4)\n\nTurn 6 (τ=2): U (to y=5 at turn 7)\n\nTurn 7 (τ=3): U (to y=6 at turn 8)\n\nTurn 8 (τ=4): U (to y=7 at turn 9)\n\nTurn 9 (τ=5): U (to y=8 at turn 10)\n\nTurn 10 (τ=6): U (to y=9 at turn 11)\n\nThen at turn 11, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 4 to turn 10, that's 7 actions: turn 4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nH=7.\n\nBut is there a way with 6 actions?\n\nSuppose I can be at y=5 at τ=1, but I can't, since from y=3 at τ=0, max I can be is y=4 at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=4 at τ=1, I cannot be at y=5 before τ=2.\n\nSo impossible to avoid the conflict without waiting or detour, which costs at least one extra turn.\n\nThus H=7 seems minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm the car positions.\n\nIn the sequence, I need to make sure no collisions at other points.\n\nFor example, at τ=3, y=5: freeway 5 dangerous only at τ=2, not τ=3, so safe.\n\ny=6 at τ=4: dangerous τ=8-10, not τ=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\ny=3 at τ=0 and τ=1 in some sequences, but dangerous only τ=12-15, not now.\n\ny=4 at τ=1 and τ=2, dangerous τ=12-15, not now.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nt1=4.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nThen at turn 11, position (0,9).\n\nBut the sequence is actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and after H actions, at turn t1+H, y=9.\n\nHere H=7, actions at turn 4 to 10.\n\nIn the answer format: for each turn, the action.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1.\n\nt=0: turn t1 +0 =4, action a_{t1}\n\nt=1: turn t1+1=5, action a_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nt=6: turn t1+6=10, action a_{t1+6}\n\nThen after, at turn 11, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, actions: a4=U, a5=S, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me write the turn numbers.\n\nIn the freeway, for y=2, it was dangerous at τ=0, but I never was on y=2 at that time, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 dangerous at τ=1, I was not on it.\n\nIn my sequence, I didn't go to low y.\n\nAnother thing: the car on freeway 2 at τ=0, with head at 0, tail -11, so at τ=0, span [-11,0], so x=0 is included, so if I were on y=2 at turn 4, I would collide, but I was at y=3.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps I can go up immediately but to a different path.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, go up to y=4 τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, go up to y=5 τ=2, but collide, so impossible.\n\nUnless... but no.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at y=3 longer, but that delays going up.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=3 for τ=1, then go to y=4 at τ=2, y=5 at τ=3, same as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nSo I think 7 is minimal.\n\nNow, about the cars on multiple freeways with same times, but since I avoid the dangerous times, fine.\n\nIn the sequence, when I am on y=4 at τ=1 and τ=2, freeway 4 has cars, but not dangerous at those times.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 7, meaning the player reaches (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H = 4 + 7 = 11\\).\n\nThe sequence avoids collisions by ensuring the player is not on a freeway \\(y\\) at a turn \\(T\\) where a car on that freeway has position 0 within its span. Key dangerous times and freeways are:\n- Freeway \\(y=2\\) is dangerous only at \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn 4).\n- Freeway \\(y=5\\) is dangerous only at \\(\\tau = 2\\) (turn 6).\n- Freeways \\(y=6, 7, 8\\) are dangerous at \\(\\tau = 8, 9, 10\\) (turns 12, 13, 14), but the player reaches \\(y=9\\) before these times.\n\nThe sequence:\n- At turn 4 (\\(\\tau = 0\\)), the player is at \\(y=3\\), which is safe. Moving up to \\(y=4\\) avoids \\(y=2\\) at the dangerous \\(\\tau=0\\).\n- At turn 5 (\\(\\tau = 1\\)), staying at \\(y=4\\) is safe, and this delays reaching \\(y=5\\) until after the dangerous \\(\\tau=2\\).\n- From turn 6 (\\(\\tau = 2\\)) onward, moving up each turn reaches \\(y=9\\) at turn 11 (\\(\\tau = 7\\)), avoiding all dangerous freeway-times.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: S \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 5, and the player is at (0,4). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nImportant note: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) and at that exact turn T, the car on that freeway has its span covering 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nAlso note: When the player moves from freeway y to y' (by moving up or down) at turn T, then at turn T the player is still on the original freeway y. Only at the next turn (T+1) will the player be on the new freeway y'. Therefore, when moving at turn T, the player only checks the car on the current freeway (the one they are leaving) at turn T and the next freeway (the one they are entering) at turn T+1? Actually, the collision rule says: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, then we check if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nSo when moving:\n- At turn T, the player is at y_T. They choose an action (U, D, S). Then:\n  - If action S: next position is same freeway y_{T+1} = y_T.\n  - If action U: next position is y_T+1 (if possible) -> so at turn T+1, the player is on y_T+1.\n  - If action D: next position is y_T-1 (if possible) -> so at turn T+1, the player is on y_T-1.\n\nTherefore, at turn T, the player is only present on one freeway: the one they started at at the beginning of the turn. So when moving up from freeway 4 to 5 at turn T, at turn T the player is still on freeway 4, and then at turn T+1 they are on freeway 5.\n\nThus, the collision condition is only checked for the freeway that the player is currently on at that turn.\n\nSo the plan:\nWe need to go from y=4 at turn 5 to y=9 at some turn. The minimal vertical steps: we need to go up 5 steps. But we cannot go up arbitrarily because of the cars.\n\nWe are allowed to stay (S), which might be necessary to wait for a car to pass.\n\nThe cars are moving continuously. We are given the state at turn t1=5.\n\nFor each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, we are given (head, tail, direction, speed) at turn 5.\n\nNote: The representation of the car:\n- For right-moving: the head is the rightmost part? Actually, the span is given as (head, tail). For right-moving: the car moves to the right. So at turn T, the span is [tau, h] (if right) and then at turn T>t1, the span becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\nBut wait, the initial state for a right-moving car is given as (h, tau, right, s). However, the update rule says for right-moving: \n  initial span at t1: [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the table, for freeway 2: we have two cars: (12,1,right,12) and (60,49,right,12). \nFor the first car: at turn 5, the span is [1,12] (since right: tail=1, head=12). Then at a future turn T, it becomes [1+12*(T-5), 12+12*(T-5)].\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car: the update rule says: initial span at t1: [h, tau] (so head is h, tail is tau) and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\nFor freeway 5: (12,47,left,36) -> so at turn 5, the span is [12,47] (but wait, the update says for left: initial span is [h, tau] and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. However, note that the representation in the table is (head, tail, ...). So for left, the head is the leftmost? Actually, the update rule says for left: the initial span is [h, tau] meaning from h to tau? But then if h=12 and tau=47, that would be from 12 to 47? But then when moving left, the car would move to the left? That doesn't make sense because 12 to 47 is a segment that would move to the left? Actually, moving left means the entire car moves left.\n\nBut note: the update rule for left says: [h, tau] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. So if h=12 and tau=47, then at turn 5 the car covers [12,47]. Then at turn T, it covers [12-36*(T-5), 47-36*(T-5)]. So at T=5: [12,47]; at T=6: [12-36, 47-36] = [-24,11]; at T=7: [-60,-25]; and so on.\n\nNow, the collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (which is the player's y-coordinate at that turn) and if for any car on that freeway, 0 is in the span [a, b] (for a<=b) of that car at turn T.\n\nBut note: for a right-moving car, the span is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] and since tau <= h, the span is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] and we require 0 to be in that interval.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: the span is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] and note that h <= tau? Actually, in the update rule for left, the initial span is [h, tau] and then it moves. But in the example for freeway 5, we have (12,47,left,36). Here h=12, tau=47, so the initial span is [12,47]. Then as the car moves left, the entire segment moves left.\n\nSo we have to check for each freeway we are on at turn T, and for each car on that freeway at turn T, whether 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nWe start at turn 5 at y=4. We cannot go to freeway 0 (because the grid is from y=0 to 9, and y=0 is the bottom, but note the freeways with cars are y=1..8). Also, the goal is (0,9) which is at y=9 (which is not a freeway with cars? Actually, freeways are from 1 to 8. So y=0 and y=9 are safe? But the player can be at y=0 or y=9 without worrying about cars? However, the problem says: avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8. So when the player is at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars to collide with. But note: when moving, we are only at a freeway during the turn if we are on y=1..8.\n\nOur path: we start at y=4 (freeway 4) at turn 5. We want to get to y=9. We can only move one step per turn (or stay). So we must go through y=5,6,7,8 to get to 9. But we can also go down? But that would be inefficient. So ideally we want to go up every turn. But we have to avoid the cars.\n\nWe need to simulate the cars on each freeway we plan to traverse.\n\nLet me note the freeways we care about: we are starting at y=4, then we will go to y=5,6,7,8, and then to 9. So we care about freeways 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut note: at each step, we are at a freeway at a specific turn. We must not be at a freeway when a car on that freeway has 0 in its span.\n\nWe are going to simulate from turn 5 onward.\n\nFirst, let's compute the car spans for each freeway at each turn we might be present.\n\nWe are at turn 5. We want to know for freeways 4,5,6,7,8 at turns starting from 5 until we reach 9.\n\nBut note: we are going to move one step at a time. We can also stay, so we might be on the same freeway for multiple turns.\n\nWe need to avoid:\n\n- On freeway 4: at turn 5, and possibly later if we stay.\n- On freeway 5: when we are on it (which will be at turn T if we move up at turn T-1 from 4 to 5, so we arrive at turn T at y=5) or if we stay on 5 at subsequent turns.\n- Similarly for 6,7,8.\n\nWe start at turn 5 at y=4. We must check freeway 4 at turn 5.\n\nFreeway 4: \n  Car: (-33, -44, right, 3) -> but wait, the table says for freeway 4: (-33,-44,right,3). \n  This is a right-moving car? The update rule for right: initial span at turn 5: [tau, h] -> so tau should be the left end and h the right? But the table gives (h, tau) = (-33, -44). So which is head and which is tail? The update rule says for right: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)]\" ??? Wait, no, I think there's a confusion.\n\nLooking back at the problem:\n\nFor left-moving: \n  Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)]\nFor right-moving:\n  Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nBut the table gives for each car: (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nSo for a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost? Then the tail is the leftmost? Then the initial span for right is [tail, head]. Similarly, for left-moving, the head is the leftmost? Then the initial span for left is [head, tail] (with head <= tail?).\n\nBut in the example for freeway 2: (12,1,right,12) -> here head=12, tail=1. Then for a right-moving car, the initial span is [tail, head] = [1,12]. Then at turn T, [1+12*(T-5), 12+12*(T-5)].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5: (12,47,left,36) -> head=12, tail=47. For left, the initial span is [head, tail] = [12,47]. Then at turn T, [12-36*(T-5), 47-36*(T-5)].\n\nNow, for freeway 4: (-33,-44,right,3). This is right-moving. So initial span at turn5: [tail, head] = [-44, -33]? Because tail is the left end? But the table says (head, tail) = (-33,-44). So if it's right-moving, then head is the rightmost? So tail is -44 (left) and head is -33 (right). So the span is [-44, -33]. Then at turn T: [-44+3*(T-5), -33+3*(T-5)].\n\nBut note: the car is at freeway 4. We are at (0,4) at turn5. We must check if 0 is in the car's span at turn5? The span at turn5 is [-44, -33] -> 0 is not in that interval. So safe.\n\nBut what about future turns? We might be staying on freeway4 for a few turns? So we need to check when the car will cover 0.\n\nSet: -44 + 3*(T-5) <= 0 <= -33 + 3*(T-5)\n\nBut note: the interval is [-44+3*(T-5), -33+3*(T-5)]. Since -44+3*(T-5) is the left end and -33+3*(T-5) is the right end.\n\nWe can solve:\n\nFirst inequality: -44 + 3*(T-5) <= 0  => 3*(T-5) <= 44 => T-5 <= 44/3 ≈ 14.666 => T <= 19.666 -> so T<=19\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -33 + 3*(T-5) => 33 <= 3*(T-5) => T-5 >= 11 => T>=16.\n\nSo the car covers 0 at turns T=16,17,18,19.\n\nTherefore, we must not be on freeway4 at turns 16,17,18,19.\n\nNow, freeway5: \n  There is one car: (12,47,left,36). Initial span at turn5: [12,47]. Then at turn T: [12-36*(T-5), 47-36*(T-5)].\n\nWe want to know when 0 is in this interval.\n\nSo: 12-36*(T-5) <= 0 <= 47-36*(T-5)\n\nFirst: 12-36*(T-5) <= 0 -> 12 <= 36*(T-5) -> T-5 >= 12/36 = 1/3 -> T>=6 (since T is integer, T>=6)\n\nSecond: 0 <= 47-36*(T-5) -> 36*(T-5) <= 47 -> T-5 <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305 -> T<=6.305 -> T<=6.\n\nSo only at T=6: \n  At T=6: [12-36*1, 47-36*1] = [-24, 11]. \n  Then 0 is in [-24,11] -> yes.\n\nAt T=5: [12,47] -> 0 not in [12,47] -> safe.\nAt T=6: [-24,11] -> 0 is in there -> collision if we are on freeway5 at turn6.\nAt T=7: [12-72, 47-72] = [-60,-25] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo only at turn6, freeway5 is unsafe.\n\nTherefore, we must not be on freeway5 at turn6.\n\nNow, freeway6: \n  Car: (-28,-39,right,4). \n  Right-moving: so initial span at turn5: [tail, head] = [-39, -28]. \n  Then at turn T: [-39+4*(T-5), -28+4*(T-5)].\n\nWhen is 0 in the interval?\n\n-39+4*(T-5) <= 0 <= -28+4*(T-5)\n\nFirst: -39+4*(T-5) <=0 -> 4*(T-5)<=39 -> T-5<=39/4=9.75 -> T<=14.75 -> T<=14\n\nSecond: 0<= -28+4*(T-5) -> 28<=4*(T-5) -> T-5>=7 -> T>=12.\n\nSo T=12,13,14.\n\nThus, unsafe at turns 12,13,14.\n\nFreeway7: same as freeway6? \n  The table says: freeway7: (-28,-39,right,4) -> same as freeway6.\n\nSo unsafe at turns 12,13,14.\n\nFreeway8: same: (-28,-39,right,4) -> unsafe at turns 12,13,14.\n\nNow, freeway1,2,3: we don't plan to go there, but note: we are starting at 4 and going up. So we only care about 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nWe also note that freeway2 has two cars. But we are not going to freeway2? Actually, we are going from 4 to 5,6,7,8,9. So we skip freeway1,2,3.\n\nBut wait, we are at 4, then 5, then 6, then 7, then 8, then 9. So we don't go to freeways 1,2,3.\n\nSo we have:\n\nFreeway4: unsafe at turns 16,17,18,19.\nFreeway5: unsafe at turn6.\nFreeway6: unsafe at turns 12,13,14.\nFreeway7: unsafe at turns 12,13,14.\nFreeway8: unsafe at turns 12,13,14.\n\nWe start at turn5 at y=4.\n\nGoal: reach y=9 in minimal turns. We have to go up 5 steps (from 4 to 5, then to 6, then to 7, then to 8, then to 9). So at minimum we need 5 turns: \n  Turn5: at y4, then we do U -> turn6: at y5; U-> turn7: at y6; U-> turn8: at y7; U-> turn9: at y8; U-> turn10: at y9.\n\nBut we must avoid collisions:\n\n- At turn5: we are at y4 -> safe (as we saw).\n- At turn6: we are at y5 -> but freeway5 is unsafe at turn6 -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot do that.\n\nWe need to avoid being on freeway5 at turn6.\n\nOptions:\n1. Delay the move from 4 to 5 until after turn6? But then we can move at turn7 to 5? But note we are still on 4 at turn6 and 7? Then we must avoid freeway4 at turn6? But freeway4 is safe at turn6? Because the unsafe turns for 4 are 16-19. So at turn6, freeway4 is safe.\n\nBut then we move from 4 to 5 at turn7: \n  Turn5: at4 -> safe.\n  Turn6: we are still at4? Then we must check freeway4 at turn6: safe (since unsafe only at 16-19).\n  Then at turn7: we move to5 -> so at turn7 we are at5.\n\nBut we must check freeway5 at turn7: \n  For freeway5: we computed that at turn7, the car is at [-60,-25] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nThen we can proceed? \n\nBut note: we are now at turn7 at y5. Then we need to go to y6 at turn8: \n  Turn8: at y6 -> but freeway6 is unsafe at turns12,13,14? turn8 is before 12 -> safe? \n\nBut let's check freeway6 at turn8: \n  The car on freeway6: initial span at turn5: [-39,-28] for the right-moving car? \n  Then at turn8: T=8 -> T-5=3 -> [-39+4*3, -28+4*3] = [-39+12, -28+12] = [-27, -16] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nThen at turn9: we move to y7 -> freeway7 at turn9: \n  freeway7: same car? [-39+4*(9-5), -28+4*(9-5)] = [-39+16, -28+16] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn10: move to y8 -> freeway8 at turn10: \n  freeway8: same: [-39+4*(10-5), -28+20] = [-39+20, -28+20] = [-19,-8] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn11: move to y9 -> done at turn11.\n\nSo that would be 6 moves: from turn5 to turn10 (6 actions: turns5 to10) and then at turn11 we are at y9? \n\nBut wait: the moves:\n\nTurn5: we start at y4. We don't move? Then we stay at y4? Or we can do an action to stay? Or we can do nothing? Actually, we have to choose an action at every turn until we reach.\n\nLet me write the sequence:\n\nTurn5: at y4. We do S (stay) -> then at turn6: still at y4? Then we are safe (freeway4 safe at turn6).\n\nTurn6: at y4. We do U -> then at turn7: at y5 -> safe (freeway5 at turn7: safe).\n\nTurn7: at y5. We do U -> then at turn8: at y6 -> safe (freeway6 at turn8: safe).\n\nTurn8: at y6. We do U -> then at turn9: at y7 -> safe.\n\nTurn9: at y7. We do U -> then at turn10: at y8 -> safe.\n\nTurn10: at y8. We do U -> then at turn11: at y9 -> goal.\n\nSo H=6 turns? But the minimal number of steps? We moved up 5 times and stayed once? So 6 turns.\n\nBut can we do better? We must avoid freeway5 at turn6. If we try to move up at turn5, we get to y5 at turn6 -> collision. So we cannot. Therefore, we must wait at least one turn.\n\nBut note: we could also move down? But that would be inefficient. So staying one turn at y4 is the minimal delay.\n\nBut is there a way to avoid the collision at freeway5 at turn6 without waiting? For example, if we move up at turn5 and then at turn6 we are at y5 and that is unsafe. But we cannot jump over. So we have to wait.\n\nAlternatively, we could go down to y3? But that would require more steps. So not minimal.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6.\n\nBut we have to check the entire path for other collisions.\n\nWe already checked:\n\n- Turn5: y4 -> safe (car at freeway4: [-44,-33] at turn5 -> safe).\n- Turn6: y4 -> safe (freeway4 at turn6: [-44+3, -33+3] = [-41,-30] -> safe).\n- Turn7: y5 -> freeway5: [12-36*(7-5), 47-36*2] = [12-72, 47-72] = [-60,-25] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n- Turn8: y6 -> freeway6: [-39+4*(8-5), -28+12] = [-39+12, -28+12] = [-27,-16] -> safe.\n- Turn9: y7 -> freeway7: same as freeway6? Actually, freeway7 has the same car? The table says freeway7: (-28,-39,right,4) -> so same as freeway6: at turn9: T-5=4 -> [-39+16, -28+16]=[-23,-12] -> safe.\n- Turn10: y8 -> freeway8: same: at turn10: T-5=5 -> [-39+20, -28+20]=[-19,-8] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn11: we are at y9 -> no car to check.\n\nBut wait, at turn10 we are at y8, and then we do U at turn10 to go to y9 at turn11. So at turn10 we are on freeway8 and safe. Then at turn11 we are at y9 and the game ends? The goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. We started at turn5 (t1=5). We did actions at turns 5,6,7,8,9,10 (6 actions) and then at the end of turn10 we are at y9? \n\nActually, the update: \n  At turn5: we start at (0,4). \n  Then we choose an action at turn5. \n  Then at the beginning of turn6, we are at the new position.\n\nSo the position at the beginning of turn t is the result of the action at turn t-1.\n\nBut the problem says: \n  We are given the state at turn t1=5: player at (0,4). \n  We need to choose actions for turns t1, t1+1, ... until we reach (0,9) at some turn.\n\nThe goal is to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nWe have:\n\n  t1 = 5: we are at y4.\n\n  We choose actions: \n    a5: S -> then at the beginning of turn6: y6 = y5 + 0 = 4 -> still at4.\n    a6: U -> at turn7: y7 = 4+1=5.\n    a7: U -> at turn8: y8=5+1=6.\n    a8: U -> at turn9: y9=7.\n    a9: U -> at turn10: y10=8.\n    a10: U -> at turn11: y11=9.\n\nSo at turn11, we are at y9. Therefore, we have taken H=6 actions (from turn5 to turn10) and the last action is at turn10, and then at turn11 we are at y9.\n\nThe minimal H is 6.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 5? That would require 5 moves: 5 actions (turn5 to turn9) and then at turn10 we are at y9. But we cannot avoid freeway5 at turn6 if we move up at turn5. Therefore, 5 is impossible.\n\nSo the minimal H is 6.\n\nBut note: we must also avoid other unsafe turns? For freeways 6,7,8 we have unsafe turns at 12,13,14. But our path ends at turn11, so we are safe.\n\nBut what if we take longer? Then we might run into the unsafe turns at freeway4 at 16-19? But we are leaving freeway4 at turn6 (if we do S at turn5 and U at turn6) then at turn7 we are at5. So we are off freeway4 by turn7. So no problem.\n\nTherefore, the sequence:\n\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut wait, we have 6 actions: turns 5,6,7,8,9,10. Then at turn11 we are at 9.\n\nBut the problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. Here t1=5, so:\n\nt=0: a_{5} \nt=1: a_{6}\n...\nt=5: a_{10}\n\nSo 6 actions.\n\nBut is there an alternative? What if we move up at a different time? But we have to avoid freeway5 at turn6. The only way is to not be at freeway5 at turn6. We can either stay at 4 at turn6 (as we did) or move down? But moving down would be worse.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to go up at turn5 to 5 and then immediately at turn6 move to 6? But at turn6 we are at y5? Then we move to y6 at turn7? But at turn6 we are on freeway5 -> collision at turn6.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeway5 at turn6. Therefore, we must not be at freeway5 at the beginning of turn6? Actually, the position at the beginning of turn6 is the result of the action at turn5. If we do U at turn5, then at the beginning of turn6 we are at y5 -> and then we are on freeway5 at turn6 -> collision.\n\nIf we do S at turn5, then at turn6 we are at y4 -> safe. Then at turn6 we do U -> then at turn7 we are at y5 -> safe.\n\nSo we have to do S at turn5.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is:\n\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut wait, after turn10 we are at y9? Actually, after the last action at turn10 (which is U) we are at y9 at the beginning of turn11. So we have reached.\n\nBut the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nWe have H=6 (number of turns in the sequence? Or the number of actions? The sequence has H actions, and we reach after the last action? Actually, the player update happens after the action. So after H actions, we are at the goal.\n\nIn our case, after 6 actions (from turn5 to turn10) we are at turn11 at y9? But the problem says: we are to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nt1+H-1 = 5+H-1 = 4+H.\n\nSet 4+H = the turn at which we are at y9? Actually, the state after the last action is at turn t1+H. \n\nLet me clarify:\n\n- At turn t1 (5): we start at (0,4). We choose action a5. Then the next state is at turn6: y6 = f(y5, a5).\n- Then we choose a6 at turn6: then at turn7: y7 = f(y6, a6).\n- ...\n- After the last action (the H-th action, which is at turn t1+H-1 = 5+H-1), then the state at turn (5+H) is the result of that last action.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H-1}? Or the position at the end?\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nLet me read: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nSo the index of the turn at which we are at y=9 is t1+H-1.\n\nIn our plan:\n\nAfter action a5 (at turn5): we are at turn6: y6=4 (if we did S).\nAfter a6 (at turn6): turn7: y7=5.\nAfter a7: turn8: y8=6.\nAfter a8: turn9: y9=7.\nAfter a9: turn10: y10=8.\nAfter a10 (at turn10): turn11: y11=9.\n\nSo we want y_{t1+H-1} = y_{5+H-1} to be 9.\n\nWe have y11=9 -> so 5+H-1=11 -> 4+H=11 -> H=7.\n\nBut that would mean we have 7 actions? But we only did 6.\n\nAlternatively, if we count the starting turn as turn5, then:\n\nAt turn5: y5=4.\nAt turn6: y6=4 (after S at turn5).\nAt turn7: y7=5 (after U at turn6).\nAt turn8: y8=6 (after U at turn7).\nAt turn9: y9=7 (after U at turn8).\nAt turn10: y10=8 (after U at turn9).\nAt turn11: y11=9 (after U at turn10).\n\nWe want y_{5+H-1}=9. So if we set 5+H-1=11, then H=7. But we only have 6 actions.\n\nBut the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1: that is, a5 to a_{5+H-1}. So if H=6, then we have actions at turns 5,6,7,8,9,10. Then the state after the last action is at turn11: y11=9. But the problem says we want y_{t1+H-1}=9 -> y_{5+6-1}=y10=8, not 9.\n\nSo we have a discrepancy.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning actions taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAnd then the player position after these actions (i.e., at the beginning of turn t1+H) is y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut the goal is to have y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nBut in the update, the position at turn t is the state at the beginning of turn t. Then we apply action a_t to get the state at turn t+1.\n\nSo at turn t1 (5), we are at y5=4. Then we apply a5 to get y6. Then a6 to get y7, ... until we apply a_{t1+H-1} to get y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut we want the position at turn t1+H-1 to be 9? That is, at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\nIn our plan:\n\nAt the beginning of turn5: y5=4.\nAfter a5 (S): at turn6: y6=4.\nAfter a6 (U): at turn7: y7=5.\n...\nAfter a9 (U): at turn10: y10=8.\nAfter a10 (U): at turn11: y11=9.\n\nWe want at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 to be 9. So if we set t1+H-1=11, then H-1=6 -> H=7. Then we want y11=9, which we achieve. But then we need 7 actions? But we only have 6 actions that we did? Actually, we did 6 actions to get to y11=9. If we require 7 actions, then we would have to do an extra action? But we are already at 9.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we are to have reached 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we must have y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nIn our plan, we can have:\n\nWe want y_{5+H-1}=9.\n\nWe have:\n  If we do no action? We start at turn5 at y5=4.\n  After 0 actions: we are at turn5: y5=4 -> not 9.\n  After 1 action: turn6: y6=?\n  ...\n\nWe need to find H such that after H actions (applied at turns 5,6,...,5+H-1) the state at the beginning of turn 5+H is y_{5+H}. But the problem says we want the state at the beginning of turn 5+H-1 to be 9.\n\nThat is, we want to be at 9 at the start of turn 5+H-1.\n\nIn our plan, we are at 9 at the start of turn11. So 5+H-1=11 -> H=7.\n\nBut then we need to have 7 actions? But we only have 6 actions in the sequence? The sequence is for t=0 to H-1: 7 actions? But we only need 6.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd then in the answer format, it says:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1}\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n...\n\nSo the sequence has H actions, starting at t1 and ending at t1+H-1.\n\nAnd then after the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we have the next state at turn t1+H. But the problem says we want to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut in the problem statement: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nBut in the dynamics, at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t, and then we choose an action a_t which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we do not need to take an action at turn t1+H-1? Because the action at turn t1+H-1 would then determine y_{t1+H}, but we don't care about that.\n\nSo the last action we take is at turn t1+H-2? Then the sequence would be from t1 to t1+H-2? But the problem says the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, meaning H actions.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1, then we must have taken an action at turn t1+H-2 that moved us to 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn our plan:\n\nWe are at y=8 at the beginning of turn10. Then we take action U at turn10, and then at turn11 we are at y9.\n\nBut we want to be at y9 at the beginning of turn10? How?\n\nWe would have to be at y9 at the beginning of turn10. That means we must have arrived at y9 by an action taken at turn9.\n\nSo at turn9 we are at y8 (beginning of turn9). Then we do U at turn9, and then at turn10 we are at y9.\n\nSo then we are at y9 at the beginning of turn10.\n\nTherefore, we want y_{10}=9.\n\nSo t1+H-1=10 -> 5+H-1=10 -> H=6.\n\nThen the sequence of actions: from t=0 to 5 (H=6 actions) at turns 5,6,7,8,9,10? But wait, the last action is at turn5+5=10? But we want the action at turn9 to be the last? \n\nIf H=6, then the actions are at turns: 5,6,7,8,9,10. But then the state after the last action (at turn10) is at turn11. But we want to be at 9 at turn10.\n\nSo we must be at 9 at turn10 without an action at turn10? That is, the action at turn9 should put us at 9 at turn10.\n\nTherefore, we need to be at 9 at turn10. \n\nIn our plan:\n\nAt turn5: y5=4.\nAfter a5 (S): at turn6: y6=4.\nAfter a6 (U): at turn7: y7=5.\nAfter a7 (U): at turn8: y8=6.\nAfter a8 (U): at turn9: y9=7.\nAfter a9 (U): at turn10: y10=8.\n\nWe are at 8 at turn10, not 9.\n\nTo be at 9 at turn10, we need to have been at 8 at turn9 and then done U at turn9.\n\nSo we must be at 8 at turn9.\n\nHow?\n\nWe need to be at 8 at turn9: that means we must have been at 7 at turn8 and done U at turn8.\n\nThen:\n\nAt turn5: y5=4.\nAction at turn5: ? \nWe want to be at turn9: y9=8.\n\nThe minimal path: we need to go from 4 to 8 in 4 moves (from turn5 to turn9, but actions at turn5,6,7,8).\n\nBut we must avoid the obstacles.\n\nSpecifically, we must avoid freeway5 at turn6.\n\nSo:\n\nOption:\n\nTurn5: U -> then at turn6: y6=5 -> but freeway5 at turn6 is unsafe -> collision.\n\nTurn5: S -> then at turn6: y6=4.\nTurn6: U -> at turn7: y7=5 -> safe (freeway5 at turn7 is safe).\nTurn7: U -> at turn8: y8=6 -> safe (freeway6 at turn8: safe).\nTurn8: U -> at turn9: y9=7.\nThen at turn9 we do U to get to 8 at turn10? But we want to be at 9 at turn10.\n\nWe need one more up.\n\nBut if we do:\n\nTurn5: S\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\n\nThen:\n  turn5: S -> turn6:4\n  turn6: U -> turn7:5\n  turn7: U -> turn8:6\n  turn8: U -> turn9:7\n  turn9: U -> turn10:8\n\nStill at 8 at turn10.\n\nTo be at 9 at turn10, we must have been at 8 at turn9 and done U at turn9.\n\nSo we must be at 8 at turn9.\n\nWe are at 4 at turn5. To get to 8 by turn9, we need 4 steps up in 4 actions (from turn5 to turn8).\n\nBut we have to avoid freeway5 at turn6.\n\nIf we do:\n\nTurn5: U -> turn6:5 -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot do that.\n\nTurn5: S -> turn6:4\nTurn6: U -> turn7:5\nTurn7: U -> turn8:6\nTurn8: U -> turn9:7 -> then we are at 7 at turn9, not 8.\n\nSo we are one short.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at 8 at turn9.\n\nAlternatively, we could move faster? But we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo it is impossible to be at 9 at turn10? But we can be at 9 at turn11.\n\nThe problem says: we want y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nIf we set H=7, then we want y_{5+7-1}=y11=9.\n\nThen we need 7 actions: turns5 to11? But the sequence is for t=0 to H-1=6, so turns5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nThen after the last action (at turn10), we are at turn11: y11=9.\n\nThat matches.\n\nBut then the minimal H would be 7? But we only need 6 actions to get there.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take actions for H turns, and then after H actions we are at the goal.\n\nIn that case, after 6 actions (at turns5 to10), we are at turn11 at y9. So we have reached after 6 actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence of H actions.\n\nAnd then the condition is y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut in our case, with H=6, we have y_{5+6-1}=y10=8, not 9.\n\nSo we must have y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nTherefore, we must be at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo for our plan to work, we need to be at 9 at turn11, so t1+H-1=11 -> 5+H-1=11 -> H=7.\n\nBut then we need 7 actions? But we only have 6 actions in the sequence that gets us there.\n\nWith H=7, the sequence has 7 actions: turns5 to11? But the last action would be at turn11? But we are already at 9 at turn11? We don't need to act.\n\nLet me re-read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then after that sequence, we are at the goal at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut if we do 7 actions, then the last action is at turn t1+6=11. And then the state at turn12 is determined by that action. But we want to be at 9 at turn11.\n\nSo to be at 9 at turn11, we must not take an action at turn11? Because the action at turn11 would be to move to turn12.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of actions should not include an action at turn11 if we are already at 9 at turn11.\n\nSo the actions should stop at the turn before we reach the goal? That is, the last action is at turn10, which gets us to 9 at turn11.\n\nTherefore, the sequence has actions from turn5 to turn10 (6 actions), and then at turn11 we are at 9.\n\nThen the index of the turn where we are at 9 is 11, and we want y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo 5+H-1=11 -> H=7.\n\nBut then the sequence has H=7 actions? But we only have 6.\n\nThis is not matching.\n\nPerhaps the \"turns H\" refers to the number of actions taken, and then the turn index at which we reach is t1+H.\n\nIn that case, we have H=6 actions, and we reach at turn5+6=11.\n\nAnd then the problem should say we want y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nI think there might be a mistake in the problem statement or in our interpretation.\n\nLet me look at the problem: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nAnd the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo the state y_{t} is at the beginning of turn t.\n\nThe action a_t is taken at turn t, and then y_{t+1} is determined.\n\nTherefore, the state at turn t is y_t, which is the state BEFORE the action a_t.\n\nSo to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, it means that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9, and we have not taken any action at that turn yet.\n\nBut we are to provide a sequence of actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1? That would include an action at turn t1+H-1, which would then change the state.\n\nUnless we do nothing at the last turn? But the actions are in {U,D,S}, and S is stay.\n\nSo if we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, then we can choose to do S at turn t1+H-1 to stay at 9 for turn t1+H, but that is not necessary.\n\nBut the goal is to reach (0,9), and once we are there, we can stop. But the problem requires a sequence of actions until we reach.\n\nPerhaps the sequence includes actions until the turn when we are at 9, and then we stop.\n\nBut the problem says: \" a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} \" and then after these actions, at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\nBut after the actions, the state at turn t1+H-1 is the result of the last action? Let's see:\n\n- At turn t1: we do a_{t1} (action at turn t1) -> then state at turn t1+1 is updated.\n- ...\n- At turn t1+H-2: we do a_{t1+H-2} -> state at turn t1+H-1 is updated.\n- Then we do a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1 -> state at turn t1+H is updated.\n\nSo if we want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9, then we must have been at 9 at turn t1+H-1 before any action, and then we do an action (probably S) to stay at 9 for the next turn.\n\nBut the goal is to reach (0,9), so once we are at 9, we can stop. But the sequence must include the action that made us arrive at 9? Or the action after we are at 9?\n\n This is ambiguous.\n\nGiven the answer format, and to resolve, let me assume that the sequence of actions should bring us to 9 at the state AFTER the last action. That is, after the last action in the sequence, we are at 9.\n\nIn that case, for our plan, after the last action (U at turn10), we are at 9 at turn11. So the turn index for the state is 11, and the last action is at turn10.\n\nThen the sequence has actions from turn5 to turn10 (6 actions), so H=6.\n\nThen the state after the last action is at turn11, which is y_{11}=9.\n\nAnd the problem should say: after the sequence, we are at 9.\n\nBut the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", which with t1=5, H=6, would be y_{10}=8, not 9.\n\nSo it doesn't match.\n\nPerhaps the turns are counted including the starting turn as turn0 for the action sequence? But the problem says turn t1=5.\n\nI think there might be a mistake in the problem statement.\n\n To clarify, let me assume that the minimal H is the number of actions required, and the sequence is for the actions at turns t1 to t1+H-1, and after the last action (at turn t1+H-1), the next state at turn t1+H is 9.\n\nThen we want y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nIn our case, we have y_{11}=9, and t1=5, so 5+H=11 -> H=6.\n\nThen the answer is H=6, and the sequence as above.\n\nAnd this is the common understanding in such problems.\n\nMoreover, the problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars\" during the sequence. In our plan, we avoid collisions.\n\nSo I will go with H=6 and the sequence:\n\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nThen at turn11, we are at 9.\n\nAnd we have collisions only if during the actions we are on a freeway when a car is at 0, which we checked and avoided.\n\nSo final answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). The car positions and movements are given at turn 5, and the player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S) each turn.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player starts at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4) at turn 5.\n- To reach \\(y = 9\\), the player must move up 5 times (from 4 to 5, 5 to 6, 6 to 7, 7 to 8, and 8 to 9), requiring at least 5 actions. However, moving up immediately at turn 5 would place the player at \\(y = 5\\) at turn 6, which is unsafe due to a car on freeway 5 at turn 6 (span \\([-24, 11]\\) contains 0).\n- The player must delay the first move to avoid freeway 5 at turn 6. Staying at \\(y = 4\\) at turn 5 results in \\(y = 4\\) at turn 6, which is safe (freeway 4 car span at turn 6 is \\([-41, -30]\\), not containing 0).\n- Moving up at turn 6 places the player at \\(y = 5\\) at turn 7. The car on freeway 5 at turn 7 has span \\([-60, -25]\\), which does not contain 0, so it is safe.\n- Subsequent moves up at turns 7, 8, 9, and 10 are safe:\n  - Turn 8: \\(y = 6\\), freeway 6 car span \\([-27, -16]\\) (safe).\n  - Turn 9: \\(y = 7\\), freeway 7 car span \\([-23, -12]\\) (safe).\n  - Turn 10: \\(y = 8\\), freeway 8 car span \\([-19, -8]\\) (safe).\n- After moving up at turn 10, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11, which is the goal (no cars on \\(y = 9\\)).\n\nThis plan uses 6 actions (turns 5 to 10) and reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11. The minimal \\(H\\) is 6, as it is impossible to reach in 5 turns without colliding at turn 6.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- Turn 5: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 4\\), avoiding the unsafe freeway 5 at turn 6.\n- Turn 6: Move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 7, safe.\n- Turn 7: Move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 8, safe.\n- Turn 8: Move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9, safe.\n- Turn 9: Move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10, safe.\n- Turn 10: Move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11, achieving the goal.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: S \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,4) at turn t1=6 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, staying within 0 to 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I have its head, tail, direction, and speed at turn t1=6. I need to find where these cars are at future turns to avoid collisions.\n\nCollision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 (the x-position) is within the car's span at that turn. Also, when moving to a new freeway, I'm not on that new freeway until the next turn, so I only care about the freeway I'm currently on for collision.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9. Since we start at y=4, and y=9 is above, I probably need to move up, but I have to avoid the cars on y=1 to y=8.\n\nNow, let's list the car states at t1=6 for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: (head=48, tail=1, direction=right, speed=48). Since direction is right, and head=48, tail=1, but for right-moving cars, the span is [tail, head], I think? Let me check the update rule.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\n- Left-moving: span [h, τ] → [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\n- Right-moving: span [τ, h] → [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (48,1,right,48). It says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, it should be [τ, h] since τ is tail, h is head.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo for freeway 1: at t1=6, car is right-moving, span [τ, h] = [1, 48], speed 48. So at time T, span is [1 + 48*(T-6), 48 + 48*(T-6)]\n\nSince it's moving right, position increases.\n\nSimilarly, other cars.\n\nNow, collision if at turn T, player on freeway y, and for that freeway, 0 is in some car's span at T.\n\nAlso, when player moves, at turn T, after action, y_{T} is set, and collision is checked based on y_T and the cars on that row at time T.\n\nIf player moves to a different y, at turn T, they are on the new y only from the next turn, I think. Let's read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd from the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo at turn T, when you perform action a_T, you move to y_{T+1} based on a_T, but the position y_{T+1} is for time T+1, I think.\n\nThe position is updated as y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nSo at time t, position is y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T for position y_T.\n\nSo when at turn T, you are at position y_T, and collision if for freeway y_T, there is a car with 0 in its span at time T.\n\nIf you move at turn T, you change to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nBut at turn T itself, you are still on y_T.\n\nFor example, if at turn T you are on y, and you move to y' at T+1, at turn T you are on y, so collision check for y at time T.\n\nAt turn T+1, you are on y', collision check for y' at time T+1.\n\nThe note says that if you move to a different freeway at turn T, you are not on that new freeway until turn T+1, so at turn T, you are still on the old one.\n\nThat's consistent.\n\nNow for the cars, I need their positions at future times relative to t1=6.\n\nLet Δt = T - t1 = T - 6.\n\nFor each freeway and each car, I can find the span at time T as a function of Δt.\n\nSince collision depends on whether 0 is in the span at time T for the freeway the player is on.\n\nThe player starts at y=4 at t=6.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I need to increase y by 5, so minimum 5 turns if I move up every turn, but I might have to wait or detour due to cars.\n\ny from 4 to 9, difference 5, so at least 5 up moves, but I can stay or move down, which would increase H, so to minimize H, I should avoid down moves and minimize stay, but sometimes stay might be necessary to avoid collision.\n\nSince the grid is small, y=0 to 9, and cars are moving, I need to simulate the car positions.\n\nLet me list all cars per freeway, since multiple cars per freeway possible, but from the table, some have multiple.\n\nFreeway k:\n\n- k=1: one car: (h=48, τ=1, d=right, s=48)\n\nFor right-moving, span at t1: [τ, h] = [1,48]\n\nAt time T: [τ + s(T-6), h + s(T-6)] = [1 + 48(T-6), 48 + 48(T-6)]\n\nSince s=48, it's moving fast.\n\n- k=2: two cars\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,12) → right-moving, span [τ,h] = [13,24]? Head h=24, tail τ=13? But for right, it should be [tail, head], so [13,24]\n\nAt T: [13 + 12(T-6), 24 + 12(T-6)]\n\nSecond car: (-48,-59,right,12) → right-moving, span [τ,h] = [-59,-48]? Head h=-48, tail τ=-59, so [ -59, -48 ] since right-moving, increasing.\n\nAt T: [ -59 + 12(T-6), -48 + 12(T-6) ]\n\n- k=3: one car: (-30,-41,right,3) → right-moving, span [τ,h] = [-41,-30]\n\nAt T: [ -41 + 3(T-6), -30 + 3(T-6) ]\n\n- k=4: same as k=3? (-30,-41,right,3) identical to k=3? Probably a copy-paste error or same car on different row? But freeway different, so separate.\n\nk=4: (-30,-41,right,3) same as k=3.\n\n- k=5: (-24,11,left,36) → left-moving, so span [h,τ] = [head, tail]? For left-moving, it says span [h, τ] → [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nHere h=-24, τ=11? Head and tail, but for left-moving, since it moves left, position decreases.\n\nAt t1, span [h, τ] = [-24, 11]? But h=-24, τ=11, so from -24 to 11, which is increasing, but left-moving should be decreasing? I think there might be inconsistency in how head and tail are defined.\n\nLet's read the car state table.\n\nIt says: Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nAnd for update:\n\nLeft-moving: span [h, τ] → [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nRight-moving: span [τ, h] → [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nFor left-moving, it uses [h, τ], which might have h and τ in decreasing order or something.\n\nIn k=5: (h=-24, τ=11, d=left, s=36)\n\nSo span at t1: [h, τ] = [-24, 11]? But -24 to 11, with left direction, meaning it will move left, so positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, it uses [τ, h] which is increasing.\n\nIn this case for k=5, [h, τ] = [-24, 11], but since it's left-moving, the head is at left? I think head is the front, so for left-moving, head is smaller x, tail is larger x.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, head is larger x, tail smaller.\n\nBut in the span, for collision, we care about the interval.\n\nFor k=5 left-moving: span at t1: [h, τ] = [-24, 11]\n\nAt time T: [h - s(T-6), τ - s(T-6)] = [-24 - 36(T-6), 11 - 36(T-6)]\n\n- k=6: (-24,-35,right,4) → right-moving, so span [τ,h] = [-35,-24]? Head h=-24, tail τ=-35, so [ -35, -24 ] for right-moving.\n\nAt T: [ -35 + 4(T-6), -24 + 4(T-6) ]\n\n- k=7: same as k=6? (-24,-35,right,4) identical to k=6.\n\n- k=8: same, (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nSo freeways 6,7,8 all have the same car configuration.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, for the freeway y that player is on, 0 is in one of the car spans on that freeway at time T.\n\nPlayer starts at y=4 at t=6.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9 with min H.\n\nSince y=9 is the target, and no cars on y=9? The freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no collision possible there. But y=0 is bottom, y=9 is top, we start from y=4, go to y=9.\n\nAt y=0 or y=9, since no freeway, no cars, so no collision, we can be there safely.\n\nBut the target is (0,9), so once we reach y=9, we are done.\n\nNow, to go from y=4 to y=9, we need to cover rows 5,6,7,8 to get to 9, but we can stay or move through them.\n\nSince we move one step per turn, except stay, to increase y, we need up moves.\n\nMin steps: if we go up every turn, from t=6 to t=11, y=4,5,6,7,8,9 at t=11, so H=5 turns? Let's see the time.\n\nAt turn t=6, position y=4.\n\nAfter action a_6 at t=6, y_7 = y_6 + Δy_6\n\nSimilarly, after a_7, y_8, and so on.\n\nTo reach y=9, say at turn T, y_T =9.\n\nSo from t=6 to T, with y starting at 4, ending at 9.\n\nThe number of turns from t=6 to T is T-6 +1? Let's define.\n\nLet the sequence of actions from t= t1 to t1 + H -1, so H actions, from time t1 to t1 + H -1, positions from y_t1 to y_{t1 + H}\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{t1 + H}\n\nSet y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nAt time t1, we are at y_{t1}, before any action.\n\nAfter action at t1, we move to y_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nSo to have y_{t1 + H} =9, with y_{t1} =4.\n\nThe change in y is +5, so we need at least 5 up moves, and possibly some stay or down, but down would require more up moves, so min H when we have 5 up moves and no down or stay, so H=5, with y increasing each turn: y_6=4, y_7=5, y_8=6, y_9=7, y_10=8, y_11=9. So at turn t=11, y=9.\n\nNow, we need to check for each of these positions at times t=6 to t=10, since at t=11, y=9, no freeway, no collision.\n\nCollision check at each turn T from t=6 to t=10 for the position y_T and freeway y_T.\n\nAt T, we are on y_T, and we check if 0 is in a car span on row y_T at time T.\n\nFor T=6 to 10, y_T from 4 to 8? y_6=4, y_7=5, y_8=6, y_9=7, y_10=8.\n\nThen at t=11, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, for each of these, we need to ensure that at time T, for freeway y_T, 0 not in any car span at T.\n\nFirst, at t=6, y=4. Freeway y=4.\n\nCars on freeway 4: from table, freeway 4 has car: (-30,-41,right,3)\n\nSo at time T, span for this car: since right-moving, span [τ + s(T-6), h + s(T-6)] with τ=-41, h=-30, s=3.\n\nAt T=6, span [ -41 + 3(0), -30 + 3(0) ] = [-41, -30]\n\n0 is not between -41 and -30, since both negative, so 0 not in span, so no collision at t=6 on y=4.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, if we go up to y=5 at t=7.\n\nAt t=7, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nCars on freeway 5: (-24,11,left,36)\n\nLeft-moving, so span at T: [h - s(T-6), τ - s(T-6)] with h=-24, τ=11, s=36.\n\nAt T=7, Δt=1, span [ -24 -36(1), 11 -36(1) ] = [ -24-36, 11-36 ] = [-60, -25]\n\n0 not in [-60,-25], both negative, so safe.\n\nThen at t=8, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nCars on freeway 6: (-24,-35,right,4) but multiple cars? Freeway 6 has one car: head -24, tail -35, direction right, speed 4.\n\nBut in table, it says for k=6: (-24,-35,right,4), similarly k=7 and k=8 same, but different freeways.\n\nFor freeway 6, at T=8, y=6.\n\nCar on y=6: right-moving, span [τ + s(Δt), h + s(Δt)] with τ=-35, h=-24, s=4, Δt=T-6=2.\n\nAt T=8, Δt=2, span [ -35 + 4(2), -24 + 4(2) ] = [ -35 +8, -24 +8 ] = [-27, -16]\n\n0 not in [-27,-16], both negative, safe.\n\nThen at t=9, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nCar on y=7: same as above? Freeway 7 has identical car: (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nAt T=9, Δt=3, span [ -35 + 4(3), -24 + 4(3) ] = [ -35+12, -24+12 ] = [-23, -12]\n\n0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at t=10, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nCar on y=8: (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nAt T=10, Δt=4, span [ -35 + 4(4), -24 + 4(4) ] = [ -35+16, -24+16 ] = [-19, -8]\n\nStill negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at t=11, y=9, safe.\n\nSo in this path, all safe, with 5 up moves, from t=6 to t=10 actions: all U.\n\nActions at t=6,7,8,9,10: all U, then at t=11, position (0,9).\n\nH=5 turns of actions, from t=6 to t=10.\n\ny_{t1 + H} = y_{6+5} = y_{11} =9.\n\nAnd no collisions.\n\nBut is that possible? Let me double-check the cars.\n\nFor freeway 5 at t=7: we had span [-60,-25], but is that correct?\n\nFreeway 5 car: left-moving, h=-24, τ=11, s=36.\n\nAt T=7, Δt=1, [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] = [-24 -36(1), 11 -36(1)] = [-60, -25], yes.\n\n0 not in.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut freeway 1,2,3,4 also have cars, but since we are not on those rows at those times, we don't care.\n\nIn this path, we are only on y=4,5,6,7,8 at t=6 to 10, and we checked each.\n\nAt t=6, y=4; t=7,y=5; t=8,y=6; t=9,y=7; t=10,y=8; t=11,y=9.\n\nAll covered.\n\nBut the cars on other rows might be dangerous if we were there, but we are not.\n\nIn this case, it seems we can go straight up with no problem.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 2, for example, since it has two cars.\n\nBut we never on y=2, so irrelevant.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1 has a fast car, but on y=1, we not there.\n\nSo in this sequence, it should be fine.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we do in 5 turns.\n\nBut is there a reason to take more turns? Probably not, since min is 5.\n\nBut let me see if at some point it might be blocked.\n\nFor example, on freeway 5, at t=7, car is at [-60,-25], far left.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut what about freeway 8 at t=10, span [-19,-8], still left of 0.\n\nNow, but the car on freeway 1, for example, at some time might be near 0, but since we not on y=1, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 has cars.\n\nFreeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,12) at t1, span [13,24] for right? Head=24, tail=13, so [13,24]\n\nAt T, [13 +12(T-6), 24 +12(T-6)]\n\nAt T=6, [13,24]\n\nWhen is 0 in this? 0 < 13, so never, since increasing.\n\nSecond car: (-48,-59,right,12), span at t1: [-59,-48]\n\nAt T: [-59 +12(T-6), -48 +12(T-6)]\n\nAt T=6, [-59,-48]\n\n0 not in, and since increasing, at some point it might cover 0, but let's see when.\n\nSet -59 +12(Δt) <= 0 <= -48 +12(Δt)\n\nSolve: from left: -59 +12Δt <=0 => 12Δt <=59 => Δt <= 59/12 ≈4.916, so for Δt <=4\n\n-48 +12Δt >=0 => 12Δt >=48 => Δt >=4\n\nSo at Δt=4, T=10, span [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0]\n\nAt T=10, span is [-11,0], so 0 is included? -11 to 0, inclusive?\n\nThe span is [a,b], which includes a and b, so if 0 is endpoint, is it included?\n\nThe collision condition: \"0 ∈ Span(T)\", so if 0 is in the span, including endpoints.\n\nAt T=10, for this car, span [-11,0], so 0 is in the span, so if player is on freeway 2 at T=10, collision.\n\nBut in our path, at T=10, we are on y=8, not y=2, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, for other times.\n\nFor example, at T=10, on y=2, if someone is there, collision.\n\nBut we not there.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nFreeway 1: car at T, [1 +48(Δt), 48 +48(Δt)]\n\nSet 1+48Δt <=0 <=48+48Δt\n\nBut 1+48Δt >0 for all Δt>=0, since min at Δt=0 is 1>0, so 0 never in span, always positive.\n\nFreeway 3: car (-30,-41,right,3) span at T: [-41+3Δt, -30+3Δt]\n\nBoth negative until -30+3Δt=0, Δt=10, T=16, etc., but at early times, negative, no 0.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4 same.\n\nFreeway 5: left-moving, span [ -24 -36Δt, 11 -36Δt ]\n\nAt T, [ -24-36Δt, 11-36Δt ]\n\nSince moving left, decreasing.\n\n11-36Δt <=0 for Δt>=1, and -24-36Δt <0 always, so span always negative, 0 not in.\n\nFor example at Δt=0, [-24,11], which includes 0? -24 to 11, -24<0<11, so 0 is in span at t1=6 for freeway 5.\n\nAt t=6, on freeway 5, 0 is in the car span?\n\nFreeway 5 at t1=6: car span [h,τ] = [-24,11], and since left-moving, but at time T=6, span is [-24,11], and -24 <= 0 <=11, yes, 0 is between -24 and 11, so if player is on y=5 at t=6, collision.\n\nBut in our case, at t=6, we are on y=4, not y=5.\n\nIn our path, we go to y=5 at t=7.\n\nAt t=7, for freeway 5, span [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nBut at t=6, on y=5, it would be dangerous, but we not there.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 6,7,8 cars, at t=6, span for y=6: car (-24,-35,right,4), span at t6: [ -35, -24 ] for right-moving? [τ, h] = [-35,-24], so [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nAt later times, as we move right, but slowly, at T=10, for example, on y=6, at T=10, Δt=4, span [-35+16, -24+16] = [-19,-8], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo in the direct up path, it seems safe.\n\nBut let me confirm the freeway 5 at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, freeway 5 has car with span [-24,11], which includes 0, so if we were on y=5 at t=6, collision, but we start at y=4.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=5 at t=7, it is safe as span moved left.\n\nNow, but in our plan, we are going to y=5 at t=7, which is fine.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster, but 5 is minimum.\n\nMaybe we can reach earlier? No, from y=4 to y=9, min 5 steps.\n\nUnless we can jump, but no, only +1 per up.\n\nSo H=5 should be achievable.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nWe need to output actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nHere t1=6, H=5, actions at t=6,7,8,9,10, all U.\n\nThen at t=11, position (0,9).\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from t=6 to t=10.\n\nNow, but I recall that for freeway 2, at T=10, there is a car with span including 0, but on y=2.\n\nSimilarly, perhaps on other rows at other times.\n\nBut since we not there, ok.\n\nTo be thorough, let's see if on our path, any issue.\n\nAnother thing: when we move, at turn T, we are on y_T, and we check collision for that y_T at time T.\n\nIn our case:\n\n- At T=6: y=4, freeway 4 car: [-41,-30] at T=6, 0 not in.\n\n- T=7: y=5, freeway 5 car: at T=7, [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\n- T=8: y=6, freeway 6 car: at T=8, Δt=2, [-35+8, -24+8]=[-27,-16], 0 not in.\n\n- T=9: y=7, freeway 7 car: similar to 6, at T=9, Δt=3, [-35+12, -24+12]=[-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\n- T=10: y=8, freeway 8 car: at T=10, Δt=4, [-35+16, -24+16]=[-19,-8], 0 not in.\n\nAll safe.\n\nPerhaps I should check if we can do it in less, but impossible.\n\nH=5 is minimum.\n\nBut the player can move down or stay, which would increase H, so worse.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 +4: a_{t_1+4} = U\n\nt1=6, so:\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the sequence, t from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, H=5, so t=6 to 10.\n\nNow, but let me make sure about the car on freeway 5 at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, on y=5, it would be dangerous, but we not there.\n\nPerhaps if we stay or something, but no need.\n\nAnother thing: the car on freeway 2 second car at T=10, span includes 0, but we on y=8.\n\nNow, but what about freeway 1? Car moving fast.\n\nAt T=7, for example, on y=1, car span: [1+48(1), 48+48(1)] = [49,96], far right.\n\nAt T=6, [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nNever near 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 and 4, cars at negative positions, moving slowly right.\n\nFreeway 3 car: at T, [-41+3Δt, -30+3Δt]\n\nSet equal to 0: -41+3Δt=0, Δt=41/3≈13.666, T=19.666, etc., not soon.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think the direct path is safe.\n\nBut in the initial state, freeway 2 has two cars, but we not on y=2.\n\nPerhaps the player could be forced to go through other rows, but in this case, no.\n\nSo I think we can output the sequence.\n\nBut the answer should be in a box.\n\nBut let me see if there is any mistake.\n\nAnother point: the freeway y=5 car at t=6 has span including 0, so if we were to go to y=5 at t=6, we cannot, but we go at t=7, when it has moved left.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nSuppose we try to go up immediately.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster by moving down first? No, that would increase time.\n\nFor example, if we move down to y=3, then up, but that would take more turns.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nSo min H=5 with all up.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is five U actions.\n\nSo in the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: a_{6} = U \\\\\nTurn 7: a_{7} = U \\\\\nTurn 8: a_{8} = U \\\\\nTurn 9: a_{9} = U \\\\\nTurn 10: a_{10} = U\n}\n\nIn the box, it should be written as per format.\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nt_1=6.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 6: a_{6} = U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: a_{7} = U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: a_{8} = U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: a_{9} = U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: a_{10} = U\n}\n\nBut in the sequence, it should be up to t_1 + H-1 = 6 + 4 =10? H=5, t from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, so t=6 to 10, that's 5 actions.\n\nYes.\n\nSince H is the number of turns, and actions from t=0 to H-1 relative, but here absolute.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut in the car list, freeway 5 has a car that covers 0 at t=6, but we avoid by going later.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 at t=10 has a car covering 0 on y=2.\n\nBut not on our path.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimum number of turns required is \\(H = 5\\), as the player must increase their \\(y\\)-coordinate by 5, from 4 to 9, which requires at least 5 \"U\" (up) actions with no down or stay actions to minimize \\(H\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n- At turn 6, move up to \\(y = 5\\).\n- At turn 7, move up to \\(y = 6\\).\n- At turn 8, move up to \\(y = 7\\).\n- At turn 9, move up to \\(y = 8\\).\n- At turn 10, move up to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nCollisions are avoided as follows for each turn and position:\n- **Turn 6 (\\(y = 4\\))**: Freeway 4 has a right-moving car with span \\([-41, -30]\\) at \\(T = 6\\). Since \\(0 \\notin [-41, -30]\\), no collision occurs.\n- **Turn 7 (\\(y = 5\\))**: Freeway 5 has a left-moving car with span \\([-60, -25]\\) at \\(T = 7\\). Since \\(0 \\notin [-60, -25]\\), no collision occurs.\n- **Turn 8 (\\(y = 6\\))**: Freeway 6 has a right-moving car with span \\([-27, -16]\\) at \\(T = 8\\). Since \\(0 \\notin [-27, -16]\\), no collision occurs.\n- **Turn 9 (\\(y = 7\\))**: Freeway 7 has a right-moving car with span \\([-23, -12]\\) at \\(T = 9\\). Since \\(0 \\notin [-23, -12]\\), no collision occurs.\n- **Turn 10 (\\(y = 8\\))**: Freeway 8 has a right-moving car with span \\([-19, -8]\\) at \\(T = 10\\). Since \\(0 \\notin [-19, -8]\\), no collision occurs.\n\nAt turn 11, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\), where there are no cars, so the position (0, 9) is safely achieved.\n\nThus, the minimal sequence of actions is all \"U\" moves from turn 6 to turn 10.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 6: a_{6} = U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: a_{7} = U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: a_{8} = U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: a_{9} = U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: a_{10} = U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,5) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1=7, and I start at y=5.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. Cars move left or right at constant speeds, and I need to avoid being on a freeway where a car spans x=0 at the exact turn I'm on that freeway.\n\nThe collision rule says: collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in the span of some car on the freeway y_T at that turn T. Also, when I move to a new freeway, I'm not on that freeway until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, then at turn T, I'm still on y, and at turn T+1, I'm on y+1. So I only check the car on the current freeway at each turn.\n\nI need to plan a sequence of actions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), or S (stay, y same) to go from y=5 to y=9.\n\ny must stay between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9. Since I'm starting at 5 and going to 9, I probably want to go up most of the time, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nNow, let's list the cars on each freeway at turn t1=7.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head 96, tail 49, direction right, speed 48. Since it's right-moving, the span is [tau, h] = [49, 96] at t1=7. Direction right means it's moving to the right, so as time increases, the positions increase.\n\nThe update: for right-moving, span at T is [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left: [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)]\n\nAt t1=7, for freeway 1:\n\nHead h=96, tail tau=49? But for right-moving, it says span(t1) = [tau, h], so [49,96] meaning from x=49 to x=96.\n\nThen at turn T, span(T) = [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [49 + 48(T-7), 96 + 48(T-7)]\n\nCollision if 0 in span(T), so for freeway 1, 0 in [49 + 48(T-7), 96 + 48(T-7)]?\n\nBut 49 to 96 is positive, and speed is positive, so it's moving right, so for T>7, it's even larger, so 0 will never be in this span since min is 49 >0. Similarly, at T=7, min=49>0, so no collision possible on freeway 1 at any time. Good, so freeway 1 is safe.\n\nFreeway 2: two cars? The table says: (36,25,right,12) and (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=36, tail=25, direction right, speed 12. So span at t1=7: [25,36] since right-moving, [tau,h] = [25,36]\n\nThen at T: [25 + 12(T-7), 36 + 12(T-7)]\n\nSecond car: head=-36, tail=-47? Head is -36, tail is -47, direction right, speed 12.\n\nSpan at t1: since right-moving, [tau,h] = [-47,-36]\n\nAt T: [-47 + 12(T-7), -36 + 12(T-7)]\n\nNow, collision if 0 in the span for freeway 2 at turn T.\n\nFor first car: 0 in [25 + 12(T-7), 36 + 12(T-7)]? Since min is 25 +12(T-7) >=25>0 for T>=7, so always positive, never contains 0.\n\nSecond car: 0 in [-47 +12(T-7), -36 +12(T-7)]\n\nSet -47 +12(T-7) <= 0 <= -36 +12(T-7)\n\nSo 12(T-7) <= 47 and 12(T-7) >= 36? Let's solve.\n\nLower bound <=0: -47 +12(T-7) <= 0 => 12(T-7) <=47 => T-7 <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so T <= 10.916, since T integer, T<=10\n\nUpper bound >=0: -36 +12(T-7) >=0 => 12(T-7) >=36 => T-7 >=3 => T>=10\n\nSo for T=10: lower bound -47 +12(3) = -47+36= -11 <=0\n\nUpper bound -36+36=0 >=0, so 0 is included? Upper bound is 0, so yes, 0 in [-11,0] at T=10.\n\nSimilarly, for T<10, upper bound <0? At T=9, T-7=2, lower: -47+24= -23, upper: -36+24= -12 <0, so 0 not in [-23,-12]\n\nT=11: T-7=4, lower: -47+48=1, upper: -36+48=12, both >0, 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo only at T=10, 0 in [-11,0] for second car on freeway 2.\n\nBut for freeway 2, at T=10, the second car spans [-11,0], so 0 is included, so if I'm on freeway 2 at turn 10, I collide.\n\nOtherwise, no collision on freeway 2 except at T=10.\n\nT=10 is the only turn where 0 is in the span for freeway 2.\n\nNow freeway 3: one car: (-27,-38,right,3)\n\nHead=-27, tail=-38, direction right, speed 3.\n\nRight-moving, span at t1=7: [tau,h] = [-38,-27]\n\nAt T: [-38 + 3(T-7), -27 + 3(T-7)]\n\nCollision if 0 in this interval.\n\n-38 +3(T-7) <= 0 <= -27 +3(T-7)\n\nLower <=0: -38 +3(T-7) <=0 => 3(T-7) <=38 => T-7 <= 38/3 ≈12.666, T<=19.666, so T<=19\n\nUpper >=0: -27 +3(T-7) >=0 => 3(T-7) >=27 => T-7 >=9 => T>=16\n\nSo for T from 16 to 19 inclusive.\n\nT=16: lower -38 +3(9)= -38+27= -11 <=0, upper -27+27=0 >=0, so 0 in [-11,0]\n\nT=17: lower -38+30= -8, upper -27+30=3, 0 in [-8,3]\n\nSimilarly T=18: lower -38+33= -5, upper -27+33=6\n\nT=19: lower -38+36= -2, upper -27+36=9\n\nAll contain 0.\n\nT=20: lower -38+39=1, upper -27+39=12, >0, no.\n\nSo freeway 3 has collision at turns 16,17,18,19.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? The table says: (-27,-38,right,3) identical to freeway 3.\n\nLet me check: freeway 4: (-27,-38,right,3) yes, same as freeway 3. So same collision times, turns 16 to 19.\n\nNow freeway 5: (-60,-25,left,36)\n\nDirection left, so head and tail: head=-60? Let's see the update.\n\nFor left-moving: span at t1 is [h, tau] I think? The notation: \"left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau]\"\n\nIn the game dynamics: \"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nHere h and tau are given, but for left-moving, h is head, tau is tail? In the example, for left-moving, it says [h, tau], but which is which?\n\nIn the car state, it says \"cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor left-moving, direction left, so moving left, positions decrease.\n\nAt t1, span is [h, tau], which might be from left to right or? But since it's moving left, head is the front, so if moving left, head should be on the left, I think.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nTypically, for a car moving left, the head is at smaller x, tail at larger x? No.\n\nIn the context, for right-moving, it was [tau, h] with tau < h, since moving right, tail behind.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it should be [h, tau] with h < tau? Let's see the update.\n\nFor left-moving, Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd at T, if moving left, positions decrease.\n\nNow, at t1, span is [h, tau], so for it to be a span, h should be less than tau, I assume, or not necessarily?\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 5: head h=-60, tail tau=-25, direction left.\n\nSo h = -60, tau = -25, and since left-moving, at t1, span is [h, tau] = [-60, -25]\n\nThen at T, [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)] = [-60 -36(T-7), -25 -36(T-7)]\n\nSince s=36.\n\nNow collision if 0 in this interval at turn T.\n\nSo [-60 -36(T-7), -25 -36(T-7)] contains 0.\n\nLet K = T-7, so interval: [-60 -36K, -25 -36K]\n\nNow, -60 -36K <= 0 <= -25 -36K\n\nFirst, lower <=0: -60 -36K <=0 always true since both negative for K>=0? K=T-7 >=0.\n\n-60 -36K <=0 is true for all K, since -60 <=0 and -36K<=0.\n\nUpper >=0: -25 -36K >=0 => -36K >=25 => multiply by -1, reverse inequality: 36K <= -25, which is impossible since K>=0, 36K>=0, -25<0.\n\nSo -25 -36K <= -25 <0, so upper bound always negative, lower bound more negative, so the interval is entirely negative, never contains 0.\n\nThus, no collision on freeway 5 at any time.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6,7,8: all have (-20,-31,right,4)\n\nLet's take freeway 6: head=-20, tail=-31, direction right, speed 4.\n\nRight-moving, so at t1=7, span [tau,h] = [-31,-20]\n\nAt T: [-31 +4(T-7), -20 +4(T-7)]\n\nCollision if 0 in this.\n\n-31 +4(T-7) <= 0 <= -20 +4(T-7)\n\nLower <=0: -31 +4K <=0 => 4K <=31 => K<=31/4=7.75, K<=7 since integer? K=T-7\n\nT-7 <=7.75, so T<=14.75, T<=14\n\nUpper >=0: -20 +4K >=0 => 4K >=20 => K>=5\n\nSo T-7 >=5 => T>=12\n\nThus for T=12 to T=14 inclusive.\n\nT=12: K=5, lower -31+20= -11, upper -20+20=0, so 0 in [-11,0]\n\nT=13: K=6, lower -31+24= -7, upper -20+24=4, 0 in [-7,4]\n\nT=14: K=7, lower -31+28= -3, upper -20+28=8, 0 in [-3,8]\n\nT=15: K=8, lower -31+32=1, upper -20+32=12, >0, no.\n\nSo freeway 6 has collision at turns 12,13,14.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 and 8 are identical: same cars, so same collision times, turns 12,13,14.\n\nFreeway 7: (-20,-31,right,4) same as 6.\n\nFreeway 8: same.\n\nNow, also freeway 1,5 safe always.\n\nFreeway 2: collision only at T=10.\n\nFreeway 3 and 4: collision at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nFreeway 6,7,8: collision at T=12,13,14.\n\nI need to go from y=5 at turn 7 to y=9.\n\ny changes by +1, -1, or 0 each turn.\n\nMinimal H: since from y=5 to y=9, difference 4, so at least 4 turns if I go up each time. But I might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t=7 to t=7+H-1, I need y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nLet t = t1 + i for i=0 to H-1, but at i=0, turn t1=7, position y=5.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn t1 + H, position y, but I need to reach at turn t1 + H -1? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t1 to t1 + H -1, actions a_t, and after H actions, at turn t1 + H, I should be at y=9? No.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nReach (0,9), so position at some turn.\n\n\"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nYes: \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nSo the position after H actions, at turn t1 + H -1? Let's index.\n\nAt turn t1 (current turn), position is given, y_{t1} =5.\n\nThen I perform action a_{t1} , which determines y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\nThen at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nAfter performing actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, the position at turn t1 + H -1 is y_{t1 + H -1}, which should be 9.\n\nTurn sequence:\n\n- Start: turn t1, y_{t1} =5\n\n- After action a_{t1}, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\n- ...\n\n- After action a_{t1 + k}, y_{t1 + k +1} = ...\n\n- I want y_{t1 + H -1} =9 after H-1 actions? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence has actions from t= t1 to t= t1 + H -1, so H actions.\n\nAfter first action, at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}\n\nAfter second action, at turn t1+2, y_{t1+2}\n\n...\n\nAfter the last action a_{t1 + H -1}, at turn (t1 + H -1) +1 = t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}\n\nBut I need y_{t1 + H -1} =9, which is the position at turn t1 + H -1, before the last action? I'm confused.\n\nDefine:\n\nLet the turns be indexed by t.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t is taken at turn t, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nGiven: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, I am at y_t, I choose a_t, then I move to y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\nThe state at turn t is y_t.\n\nI start at turn t1=7, y_7=5.\n\nI perform a sequence of actions: a_7, a_8, ..., up to some a_{t1 + H -1}, but t1 + H -1.\n\nAfter performing H actions, from a_7 to a_{7 + H -1}, the position at turn (7 + H -1) +1? After a_t, I am at y_{t+1}.\n\nAfter action a_{7 + k}, I am at y_{8 + k} for k from 0 to H-1? Set k starting from 0.\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + k} for k=0 to H-1, I am at position y_{t1 + k +1}\n\nFor k=0, after a_{t1}, at y_{t1+1}\n\nFor k=H-1, after a_{t1 + H -1}, at y_{t1 + H}\n\nBut I need to reach y=9 at some turn, specifically y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is the position at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, I am at y_{t1 + H -1}, and I may or may not take an action at that turn.\n\nThe sequence includes actions from t=t1 to t=t1 + H -1, so at turn t=t1 + H -1, I take action a_{t1 + H -1}, which affects y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut I need y_{t1 + H -1} =9, which is the position before taking action at that turn, or after?\n\nAt turn t, position is y_t, then I take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nI need y_{t1 + H -1} =9, meaning at turn t1 + H -1, I am at position 9.\n\nThen, at that turn, I take some action, but since I have reached y=9, and H is the number of turns, I think I stop after reaching, but the action sequence is up to reaching.\n\nThe minimal H such that after some actions, at turn t1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nFor example, if I do nothing, at turn t1, y=5, not 9.\n\nIf I go up once, at turn t1+1, y=6, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=5, I need at least 4 up actions.\n\nEach up action increases y by 1, so from y=5, after 4 up actions, I reach y=9.\n\nLet's see the turns.\n\nAt turn 7: y=5, take action a7\n\nThen at turn 8: y6 = y5 + Δy5? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nAt turn t, y_t, after action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo:\n\n- Turn 7: y_7 =5, take a_7, go to y_8 = y_7 + Δy_7\n\n- Turn 8: y_8, take a_8, go to y_9 = y_8 + Δy_8\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn t: y_t, take a_t, go to y_{t+1}\n\nI need y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{7 + H -1} =9\n\nFor example, if H=1, then y_{7} =5, not 9.\n\nH=1 means only one action? Sequence from t= t1 to t1 + H -1, for H=1, t from 7 to 7, so a_7, but after a_7, at turn 8, y_8, but we need y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{7+1-1}=y_7=5, not 9.\n\nSo for H=1, y_7=5 ≠9.\n\nFor H=2, sequence a_7, then at turn 8, y_8, and we need y_{7+2-1}=y_8=9.\n\nSimilarly, for H=4, we need y_{7+4-1}=y_10=9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFrom y_7=5 to y_{7+H-1}=9.\n\nThe number of actions is H, which changes the position from turn 7 to turn 7+H-1.\n\nThe position at turn T is after T - t1 actions or something.\n\nAt turn 7, after 0 actions, y_7=5.\n\nAfter 1 action (a_7), at turn 8, y_8.\n\nAfter 2 actions (a_7,a_8), at turn 9, y_9.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 7+k, y_{7+k}\n\nI need after H actions, at turn 7+H, y_{7+H} =? But I need y_{7+H-1} =9.\n\ny_{7+H-1} is at turn 7+H-1, which requires H-1 actions to reach from turn 7.\n\nFrom turn 7 to turn T, the number of turns elapsed is T - 7.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nTo be at y_T=9, with T = t1 + H -1 =7 + H -1.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at turn 8, T=8, then 7 + H -1 =8, so H=2.\n\ny_8=9, which requires one up action from y_7=5, but from 5 to 9 in one step? No, only +1 per action, so impossible to reach in less than 4 steps.\n\nMinimal T when I can be at y=9 is turn 11, since from turn 7, after 4 up actions, at turn 11, y_11=9.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n- Turn 7: y_7=5\n\n- Action a_7: U, then y_8 =5+1=6\n\n- a_8: U, y_9=7\n\n- a_9: U, y_10=8\n\n- a_10: U, y_11=9\n\nSo at turn 11, y_11=9.\n\nT = t1 + H -1 =7 + H -1\n\ny_T =9, with T=11, so 7 + H -1 =11, thus H=11-7+1=5.\n\nH is the number of actions: from a_7 to a_{7+H-1}, so for H actions, turns from 7 to 7+H-1 for actions, positions from y_7 to y_{7+H}.\n\nBut we need y_{7+H-1} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, with 4 up actions, at turn 11, y_11=9, which is y_{7+H-1} with 7+H-1=11, so H-1=4, H=5.\n\nActions: a_7 to a_10, 4 actions, H=4? Let's see.\n\nSequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_7, a_8, ..., a_{7+H-1}\n\nFor t from 0 to H-1, a_{t1 + t}\n\nAfter these actions, position at turn t1 + H, y_{t1 + H}\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo for example, with H actions, we have y_{t1 + H} after last action, but we need y_{t1 + H -1} before last action or something.\n\nI think I have a confusion.\n\nLet me denote the turn when I reach y=9 as T_reach.\n\nAt turn T_reach, y_{T_reach} =9.\n\nT_reach = t1 + H -1 =7 + H -1.\n\nThe number of actions from turn t1 to turn T_reach -1 or something.\n\nFrom turn 7 to turn T, to have y_T=9, I need to perform actions from turn 7 to turn T-1, because at turn t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo to set y_T=9, I need to have taken actions up to a_{T-1}.\n\nThe first action is at turn 7 for y_8, up to a_{T-1} for y_T.\n\nSo the actions are from t=7 to t=T-1, number of actions: (T-1) - 7 +1 = T-7.\n\nThen H = number of actions = T-7.\n\nAnd y_T =9, with T = t1 + H -1? t1=7, T= t1 + H -1 =7 + H -1.\n\nBut H = T-7, so 7 + (T-7) -1 = T-1, not T.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nSet T = turn when y_T=9.\n\nThen actions taken: from turn 7 to turn T-1 inclusive, to determine y_8 to y_T.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=7 to t=T-1, that's (T-1) - 7 +1 = T-7 actions.\n\nH is defined as the number of turns, but in the sequence, it's {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so for H actions.\n\nAnd we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo with t1=7, y_{7 + H -1} =9.\n\nIf I set T = 7 + H -1, then y_T=9.\n\nThe actions are from a_7 to a_{7+H-2} for t from 0 to H-1, a_{7+t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_7 to a_{7+H-1}.\n\nFor example, to have y_T=9 with T=7+H-1.\n\nThen the actions that affect up to y_T are from a_7 to a_{T-1}.\n\nSince T=7+H-1, so a_{T-1} = a_{7+H-1-1} = a_{7+H-2}\n\nBut the sequence includes a_{7+H-1}, which is at turn 7+H-1, and it determines y_{7+H}, which is not used.\n\nFor reaching at T, we don't need the action at turn T, only up to turn T-1.\n\nBut in the sequence, it includes actions up to a_{7+H-1}, and y_{7+H-1} =9, which is at turn 7+H-1.\n\nAt turn 7+H-1, y is 9, and we take action a_{7+H-1}, but since we have reached, it might be unnecessary, but it's part of the sequence.\n\nTo minimize H, we should reach as soon as possible.\n\nThe earliest I can reach y=9 is at turn 11, with y_11=9, as above, with 4 up actions from turn 7 to 10.\n\nThen T=11, so y_{7+H-1} =11, so 7+H-1=11, H-1=4, H=5.\n\nActions from a_7 to a_{7+5-1} =a_11? a_{7+H-1} = a_{7+4} for H=5? 7+H-1=7+4=11, a_{11} is at turn 11, which determines y_12, but we have y_11=9 already.\n\nFor y_11=9, we need actions a_7 to a_10.\n\nWith H=5, sequence a_7 to a_{11}, but a_11 is extra.\n\nLet's list:\n\nFor H=5, actions a_7, a_8, a_9, a_10, a_{11} for t from 0 to 4, a_{7+0} to a_{7+4} = a_7 to a_11.\n\nThen y_{7+5-1} = y_{11} =9, which is set by a_10 (since y_11 = y_10 + Δy_10).\n\na_10 determines y_11.\n\nSo with actions a_7 to a_10, we have y_11=9.\n\nBut for H=5, the sequence includes a_7 to a_11, so a_11 is included, which is not needed for reaching y_11, but it will affect y_12, but since we only care about reaching at turn 11, we can choose a_11 arbitrarily, say S, but it's part of the sequence.\n\nTo reach at turn 11 with minimal actions, H should be 4, but let's see the definition.\n\nH is the number of turns for the sequence, and we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor H=4, y_{7+4-1} = y_10.\n\nIf y_10=9, then good, but from y_7=5, with 3 actions, I can reach y_10=8 at best (U,U,U), not 9.\n\nWith 3 actions: a_7 U, y_8=6; a_8 U, y_9=7; a_9 U, y_10=8 <9.\n\nTo reach y_10=9, I need to be at y_9=8 and then U, but y_9=8 requires previous actions.\n\nFrom y_7=5, to y_10=9, I need three actions: for example, a_7 U to y_8=6, a_8 U to y_9=7, a_9 U to y_10=8? No, a_9 U from y_9 to y_10= y_9 +1.\n\nIf y_9=8, a_9 U, y_10=9.\n\nBut to have y_9=8, from y_7=5, I need two actions to go to y_9=7, then a_9 U to y_10=9.\n\nActions: a_7 and a_8 to increase from 5 to 7 at y_9, then a_9 to y_10=9.\n\nBut y_10=9, which is at turn 10.\n\nFor H=4, y_{7+4-1}=y_10=9, possible with actions a_7, a_8, a_9.\n\nThen the sequence for H=4 is a_7, a_8, a_9, and a_{7+4-1} = a_10? t from 0 to H-1=3, a_7 to a_{7+3} = a_10.\n\na_10 determines y_11, but we have y_10=9 already.\n\nSimilarly, for reaching at turn 11, y_11=9, with actions a_7 to a_10, H=4 actions, then y_{7+4-1}=y_10, not y_11.\n\nTo have y_11=9, we need H such that 7+H-1=11, H=5.\n\nThen actions a_7 to a_{11}, with a_7 to a_10 setting y_11=9, and a_11 can be S or something.\n\nBut to minimize H, we want the smallest H such that we can reach y=9 at turn 7+H-1.\n\nSince from y=5 to y=9, minimum 4 steps, so earliest turn to reach is turn 11, with y_11=9.\n\nSo T=11, then 7+H-1=11, H=5.\n\nIf I can reach earlier, but I can't, since only +1 per step.\n\nSo minimal H is at least 5, for reaching at turn 11.\n\nBut let's confirm with the car constraints; I might need to take more turns if I have to avoid.\n\nFirst, let's list the collision times for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: always safe\n\nFreeway 2: collision at T=10 only\n\nFreeway 3: collision at T=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 4: same as 3, T=16-19\n\nFreeway 5: always safe\n\nFreeway 6: collision at T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 7: same, T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 8: same, T=12,13,14\n\nAlso, freeway 0 and 9 have no cars, I assume, since freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\nThe player can be at y=0 or y=9, and no cars there, so safe.\n\nI start at y=5, turn 7.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe direct path: go up each turn.\n\nActions: a7=U, to y8=6\n\na8=U, to y9=7\n\na9=U, to y10=8\n\na10=U, to y11=9\n\nThen at turn 11, y11=9.\n\nH=5, since for H=5, y_{7+5-1}=y11=9.\n\nNow, I need to check for each turn, when I am on a freeway, if there is collision.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, and I need to ensure that for that y_T, at turn T, 0 is not in the span of any car on freeway y_T.\n\nFor the path:\n\nTurn 7: y7=5, freeway 5. Freeway 5 is always safe, as we saw, no collision possible. So safe.\n\nTurn 8: y8=6, freeway 6. Freeway 6 has collision at T=12,13,14. Turn 8 is not in that range, so safe.\n\nTurn 9: y9=7, freeway 7. Collision at T=12,13,14, turn 9 not, safe.\n\nTurn 10: y10=8, freeway 8. Collision at T=12,13,14, turn 10 not, safe.\n\nTurn 11: y11=9, no freeway or safe.\n\nSo all safe, and I reach at turn 11 with 4 up actions, but with H=5, sequence includes a7 to a11.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=5, actions a7 to a11.\n\na7: U to y8=6\n\na8: U to y9=7\n\na9: U to y10=8\n\na10: U to y11=9\n\na11: ? at turn 11, I am at y11=9, and I take action a11, which could be S, U, or D, but since y=9, if U, y12=10, but y max 9, so probably not allowed, or it stays 9? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y in [0,9], so if at y=9 and U, probably y=9, similarly for D at y=0.\n\nBut in this case, at turn 11, I have reached, so a11 can be S, for example.\n\nBut in the path to reach, only a7 to a10 are needed, but for the sequence, we include a11 as well for H=5.\n\nBut since we reach at turn 11, and H=5, it should be fine.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier? No, turn 11 is earliest.\n\nPerhaps with different actions, but no, must go up 4 times.\n\nBut in this case, all turns are safe, so minimal H is 5.\n\nBut let's confirm turn 10: y10=8, freeway 8, collision at 12,13,14, turn 10 not, safe.\n\nTurn 11: y=9, safe.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 10, y10=8, freeway 8, and no collision, good.\n\nBut freeway 2 has collision at T=10, but freeway 2 is y=2, not relevant here.\n\nIn this path, I don't go to y=2.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo with H=5, actions: a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U, and a11=S, for example.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, so for H=5, t=7 to 11, actions a7 to a11.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to specify the actions.\n\nBut in this case, it works.\n\nBut is there a problem? Turn 10 is freeway 8, which has cars, but at turn 10, for freeway 8, collision at T=12,13,14, so at T=10, no collision.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's double-check freeway 8 at T=10.\n\nFreeway 8: cars (-20,-31,right,4)\n\nAt T=10, t1=7, K=T-t1=3\n\nSpan: [-31 +4*3, -20 +4*3] = [-31+12, -20+12] = [-19, -8]\n\n0 not in [-19,-8], so safe, yes.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo with 4 up actions, I reach y=9 at turn 11.\n\nBut H=5 for the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at turn 10 if I start higher, but I start at 5, so no.\n\nMaybe by going down and up, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nSo minimal H should be 5.\n\nBut let's see if I can do with H=4.\n\nFor H=4, y_{7+4-1}=y_{10} must be 9.\n\ny10=9.\n\nFrom y7=5, to y10=9, I need to increase by 4 in 3 steps? From turn 7 to turn 10, positions y8,y9,y10.\n\ny10 = y9 + Δy9\n\ny9 = y8 + Δy8\n\ny8 = y7 + Δy7\n\nSo y10 = y7 + Δy7 + Δy8 + Δy9\n\ny7=5, y10=9, so Δy7 + Δy8 + Δy9 =4\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1, so sum=4, must be all +1, so U,U,U for a7,a8,a9.\n\nThen y8=6, y9=7, y10=8, not 9.\n\ny10=8, not 9.\n\nSo impossible to reach y10=9 from y7=5 in 3 actions.\n\nThus minimal T to reach is 11, with H=5.\n\nSo the sequence should be possible as above.\n\nBut in the actions, for turn 10, when I am at y10=8, freeway 8, and I go to y11=9.\n\nAt turn 10, I am on freeway 8, which is safe.\n\nBut let's see if at any point I might have issue.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, for example, from y to y+1, at turn T, I am on y, then after action, at turn T+1 on y+1.\n\nIn this case, no problem.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 2 at T=10, but I am not on freeway 2.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence for H=5, I have a11, which I can set to S.\n\nBut let's see if I need to specify.\n\nPerhaps I can have H=4 with y10=9, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: if I go up faster, but no, only +1 per turn.\n\nOr start from lower, but I start at 5.\n\nSo I think H=5 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision rule again.\n\nThe collision rule: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nIn this case, since I move only at action, and I move step by step, it should be fine.\n\nIn my path, I never stay or move to a dangerous freeway at wrong time.\n\nFor example, at turn 10, I am on y=8, freeway 8, which is safe at T=10.\n\nThen I move to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier by being at y=9 at turn 10, but impossible.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut let's see the car on freeway 2 at T=10, collision, but I am not on it.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo the sequence: for H=5, actions:\n\nTurn t1: a7 = U\n\nTurn t1+1: a8 = U\n\nTurn t1+2: a9 = U\n\nTurn t1+3: a10 = U\n\nTurn t1+4: a11 = S  (since at y=9, stay)\n\nt1+4 is a11.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  which is a7\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1} a8\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t1 + H-1}\n\nFor H=5, up to a_{7+4} = a11\n\nActions: a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U, a11=S\n\nBut a11=S is at turn 11, after reaching.\n\nSince we reached at turn 11, and a11 is not necessary, but we have to include it to have y_{11}=9 with the actions up to a10.\n\nIn the sequence, with a7 to a10 U, we reach y11=9.\n\nThen a11 can be anything, but we set S.\n\nNow, but in the output, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I can have a shorter sequence if I reach earlier, but can't.\n\nAnother thought: maybe at turn 7, I am at y=5, if I do nothing, but I need to go up.\n\nOr if I go down to avoid something, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, suppose I go down to y=4 or something, but then to reach y=9, I need more steps, so H larger, not minimal.\n\nSo minimal H is 5.\n\nBut let's see if there is a reason I cannot take this path.\n\nAt turn 9, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 has collision at T=12,13,14, turn 9 not, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut freeway 3 and 4 have collisions later, but I don't go there.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nPerhaps for completeness, let's list the position and freeway at each turn.\n\nTurn 7: y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\nTurn 8: y=6, freeway 6, safe (collision only at 12,13,14)\n\nTurn 9: y=7, freeway 7, safe\n\nTurn 10: y=8, freeway 8, safe\n\nTurn 11: y=9, no freeway, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nWith H=5,\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nIn the answer, it should be written as:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 3: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 4: S\n\nBut t_1 + 4 is turn 11, action S.\n\nSince the last action a11 is after reaching, but it's part of the sequence.\n\nTo avoid the extra action, but H must be such that we reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nIf I set H=4, then y_{7+4-1}=y10 must be 9, but as above, impossible.\n\nSo H=5 is correct.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at turn 10 by being at y=9 earlier, but no.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 2, there is a car that causes collision at T=10, but since I am at y=8 at turn 10, not y=2, it's fine.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo the minimal H is 5, with the sequence above.\n\nBut let's write it in the box.\n\nThe answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } t_1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 4: S \\end{array} }\n\nBut t_1 + 4 is turn 11.\n\nSince S at y=9, it stays.\n\nPerhaps I can set a11 to U, but y cannot go above 9, so probably it stays 9, so S is fine.\n\nIn the action, if U at y=9, y stays 9, similarly.\n\nBut S is explicit stay.\n\nIn the sequence, a11 can be D or something, but not necessary, S is fine.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nBut I think this is the minimal.\n\nBut earlier I thought about freeway 6,7,8 collisions at 12,13,14, but in this path, I am not on them at those turns.\n\nAt turn 12, if I were on y=6, but I am at y=9 by then.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to wait or something, but in this case, no need.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player starts at \\(y = 5\\) at turn 7.\n- To reach \\(y = 9\\), a minimum of 4 upward moves (U) are required, as each U increases \\(y\\) by 1.\n- The earliest possible turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) is turn 11, achieved by moving up on turns 7, 8, 9, and 10:\n  - Turn 7: \\(y_7 = 5\\), action U → \\(y_8 = 6\\)\n  - Turn 8: \\(y_8 = 6\\), action U → \\(y_9 = 7\\)\n  - Turn 9: \\(y_9 = 7\\), action U → \\(y_{10} = 8\\)\n  - Turn 10: \\(y_{10} = 8\\), action U → \\(y_{11} = 9\\)\n- \\(H\\) is the number of turns in the action sequence, and \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{7 + H - 1}\\) must be 9. For \\(y_{11} = 9\\), \\(7 + H - 1 = 11\\) gives \\(H = 5\\).\n- The sequence includes actions from turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) to turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 11\\), so 5 actions: \\(a_7\\) to \\(a_{11}\\).\n- After reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11, the action at turn 11 can be S (stay) since \\(y\\) cannot exceed 9.\n\n### Collision Avoidance:\nAt each turn, the player's position \\(y_T\\) must avoid collisions with cars on freeway \\(y_T\\) at turn \\(T\\). The car states and collision times are:\n\n- **Freeway 1**: Always safe (no collision possible).\n- **Freeway 2**: Collision at \\(T = 10\\) only.\n- **Freeway 3**: Collision at \\(T = 16, 17, 18, 19\\).\n- **Freeway 4**: Collision at \\(T = 16, 17, 18, 19\\).\n- **Freeway 5**: Always safe.\n- **Freeway 6**: Collision at \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\).\n- **Freeway 7**: Collision at \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\).\n- **Freeway 8**: Collision at \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\).\n\nThe planned path:\n- Turn 7: \\(y_7 = 5\\) (freeway 5) – safe.\n- Turn 8: \\(y_8 = 6\\) (freeway 6) – safe (\\(T = 8\\) not in 12-14).\n- Turn 9: \\(y_9 = 7\\) (freeway 7) – safe (\\(T = 9\\) not in 12-14).\n- Turn 10: \\(y_{10} = 8\\) (freeway 8) – safe (\\(T = 10\\) not in 12-14; span at \\(T = 10\\) is \\([-19, -8]\\), 0 not in interval).\n- Turn 11: \\(y_{11} = 9\\) – no freeway, safe.\n\nNo collisions occur, and the path reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11 with minimal \\(H = 5\\).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1 = 7\\) to \\(t_1 + 4 = 11\\) is:\n- \\(a_7 = U\\) (move up to \\(y_8 = 6\\))\n- \\(a_8 = U\\) (move up to \\(y_9 = 7\\))\n- \\(a_9 = U\\) (move up to \\(y_{10} = 8\\))\n- \\(a_{10} = U\\) (move up to \\(y_{11} = 9\\))\n- \\(a_{11} = S\\) (stay at \\(y = 9\\); action can be S since position is reached)\n\nThis sequence minimizes \\(H = 5\\) and avoids all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } t_1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 4: S \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,6) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1=8, and I have to output a sequence of actions starting from turn 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive. So from y=6, I need to reach y=9, which is 3 units up, so minimum 3 turns if I can go straight up without any issues. But I have to avoid the cars on the freeways.\n\nNow, collision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y=k (for k=1 to 8) and at that same turn, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span. The span is where the car is at that turn.\n\nAlso, importantly, when you move to a new y, you are not on that new y until the next turn. So if at turn T you are on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1}, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T; you only occupy y_{T+1} at turn T+1. So you only care about cars on the freeway you're currently on at each turn.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, and there is a car on that freeway with 0 in its span at time T, then collision.\n\nNow, I need to simulate the car movements over time. The cars are given at turn t1=8, and I need to find where they are at future turns.\n\nLet me list all the cars at t1=8.\n\nFor each freeway k, there are cars specified with (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nDirection: right or left. From the update rules:\n\n- Left-moving: span at T is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\n- Right-moving: span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, at t1, span is [τ, h], so head is h, tail is τ. Then at T, it's [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: at t1, [h, τ], at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to see when a car has 0 in its span at some turn.\n\nBut since the player is moving, I need to know for each turn and each freeway if there is a car that covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nx=0 is the player's x-position, which is always 0, I assume, since it's a vertical move only? The player is at (0,y), so x=0 fixed.\n\nSo for collision, on freeway k, at turn T, if there is a car such that 0 is between the left and right ends of the car at that turn.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per freeway at t1=8.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so at t1, span is [τ, h] = [-95, -48]? Head and tail: it says head h=-48, tail τ=-95, direction right.\n\nIn the notation: (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor right-moving, at t1, the car is from τ to h, with h > τ since it's moving right? Not necessarily, but in this case, h=-48, τ=-95, so τ < h, so from -95 to -48, which is increasing, so right-moving makes sense.\n\nAt t1, span is [τ, h] = [-95, -48]\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-95 + 48(T-8), -48 + 48(T-8)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, etc.\n\nBut I need to find when 0 is in the span for each car on its freeway.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head=-48, tail=-95, direction=right, speed=48\n\nFreeway 2: two cars: (48, 37, right, 12) and (-24, -35, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, direction=right. But head=48, tail=37? If tail=37, head=48, that means from 37 to 48, which is right, since 37<48.\n\nSecond car: head=-24, tail=-35, direction=right, so from -35 to -24.\n\nFreeway 3: one car: (-24, -35, right, 3) head=-24, tail=-35, direction=right, so from -35 to -24.\n\nFreeway 4: one car: (-24, -35, right, 3) same as freeway 3? But different freeway.\n\nFreeway 5: one car: (48, 83, left, 36) head=48, tail=83, direction=left. Head=48, tail=83? If tail=83, head=48, but 48<83, so if moving left, at t1 span should be [h, τ] = [48, 83], I think.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor left-moving, at t1, span is [h, τ], so if d=left, h and τ with h < τ or h > τ? The notation doesn't specify order, but from the update, for left-moving, span at t1 is [h, τ], so it could be h < τ or h > τ, but in practice, for left-moving, if h is head, it should be the front, so if moving left, head should be smaller x if x decreases left, but in the grid, it doesn't specify, but from the update rule, for left-moving, x decreases, so head should have smaller x than tail? I think I need to interpret based on direction.\n\nFrom the update:\n\nLeft-moving: span at t1 is [h, τ], and at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it moves left, h should be the left end or right end? At t1, [h, τ], then at T, [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt], so as time increases, both decrease, so if h < τ, then [h, τ] is from left to right, but moving left, so left end decreases. Similarly, if h > τ, it would be decreasing, but let's see the values.\n\nFor freeway 5: head=48, tail=83, d=left, so at t1, span is [h, τ] = [48, 83], since d=left.\n\nThen at T, [48 - 36(T-t1), 83 - 36(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, at t1 [τ, h], at T [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt]\n\nIn freeway 2, first car: head=48, tail=37, d=right, so at t1, [τ, h] = [37, 48]\n\nSecond car: head=-24, tail=-35, d=right, so [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nNow freeway 6: (-16, -27, right, 4) head=-16, tail=-27, d=right, so at t1 [τ, h] = [-27, -16]\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same as 6? (-16, -27, right, 4)\n\nFreeway 8: (-16, -27, right, 4) all same? But different freeways.\n\nFreeway 3 and 4 also have the same car? Freeway 3: (-24, -35, right, 3), freeway 4: (-24, -35, right, 3), same parameters.\n\nBut they are on different freeways, so I need to consider each separately.\n\nNow, for the player to be safe on a freeway at turn T, for that freeway, no car should have 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need to check all on that row.\n\nPlayer starts at y=6 at turn t1=8.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=6,7,8 are freeways, y=9 is not, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is the bottom, y=9 is the top, both no cars, so only care about y=1 to 8.\n\nPlayer at (0,6) at turn 8, which is freeway 6, so I need to check if at turn 8, on freeway 6, is there a car at x=0.\n\nFreeway 6 has a car: at t1=8, span [-27, -16] for the car, since right-moving, [τ, h] = [-27, -16], so from x=-27 to x=-16, which is left of 0, since -27 < -16 < 0, so 0 is not in [-27,-16], so at turn 8, on freeway 6, no car at x=0, so safe.\n\nNow, I need to move to y=9.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, once I reach y=9, I'm safe, regardless of cars below.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), and at that turn, since y=9 not a freeway, no collision possible.\n\nNow, I need to get there in min turns, so ideally, move up as fast as possible.\n\nBut I have to pass through y=7 and y=8, which are freeways, so I need to be safe when I'm on those rows.\n\nAlso, when I move, at each turn, I occupy only one row.\n\nLet me denote the turns starting from t=8.\n\nAt turn T, player is at y_T.\n\nFor T=8, y_8 = 6\n\nI need to choose actions a_t for t=8,9,10,... until I reach y=9.\n\nEach action changes y for the next turn.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nAt turn t, after action, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nBut position at turn t is y_t.\n\nCollision at turn t if y_t between 1 and 8, and on freeway y_t, there is a car with 0 in span at time t.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when cars cover x=0.\n\nLet's list for each freeway the times when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car, right-moving, s=48\n\nAt t1=8, span [τ, h] = [-95, -48]\n\nAt time T, span: [ -95 + 48(T-8), -48 + 48(T-8) ]\n\nSet 0 in [left, right], so min and max.\n\nSince it's moving right, left end: -95 + 48(T-8)\n\nRight end: -48 + 48(T-8)\n\n0 in [left, right] if left <= 0 <= right\n\nSo -95 + 48(T-8) <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 48(T-8)\n\nFirst inequality: -95 + 48(T-8) <= 0 => 48(T-8) <= 95 => T-8 <= 95/48 = 1.979... so T-8 <= 1 since T integer, T-8 <=1\n\nT-8 <= floor(95/48) but 95/48=1.979, so T-8 <=1\n\nAlso, second inequality: 0 <= -48 + 48(T-8) => 48 <= 48(T-8) => 1 <= T-8\n\nSo T-8 >=1 and T-8 <=1, so T-8=1, T=9\n\nThus at T=9, left = -95 +48(1) = -95+48= -47? T-8=1, so left = -95 +48*1 = -47\n\nRight = -48 +48*1 = 0\n\nSo span at T=9: [ -47, 0 ]\n\nYes, 0 is included, right end is 0.\n\nSo on freeway 1, car covers x=0 at T=9.\n\nNow, for other T? Only at T=9.\n\nT-8=1 only, so only at turn 9.\n\nNow freeway 2 has two cars.\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, d=right, s=12\n\nAt t1=8, [τ, h] = [37, 48]\n\nAt T, [37 + 12(T-8), 48 + 12(T-8)]\n\n0 in span: 37 + 12(T-8) <= 0 <= 48 + 12(T-8)\n\nFirst: 37 + 12Δt <=0? 37 +12Δt <=0 => 12Δt <= -37, not possible since Δt>=0, left end >=37>0, so always positive, never <=0, so 0 never in span. Since min x is 37 at t1, moving right, increasing, so x>=37>0, never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway 2: head=-24, tail=-35, d=right, s=12\n\nAt t1=8, [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nAt T, [ -35 + 12(T-8), -24 + 12(T-8) ]\n\n0 in span: -35 +12Δt <=0 <= -24 +12Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -35 +12Δt <=0 => 12Δt <=35 => Δt <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so Δt <=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +12Δt => 24 <=12Δt => Δt >=2\n\nSo Δt >=2 and Δt <=2, so Δt=2, T=10\n\nAt T=10, Δt=2, left = -35 +12*2 = -35+24= -11, right= -24 +24=0? -24 +12*2 = -24+24=0\n\nSo span [ -11, 0 ], 0 included.\n\nSo on freeway 2, at T=10, the second car covers x=0.\n\nNow freeway 3: one car: head=-24, tail=-35, d=right, s=3\n\nAt t1=8, [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nAt T, [ -35 + 3(T-8), -24 + 3(T-8) ]\n\n0 in span: -35 +3Δt <=0 <= -24 +3Δt\n\nFirst: -35 +3Δt <=0 => 3Δt <=35 => Δt <= 35/3 ≈11.666, so Δt <=11\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +3Δt => 24 <=3Δt => Δt >=8\n\nSo Δt >=8 and Δt <=11, so T-8 from 8 to 11, T=16 to 19? Δt=8,9,10,11\n\nT=8+8=16 to 8+11=19\n\nAt these times, car covers x=0.\n\nFor example, at Δt=8, left= -35 +3*8= -35+24= -11, right= -24+24=0\n\nAt Δt=9, left= -35+27= -8, right= -24+27=3, so [ -8,3], 0 in\n\netc.\n\nBut since s=3, it covers for multiple turns.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same as freeway 3? Head=-24, tail=-35, d=right, s=3, so exactly same, covers x=0 at T=16 to 19.\n\nBut different freeway, so when on freeway 4 at those times, collision.\n\nNow freeway 5: head=48, tail=83, d=left, s=36\n\nFor left-moving, at t1, span [h, τ] = [48, 83]\n\nAt T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [48 - 36(T-8), 83 - 36(T-8)]\n\n0 in span: 48 -36Δt <=0 <= 83 -36Δt\n\nFirst inequality: 48 -36Δt <=0 => 48 <=36Δt => Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so Δt >=2 since integer\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 83 -36Δt => 36Δt <=83 => Δt <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so Δt <=2\n\nThus Δt >=2 and Δt <=2, so Δt=2, T=10\n\nAt T=10, left=48 -36*2=48-72= -24, right=83-72=11, so [ -24,11], 0 in.\n\nSo on freeway 5, at T=10, car covers x=0.\n\nNow freeway 6: car: head=-16, tail=-27, d=right, s=4\n\nAt t1=8, [τ, h] = [-27, -16]\n\nAt T, [ -27 +4(T-8), -16 +4(T-8) ]\n\n0 in span: -27 +4Δt <=0 <= -16 +4Δt\n\nFirst: -27 +4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=27 => Δt <= 27/4 = 6.75, so Δt <=6\n\nSecond: 0 <= -16 +4Δt => 16 <=4Δt => Δt >=4\n\nSo Δt >=4 and Δt <=6, so T=12 to 14? T-8=4,5,6, T=12,13,14\n\nAt T=12, left= -27 +4*4= -27+16= -11, right= -16+16=0\n\nT=13, left= -27+20= -7, right= -16+20=4\n\nT=14, left= -27+24= -3, right= -16+24=8\n\nAll cover 0.\n\nBut at t1=8, on freeway 6, as I said, span [-27,-16], not cover 0.\n\nNow freeway 7: same car? Head=-16, tail=-27, d=right, s=4, so same as freeway 6, covers x=0 at T=12,13,14.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8: same, covers x=0 at T=12,13,14.\n\nNow, back to player.\n\nStart at turn 8, y=6 (freeway 6)\n\nAt turn 8, on freeway 6, car span [-27,-16], not cover 0, so safe.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nBut to get there, I need to pass through y=7 and y=8.\n\ny=7 is freeway 7, y=8 is freeway 8.\n\nNow, the dangerous times:\n\nFor freeway 1: occupied at T=9\n\nFreeway 2: occupied at T=10 (by second car)\n\nFreeway 3: occupied T=16 to 19\n\nFreeway 4: occupied T=16 to 19\n\nFreeway 5: occupied T=10\n\nFreeway 6: occupied T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 7: occupied T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 8: occupied T=12,13,14\n\nPlayer at turn 8: y=6, safe.\n\nI want to move up as fast as possible.\n\nOption 1: go straight up: U at t=8, to y=7 at t=9; U at t=9, to y=8 at t=10; U at t=10, to y=9 at t=11.\n\nNow, check safety:\n\nAt turn 8: y=6, freeway 6, not occupied at t=8, safe.\n\nAt turn 9: y=7 (since moved up at t=8, so at t=9 position y=7)\n\ny=7 is freeway 7.\n\nAt t=9, is freeway 7 occupied? Freeway 7 occupied at T=12,13,14, not at t=9, since t=9 is T=9, Δt=1, for freeway 7, at Δt=1, left= -27 +4(1)= -23, right= -16+4= -12, both negative, not cover 0. So safe.\n\nAt turn 10: y=8, freeway 8.\n\nAt t=10, freeway 8: Δt=2, left= -27 +4*2= -27+8= -19, right= -16+8= -8, both negative, not cover 0. Occupied starts at T=12, so safe.\n\nThen at turn 11: y=9, not a freeway, safe.\n\nSo with three moves: U,U,U at t=8,9,10, reach y=9 at t=11.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nt=8: action a_8, then y_{9} = y_8 + Δy_8\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 8: position y_8=6, choose a_8\n\nThen y_9 = y_8 + Δy_8\n\nAt turn 9, position y_9, and so on.\n\nIn this case:\n\nStart turn 8: y_8=6\n\nChoose a_8 = U, so Δy_8 = +1, so y_9 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\nTurn 9: position y_9=7, choose a_9=U, so y_{10} = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nTurn 10: position y_{10}=8, choose a_{10}=U, so y_{11} = 8 + 1 = 9\n\nTurn 11: position y_{11}=9, which is goal.\n\nNow collisions:\n\nTurn 8: y_8=6, freeway 6, at t=8, not occupied, safe.\n\nTurn 9: y_9=7, freeway 7, at t=9: for freeway 7, Δt=T-t1=9-8=1, span: left= -27 +4*1= -23, right= -16+4= -12, both <0, not cover 0, safe.\n\nTurn 10: y_{10}=8, freeway 8, at t=10: Δt=2, left= -27 +8= -19, right= -16+8= -8, both <0, not cover 0, safe.\n\nTurn 11: y=9, safe.\n\nSo in three turns, I can reach.\n\nBut is there any issue? The minimal H should be 3, since I need to increase y by 3.\n\nBut let me confirm if at some point it might be unsafe, but it seems fine.\n\nBut earlier I have freeway 1 occupied at t=9, but at t=9, if I were on freeway 1, but I'm on y=7, not freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 occupied at t=10, but at t=10 I'm on y=8, not y=5.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut the player starts at y=6, which is freeway 6, and I'm moving up immediately.\n\nBut just to be thorough, if I stayed or something, but I don't need to.\n\nThe problem is to minimize H, the number of turns, so 3 is minimum.\n\nH is the number of actions? Let me see.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nIn this case, from t1=8, actions at t=8,9,10, so three actions, H=3, and after that, at turn t1+H-1? t1 + (H-1) = 8 + (3-1) = 10, position at turn 10 is y=8? No.\n\nAfter actions from t=8 to t=10, the position after last action is at turn 11.\n\nSequence: actions at t=8,9,10 (three actions), then at turn 11, y=9.\n\nThe turn when position is (0,9) is turn 11.\n\nt1 + H -1 = 8 + 3 -1 = 10, but at turn 10, y=8, not 9.\n\nI think I confused the indexing.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t1 + H -1} = 9\"\n\nThe position after H actions.\n\nStart at turn t1, position y_{t1}\n\nAfter first action a_{t1}, position y_{t1 +1}\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, position y_{t1 + H}\n\nBut the sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nThen after a_{t1 + H -1}, position is y_{t1 + (t1 + H -1) +1?} Let's see.\n\nAt time τ, position y_τ.\n\nAfter action a_τ, y_{τ+1} is set.\n\nSo at turn τ, we perform a_τ, which determines y_{τ+1}.\n\nThe position at turn τ is y_τ.\n\nTo have y_{t1 + H} = 9? Not necessarily.\n\nThe condition is \"reach (0,9)\" and \"y_{t1 + H -1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} = 9.\n\nNow, t1 + H -1 is the turn when position is 9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then y_{t1 +1 -1} = y_{t1} =9? But at start y=6, not 9.\n\nH actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAfter k actions, position at turn t1 + k.\n\nAfter 0 actions, position at t1.\n\nAfter 1 action (a_{t1}), position at t1+1.\n\nAfter 2 actions (a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}), position at t1+2.\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions (a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}), position at t1 + H.\n\nBut the condition says y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1 + H -1 should be the turn with position 9.\n\nFor that, after H actions, position at t1 + H, but we need position at t1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nLet me read the task.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9)\".\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nNow, the actions are for t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times: t1 + 0, t1 +1, ..., t1 + (H-1)\n\nThat is, actions at turns t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nAfter performing these H actions, the position at turn (t1 + H -1) + 1? No.\n\nWhen we perform an action at turn τ, it sets y_{τ+1}.\n\nSo, at turn τ, we have y_τ, we choose a_τ, then y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ.\n\nThe sequence of actions: a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nAfter a_{t1}, y_{t1 +1} is set.\n\nAfter a_{t1+1}, y_{t1+2} is set.\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t1 + H -1}, y_{t1 + H} is set.\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is the position at turn t1 + H -1, which is before the last action.\n\nFor example, with H=3, we need y_{t1 + 3 -1} = y_{t1 +2} =9? But t1=8, y_{10} =9?\n\nIn my earlier plan, at turn 10, y=8, not 9.\n\nI think I have a misunderstanding.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nAt turn t1=8, position y_8=6.\n\nWe perform a sequence of actions starting from a_8.\n\nAfter H actions, the position at turn t1 + H should be... but the condition is y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet k = t1 + H -1.\n\nWe need y_k =9 for some k >= t1.\n\nk = t1 + H -1, so H = k - t1 +1.\n\nH is the number of actions to reach position 9 at turn k.\n\nSince we start at turn t1 with y_t1, to reach y_k=9, it takes (k - t1) actions? From turn t1 to turn k, there are (k - t1) steps.\n\nFor example, from turn 8 to turn 11, it takes 3 actions: at t=8,9,10 to be at y=9 at t=11.\n\nThe position is reached at turn 11.\n\ny_{11} =9.\n\nNow, k=11, t1=8, so k - t1 =3.\n\nH should be such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1 + H -1 =11, so 8 + H -1 =11, 7 + H =11, H=4.\n\nThat can't be right.\n\nt1 + H -1 =11, 8 + H -1 =11, 7+H=11, H=4.\n\nBut with 3 actions, we reach at turn 11.\n\nIf H=4, we need y_{8+4-1}=y_{11}=9, which is correct, but with 4 actions?\n\nI think I confused the index.\n\nLet me define the turn when position is first 9.\n\nLet T_reach be the turn when y_{T_reach} =9.\n\nT_reach >= t1.\n\nThe number of actions from turn t1 to turn T_reach -1, since at each turn from t1 to T_reach-1, we perform an action to move to the next position.\n\nAt turn t1, we start at y_t1.\n\nWe perform action at turn t1, which sets y_{t1+1}\n\nThen at turn t1+1, perform action, set y_{t1+2}, and so on, until at some turn T, we set y_{T} to 9, but y_T is set by action at T-1.\n\nTo have y_T =9 for T > t1, we need actions from turn t1 to T-1.\n\nNumber of actions: from t1 to T-1 inclusive, that's (T - t1) actions.\n\nThen y_T =9.\n\nIn the condition, y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet t1 + H -1 = T, so T = t1 + H -1.\n\nThen y_T =9.\n\nNumber of actions: to reach y_T at turn T, actions from t1 to T-1, number is (T - t1).\n\nSince T = t1 + H -1, so T - t1 = (t1 + H -1) - t1 = H -1.\n\nSo number of actions is H-1.\n\nBut the sequence is given as H actions: from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nFor example, if T_reach = t1, then y_{t1} =9, so no action needed, but H should be 0? But the sequence from t=0 to H-1, if H=0, no actions, but t1 + H -1 = t1 -1, which may not make sense.\n\nIn this case, y_t1 =6 ≠9, so T_reach > t1.\n\nSo T_reach = t1 + Δ for some Δ>0.\n\nThen y_{t1 + Δ} =9.\n\nNumber of actions: Δ actions, at turns t1 to t1 + Δ -1.\n\nThen y_{t1 + Δ} is set.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H -1} =9, so t1 + H -1 = t1 + Δ, thus H -1 = Δ, so H = Δ +1.\n\nNumber of actions is Δ, but H = Δ +1.\n\nFor example, with Δ=3, T_reach=11, y_11=9.\n\nNumber of actions: 3, at t=8,9,10.\n\nH should be such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9, so y_{8 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet 8 + H -1 =11, so 7 + H =11, H=4.\n\nThen sequence of actions: {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1=3}, so a_8, a_9, a_10, a_{11}? t=0,1,2,3? H-1=3, so t from 0 to 3, actions at t1+0=8, t1+1=9, t1+2=10, t1+3=11.\n\nBut if I have actions up to a_{11}, then y_{12} is set, but I need y_{11}=9.\n\nIf I perform action at turn 11, it sets y_{12}, but I need y_{11}=9.\n\nSo at turn 11, if y_{11}=9, I don't need to act, or I can stay, but the position is already 9.\n\nThe sequence should include actions until the turn before reaching, or including?\n\nI think there's confusion in the indexing.\n\nPerhaps the actions are to be performed until the position is reached.\n\nLet's look back at the answer format.\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\"\n\n\"Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\"\n\n...\n\nSo for H turns, but H is the number of actions.\n\nIn the sequence, it shows multiple turns.\n\nFor example, if I reach in 3 actions, I might have:\n\nTurn 8: a_8\n\nTurn 9: a_9\n\nTurn 10: a_10\n\nAnd after a_10, y_11=9.\n\nSo the last action is at turn 10, and position at turn 11 is 9.\n\nNow, y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{8 + H -1}\n\nSet this to 9, so 8 + H -1 =11, thus H=4.\n\nBut with H=4, I need actions at t=8,9,10,11.\n\nBut at t=11, if y_11=9, I can choose S, but it's unnecessary.\n\nThe minimal H should be the number to reach, so for Δ=3, H=4 actions? That seems redundant.\n\nPerhaps H includes the turns from t1 to t1+H-1, and at turn t1+H-1, position is 9.\n\nIn that case, for y_k=9, with k=t1+H-1, so H = k - t1 +1.\n\nNumber of actions from t1 to k-1.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at turn 10, so k=10.\n\nThen y_10=9.\n\nWith start at y_8=6, I need to reach y=9 at turn 10.\n\nThat means in 2 steps: from turn 8 to 9 and 9 to 10.\n\nActions at t=8 and t=9.\n\nThen y_10 = y_9 + Δy_9, and y_9 = y_8 + Δy_8.\n\nFrom y_8=6 to y_10=9, so in two steps, increase by 3, which is only possible if I move up twice, but each move +1, so from 6 to 7 at t=9, then 7 to 8 at t=10, not to 9.\n\nMaximum increase is +1 per turn, so from y=6 at t=8, at t=9 y<=7, at t=10 y<=8, at t=11 y<=9.\n\nSo earliest to reach y=9 is t=11, with three up moves.\n\nAt t=11, y=9.\n\nTo have y_k=9 at k=11.\n\nThen for y_{t1 + H -1} =9, so t1 + H -1 =11, 8 + H -1=11, H=4.\n\nThen sequence of actions: for t=0 to H-1=3, actions at t1+0=8, t1+1=9, t1+2=10, t1+3=11.\n\nBut at turn 11, I need to set y_12, but I want y_11=9, so if I am at y_11=9, I can choose S for a_11, but it's after I reached.\n\nThe condition is that after the sequence, y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn this case, with actions at t=8,9,10, I set y_11=9.\n\nThen at turn 11, I don't need to act, but if H=4, I include a_11, which could be S.\n\nBut it's not necessary for reaching, but to satisfy the sequence up to H-1.\n\nPerhaps for the output, I need to show actions until the turn before or including.\n\nI think for simplicity, in this case, with three actions U at t=8,9,10, I reach at t=11.\n\nFor the output, since H=4, I need to include a_11 as well.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nPerhaps I should proceed with the plan and see.\n\nIn my earlier plan, with U at t=8, U at t=9, U at t=10, I reach y=9 at t=11.\n\nAnd it seems safe.\n\nBut is there a reason to do otherwise? For example, if at some point it was unsafe, but in this case it is safe.\n\nBut let me check if at t=10, when I am on y=8, is it safe? Yes.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 9, I am on y=7, freeway 7, which is occupied at t=12,13,14, but not at t=9, so safe.\n\nSimilarly all good.\n\nBut the player is at (0,6) at t=8, and I move up immediately.\n\nBut suppose I stay at t=8, then y=6 at t=9, but at t=9, freeway 6 is occupied? Freeway 6 occupied at t=12,13,14, not at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, Δt=1, span [-23,-12], not cover 0.\n\nBut if I stay, I waste time, so not better.\n\nSimilarly, no need to go down.\n\nSo minimal H should be 4? Let's calculate H.\n\nI need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1=8, so y_{8 + H -1} = y_{7 + H} =9? 8 + H -1 = 7 + H.\n\nSet 7 + H =9? No.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} = y_{8 + H -1}\n\nSet this to 9.\n\nSo 8 + H -1 = k, y_k=9.\n\nk must be at least 8, and since y=6 at t=8, k=11 earliest.\n\nSo 8 + H -1 =11, so 7 + H =11, H=4.\n\nThen y_{11} =9.\n\nSequence of actions: for t=0 to 3 (since H-1=3), actions at t1+0=8, t1+1=9, t1+2=10, t1+3=11.\n\nActions: a_8, a_9, a_10, a_11.\n\nWith a_8=U, a_9=U, a_10=U, then at t=11, y_11=9, but I need to specify a_11.\n\nSince I am at y_11=9, I can choose a_11=S, for example, to stay, but it doesn't change position.\n\nIn the sequence, I need to include it.\n\nBut to minimize H, H=4 is the minimal because with H=3, y_{8+3-1}=y_{10}, which is 8 if I moved up, not 9.\n\nSo I must have H=4 to have y_{11}=9.\n\nThen actions at t=8,9,10,11.\n\nAt t=8: U, to y=7 at t=9\n\nAt t=9: U, to y=8 at t=10\n\nAt t=10: U, to y=9 at t=11\n\nAt t=11: I am at y=9, so I can choose S, for example.\n\nThen the position at turn 11 is y=9, which is t1 + H -1 =8 +4-1=11, correct.\n\nNow, in terms of collision, at turn 11, y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nAnd all previous turns safe as before.\n\nSo sequence: Turn 8: U, Turn 9: U, Turn 10: U, Turn 11: S\n\nBut is S necessary? Since I reached at turn 11, but the action at turn 11 is performed, but I can choose S.\n\nTo be precise, the minimal number of turns H is 4, meaning 4 actions.\n\nBut the \"turns\" might be ambiguous.\n\nPerhaps in some contexts, \"turns\" refer to the time steps.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nNow, back to the car, is there any issue at turn 10?\n\nAt turn 10, I am on y=8, freeway 8.\n\nAt t=10, freeway 8: car span, as before, Δt=2, left=-19, right=-8, not cover 0, safe.\n\nBut freeway 5 is occupied at t=10, but I am not on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 occupied at t=10, but y=2.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSuppose at turn 10, if I were on y=5, it would be dangerous, but I'm not.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 5: at t=10, occupied, as we calculated.\n\nBut I'm on y=8.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo minimal H is 4, with three U and one S at the end.\n\nBut the S is just to satisfy the sequence, but since I reached, I could stop, but the sequence requires H actions.\n\nPerhaps I can have the last action to be U or something, but y=9, I can only S or D, but D would go down, not good.\n\nSo S is fine.\n\nTo avoid extra action, but H must be at least 4.\n\nWith H=3, y_{10} cannot be 9, as min y at t=10 is 8 if start from 6.\n\ny_8=6, after one action y_9<=7, after two actions y_10<=8, so y_10=8 max, not 9.\n\nSo impossible to have y_{10}=9.\n\nThus H=4 is minimal.\n\nAnd with the actions above, it works.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 11, I put S, but since the position is already 9, and no collision possible, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier, but no.\n\nAnother thing: what if I move up faster, but I can only +1 per turn.\n\nOr if I start by staying, but that delays.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut H=4.\n\nIn the output, it should be for turns starting from t1=8.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for H=4, I need four lines.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point there is collision risk.\n\nAt turn 8: y=6, freeway 6, car at [-27,-16], not cover 0, safe.\n\nAction U.\n\nTurn 9: y=7, freeway 7, at t=9, car on freeway 7: Δt=1, span [-27+4(1), -16+4(1)] = [-23,-12], not cover 0, safe.\n\nAction U.\n\nTurn 10: y=8, freeway 8, at t=10, car on freeway 8: Δt=2, span [-27+4(2), -16+4(2)] = [-27+8, -16+8] = [-19,-8], not cover 0, safe.\n\nAction U.\n\nTurn 11: y=9, not freeway, safe. Action S.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I can choose not to have the last action, but H must be 4.\n\nMaybe the problem considers that at the turn when I reach, I don't need action, but the sequence definition requires it.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo minimal H=4.\n\nBut in the beginning, I thought only three moves, but due to indexing, H=4.\n\nPerhaps I should output without the last S, but the format might require it.\n\nAnother idea: what if I reach at turn 10? But impossible from y=6.\n\nUnless I can move faster, but no, only +1 per action.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut let me make sure about the car states.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have cars that occupy at t=12,13,14, but not before, so at t=9 and t=10, they are safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nFreeway 1 at t=9 occupied, but I am on y=7 at t=9, not y=1.\n\nAll fine.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collision occurs only if, at turn \\(T\\), the player is on a freeway \\(y_T \\in \\{1, \\dots, 8\\}\\) and a car on that freeway has a span that includes \\(x = 0\\) at that turn.\n\n### Analysis of Car Occupancy at \\(x = 0\\)\nThe car positions and movements are simulated from \\(t_1 = 8\\) to determine when each freeway is occupied at \\(x = 0\\):\n- **Freeway 1**: Occupied only at \\(T = 9\\).\n- **Freeway 2**: Occupied only at \\(T = 10\\) (due to the second car).\n- **Freeway 3**: Occupied from \\(T = 16\\) to \\(T = 19\\).\n- **Freeway 4**: Occupied from \\(T = 16\\) to \\(T = 19\\).\n- **Freeway 5**: Occupied only at \\(T = 10\\).\n- **Freeway 6**: Occupied from \\(T = 12\\) to \\(T = 14\\).\n- **Freeway 7**: Occupied from \\(T = 12\\) to \\(T = 14\\).\n- **Freeway 8**: Occupied from \\(T = 12\\) to \\(T = 14\\).\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9) Minimally\nThe player must increase \\(y\\) from 6 to 9, requiring at least 3 upward moves. The earliest possible turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) is turn 11, as:\n- At turn 8, \\(y = 6\\).\n- After one action (e.g., \\(U\\)), \\(y_9 = 7\\) at turn 9.\n- After two actions, \\(y_{10} \\leq 8\\) at turn 10.\n- After three actions, \\(y_{11} = 9\\) at turn 11.\n\nThe minimal \\(H\\) is the number of actions such that \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\\). With \\(t_1 = 8\\), \\(y_{8 + H - 1} = 9\\). Setting \\(8 + H - 1 = 11\\) gives \\(H = 4\\). Thus, \\(H = 4\\) actions are required, and the position at turn 11 is \\(y = 9\\).\n\nA sequence of actions to achieve this safely:\n- **Turn 8**: Start at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6). At \\(T = 8\\), freeway 6 is not occupied (span \\([-27, -16]\\), \\(x = 0\\) not covered). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9.\n- **Turn 9**: Position \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7). At \\(T = 9\\), freeway 7 is not occupied (span \\([-23, -12]\\), \\(x = 0\\) not covered). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10.\n- **Turn 10**: Position \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8). At \\(T = 10\\), freeway 8 is not occupied (span \\([-19, -8]\\), \\(x = 0\\) not covered). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n- **Turn 11**: Position \\(y = 9\\) (not a freeway, safe). Action \\(S\\) (stay) maintains \\(y = 9\\), as required.\n\nThis sequence avoids all collisions and reaches (0, 9) at turn 11 with \\(H = 4\\) actions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: S }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,7) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1=9, and I'm at y=7. I have to move up to y=9, but I need to avoid the cars on y=7 and y=8 since I'm starting on y=7.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. Cars are on specific freeways, and they move left or right with a certain speed. Collision happens if at turn T, when I'm on freeway y_T, the x=0 is within the car's span at that turn.\n\nThe player update is straightforward: I can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe car update: for left-moving cars, the span moves left, so h and tau decrease by s per turn. For right-moving, they increase by s per turn.\n\nAlso, important: when I move to a new freeway, I'm not considered on that freeway until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nIn this case, I'm starting at turn t1=9 on y=7. So at turn 9, I'm on freeway 7.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9. Since y=9 is the top, and there are no cars above, I think y=9 is safe, no freeway there, I assume. The freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 might be safe, but the goal is to reach (0,9), which is not a freeway, so no cars to worry about there.\n\nBut to get there, I need to pass through y=7 and y=8.\n\nCurrently at turn 9, I'm on y=7.\n\nLet me list the cars on each freeway at turn t1=9.\n\nFreeway 1: (h, tau, d, s) = (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nSince it's right-moving, at time T, span is [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]? Let's see the notation.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, it says \"head h, tail tau\", and for right-moving, head is to the right, I think.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nh=0, tau=-47, d=right, s=48.\n\nSince right-moving, at turn t1=9, span is [tau, h] = [-47, 0], I think? But in the update, it says for right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h]? Let's read carefully.\n\nThe car state is given at turn t1: for each car, it gives (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s).\n\nThen for turn T, the span is calculated based on that.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), tau - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn both cases, the span is from left to right, I assume.\n\nFor freeway 1 at t1=9: h=0, tau=-47, right, s=48.\n\nSo at T=9, Span(9) = [tau + s(0), h + s(0)] = [-47 + 48*0, 0 + 48*0] = [-47, 0]\n\nNow, collision if at turn T, I'm on freeway k, and 0 is in Span(T) for that car.\n\nBut for freeway 1, at T=9, span is [-47,0], so x=0 is included since 0 is the upper bound.\n\n[ -47, 0 ] includes 0, right? Usually intervals include endpoints.\n\nSo at turn 9, on freeway 1, if I were there, I would collide, but I'm on freeway 7, not 1.\n\nI need to check for freeway 7 and 8, since I'll be moving there.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars:\n\nFreeway k | Cars (h, tau, d, s)\n\n1: (0, -47, right, 48)  // so one car\n\n2: (60, 49, right, 12), and (-12, -23, right, 12)  // two cars\n\n3: (-21, -32, right, 3)  // one car\n\n4: (-21, -32, right, 3)  // one car, same as above? Typo or same?\n\n5: (12, 47, left, 36)  // left-moving\n\n6: (-12, -23, right, 4)  // one car\n\n7: (-12, -23, right, 4)  // one car\n\n8: (-12, -23, right, 4)  // one car\n\nFreeway 7 has a car: h=-12, tau=-23, d=right, s=4\n\nAt turn t1=9, Span(9) = [tau + s(0), h + s(0)] = [-23 + 0, -12 + 0] = [-23, -12] for right-moving, since d=right.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(T) = [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAt T=9, T-t1=0, so [tau, h] = [-23, -12] for freeway 7.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same (-12, -23, right, 4), so Span(9) = [-23, -12]\n\nNow, I need to find when these spans include x=0.\n\nFor a collision to occur on freeway k at turn T, 0 must be in Span(T) for some car on that freeway.\n\nFor freeway 7 at T=9: Span = [-23, -12], which is from -23 to -12, so 0 is not in this interval, since -12 < 0? -12 is less than 0, so [-23, -12] is all negative, 0 not included. So at turn 9, on freeway 7, no collision, since 0 not in [-23,-12].\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8: same span [-23,-12], 0 not included.\n\nBut I need to move to y=8 and then to y=9.\n\nI start at turn 9 on y=7.\n\nI need to take actions to increase y to 9.\n\nThe minimal H would be at least 2, since I need to go from 7 to 9, so two U actions, but I might need to wait if there's a car coming.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from turn t1 to t1+H-1, with H actions? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t1, t1+1, ..., up to t1+H-1, and after H actions, I should be at y=9.\n\nAfter action at turn T, position updates to T+1.\n\nAt turn T, I choose action, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am at y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T based on y_T.\n\nSo for me to be at (0,9), that means after H actions, at turn t1 + H, I am at y=9.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t1, I am at position (0, y_{t1}) = (0,7).\n\nThen I choose action a_{t1}, which determines y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, I am at (0, y_{t1+1}), and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, I have taken actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, so I am at turn t1+H, at position y_{t1+H}.\n\nI need y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nAnd for each turn from t1 to t1+H-1, when I am on some freeway, I must not collide with cars on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, at that turn T, no car should have 0 in its span.\n\nAlso, when I move, at the turn I move, I am still on the old freeway, so I don't get hit by the new one until the next turn.\n\nIn this case, since I start at y=7, I need to go to y=8 or y=9 directly, but I can only change by ±1 or 0 per turn.\n\nSo to go from 7 to 9, minimum 2 turns: say U at t1, then at t1+1 I am at y=8, then U at t1+1, at t1+2 I am at y=9.\n\nOr I could stay or something, but that would take more turns.\n\nBut I need to avoid collisions on the way.\n\nFirst, let's find out when the cars on y=7 and y=8 have 0 in their span.\n\nFreeway 7: car at t1=9: h=-12, tau=-23, d=right, s=4\n\nSpan at time T: since right-moving, Span(T) = [tau + s(T-9), h + s(T-9)] = [-23 + 4(T-9), -12 + 4(T-9)]\n\nSet 0 in this interval: lower bound <= 0 <= upper bound\n\nSo -23 + 4(T-9) <= 0 <= -12 + 4(T-9)\n\nLet k = T-9, so for integer k>=0\n\n-23 + 4k <= 0 <= -12 + 4k\n\nFirst inequality: -23 + 4k <= 0 => 4k <= 23 => k <= 23/4 = 5.75, so k <= 5 since integer\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -12 + 4k => 4k >= 12 => k >= 3\n\nSo for k=3,4,5, 0 is in span.\n\nk = T-9, so at T=12,13,14, collision on freeway 7.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 8: same car? Freeway 8 has (-12,-23,right,4), same as freeway 7.\n\nSo similarly, Span(T) = [-23 + 4(T-9), -12 + 4(T-9)]\n\nSo same as above, collision at T=12,13,14.\n\nNow, I am at turn 9, y=7.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nFirst, can I go directly in 2 turns?\n\nOption: at turn 9, action U, so y_{10} = 7 +1 =8\n\nThen at turn 10, I am on y=8.\n\nNow, check collision at turn 10 on y=8.\n\nAt turn 10, T=10, k=T-9=1\n\nSpan on freeway 8: [-23 +4(1), -12 +4(1)] = [-19, -8]\n\n0 not in [-19,-8], so safe.\n\nThen at turn 10, I can action U, so y_{11} =8+1=9\n\nThen at turn 11, I am on y=9, which is not a freeway, so no car, safe.\n\nAnd I reached y=9 at turn 11.\n\nNow, check for turn 9: at turn 9, I am on y=7.\n\nFreeway 7 at T=9: span [-23, -12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSo in two actions: a_{9} = U, a_{10} = U\n\nThen at turn 11, y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think.\n\nThe sequence is for t=0 to H-1, so actions at t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1+H, position is set.\n\nI need y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nHere t1=9, after actions at t1=9 and t1+1=10, I have y_{11} =9, so H=2 actions: at t1 and t1+1? t1 + H -1 = t1+1 for H=2.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so actions at t1 + t for t=0,1,2,...,H-1.\n\nSo for H=2, actions at t1 +0 and t1 +1, i.e., turn 9 and turn 10.\n\nThen after that, at turn t1 + H =11, position is y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd collision: at turn 9, y=7, freeway 7, span [-23,-12], no 0.\n\nAt turn 10, y=8, freeway 8, span at T=10: k=1, [-23+4(1), -12+4(1)] = [-19,-8], no 0.\n\nThen at turn 11, y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nSo it seems I can reach in 2 turns with U,U.\n\nBut the problem is to avoid collisions, and it seems fine.\n\nBut let me check other freeways? I only care about the freeways I am on.\n\nIn this path, I am only on y=7 at turn 9, and y=8 at turn 10.\n\nI don't go to other freeways, so only need to check those.\n\nBut for freeway 7 and 8, at turn 9 and 10, no issue.\n\nBut earlier I saw that at T=12,13,14, there is collision on both, but I won't be there at those times.\n\nIn this plan, I leave by turn 10.\n\nBut let me confirm the span for freeway 8 at turn 10.\n\nT=10, k=1, span = [-23 +4*1, -12 +4*1] = [-19, -8], yes, all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for y=7 at T=9.\n\nBut what about the car on freeway 7? I am on it at turn 9, but span is [-23,-12], no 0.\n\nIs there any other car on freeway 7 or 8?\n\nFor freeway 7, only one car, similarly for 8.\n\nFreeway 7 has one car, freeway 8 has one car, both with same parameters.\n\nIn the table, freeway 7: (-12,-23,right,4), so one car.\n\nSimilarly for 8.\n\nSo no other cars.\n\nBut let me check freeway 6, but I don't go there, so irrelevant.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut the player is at (0,y), so only when on freeway y, and x=0 is in car span.\n\nIn this case, seems fine.\n\nBut the initial position is (0,7), and I need to reach (0,9).\n\nWith two U actions, I can be at (0,9) at turn 11.\n\nBut let me see if I need to consider something else.\n\nPerhaps I should check if at turn 9, when I am on y=7, is it safe, and turn 10 on y=8 safe.\n\nBut at turn 10, on y=8, span is [-19,-8], not including 0, so safe.\n\nBut let me calculate the values.\n\n-19 to -8, both less than 0, so 0 not in between.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut what about the car on freeway 5, but that's y=5, I'm not there.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car states.\n\nAnother thing: for freeway 2, there are two cars, but I won't be on y=2.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut in this path, I only touch y=7 and y=8.\n\ny=7 at turn 9, y=8 at turn 10.\n\nBoth safe at those times.\n\nThen at turn 11, y=9, done.\n\nSo minimal H should be 2, with actions U at turn 9, U at turn 10.\n\nBut the answer should be in a box.\n\nBut let me see if there is a reason I cannot do this.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that when I move to y=8 at turn 10, but at turn 10, I am on y=8, and the car span must not include 0.\n\nWhich it doesn't.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, at some other time, but I'm only there at turn 10.\n\nAnother thought: the collision is only when I am on the freeway, and at that exact turn, the car span includes 0.\n\nNot before or after.\n\nSo since at turn 10, on y=8, no car has 0 in span, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let me double-check the span calculation.\n\nFreeway 8 car: at t1=9, tau=-23, h=-12, s=4, right-moving.\n\nAt time T, span = [tau + s(T-9), h + s(T-9)] = [-23 + 4(T-9), -12 + 4(T-9)]\n\nAt T=10: [-23 +4(1), -12 +4(1)] = [-19, -8]\n\n-19 <= x <= -8, so x=0 is not in this, since 0 > -8? -8 < 0, so x=0 is greater than upper bound, not included.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9: [-23, -12], same.\n\nNow, when does it include 0? As I calculated, k=3,4,5: T=12,13,14.\n\nFor example, T=12: k=3, [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11, 0], and 0 is included, since upper bound is 0.\n\nSimilarly, T=13: [-23+16, -12+16] = [-7,4], includes 0.\n\nT=14: [-23+20, -12+20] = [-3,8], includes 0.\n\nBut I'm not there at those times.\n\nSo for my immediate move, it should be fine.\n\nBut the player is starting at turn 9, y=7.\n\nAction at turn 9: U, so at turn 10, y=8.\n\nThen at turn 10, I am on y=8, and I need to go to y=9.\n\nAction at turn 10: U, so at turn 11, y=9.\n\nAll safe.\n\nPerhaps I could stay or something, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo minimal H=2.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", but in this case H=2.\n\nBut let me see if there is any constraint I missed.\n\nAnother thing: the vertical axis y=0 to 9, and freeways y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I assume, so no cars, always safe.\n\nIn this case, y=9 is safe.\n\nPerhaps I should check if on freeway 7 or 8 at other times, but I don't need to.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me see the car on freeway 5, for example.\n\nFreeway 5: (12,47,left,36)\n\nLeft-moving, so at T, Span(T) = [h - s(T-9), tau - s(T-9)] = [12 - 36(T-9), 47 - 36(T-9)]\n\nBut since I'm not on y=5, irrelevant.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nFreeway 2 has two cars, but y=2, not relevant.\n\nSo I think with two U actions, I can reach.\n\nBut the initial position is (0,7), and I need to go to (0,9).\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nPerhaps I need to output the actions.\n\nBut the current turn is t1=9, so:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAnd H=2.\n\nBut is there a reason to wait? For example, if I stay at y=7, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nOr if I go down, but that would be away, so not minimal.\n\nSo H=2 should be minimal.\n\nBut let me see if at turn 9, on y=7, it is safe, which it is.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, at turn 10, it is safe, but let me confirm the time.\n\nTurn t1=9, current.\n\nAction at turn 9: U, so y_{10} =8\n\nThen at turn 10, I am on y=8.\n\nAction at turn 10: U, y_{11}=9.\n\nAt turn 10, on y=8, car span: as above, [-19,-8], not include 0.\n\nBut the car on freeway 8 is moving right, s=4, so at turn 10, it is at [-19,-8], which is left of 0, and moving right, but since 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if the car passes 0 at some point, but at turn 10, it's not there.\n\nAnother thing: the note says that if I move to a new freeway, at the turn I move, I am not on the new freeway yet.\n\nIn this case, when I move from y=7 to y=8 at turn 9, at turn 9 I am still on y=7, so I only check y=7 at turn 9.\n\nThen at turn 10, I am on y=8, so check y=8 at turn 10.\n\nNo issue.\n\nIf I were to stay at y=7 for multiple turns, I need to avoid when collision happens, but here not necessary.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me check if for y=8, at turn 10, is there any car? Yes, one car with span [-19,-8].\n\nBut what about other cars on y=8? Only one car listed.\n\nSimilarly for y=7.\n\nIn the table, freeway 8 has one car: (-12,-23,right,4)\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut for freeway 2, it has two cars, but for 7 and 8, only one each.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car state.\n\nFreeway 1: (0,-47,right,48) at t1=9, span [-47,0], which includes 0 at T=9? At T=9, for freeway 1, span [-47,0], and since it includes 0, if I were on y=1 at turn 9, I would collide, but I'm not, so irrelevant.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways have cars that may cover 0 at some time, but I'm not there.\n\nSo for my path, only y=7 and y=8 at turns 9 and 10 matter.\n\nBoth safe.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=2 with actions U at turn 9 and U at turn 10.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the sequence, for t from 0 to H-1, so t=0: turn t1 +0 =9, action U\n\nt=1: turn t1+1=10, action U\n\nThen at turn 11, y=9.\n\nIn the output, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  which is U for turn 9\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1} U for turn 10\n\nAnd H=2.\n\nBut the box should contain the actions.\n\nPerhaps I need to write it as per format.\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so for H=2, t=0 and t=1.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut let me see if there is any trick.\n\nAnother point: the car on freeway 7 and 8 are the same, but at different freeways.\n\nBut in terms of timing, since both have same parameters, but I only care when I am on them.\n\nAt turn 9, y=7, car not at 0.\n\nTurn 10, y=8, car not at 0.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to go through y=8 at a different time, but why, since I can go directly.\n\nMaybe if there was a collision at turn 10, but there isn't.\n\nBut let me calculate for y=8 at turn 10.\n\nT=10, t1=9, so Δt=1\n\nSpan: for right-moving car, tau + s*Δt = -23 +4*1 = -19\n\nh + s*Δt = -12 +4*1 = -8\n\nSo [ -19, -8 ], and since it's a closed interval, I think, includes endpoints, but -19 and -8 both negative, 0 not in between, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps the direction: right-moving, so head is at higher x, so at T=10, head at -8, tail at -19, so from x=-19 to x=-8, all left of 0.\n\nMoving right, but at T=10, not at 0.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2 with actions U and U.\n\nSo I should output that.\n\nBut the problem has multiple cars on some freeways, like freeway 2 has two, but for y=7 and 8, only one each.\n\nIn freeway 2, cars are (60,49,right,12) and (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nBut I don't care.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3,4,6,7,8.\n\nFreeway 3: (-21,-32,right,3)\n\nAt T, span = [ -32 +3(T-9), -21 +3(T-9) ] for right-moving.\n\nSet 0 in: -32 +3k <=0 <= -21 +3k, k=T-9\n\n-32+3k <=0 => 3k<=32 => k<=10.666, k<=10\n\n0 <= -21+3k => 3k>=21 => k>=7\n\nSo collision at T=16 to 10? k from 7 to 10, T=16,17,18,19.\n\nBut not relevant.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 same as 3? Freeway 4: (-21,-32,right,3) same as freeway 3, so same.\n\nFreeway 6: (-12,-23,right,4) same as 7 and 8.\n\nFreeway 6: at t1=9, car (-12,-23,right,4), so same as freeway 7 and 8.\n\nSo for y=6, collision when 0 in span: -23+4k <=0 <= -12+4k, so k>=3 and k<=5, T=12,13,14.\n\nBut again, not on y=6.\n\nFreeway 5: (12,47,left,36)\n\nLeft-moving, so Span(T) = [h - s(T-9), tau - s(T-9)] = [12 - 36(T-9), 47 - 36(T-9)]\n\nSet 0 in: 12 -36k <= 0 <= 47 -36k? Let k=T-9\n\nLower bound: 12 -36k <=0 => -36k <= -12 => 36k >=12 => k>=12/36=1/3, so k>=1\n\nUpper bound: 0 <= 47 -36k => 36k <=47 => k<=47/36≈1.305, so k<=1\n\nk>=1 and k<=1, so only k=1, T=10\n\nAt T=10, k=1, Span = [12 -36(1), 47 -36(1)] = [12-36, 47-36] = [-24,11]\n\n0 is in [-24,11], since -24<=0<=11.\n\nSo on freeway 5, at turn 10, if I were there, collision.\n\nBut I'm not on y=5 at turn 10, I'm on y=8 or something.\n\nIn my plan, I'm not on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, other times.\n\nBut for freeway 5, collision only at T=10, k=1.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nBut irrelevant for me.\n\nSo back to my point, with U at turn 9 and U at turn 10, I reach y=9 at turn 11, safe.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n\nBut the player position is given as (0,7) at turn t1=9.\n\nAnd actions.\n\nSo minimal H=2.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider if I can go faster, but I can't, since only ±1 per turn.\n\nOr if I go down, but that would be worse.\n\nSo H=2 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me write the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) without colliding with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-coordinate by +1, -1, or 0 per turn, respectively, with y constrained to [0, 9].\n- Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) only if the player is on freeway \\(y_T\\) and \\(x = 0\\) is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\).\n- At turn \\(T\\), if the player moves to a new freeway, they are not considered on the new freeway until turn \\(T+1\\).\n\n### Car States at Turn \\(t_1 = 9\\):\n- **Freeway 7**: One car with head \\(h = -12\\), tail \\(\\tau = -23\\), direction right, speed \\(s = 4\\).  \n  Span at turn \\(T\\): \\([\\tau + s(T-9), h + s(T-9)] = [-23 + 4(T-9), -12 + 4(T-9)]\\).  \n  Collision when \\(0 \\in [-23 + 4k, -12 + 4k]\\) for \\(k = T-9\\):  \n  \\(-23 + 4k \\leq 0 \\leq -12 + 4k\\) → \\(k \\geq 3\\) and \\(k \\leq 5\\) → Turns \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\).  \n  At turn \\(T = 9\\) (\\(k=0\\)): span \\([-23, -12]\\), 0 not included → safe.  \n  At turn \\(T = 10\\) (\\(k=1\\)): span \\([-19, -8]\\), 0 not included → safe.\n\n- **Freeway 8**: One car with head \\(h = -12\\), tail \\(\\tau = -23\\), direction right, speed \\(s = 4\\).  \n  Identical to freeway 7 car: span at turn \\(T\\) is \\([-23 + 4(T-9), -12 + 4(T-9)]\\).  \n  Collision at turns \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\).  \n  At turn \\(T = 10\\) (\\(k=1\\)): span \\([-19, -8]\\), 0 not included → safe.\n\n### Path to (0, 9) in Minimal Turns:\n- From (0, 7), reaching (0, 9) requires increasing y by 2, which takes at least 2 turns with two \"U\" actions.\n- **Plan**:  \n  - At turn 9: Action \\(a_9 = U\\), moving to y=8 at turn 10.  \n    - At turn 9, player is on freeway 7.

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 8) at turn t1 = 10. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. Since the player is at y=8 and needs to go to y=9, which is the top, and y=9 has no cars because cars are only on y=1 to y=8, according to the problem. The vertical axis is from y=0 to y=9, and freeways are y=1 to y=8, so y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\nThe player starts at (0,8) and wants to reach (0,9). Since y=9 has no cars, once the player is on y=9, they're safe. But to get there, they need to move from y=8 to y=9, which requires an 'U' action to go up by one.\n\nBut they have to avoid cars on the freeways. Specifically, when they are on a freeway y=k at turn T, they can be collided if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nNow, the collision rule: collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T. And note that when you move to a new y, you are not on that new y until the next turn. So if you move from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at turn T you are still on y_T, and at turn T+1 you are on y_{T+1}.\n\nThe player update is: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on action a_t.\n\nSo at time t, position is (0, y_t). Action a_t is taken at time t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nFor collision: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, if there is a car where 0 is in its span at time T, then collision.\n\nBut only for freeways y=1 to 8; y=0 and y=9 have no cars, I assume.\n\ny=0 might have something, but the problem says \"freeways y=1,...,8\" so probably y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=8, which is a freeway, so cars there.\n\nCurrent position at t1=10: (0,8)\n\nCar states at t1=10:\n\nFor each freeway, list of cars with (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (48,1,right,48) — head=48, tail=1, direction=right, speed=48\n\nSince direction right, span is [tail, head] = [1,48] at t1, I think? The notation says for right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] so tail τ, head h.\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but in the span definition, for right-moving, it says span(t1) = [τ, h] meaning [tail, head].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ] meaning [head, tail].\n\nIn the car update, for left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed), but for direction, it should be consistent.\n\nLet's look at freeway 1: (48,1,right,48) — so head=48, tail=1, direction=right, speed=48.\n\nSince direction right, at t1, span is [τ, h] = [1,48]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: two cars: (-48,-59,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=-48, tail=-59, direction=right, speed=12\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nSecond car: head=0, tail=-11, direction=right, speed=12, span at t1: [-11, 0]\n\nFreeway 3: (-18,-29,right,3) head=-18, tail=-29, right, speed=3, span: [-29,-18]\n\nFreeway 4: same as 3? (-18,-29,right,3) same as freeway 3? Probably different freeway.\n\nFreeway 5: (-24,11,left,36) head=-24, tail=11? That can't be right for left-moving.\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, head and tail: in the span, for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ], and h should be greater than τ or something? Let's see the update.\n\nFor left-moving: span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, positions decrease.\n\nIn this case, head=-24, tail=11, but -24 < 11, so if head is less than tail, that might be inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps the (head, tail) is always defined such that for left-moving, head is the leading part, which for left-moving, head should be smaller number.\n\nIn freeway 5: (-24,11,left,36) — head=-24, tail=11, direction left.\n\nSince direction left, at t1, span is [h, τ] = [-24, 11]? But -24 to 11, and moving left, so over time, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, head is larger.\n\nIn freeway 2, first car head=-48, tail=-59, so tail < head since -59 < -48.\n\nFor freeway 5, head=-24, tail=11, -24 < 11, so tail > head? That seems odd.\n\nLet's read the car state table:\n\nIt says: Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor right-moving, it should be tail < head, I think, because span is [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nFor left-moving, span is [h, τ] with h > τ? No.\n\nIn the update:\n\nFor left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → moves left, so h and τ decrease.\n\nIf h and τ, with h > τ, then [h, τ] would be decreasing, but [h, τ] with h > τ is from higher to lower, like from right to left.\n\nFor example, freeway 5: head=-24, tail=11, direction left.\n\nSo at t1, span is [h, τ] = [-24, 11]. Since left-moving, as time increases, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, like freeway 1: head=48, tail=1, direction right, span [1,48], moves right, both increase.\n\nNow, the key point for collision: at any turn T, for a car, if 0 is in the span at that time.\n\nSpan is a continuous interval, I assume, so if 0 is between the min and max of the span.\n\nFor a right-moving car, span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nFor left-moving, span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd collision if player is on that freeway at turn T and 0 in span(T) for that car.\n\nPlayer is at (0, y_T) at turn T, so for freeway y_T, we check the cars there.\n\nNow, player starts at t1=10, y=8.\n\nWe need to find actions to go to y=9 as fast as possible, but avoiding collisions on the way.\n\nSince y=9 is the target and has no cars, once we reach y=9, we're done.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=8, we need to move up, so action 'U' at some turn, which will set y_{t+1} = y_t + 1.\n\nBut at the turn when we are on y=8, we might be at risk if there is a car on y=8 that has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay or move down, but we need to go up eventually.\n\nFirst, let's list the car states at t1=10 for each freeway, and then for future turns.\n\nt1=10\n\nFreeway 1: one car, right-moving, span at t1: [1,48], speed 48. So at time T, span = [1 + 48(T-10), 48 + 48(T-10)] = [48(T-10) +1, 48(T-10) +48]\n\n0 in span if 48(T-10) +1 <= 0 <= 48(T-10) +48\n\nSince 48(T-10) +1 >0 for T>=10, and increases, 0 is never in span for T>=10, because min is at least 1 at T=10, and larger later. So no collision on freeway 1 for T>=10.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12) so head=-48? tail=-59, direction right, speed 12.\n\nAt t1, span: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt T, span: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-59 + 12(T-10), -48 + 12(T-10)]\n\n0 in this span if -59 +12(T-10) <= 0 <= -48 +12(T-10)\n\nLeft: -59 +12(T-10) <= 0 => 12(T-10) <= 59 => T-10 <= 59/12 = 4.916, so T <= 10 + 4.916 = 14.916, so T <= 14 since integer\n\nRight: 0 <= -48 +12(T-10) => 48 <= 12(T-10) => T-10 >= 48/12 = 4, so T >= 14\n\nThus for T=14, 0 in span? Left: -59 +12(4) = -59+48= -11 <=0, right: -48+48=0 <=0, so 0 <=0 is true, so at T=14, span min=-11, max=0, so 0 is included.\n\nAt T=14, -59 +12(4) = -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, so span [-11,0], so 0 is in it.\n\nSimilarly, for T<14, min <0 but max<0? At T=13, T-10=3, min=-59+36= -23, max=-48+36= -12, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nT=15, min=-59+60=1, max=-48+60=12, both positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=14 for this car.\n\nBut there is another car on freeway 2: (0,-11,right,12) head=0, tail=-11, direction right, speed 12.\n\nAt t1, span: [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T, span: [-11 +12(T-10), 0 +12(T-10)] = [12(T-10) -11, 12(T-10)]\n\n0 in span if 12(T-10) -11 <= 0 <= 12(T-10)\n\nLeft: 12(T-10) -11 <=0 => 12(T-10) <=11 => T-10 <= 11/12 <1, so T<=10 since integer, T=10.\n\nAt T=10, left: 12(0)-11= -11<=0, right:0<=0, so 0 in span.\n\nFor T>10, min = 12(T-10)-11 > -11 but since T>10, min > -11? At T=11, min=12(1)-11=1>0, so min>0, 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, at T=10, min=-11<=0<=0, yes.\n\nSo for freeway 2, at T=10, the second car has span [-11,0], so 0 is in it.\n\nAnd at T=14, the first car has span that includes 0.\n\nBut for the player, at turn T, if on freeway 2.\n\nNow, t1=10, player is at y=8, not on freeway 2.\n\nWe need for freeway 8, since player starts at y=8.\n\nFreeway 8: (-8,-19,right,4) head=-8, tail=-19, direction right, speed 4.\n\nAt t1, span: [τ, h] = [-19, -8]\n\nAt T, span: [-19 +4(T-10), -8 +4(T-10)]\n\n0 in span if -19 +4(T-10) <= 0 <= -8 +4(T-10)\n\nLeft: -19 +4(T-10) <=0 => 4(T-10) <=19 => T-10 <=19/4=4.75, T<=14.75, so T<=14\n\nRight: 0 <= -8 +4(T-10) => 8 <=4(T-10) => T-10 >=2, T>=12\n\nThus for T=12,13,14.\n\nAt T=12: min= -19 +4(2)= -19+8= -11 <=0, max= -8+8=0 <=0? 0<=0 true, span [-11,0]\n\nAt T=13: min=-19+12= -7? 4(3)=12, min=-19+12=-7, max=-8+12=4, so -7<=0<=4, yes.\n\nT=14: min=-19+16= -3, max=-8+16=8, -3<=0<=8 yes.\n\nT=11: min=-19+4= -15, max=-8+4= -4, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nT=15: min=-19+20=1, max=-8+20=12, both positive, no.\n\nSo on freeway 8, car spans include 0 at T=12,13,14.\n\nNow, player is at y=8 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, position (0,8), so on freeway 8 at turn 10.\n\nIs there a car on freeway 8 at t=10 with 0 in span? At t=10, for freeway 8, car span [-19,-8], min=-19, max=-8, both <0, so 0 not in span, so no collision at t=10.\n\nBut we need to take actions.\n\nPlayer wants to go to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: at turn 10, we can choose a_{10} which affects y_{11}.\n\nIf we do nothing, stay at y=8, or move up to y=9, or move down to y=7.\n\nBut moving down might not be helpful since we need to go up.\n\ny=7 is also a freeway, so we need to check cars there.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can directly move up at t=10.\n\nAction at t=10: if a_{10} = U, then y_{11} = y_{10} +1 = 8+1=9.\n\nAt turn t=10, player is on y=8, no collision as above.\n\nAfter action, at turn t=11, player is at y=9.\n\nAt turn t=11, position (0,9), but y=9 has no cars, so no collision possible.\n\nAnd we reached y=9 at turn 11.\n\nt=10 to t=11, in one turn.\n\nBut is that possible? We need to check if during the move, but the collision is only considered at the turn when you are on the freeway.\n\nSpecifically, at turn T, you are on y_T, and we check for that y_T.\n\nWhen you move from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at turn T you are on y_T, so if collision on y_T at turn T, it happens.\n\nThen at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, check for that.\n\nIn this case, at turn t=10, on y=8, no collision.\n\nAction a_{10} = U, so at turn t=11, y_{11} =9, on y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nSo in one action, we reach the goal.\n\nBut is there a problem? The player is at (0,8) at t=10, and we move to (0,9) at t=11.\n\nBut on freeway 8, at turn t=10, no car has 0 in span, as we saw, span is [-19,-8], all negative, so 0 not occupied.\n\nAnd at t=11, player is on y=9, safe.\n\nSo why would we need more turns? Perhaps for other freeways, but we don't go to them.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 has car at t=10: span [-19,-8], so positions from -19 to -8, all left of 0, so 0 is not covered, no car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, at other turns, but we are not staying.\n\nIn this case, it seems we can go directly.\n\nBut let's check the other freeways to see if there is any constraint, but since we are only on y=8 at t=10 and y=9 at t=11, no other freeways involved.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no cars, safe.\n\nThe target is to reach (0,9), which we do at t=11.\n\nBut the sequence is from t=10 to when we reach, so H turns, starting from t=10, actions at t=10, t=11, ..., until we reach.\n\nIn this case, at t=10, we take action U, which sets y_{11}=9.\n\nThen at turn t=11, we are at (0,9), so we have reached.\n\nBut do we need to take action at t=11? The action sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, and after H actions, we are at turn t1+H.\n\nLet's see the task.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nReach at turn t1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} , so t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter these H actions, the position is y_{t1 + H}, because y_{t+1} depends on a_t.\n\nAt time t1, position y_{t1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, position y_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nAfter action a_{t1+H-1}, position y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} =9? No.\n\nThe reach condition: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nFrom the task: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAnd the sequence is {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAt turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, we take action.\n\nAfter all actions, at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1+H}, but we care about the position at the turn when we have the action or after.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then actions at t1 only, and we want y_{t1 +1 -1} = y_{t1} =9? But at t1, player is at y=8, not 9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIf H=1, y_{t1 +1 -1} = y_{t1} =8 ≠9.\n\nIf H=2, y_{t1 +2 -1} = y_{t1 +1} =9.\n\nAnd actions at t1 and t1+1.\n\nBut at t1+1, we take action, but the position y_{t1+1} is after action at t1.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T is determined.\n\nAction a_T is taken at turn T, which sets y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, position is y_{T+1}.\n\nWe want at some turn, position y_T =9 for T= t1 + H -1.\n\nFor T= t1 + H -1, y_T =9.\n\nThe actions are from turn t1 to t1+H-1, so for t from t1 to t1+H-1, we take a_t.\n\nThen at turn t1+H-1, we take a_{t1+H-1}, which affects y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut y_{t1+H} is the position after the last action.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9, which is the position at turn t1+H-1, before action a_{t1+H-1}? No.\n\nPosition at turn T is y_T, which is the position at the start of turn T, before action a_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, we move to y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nSo at turn T, position y_T, then we take action a_T, then at turn T+1, position y_{T+1}.\n\nWe want for some turn, y_T =9.\n\nThe turn when we reach is t1 + H -1, so y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAnd we take actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1.\n\nFor example, if we reach at turn t1, but y_{t1}=8≠9, so not.\n\nIf we reach at turn t1+1, y_{t1+1}=9.\n\nThen H-1 =1? t1 + H -1 = t1+1 implies H-1=1, so H=2.\n\nActions at t1 and t1+1.\n\nBut at turn t1+1, we take action, but position at turn t1+1 is y_{t1+1}=9, which is already the target, so we don't need to take action at turn t1+1 if we have reached, but the sequence includes actions up to t1+H-1.\n\nIf y_{t1+1}=9 at turn t1+1, then we have reached at turn t1+1.\n\nWe take action at t1 to go from y_{t1}=8 to y_{t1+1}=9.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, we are at position, and since we have reached, we don't need to do anything else, but the action sequence includes a_{t1+1} as well? No.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for H=2, t=0 and t=1, actions at t1 and t1+1.\n\nBut at turn t1+1, if we are already at y=9, taking an action might move us away, but we need to stay or something.\n\nThe minimal H should be such that we reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nFor H=1, y_{t1+1-1}=y_{t1}=8≠9\n\nFor H=2, y_{t1+2-1}=y_{t1+1}, which we want to be 9.\n\nAnd actions at t1 and t1+1.\n\nAt t1, we take action to set y_{t1+1}, so if we take U at t1, y_{t1+1}=9.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, we are at y=9, but we need to take action a_{t1+1}, which could be S to stay, since y=9 is safe.\n\nIf we take S, y_{t1+2}=y_{t1+1}=9, but we don't care about later, as long as at turn t1+1, we have y=9.\n\nAfter taking a_{t1+1}, we have y_{t1+2}, but we only care that at turn t1+1, y=9.\n\nSo at turn t1+1, position is 9, reached.\n\nAnd we take action at t1+1, but it doesn't affect the position at that turn.\n\nSimilarly, we could take any action at t1+1, since y=9, moving up or down might go out of bound, but y=9, if U, y=10, but y=9 is max, so y_{t+1} = min(max(y_t + Δy, 0),9), so at y=9, U or S keep it at 9, D would go to 8.\n\nBut since we are at y=9 at turn t1+1, we can take S to stay.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=2, we need two actions: a_{t1} and a_{t1+1}.\n\na_{t1} = U to go to 9, then a_{t1+1} = S to stay, or U or D, but to be safe, S is fine.\n\nBut in this case, we reach at turn t1+1.\n\nNow, back to the car situation.\n\nAt t1=10, on y=8, no collision.\n\nThen action U, so at turn 11, on y=9, no cars.\n\nBut is there a car on freeway 8 at other times? But we are not on it at other times.\n\nUnless we stay.\n\nBut we can go directly.\n\nBut let's check freeway 9, but no freeway, so safe.\n\nPerhaps for y=8 at t=10, it is safe, and we can move.\n\nBut let's see the car on freeway 8: at t=10, span [-19,-8], all negative, so x=0 not occupied.\n\nAt t=11, if we were to be on y=8, but we move away.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut why is the player at y=8, which is a freeway, and we need to go to y=9.\n\nPerhaps there is a car coming to x=0 on y=8 at some turn, but at t=10, it's safe, and we leave immediately.\n\nIn this case, H=2, actions: at t1=10, U; at t1+1=11, S or something.\n\nBut let's see if we can do with H=1, but H=1, we need y_{t1} =9, but it is 8, impossible.\n\nSo minimal H=2.\n\nBut perhaps we need to consider if moving up causes collision or something, but the collision is based on position at the turn, not during move.\n\nThe problem says: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in Span(T) but not in Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut in this case, at turn T, you are on y_T, so only check cars on y_T.\n\nWhen you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, so cars on y_T at turn T matter.\n\nAt turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1 matter.\n\nNo issue for moving.\n\nSo for going from y=8 to y=9 at turn 10: at turn 10, on y=8, no collision; move to y=9 at turn 11, no collision on y=9.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nBut let's check the other freeways to see if there is a reason we cannot.\n\nFreeway 2 has cars that have 0 at t=10 and t=14, but we are not on freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: (-24,11,left,36) head=-24, tail=11, direction left, speed 36.\n\nAt t1, span [h, τ] = [-24, 11] for left-moving.\n\nAt T, span [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [-24 -36(T-10), 11 -36(T-10)]\n\n0 in span if -24 -36(T-10) <= 0 <= 11 -36(T-10)\n\nLeft: -24 -36(T-10) <=0 always true for T>=10? -24 -36(0) = -24<=0 true, and decreases, so always true for T>=10.\n\nRight: 0 <= 11 -36(T-10) => 36(T-10) <=11 => T-10 <= 11/36 <1, so T=10.\n\nAt T=10, 0 <=11 true.\n\nFor T>10, right inequality false.\n\nSo at T=10, 0 in span for freeway 5? But player not on it.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nFreeway 6: (-8,-19,right,4) similar to 8, but on y=6.\n\nNot relevant.\n\nSo for our plan, it seems we can go directly.\n\nBut the player is at (0,8) and wants to reach (0,9), so moving up is the way.\n\nPerhaps there is a car on y=8 at t=10 that I missed, but no.\n\nFreeway 8 has one car with span [-19,-8] at t=10, so x from -19 to -8, not including 0.\n\nAnd at future turns, it moves right, so min and max increase, so at t=12, min=-11, max=0, so 0 included, but at t=12, if we are on y=8, it would be collision, but we are not, since we move at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, at t=11, if we were on y=8, min=-19+4(1)= -15, max=-8+4= -4, both negative, 0 not in, so safe even if we stayed, but we don't.\n\nSo I think moving up at t=10 is fine.\n\nThen H=2, actions: at t=10, U; at t=11, since we are at y=9, we need to take an action, say S.\n\nBut at turn t=11, we are at position, and we take action, but the position at turn t=11 is y=9, which is the target for turn t1+H-1.\n\nFor H=2, t1+H-1 =10+2-1=11, y_{11}=9.\n\nAction sequence: a_{10} = U, a_{11} = S (or U or D, but S is safe).\n\nIn the answer, we need to specify the actions.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach faster, but H=2 is minimal since from 8 to 9 takes at least one step.\n\nH is the number of turns for the sequence, but we reach at turn 11 with H=2.\n\nPerhaps H=1, but impossible.\n\nSo I think this is it.\n\nBut the problem might be that at turn t=10, on y=8, is there any car? Freeway 8 has only one car, with span not including 0.\n\nBut let's list all freeways to be sure.\n\nFreeway 1: no issue, as before.\n\nFreeway 2: at t=10, second car has span [-11,0], so 0 included, so if player on freeway 2 at t=10, collision, but player on y=8, not 2.\n\nFreeway 3: (-18,-29,right,3) at t1 span [-29,-18], at T: [-29+3(T-10), -18+3(T-10)]\n\n0 in if -29+3(T-10) <=0 <= -18+3(T-10)\n\nLeft: -29+3(T-10)<=0 => 3(T-10)<=29 => T-10<=29/3≈9.666, T<=19.666\n\nRight: 0<=-18+3(T-10) => 18<=3(T-10) => T-10>=6, T>=16\n\nSo for T=16 to 19, 0 in span, but not at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 same as 3? Freeway 4: (-18,-29,right,3) same as freeway 3, so same.\n\nFreeway 5: at t=10, 0 in span, as above.\n\nFreeway 6: (-8,-19,right,4) similar to freeway 8.\n\nAt t1, span [-19,-8], at T: [-19+4(T-10), -8+4(T-10)]\n\n0 in if -19+4(T-10)<=0<=-8+4(T-10)\n\nLeft: -19+4(T-10)<=0 =>4(T-10)<=19=>T-10<=4.75, T<=14\n\nRight: 0<=-8+4(T-10) =>8<=4(T-10) =>T-10>=2, T>=12\n\nSo T=12,13,14.\n\nFreeway 7 same as 6 and 8? Freeway 7: (-8,-19,right,4) same as 6 and 8.\n\nFreeway 7: (-8,-19,right,4) same as 8.\n\nIn table:\n\nFreeway 6: (-8,-19,right,4)\n\nFreeway 7: (-8,-19,right,4)\n\nFreeway 8: (-8,-19,right,4)\n\nAll the same? But different freeways.\n\nFor y=6,7,8, each has a car with same parameters? But position might be different, but in this case, all have head=-8, tail=-19 at t1, so same span at each turn for their respective freeways.\n\nBut for player, we care about y=8 at t=10.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus, moving up directly should work.\n\nPerhaps the player can move at t=10 to y=9 immediately.\n\nBut let's see the position: player at (0,8), action U to (0,9) at next turn.\n\nNo collision.\n\nMaybe the problem is that y=9 might not be reachable directly due to cars, but no cars on y=9.\n\nSo I think H=2 with actions U at t1, and S at t1+1.\n\nBut in the sequence, for t1+1, we need to specify an action, but since we have reached, S is fine.\n\nTo minimize H, H=2 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at turn t1, but impossible.\n\nSo I think this is the answer.\n\nBut let's write it.\n\nCurrent turn t1=10, player position (0,8)\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 10: U  (to go up)\n\nThen at turn 11, position (0,9), reached.\n\nThen action at turn 11, say S.\n\nSo sequence: a_{10} = U, a_{11} = S\n\nH=2.\n\nIn the boxed answer.\n\nBut the answer format should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nFor H=2, two actions.\n\nBut at turn 11, after taking S, we are still at (0,9), but the position at turn 11 is already 9 before action, but action doesn't change it.\n\nYes.\n\nTo be precise, after a_{10}=U, y_{11}=9.\n\nAt turn 11, position y_{11}=9, so we have reached at turn 11.\n\nThen we take a_{11}, which can be S.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps we can have H=1, but not possible.\n\nSo minimal H=2.\n\nBut let's see if there is any car that could affect.\n\nAnother thing: when we move, at the moment of move, but the collision is only checked at integer turns, I think.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the action sequence is:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut in the output, it should be in the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbering.\n\nt1=10, so Turn 10: U, Turn 11: S\n\nAnd H=2.\n\nBut the sequence is from t=0 to H-1 relative, but in the answer, it's listed as Turn t_1: etc.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8, at t=10, the car is moving, but at t=10, position is fixed.\n\nI think I overcomplicate.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- At turn 10, the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\).\n- The car on freeway 8 at turn 10 has a span of \\([-19, -8]\\) (right-moving, speed 4). Since both endpoints are negative, \\(x = 0\\) is not in the span, so no collision occurs at turn 10.\n- By taking action \\(U\\) (up) at turn 10, the player moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n- At turn 11, the player is at \\(y = 9\\), which has no cars (as freeways are only \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)), so it is safe.\n- Thus, the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 11, which corresponds to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 10 + H - 1 = 11\\), so \\(H = 2\\).\n- At turn 11, since the player is already at the target position, action \\(S\\) (stay) is taken to remain at \\(y = 9\\), but any action (\\(U\\), \\(D\\), or \\(S\\)) would keep the player at \\(y = 9\\) or within bounds (due to the grid constraint \\(y \\in [0, 9]\\)), and \\(S\\) is chosen for simplicity.\n\n### Minimal Sequence:\n- \\(H = 2\\) turns.\n- Actions:\n  - At turn 10: \\(a_{10} = U\\) to move from \\(y = 8\\) to \\(y = 9\\).\n  - At turn 11: \\(a_{11} = S\\) to stay at \\(y = 9\\) (position reached at turn 11).\n\n### Verification:\n- Turn 10: Player at (0, 8), action \\(U\\) sets \\(y_{11} = 8 + 1 = 9\\). No collision on \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10.\n- Turn 11: Player at (0, 9), action \\(S\\) sets \\(y_{12} = 9\\) (but not relevant as position (0, 9) is reached at turn 11).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in the minimal \\(H = 2\\) turns without collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: S\n}",
