        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 through y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays, and the cars move left or right at constant speeds. Collision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and there's a car on that freeway where 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car positions over time. The current turn is t_1 = 0.\n\nLet me list out the cars for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nSince they're all right-moving with speed 6, the span at time T is [τ + 6(T - t_1), h + 6(T - t_1)] because for right-moving, it's [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] where ΔT = T - t_1.\n\nt_1 is 0, so ΔT = T.\n\nSo for a right-moving car with head h, tail τ, speed s, at time T, span is [τ + sT, h + sT].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h - sT, τ - sT], but all cars here are right-moving except... let me check.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFreeway 1: all right, speed 6\n\nFreeway 2: same as 1? \" (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6) \" for k=1,2,3 all have this.\n\nk=1,2,3 have identical cars: three cars each with those positions.\n\nThen k=4,5,6,7 have: (-48,-59,right,6), (0,-11,right,6)\n\nAnd k=8 has: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4) but with speed 4.\n\nAll are right-moving, no left-moving mentioned.\n\nIn the car update, it says left-moving and right-moving, but in this state, all are right-moving.\n\nFor right-moving, span at T is [τ + sT, h + sT], since head is at h, which is larger I assume? In the notation, for right-moving, it says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" so τ is tail, h is head, and since it's moving right, head is to the right, so h > τ.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head is to the left, h < τ, but here all are right-moving.\n\nIn freeway 4,5,6,7: (-48,-59,right,6), here h=-48, τ=-59, so since right-moving, h should be greater than τ, but -48 > -59, yes.\n\nSimilarly, (0,-11,right,6), h=0, τ=-11, 0 > -11.\n\nFor k=8, (48,37,right,4), h=48, τ=37, 48>37.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at time T.\n\nThe span includes the positions where the car is, so if 0 is between τ + sT and h + sT inclusive for right-moving cars.\n\nSince it's a closed interval, I assume.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at t=0.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0, no cars, so no collision possible. Similarly, y=9 is the goal, no cars there.\n\nThe player needs to reach (0,9), which is y=9, so once there, no issue.\n\nBut during the path, when on y=1 to 8, need to avoid times when cars are at x=0.\n\nNow, the player moves vertically only, so x is always 0.\n\nSo for each freeway y, I need to find times when there is no car covering x=0.\n\nThat is, for each y, find times T where for all cars on that freeway, 0 is not in their span at T.\n\nSince collision happens if any car has 0 in span, so to be safe, we need that for all cars on that row, 0 not in span.\n\nNow, let's list the cars for each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: cars: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nAt time T, spans:\n\nCar1: [37 + 6T, 48 + 6T]\n\nCar2: [1 + 6T, 12 + 6T]\n\nCar3: [-35 + 6T, -24 + 6T]\n\n0 is in car1 span if 37+6T ≤ 0 ≤ 48+6T\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut since we need 0 not in any, we need for each car, 0 not in their interval.\n\nSo for car1: 0 not in [37+6T, 48+6T] which is always true for T≥0? 37+6T ≥37>0 for T≥0, so 0 < 37+6T ≤ left endpoint, so 0 is always less than left endpoint, so never in interval since interval starts at 37+6T >0.\n\n37+6T at T=0 is 37>0, and increases, so yes, min is 37, so 0 is always left of the interval, so never covered by car1.\n\nSimilarly, car3: [-35+6T, -24+6T]\n\nAt T=0, -35 to -24, both negative, so 0 not in.\n\nWhen does it cover 0? When -35+6T ≤ 0 ≤ -24+6T\n\n0 ≤ -24+6T ⇒ 6T ≥24 ⇒ T≥4\n\nAnd -35+6T ≤0 ⇒ 6T ≤35 ⇒ T≤35/6≈5.833, so T=5 or 6? T integer since turns.\n\nT is integer, turns.\n\nSo for car3, 0 in span when T=5,6? Let's compute:\n\nAt T=5: -35+30= -5, -24+30=6, so [-5,6], 0 is in it.\n\nAt T=6: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in, since 1>0.\n\n-24+6T at T=5: -24+30=6, so [ -35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6], yes 0 in.\n\nAt T=6: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 1>0, 0 not in.\n\nAt T=4: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], -11≤0≤0, so 0 is in, since inclusive.\n\n[ -11, 0] includes 0.\n\nSimilarly, T=5: [-5,6] includes 0.\n\nT=6: [1,12] does not include 0.\n\nNow car2: [1+6T, 12+6T]\n\nAt T=0: [1,12], 1>0? 1 to 12, 0 not in since min=1>0.\n\nAlways 1+6T ≥1>0, so left endpoint >0, so 0 never in car2 span.\n\nSimilarly car1 always not covering 0.\n\nSo for freeway 1, only car3 can cover 0, at T=4 and T=5.\n\nAt T=4: [ -11, 0] includes 0\n\nT=5: [-5,6] includes 0\n\nOther times not.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1, because cars identical, so same times unsafe: T=4 and T=5.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3: same.\n\nNow freeway 4: cars (-48,-59,right,6), (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: h=-48, τ=-59, right, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [ -59 + 6T, -48 + 6T ]\n\nSecond car: h=0, τ=-11, s=6, span [ -11 + 6T, 0 + 6T ] = [ -11 + 6T, 6T ]\n\nNow, 0 in first car span: -59 + 6T ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 6T\n\n0 ≤ -48 + 6T ⇒ 6T ≥48 ⇒ T≥8\n\n-59+6T ≤0 ⇒ 6T ≤59 ⇒ T≤59/6≈9.833, so T=9,10? T integer.\n\nAt T=8: -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, so [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nT=9: -59+54= -5, -48+54=6, [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nT=10: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], not include 0.\n\nNow second car: [ -11 + 6T, 6T ]\n\n0 in this span: since 6T is the right end, and -11+6T ≤ 6T always, 0 in if -11+6T ≤ 0 ≤ 6T\n\n0 ≤ 6T always for T≥0.\n\n-11+6T ≤0 ⇒ 6T ≤11 ⇒ T≤11/6≈1.833, so T=0,1? T=0: [ -11, 0], includes 0.\n\nT=1: [ -11+6, 6] = [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nT=2: [ -11+12, 12] = [1,12], not include 0.\n\nSo for freeway 4:\n\nFirst car unsafe at T=8,9\n\nSecond car unsafe at T=0,1\n\nSo overall, unsafe when either car covers 0, so T=0,1 (from car2) and T=8,9 (from car1)\n\nT=2 to 7 should be safe? T=2: car1 span [-59+12, -48+12]=[-47,-36], both negative, 0 not in. Car2 [1,12], 0 not in. So yes.\n\nT=3: car1 [-59+18, -48+18]=[-41,-30], car2 [-11+18,18]=[7,18], both not cover 0.\n\nSimilarly up to T=7.\n\nT=7: car1 [-59+42, -48+42]=[-17,-6], car2 [-11+42,42]=[31,42], not cover 0.\n\nT=8: car1 [-11,0], car2 [-11+48,48]=[37,48], car1 covers 0.\n\nT=9: car1 [-5,6], car2 [43,54], car1 covers 0.\n\nT=10: car1 [1,12], car2 [49,60], no cover.\n\nSo unsafe at T=0,1,8,9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as 4, so unsafe T=0,1,8,9\n\nFreeway 6: same, unsafe T=0,1,8,9\n\nFreeway 7: same, unsafe T=0,1,8,9\n\nNow freeway 8: different, cars (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4) with speed 4.\n\nSo s=4.\n\nFirst car: span [37+4T, 48+4T], always >0, never cover 0.\n\nSecond car: [1+4T, 12+4T], always >0, never cover 0.\n\nThird car: [-35+4T, -24+4T]\n\n0 in span if -35+4T ≤ 0 ≤ -24+4T\n\n0 ≤ -24+4T ⇒ 4T ≥24 ⇒ T≥6\n\n-35+4T ≤0 ⇒ 4T ≤35 ⇒ T≤8.75, so T=7,8? T integer.\n\nAt T=6: -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, so [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nT=7: -35+28= -7, -24+28=4, [-7,4], includes 0.\n\nT=8: -35+32= -3, -24+32=8, [-3,8], includes 0.\n\nT=9: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, [1,12], not include 0.\n\nAnd T=6,7,8 cover 0.\n\nT=5: -35+20= -15, -24+20= -4, [-15,-4], both neg, 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 8, unsafe at T=6,7,8.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the unsafe times when player cannot be there:\n\ny=1: unsafe T=4,5\n\ny=2: same, T=4,5\n\ny=3: same, T=4,5\n\ny=4: unsafe T=0,1,8,9\n\ny=5: same, T=0,1,8,9\n\ny=6: same, T=0,1,8,9\n\ny=7: same, T=0,1,8,9\n\ny=8: unsafe T=6,7,8\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at t=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 in minimal turns.\n\nPlayer can move U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, 0, with y clamped to [0,9].\n\nSince we start at 0 and need to go to 9, we probably want to go up as much as possible, but need to avoid unsafe times on the rows.\n\nThe key point is that when you move, you are on a row at a specific turn.\n\nFor example, at turn T, you are at position y_T.\n\nIf you move from y to y+1 at turn T, that means at turn T, you are on row y, and you decide to go up, so at turn T+1, you are on y+1.\n\nBut for collision, at turn T, you are on row y_T, and we check if that row has a car covering x=0 at time T.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at time T, even if they cover 0 at T.\n\nBut at time T, you are on y_T, so you care only about cars on y_T at time T.\n\nThen at time T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so you care about cars on y_{T+1} at time T+1.\n\nSo the row you are on at time T must be safe at time T.\n\nNow, we start at t=0, y=0.\n\ny=0 is safe always, since no cars.\n\nWe need to end at y=9 at some turn H, so at turn H, we are on y=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, the minimal H: since we need to go from y=0 to y=9, at least 9 moves up, but we can stay or go down, but that would increase turns, so minimal should be achieved by going up as much as possible, but avoiding unsafe rows at unsafe times.\n\nSince we can stay or move down, but moving down would require more moves to go up later, so it might not be minimal. Probably we only move up or stay, but staying might be necessary to wait.\n\nMoving down might be useful to avoid, but in this case, since the unsafe times are specific, and rows above might have different times, but going down from low row might not help to reach high row faster.\n\nFor example, from y=0, to go to y=1, we need to be at y=1 at some time when it is safe.\n\nSimilarly for each step.\n\nThe player position at time T is y_T, which depends on the actions.\n\nLet t be the turn number from start, t=0,1,2,...\n\nAt t=0, y=0.\n\nAfter each action, y changes.\n\nThe turn when we are on a row matters.\n\nTo minimize turns, we want to reach y=9 asap.\n\nThe direct way: go up every turn, but need to check if at each step, the row is safe at that time.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0, safe.\n\nThen, at t=1, if we go up, y=1.\n\nBut at t=1, is y=1 safe?\n\ny=1 unsafe at t=4,5 only, at t=1, it should be safe? From above, for y=1, unsafe at T=4,5, so at T=1, safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can go up to y=2 at t=2, y=3 at t=3.\n\nAt t=4, if we go to y=4, but y=4 at t=4: is it safe?\n\ny=4 unsafe at T=0,1,8,9. T=4 is not in 0,1,8,9, so should be safe? T=4, from above, for y=4, unsafe at 0,1,8,9, so T=4 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at t=5: y=5 unsafe at T=0,1,8,9, t=5 not in, safe.\n\ny=6 at t=6: y=6 unsafe at T=0,1,8,9, t=6 not in, safe.\n\ny=7 at t=7: y=7 unsafe at T=0,1,8,9, t=7 not in, safe.\n\nNow y=8 at t=8: y=8 unsafe at T=6,7,8. t=8 is unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt t=8, if we are on y=8, it is unsafe.\n\nIf we go to y=8 at t=8, collision.\n\nBut we are at t=7, y=7 (if we went straight up).\n\nAt t=7, y=7, which is safe, as above.\n\nThen we want to go to y=8 at t=8, but y=8 at t=8 is unsafe.\n\nWe could stay at y=7 for another turn, but at t=8, if we stay, y=7, and y=7 at t=8: is it safe?\n\ny=7 unsafe at T=8? T=8 is in 8,9? y=7 unsafe at T=0,1,8,9.\n\nT=8 is unsafe for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, if on y=7, it is unsafe.\n\nWhat about going down? But we are at y=7, going down to y=6 at t=8.\n\ny=6 at t=8: y=6 unsafe at T=0,1,8,9, so t=8 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, all rows from 4 to 7 are unsafe at t=8.\n\ny=1,2,3: y=1 unsafe only at t=4,5, so at t=8 safe.\n\nBut we are at y=7 at t=7, which is safe, but at t=8, if we go to y=8, unsafe; if stay y=7, unsafe; if down to y=6, unsafe.\n\nAll options unsafe at t=8 for rows 4-7.\n\nBut y=1,2,3 are safe at t=8, but we are at y=7, too far.\n\nWe need to not be on rows 4-7 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly at t=9, y=4-7 unsafe, y=8 unsafe at t=6,7,8, but t=9: y=8 unsafe at T=6,7,8, so t=9 should be safe? T=9 not in 6,7,8, so safe.\n\ny=8 unsafe T=6,7,8, so T=9 safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=1,2,3 safe at t=9.\n\ny=4-7 unsafe at t=9.\n\nBut let's list the safe times for each row.\n\nFor row y, the times when it is safe to be on that row.\n\ny=1: safe except t=4,5 → safe at t=0,1,2,3,6,7,8,9,...\n\ny=2: same as y=1\n\ny=3: same\n\ny=4: unsafe t=0,1,8,9 → safe for t=2,3,4,5,6,7,10,...\n\nSimilarly y=5,6,7 same as y=4\n\ny=8: unsafe t=6,7,8 → safe for t=0,1,2,3,4,5,9,10,...\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nWe start at t=0, y=0, safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some t.\n\ny=9 always safe.\n\nThe minimal t to reach y=9 is at least 9, if we go up every turn.\n\nBut at t=8, if we are to be at y=8, it is unsafe, so we cannot be at y=8 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, if we go straight up:\n\nt=0: y=0, safe\n\nt=1: y=1, safe (since y=1 safe at t=1)\n\nt=2: y=2, safe\n\nt=3: y=3, safe\n\nt=4: y=4, safe? y=4 safe at t=4? t=4 is 4, which is not 0,1,8,9, so yes, safe.\n\nt=5: y=5, safe? t=5 not 0,1,8,9, safe.\n\nt=6: y=6, safe? t=6 not 0,1,8,9, safe.\n\nt=7: y=7, safe? t=7 not 0,1,8,9, safe.\n\nt=8: now, if we go to y=8, y=8 unsafe at t=8.\n\nIf we stay at y=7, but y=7 at t=8 unsafe, as above.\n\nIf we go down to y=6, y=6 unsafe at t=8.\n\nAll not possible.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=7 at t=7 and then move at t=8, because whatever we do, at t=8 we are on a row between 4 and 8 or something, but y=8 is row 8, which is unsafe, and rows 4-7 are all unsafe at t=8.\n\nThe only rows safe at t=8 are y=1,2,3 and y=9, but y=9 not reached yet, and y=0, but we are at y=7.\n\nSo from y=7 at t=7, we are stuck at t=8.\n\nTherefore, going straight up doesn't work because at t=8 we hit a problem.\n\nWe need to adjust the path to avoid being on rows 4-7 at t=8 or t=9, but t=9 is also unsafe for y=4-7.\n\nSpecifically, we need to be on a safe row at each turn.\n\nSince we start from bottom, we can go slower or faster to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at t=8, rows 1,2,3,8,9 are safe, but y=8 at t=8 is unsafe, y=8 safe at t=9, etc.\n\ny=8 safe at t=9, as above.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=8 earlier or later.\n\nMinimal H: we need at least 9 turns to go from y=0 to y=9 with only up, but since we may need to wait, H might be more.\n\nBut let's see possible paths.\n\nFirst, list the constraints.\n\nDenote the time when we first reach each row or something.\n\nSince the unsafe times are periodic or clustered, we can go up quickly to a safe row before t=4 or after t=9, but t=4 and 5 are unsafe for y=1,2,3, but we can be there at other times.\n\nFor y=1,2,3, they are unsafe only at t=4,5, so we can be on them before or after.\n\nSimilarly, y=4-7 unsafe at t=0,1,8,9, so safe between t=2 to 7.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=6,7,8, safe before and after.\n\nNow, to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nWe need to cross each row at some safe time.\n\nBut since we can stay, we can be on a row for multiple turns.\n\nBut to minimize time, we want to move up as much as possible.\n\nBut at certain times, we might need to wait on a safe row.\n\nNow, from t=0 to t=7, we can be on low rows or high rows, but the critical point is t=8 and t=9.\n\nSpecifically, at t=8, if we are on y=1,2,3, it is safe, or y=9, but not y=4-8 except y=8 is unsafe.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=8.\n\nSimilarly at t=9, y=1,2,3 safe, y=8 safe (since t=9 not 6,7,8), y=9 safe, y=4-7 unsafe.\n\nSo at t=8, we can be on y=1,2,3 or perhaps y=0 but y=0 is not freeway, always safe, but we start from there.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, let's think about when we can be on y=8.\n\ny=8 is safe except t=6,7,8.\n\nSo we can be on y=8 at t<=5 or t>=9.\n\nSimilarly, y=7: safe except when? y=7 unsafe at t=0,1,8,9, so safe at t=2,3,4,5,6,7.\n\nt=6 and7 are safe for y=7.\n\ny=7 safe at t=2 to7.\n\nBut at t=8, unsafe.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to be on y=8 at some point before going to y=9.\n\nThe time when we are on y=8 must be safe.\n\nSo we can be on y=8 at t<=5 or t>=9.\n\nIf we reach y=8 early, say at t=5, then at t=6 we can go to y=9.\n\nBut we need to get to y=8 by t=5.\n\nFrom start, can we reach y=8 by t=5?\n\nAt t=0, y=0\n\nt=1, y=1 (if up)\n\nt=2, y=2\n\nt=3, y=3\n\nt=4, y=4\n\nt=5, y=5\n\nAt t=5, y=5, which is safe? y=5 at t=5: unsafe? y=4-7 unsafe at t=0,1,8,9, t=5 not in, so safe.\n\nBut we are at y=5 at t=5, not y=8.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=5, we need to have moved faster.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=5, we can increase y by at most 5 (since 5 moves), so at t=5, y<=5, cannot be y=8.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at t=5 is impossible, since max y at t=5 is 5.\n\nSimilarly, t=4, y<=4; t=3, y<=3, etc.\n\nSo we cannot reach y=8 at t<=5, because by t=5, we can be at most y=5.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=8 is t=8, but at t=8, y=8 is unsafe.\n\nAt t=8, if we could be at y=8, but unsafe, so we cannot be there at t=8.\n\nNext, we can be at y=8 at t=9 or later.\n\nBut at t=9, y=8 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can be at y=8 at t=9, then go to y=9 at t=10.\n\nBut H would be 10 or more.\n\nBut we can reach earlier? Minimal might be 10.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach by t=9.\n\nAt t=9, if we are at y=9, that would be good.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at t=9, we need to be at y=8 at t=8, but y=8 at t=8 unsafe, so we cannot be at y=8 at t=8 to go up to y=9 at t=9.\n\nIf we are at y=8 at t=9, then at t=10 we can be at y=9.\n\nBut at t=9, we can be at y=9 directly if we were at y=8 at t=8, but not possible.\n\nSo the earliest to reach y=9 is at t=10, by being at y=8 at t=9, then up to y=9 at t=10.\n\nNow, can we be at y=8 at t=9?\n\nYes, and it is safe.\n\nNow, we need to get to y=8 by t=9.\n\nBut at t=9, we can be at y=8.\n\nNow, from start, we need to reach y=8 at some point.\n\nBut we can reach earlier and wait, but to minimize time, we want to arrive at t=9.\n\nNow, to be at y=8 at t=9, we need to have y increasing.\n\nNow, during the path, we need to be on safe rows at each time.\n\nSpecifically, for t=8, we need to be on a safe row at t=8.\n\nSafe rows at t=8: y=1,2,3 (since y=1,2,3 safe at t=8), and y=0, y=9, but y=9 not yet.\n\ny=1,2,3 safe at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, safe rows: y=1,2,3,8,9 (y=4-7 unsafe).\n\nNow, we need to go from y=0 at t=0 to y=8 at t=9 or something.\n\nLet's plan the path backwards or forwards.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 by minimal H.\n\nSince we must avoid t=8 for y=4-8 except y=8 is unsafe, and y=4-7 unsafe.\n\nAt t=8, we should be on y=1,2, or 3.\n\nSimilarly at t=9, we can be on y=8 or y=9.\n\nBut to reach y=9, if at t=9 we are on y=8, then at t=10 y=9.\n\nIf at t=9 we are on y=9, better, but not possible since need to come from y=8 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nSo likely H=10, with y=9 at t=10.\n\nNow, at t=9, we should be at y=8, which is safe.\n\nAt t=8, we should be at a safe row, which can be y=1,2,3.\n\nFrom y=1,2,3 at t=8, we need to reach y=8 at t=9.\n\nBut from y=3 to y=8 in one step? Impossible, max change per turn is 1.\n\ny can only change by -1,0,1 per turn.\n\nSo from y=3 at t=8, at t=9 we can be at y=2,3,4.\n\nBut y=4 at t=9 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if at y=2 at t=8, t=9 y=1,2,3.\n\nBut we need y=8 at t=9.\n\nSo how to reach y=8 at t=9?\n\nWe need to be at y=8 at t=9, so we must come from y=7, y=8, or y=9 at t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, y=7 is unsafe (since y=7 unsafe at t=8), y=8 unsafe, y=9 not reached.\n\ny=7 at t=8: unsafe, cannot be there.\n\ny=8 at t=8: unsafe, cannot be there.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=8 at t=9, because to be at y=8 at t=9, we must have been at y=7,8, or9 at t=8, but none are safe at t=8.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be at y=8 at t=9.\n\nSimilarly, if we want to be at y=9 at t=10, we need to be at y=8 at t=9.\n\nBut if we cannot be at y=8 at t=9, then we cannot reach y=9 at t=10.\n\nWe need to be at y=8 at some other time.\n\ny=8 can be safe at t=9, but we cannot be there at t=9 because we cannot arrive there from t=8.\n\nThe only way to be at y=8 at t=9 is to have been on y=8 at t=8 and stay, or from y=7 or y=9 at t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, y=7 and y=8 are both unsafe, so we cannot be on them.\n\ny=9 not reached.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be at y=8 at t=9.\n\nSimilarly, for any t, to be at y=8 at time T, we need to have been at y=7,8,9 at time T-1.\n\nBut at times when y=8 is safe, like T=9, but at T-1=8, y=7 and y=8 are unsafe, so we cannot be there to move to y=8 at T=9.\n\nThe safe times for y=8 are t<=5 or t>=9.\n\nFor t<=5, we can reach, but as before, at t=5, max y=5, so we can be at y=5 at t=5, not y=8.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=8 for t<=5.\n\nFor t>=9, but to be at y=8 at t=9, we need to be at y=7,8,9 at t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, y=7 unsafe, y=8 unsafe, y=9 not reached.\n\nSo no way to be at y=8 at t=9.\n\nSimilarly at t=10, to be at y=8 at t=10, we can come from y=7,8,9 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, y=7 is unsafe (y=4-7 unsafe at t=9), y=8 is safe, y=9 safe.\n\nSo we can be at y=8 at t=9 and stay to y=8 at t=10, or from y=7 at t=9, but y=7 unsafe at t=9, cannot be there.\n\nOr from y=9 at t=9, down to y=8 at t=10, but we want to go up, not down.\n\nBut possible.\n\nSo to be at y=8 at t=10, we can come from:\n\n- at t=9, on y=8, and stay S, so at t=10 y=8\n\n- at t=9, on y=7, and go up to y=8 at t=10, but y=7 unsafe at t=9\n\n- at t=9, on y=9, and go down to y=8 at t=10\n\nSince y=9 is safe, we can be there and go down, but that seems inefficient.\n\nWe can be at y=8 at t=9 and stay.\n\nBut we cannot be at y=8 at t=9, as above.\n\nThe only way is to be at y=8 at t=10 from y=9 at t=9, but that means we reached y=9 earlier, at t=9.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at t=9, we need to be at y=8 at t=8, which is unsafe, impossible.\n\nSo we are stuck.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=8 at t=5 or earlier, but impossible as max y at t=5 is 5.\n\nLet's list the possible y at each time with safety.\n\nFor example, at t=0: y=0 safe\n\nt=1: can be y=0,1\n\ny=1 safe at t=1\n\nt=2: y=0,1,2\n\ny=2 safe\n\nt=3: y=0,1,2,3\n\ny=3 safe at t=3\n\nt=4: y=0,1,2,3,4\n\ny=1,2,3 unsafe at t=4? y=1 unsafe at t=4,5\n\nAt t=4, y=1 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly y=2,3 unsafe at t=4.\n\ny=4 safe at t=4? y=4 unsafe at t=0,1,8,9, so t=4 safe.\n\nSo at t=4, possible y: 0,1,2,3,4 but y=1,2,3 unsafe, so only y=0 or y=4 safe.\n\ny=0 always safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=5: y=0,1,2,3,4,5\n\ny=1,2,3 unsafe (since t=5 unsafe for them)\n\ny=4 and y=5 safe? y=5 unsafe at t=0,1,8,9, t=5 not in, safe.\n\ny=4 safe.\n\nSo safe y at t=5: 0,4,5\n\nt=6: y=0 to6\n\ny=1,2,3 safe at t=6? y=1 safe except t=4,5, so t=6 safe.\n\nSimilarly y=2,3 safe.\n\ny=4,5,6,7 all safe at t=6? y=4 safe at t=6, yes.\n\ny=6 safe at t=6, yes.\n\ny=7 safe at t=6, yes.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=6,7,8, so at t=6 unsafe.\n\nSo at t=6, safe y: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\n\ny=8 unsafe.\n\nt=7: y=0 to7 or8, but y=8 unsafe.\n\ny=1,2,3 safe\n\ny=4,5,6,7 safe (since t=7 not 0,1,8,9 for y=4-7)\n\ny=8 unsafe.\n\nSo safe: y=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\n\nt=8: y=0 to8\n\ny=1,2,3 safe\n\ny=4,5,6,7 unsafe (since t=8 unsafe for them)\n\ny=8 unsafe\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe but y=9 not reached.\n\nSo only safe y at t=8: 0,1,2,3\n\nt=9: y=0 to9\n\ny=1,2,3 safe\n\ny=4,5,6,7 unsafe\n\ny=8 safe (t=9 not 6,7,8)\n\ny=9 safe\n\nSo safe y at t=9: 0,1,2,3,8,9\n\nt=10: similarly, all rows safe except possibly, but let's see later.\n\nNow, we start from y=0 at t=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some t.\n\nAt t=9, we can be at y=9 directly if we can reach it.\n\nTo be at y=9 at t=9, we need to be at y=8 at t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, y=8 is unsafe, so we cannot be at y=8 at t=8.\n\nTherefore, impossible to be at y=9 at t=9.\n\nSimilarly, at t=10, to be at y=9, we need to be at y=8 or y=9 at t=9.\n\nIf at y=9 at t=9, then stay or something, but we can be at y=9 at t=9 only if we were at y=8 at t=8, impossible.\n\nSo we must be at y=8 at t=9, then go up to y=9 at t=10.\n\nBut at t=9, we can be at y=8, which is safe.\n\nNow, how to be at y=8 at t=9.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=9, we need to be at y=7,8,9 at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, possible safe y: only 0,1,2,3.\n\nNone of which are 7,8,9.\n\nSo from y=1,2,3 at t=8, at t=9 we can go to y=0,1,2,3,4 but y=4 at t=9 unsafe, so only to y=0,1,2,3.\n\nCannot reach y=8 from there in one step.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be at y=8 at t=9.\n\nThus, we cannot reach y=9 at t=10 via y=8 at t=9.\n\nSimilarly, for later times, the problem persists.\n\nFor example, at t=10, to be at y=8, we can come from y=7,8,9 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, safe y: 1,2,3,8,9\n\nSo we can be at y=8 or y=9 at t=9, then to y=8 at t=10.\n\nBut we want to go to y=9, not stay at y=8.\n\nBut if we are at y=9 at t=9, we can stay or go down, but to reach y=9, we can be there.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at t=9, we need y=8 at t=8, impossible.\n\nSo the earliest we can be at y=9 is at t=10, by being at y=8 at t=9 and then up.\n\nBut we cannot be at y=8 at t=9.\n\nSo how about at t=11 or later.\n\nLet's try to be at y=8 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, y=8 is safe? y=8 unsafe at t=6,7,8, so t=10 safe.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=10, we come from t=9 on y=7,8,9.\n\nAt t=9, safe y: 1,2,3,8,9\n\nSo possible: on y=8 at t=9, then stay to y=8 at t=10.\n\nOr on y=9 at t=9, down to y=8 at t=10.\n\nOr on y=7 at t=9, but y=7 unsafe at t=9, cannot.\n\nSo we can be at y=8 at t=10 from y=8 at t=9 or from y=9 at t=9.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=9, we still have the problem.\n\nFrom above, at t=9, we can be at y=8, which is safe, but how to get there?\n\nFrom t=8, we can only be at y=1,2,3, and from there at t=9 we can only be at y=0,1,2,3,4 but y=4 unsafe, so y=0,1,2,3.\n\nCannot reach y=8.\n\nUnless we are at higher y earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=7, we can be at y=7, which is safe.\n\nFrom y=7 at t=7, we can go to y=6,7,8 at t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, y=6,7 are unsafe, y=8 unsafe, so no safe option.\n\nIf we go to y=8 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nOr stay y=7, unsafe.\n\nOr down to y=6, unsafe.\n\nAll unsafe.\n\nSo from t=7, we cannot move to t=8 on a safe row except low rows, but we are at high row.\n\nThe only way is to be at a low row at t=8.\n\nBut to be at a low row at t=8, we need to have moved down earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=7, instead of being at y=7, we can be at lower y.\n\nBut we want to go up, so we may have to waste some moves to go down and then up.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=6, we are at y=3, which is safe at t=6.\n\nThen at t=7, we can go to y=4, which is safe at t=7.\n\nThen at t=8, from y=4, we can go to y=3,4,5 but y=4 and y=5 unsafe at t=8, y=3 safe.\n\nSo go down to y=3 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=9, from y=3, we can go to y=2,3,4 but y=4 unsafe at t=9, so only y=2 or 3 or stay.\n\nBut we need to reach y=8.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=9, we can only go to y=2,3,4, not higher.\n\nSo it will take many turns to go up from there.\n\nFor example, from t=9 y=3, to reach y=8, it takes at least 5 turns: to y=4 at t=10, but y=4 at t=10: is it safe? y=4 unsafe at t=8,9, but t=10 not, so safe, then y=5 at t=11, safe, y=6 at t=12, safe, y=7 at t=13, safe, y=8 at t=14, then y=9 at t=15.\n\nBut this is late, and we can do better.\n\nSince at t=9, we can be at y=8 directly if we can get there.\n\nBut we can't from low rows.\n\nAnother idea: be at y=8 at t=5, but impossible.\n\nOr at t=9, but can't arrive.\n\nPerhaps stay at lower rows longer.\n\nFor example, stay at y=0 for some turns, but that delays.\n\nLet's list a possible path that works.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nAt t=1, go U to y=1 (safe at t=1)\n\nAt t=2, go U to y=2 (safe)\n\nAt t=3, go U to y=3 (safe)\n\nAt t=4, now at t=4, y=3 is unsafe, so we cannot be at y=3 at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, safe y are only y=0 and y=4.\n\nSince we are at y=3 at t=3, we can go to y=4 at t=4, which is safe.\n\nYes.\n\nSo at t=3, y=3\n\nThen at t=4, go U to y=4, safe.\n\nAt t=5, go U to y=5, safe (t=5 not 0,1,8,9)\n\nAt t=6, go U to y=6, safe\n\nAt t=7, go U to y=7, safe\n\nNow at t=7, y=7\n\nt=8 coming, we need to move, but whatever we do, at t=8 we are on unsafe row.\n\nSo instead, at t=7, we can go down or something.\n\nBut at t=7, y=7 is safe, but if we go down to y=6 at t=8, y=6 unsafe at t=8.\n\nNot good.\n\nPerhaps at t=6, instead of going to y=6, we stay or go down.\n\nFor example, at t=5, we are at y=5.\n\nAt t=6, we can go to y=6, or stay y=5, or down to y=4.\n\nAll safe at t=6.\n\nBut if we stay or go down, we are lower, then at t=7, we can go to y=7, etc., but still at t=8 problem.\n\nUnless we are at y=3 at t=8.\n\nSo let's plan to be at y=3 at t=8.\n\nFrom start:\n\nt=0: y=0\n\nt=1: U to y=1\n\nt=2: U to y=2\n\nt=3: U to y=3\n\nt=4: now at t=4, if we stay at y=3, unsafe, so we must go to y=4.\n\nGo U to y=4\n\nt=5: U to y=5\n\nt=6: now, instead of U, we go D to y=4, for example.\n\nAt t=6, y=4 safe.\n\nThen at t=7, from y=4, we can go U to y=5, or stay, or D to y=3.\n\ny=5 at t=7 safe.\n\nBut if we go to y=5 at t=7, then at t=8, y=5 unsafe.\n\nIf at t=7 we go D to y=3, then at t=8, y=3 safe.\n\nYes.\n\nSo:\n\nt=6: from y=5, go D to y=4 (action at t=6: D, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, so at turn t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nAt turn t, we perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nBut the position at turn t is y_t, and collision is checked at turn t based on y_t.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn T, position y_T.\n\nAction a_t is taken at turn t, affecting y_{t+1}.\n\nFor the path, we need y_T for each turn T.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Delta y_0, and so on.\n\nFor collision at turn T, we have y_T and check if on freeway, cars at that time.\n\nBack to path.\n\nAt t=0, y=0, safe. Action a_0: let's say U, so y_1 = 1.\n\nAt t=1, y=1, safe (t=1 not 4,5 for y=1). Action a_1: U, y_2=2\n\nt=2, y=2, safe, a_2: U, y_3=3\n\nt=3, y=3, safe (t=3 not 4,5), a_3: U, so y_4 =4\n\nt=4, y=4, safe (t=4 not 0,1,8,9 for y=4), a_4: U, y_5=5\n\nt=5, y=5, safe, a_5: U, y_6=6\n\nt=6, y=6, safe, now action a_6: if we do U, y_7=7\n\nBut then at t=7, y=7, safe, but then at t=8, if we do U, y_8=8, unsafe; S, y_8=7, unsafe; D, y_8=6, unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\nSo at t=6, instead of U, we do D, so a_6: D, then y_7 = y_6 -1 = 6-1=5\n\nAt t=7, y=5, which is safe at t=7? y=5 unsafe at t=0,1,8,9, t=7 not in, safe.\n\nThen action a_7: we can do D to y=4, or S to y=5, or U to y=6.\n\nBut we need to be at safe row at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, safe rows are y=1,2,3.\n\nSo from y=5 at t=7, we can go D to y=4, but y=4 at t=8 unsafe.\n\nGo S to y=5, unsafe.\n\nGo U to y=6, unsafe.\n\nAll lead to unsafe at t=8.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt t=6, do S, stay at y=6.\n\nThen at t=7, y=6, safe, then a_7: D to y=5, or S, or U to y=7.\n\nThen at t=8, y=5,6,7 all unsafe.\n\nSame.\n\nSo from y=6 at t=6, we cannot reach a safe row at t=8.\n\nWe need to be lower at t=6.\n\nFor example, at t=5, we are at y=5.\n\nInstead of going to y=6 at t=6, we go down.\n\na_5: not U, but D or S.\n\nAt t=5, y=5, safe.\n\nAction a_5: if D, then y_6 =4\n\nOr S, y_6=5\n\nOr U, y_6=6\n\nNow, at t=6, if y=4, safe, or y=5, safe, or y=6 safe.\n\nBut we need to get to y=1,2,3 at t=8.\n\nFrom t=6, we have two turns to t=8.\n\nFor example, if at t=6, y=4.\n\nThen a_6: actions to y=3,4,5 at t=7.\n\nAt t=7, y=3,4,5 all safe.\n\nThen from there, to t=8.\n\nAt t=7, if y=3, then a_7: to y=2,3,4 at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, y=2,3 safe (y=4 unsafe)\n\nIf at t=7 y=4, a_7 to y=3,4,5 at t=8, only y=3 safe.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=7 y=5, to y=4,5,6 at t=8, all unsafe except possibly, y=4,5,6 all unsafe at t=8.\n\nSo only if we are at y=3 at t=7, then at t=8 we can be at y=3 (safe) or y=2 (safe) or y=4 unsafe.\n\nSo possible to be at y=2 or 3 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=6 we are at y=5, then at t=7 we can be at y=4,5,6.\n\nThen at t=8, from y=4: to y=3,4,5; only y=3 safe\n\nFrom y=5: to y=4,5,6; all unsafe\n\nFrom y=6: to y=5,6,7; all unsafe\n\nSo only if we go to y=4 at t=7, then to y=3 at t=8.\n\nBut y=4 at t=7 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=6 y=6, then at t=7 to y=5,6,7, then to t=8, all unsafe or not reach safe.\n\nSo best to be at y=4 or lower at t=6.\n\nBut let's set to be at y=3 at t=8.\n\nFrom above, one way: at t=6, be at y=4.\n\nHow to be at y=4 at t=6.\n\nFrom start, we can go up to y=4 by t=4 or later.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=0: y=0, a_0: U, y_1=1\n\nt=1: y=1, a_1: U, y_2=2\n\nt=2: y=2, a_2: U, y_3=3\n\nt=3: y=3, a_3: U, y_4=4\n\nt=4: y=4, a_4: U, y_5=5\n\nt=5: y=5, now instead of U, do D, a_5: D, so y_6=4\n\nAt t=6, y=4, safe.\n\nThen a_6: we can go D to y=3, or S to y=4, or U to y=5.\n\nWe want to be at y=3 at t=7 for later.\n\nAt t=7, y=3 is safe.\n\nSo a_6: D to y=3\n\nThen at t=7, y=3, safe.\n\nThen a_7: S to y=3 or D to y=2 or U to y=4.\n\nAt t=8, we need to be on safe row, y=2 or 3.\n\nSo if S, y_8=3 safe; or D to y=2 safe; or U to y=4 unsafe.\n\nSo can stay or down.\n\nSay a_7: S, so y_8=3\n\nAt t=8, y=3, safe.\n\nNow at t=9, from y=3, a_8: actions to y=2,3,4 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, y=2 and y=3 are safe, y=4 unsafe.\n\nAlso, y=8 and y=9 are safe.\n\nBut from y=3, we can only go to y=2,3,4.\n\nTo reach y=8, we need to go up, but slowly.\n\nFor example, a_8: U to y=4, but y=4 at t=9 unsafe, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nSo must stay or down, a_8: S to y=3 or D to y=2.\n\nSay S, y_9=3\n\nAt t=9, y=3, safe.\n\nThen a_9: U to y=4 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, y=4, is it safe? y=4 unsafe at t=0,1,8,9, t=10 not in, safe.\n\nThen a_10: U to y=5 at t=11, safe\n\na_11: U to y=6 at t=12, safe\n\na_12: U to y=7 at t=13, safe\n\na_13: U to y=8 at t=14, now y=8 at t=14: safe? y=8 unsafe at t=6,7,8, t=14 not in, safe.\n\nThen a_14: U to y=9 at t=15.\n\nSo we reach at t=15, with H=15 turns? But we start from t=0 to t=15, so 16 positions, but turns from 0 to 15, 16 turns? Let's see.\n\nThe turn when we are at y=9 is t=15.\n\nNumber of turns from start: we have actions from t=0 to t=14, 15 actions, and position at t=15.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think H is the number of actions or the time.\n\nThe problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nt_1 =0, so actions from t=0 to H-1, and after H actions, at turn H, we are at (0,9).\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\" let's see.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nIn the task: \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nt_1=0, so y_{H-1} =9.\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions at t=0, then y_1 = y_0 + Delta, if U, y_1=1, not 9.\n\nMinimal H to reach y=9.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=9, with only up, H=9 actions, y_9=9.\n\nBut here not possible directly.\n\nIn the above path, we reached at t=15, so y_15=9, so H-1=15, H=16.\n\nBut that seems long, and we can do better.\n\nAt t=9, we can be at y=8 or 9 if we were higher, but we are low.\n\nSince at t=9, we can be at y=8, which is safe, but how to get there earlier.\n\nFor example, after being at y=3 at t=8, instead of staying, but we can only go to low rows.\n\nPerhaps we can go up faster at the beginning or slower.\n\nAnother idea: at t=4, we are at y=4.\n\nInstead of going up, we can stay or go down.\n\nBut that seems worse.\n\nOr at t=0, stay for some turns.\n\nBut let's list the safe times again.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, since we can be on it at t=9, but we can't arrive at t=9, but we can be on it at t=10 or later.\n\nFor example, at t=10, y=8 safe.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=10, from t=9 on y=7,8,9.\n\nAt t=9, safe y: 1,2,3,8,9\n\nSo we can be on y=8 at t=9, then stay to y=8 at t=10.\n\nOr on y=9 at t=9, down to y=8 at t=10.\n\nOr on y=7 not possible.\n\nSo we need to be on y=8 or y=9 at t=9.\n\nHow to be on y=8 at t=9.\n\nIf we can be on y=8 at t=9, it is safe, but how to get there.\n\nFrom t=8, we can only be on y=1,2,3 at t=8, and from there to t=9, we can only be on y=0,1,2,3.\n\nUnless we are on y=8 at t=8, but unsafe.\n\nSo the only way is to be on y=8 at t=9 by having been on y=8 at t=8 and stayed, but unsafe at t=8.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be on y=8 at t=9.\n\nSimilarly, impossible to be on y=9 at t=9.\n\nSo for t=9, we can only be on y=1,2,3,8,9 but y=8 and y=9 are only possible if we were there at t=8, which we can't, so in practice, at t=9, we can only be on y=1,2,3 from the low path.\n\nThen from there, we can go up slowly.\n\nBut to reach y=8 faster, we need to be higher at earlier times when possible.\n\nFor example, at t=7, we can be at y=7, safe.\n\nBut from y=7 at t=7, we cannot go to a safe row at t=8 except by going to low rows, but we can't in one step.\n\nThe closest safe row at t=8 is y=3, which is 4 steps down, not efficient.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=3 at t=7, then at t=8 y=3 safe, then at t=9 we can go to y=4, but y=4 at t=9 unsafe, so we must stay or down, so we are stuck at low rows until t=10.\n\nAt t=10, we can go to y=4, safe, etc.\n\nBut let's calculate the minimal time.\n\nSuppose we go up to y=7 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=8, we must move to a safe row, but the only safe rows are y=1,2,3, so we need to be there at t=8, but from y=7 at t=7, to reach y=3 at t=8, we need to go down 4 steps, impossible.\n\nMax down one step, so from y=7 at t=7, at t=8 we can be at y=6,7,8, all unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot reach a safe row at t=8 from y=7 at t=7.\n\nSimilarly from y=6 at t=7, to y=5,6,7 at t=8, all unsafe.\n\nFrom y=5 at t=7, to y=4,5,6 at t=8, all unsafe.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=7, to y=3,4,5 at t=8; y=3 is safe, so we can go to y=3 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, from lower.\n\nSo to be safe at t=8, we must be at y<=3 at t=7, so that we can go to y=2 or 3 at t=8.\n\nFor example, at t=7, be at y=3 or 4.\n\nIf at y=4 at t=7, we can go D to y=3 at t=8.\n\nIf at y=3 at t=7, we can go S to y=3 or D to y=2 at t=8.\n\nThen from there, at t=9, we can go to y=4 at t=10, etc.\n\nBut the earliest to reach y=9 is from y=8 at t=14 as before.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach y=8 earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=9, we can be at y=8 if we were there, but we can't.\n\nAt t=10, we can be at y=8.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=10, from t=9 on y=7,8,9.\n\nAt t=9, we can be on y=8 or y=9.\n\nIf on y=8 at t=9, then stay to y=8 at t=10.\n\nBut how to be on y=8 at t=9? Impossible.\n\nIf on y=9 at t=9, then down to y=8 at t=10, but to be on y=9 at t=9, need y=8 at t=8, impossible.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=8 at t=10 either from this.\n\nFrom t=9, we can be on y=3, for example, then at t=10 go to y=4, t=11 y=5, t=12 y=6, t=13 y=7, t=14 y=8, t=15 y=9.\n\nH-1=15, H=16.\n\nBut let's confirm with the down path I had earlier.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nt=0: y=0, a0=U, y1=1\n\nt=1: y=1, a1=U, y2=2\n\nt=2: y=2, a2=U, y3=3\n\nt=3: y=3, a3=U, y4=4\n\nt=4: y=4, a4=U, y5=5\n\nt=5: y=5, a5=D, y6=4  (action D at t=5)\n\nt=6: y=4, a6=D, y7=3  (action D at t=6)\n\nt=7: y=3, a7=S, y8=3  (action S at t=7)\n\nt=8: y=3, safe, a8=S, y9=3  (action S at t=8)\n\nt=9: y=3, safe, a9=U, y10=4\n\nt=10: y=4, safe, a10=U, y11=5\n\nt=11: y=5, safe, a11=U, y12=6\n\nt=12: y=6, safe, a12=U, y13=7\n\nt=13: y=7, safe, a13=U, y14=8\n\nt=14: y=8, safe (t=14 not 6,7,8), a14=U, y15=9\n\nSo at t=15, y=9, so H-1=15, thus H=16.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=14, 15 actions.\n\nSequence: U,U,U,U,D,D,S,S,U,U,U,U,U,U,U\n\nBut we can optimize.\n\nAt t=7, we are at y=3, instead of staying, we could go up, but at t=8, if we go to y=4, unsafe.\n\nSo must stay or down.\n\nSimilarly at t=8, stay at y=3.\n\nThen at t=9, we go up to y=4 at t=10? At t=9, if we go U, y10=4, but at t=10, not at t=9.\n\nAction at t=9 determines y10.\n\nAt t=9, y=3, a9=U, then y10=4.\n\nBut at t=9, we are at y=3, safe, and we can choose action.\n\nBut to go up, we have to go to y=4 at t=10, which is safe, but we lose a turn.\n\nIs there a way to be higher at t=9?\n\nFor example, if at t=7, we are at y=4, then a7=D to y=3 at t=8, same as above.\n\nOr at t=6, if we are at y=5, then a6=D to y=4 at t=7, then a7=D to y=3 at t=8, then same.\n\nBut at t=5, we are at y=5, instead of going down, we can stay or go up, but then at t=6 y=6, then we have to go down later.\n\nFor example, t=5: y=5, a5=S, y6=5\n\nt=6: y=5, safe, a6=D, y7=4\n\nt=7: y=4, safe, a7=D, y8=3\n\nt=8: y=3, safe, a8=U, but to y=4 at t=9? a8 action at t=8 determines y9.\n\na8=U, then y9=4\n\nBut at t=9, y=4, unsafe! Collision.\n\nBecause y=4 unsafe at t=9.\n\nSo at t=9, we cannot be at y=4.\n\nIn the path, when we go to y=4 at t=10, it is safe.\n\nIn the first path, at t=9, we are at y=3, a9=U, to y=4 at t=10, safe.\n\nIf at t=8, we do U, y9=4, but at t=9, y=4 unsafe, so cannot.\n\nSo we must not be on y=4 at t=9.\n\nSimilarly, in the path, we stay at y=3 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nAt t=9, we can be at y=3, safe.\n\nThen only at t=10 we go to y=4.\n\nSo the path is fixed in that regard.\n\nBut we can reach y=7 earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=7, we can be at y=7, but then we have to go down to y=3 at t=8, but from y=7 to y=3 in one step impossible.\n\nSo we cannot, so the down path is necessary.\n\nPerhaps at the beginning, we stay at y=0 for some turns, but that would delay reaching high rows.\n\nFor example, if at t=0, we stay, y1=0, then at t=1 y=0 or1, etc., but we will reach y=5 later, so t=8 will be at lower y, but then after t=8, we can go up, but still, from low y to y=9 takes time.\n\nFor example, suppose we stay at y=0 until t=3.\n\nt=0: S, y1=0\n\nt=1: S, y2=0\n\nt=2: S, y3=0\n\nt=3: U, y4=1\n\nt=4: now at t=4, y=1 unsafe, so we cannot be at y=1 at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, safe y are y=0 and y=4.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=3, we can go to y=0 or1 at t=4.\n\nIf to y=1, unsafe; to y=0, safe.\n\nThen later, we can go up, but it will take more turns.\n\nFor example, at t=4, y=0, a4=U, y5=1\n\nt=5: y=1, but t=5 unsafe for y=1, so cannot.\n\nAt t=5, safe y are y=0,4,5.\n\nIf at t=4, we are at y=0, a4=U, to y=1 at t=5, unsafe.\n\nIf a4=S, to y=0 at t=5, safe.\n\nThen at t=5, y=0, a5=U, to y=1 at t=6.\n\nt=6: y=1, safe, a6=U, y7=2\n\nt=7: y=2, safe, a7=U, y8=3\n\nt=8: y=3, safe, same as before, then we need to go up from there, reaching y=9 at t=15 or later.\n\nWorse than going up fast initially.\n\nSo the first path is better.\n\nBut in the first path, we reached at t=15 with H=16.\n\nBut perhaps we can reduce the waiting.\n\nFor example, at t=7, we are at y=3, and at t=8 y=3, t=9 y=3.\n\nBut at t=9, we can go to y=4 immediately if it were safe, but not.\n\nNotice that at t=9, y=8 is safe, and if we can be there, but we can't from low.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=6, we can be at y=7, for example.\n\nt=6: y=7 safe.\n\nThen at t=7, y=7 safe.\n\nBut at t=8, we must leave to safe row.\n\nBut we can go to y=8, unsafe, or down.\n\nBut down to y=6 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8, the cars are different.\n\nFreeway 8 has speed 4, unsafe at t=6,7,8.\n\nBut at t=5, if we can be at y=8, impossible.\n\nI think we have to accept H=16.\n\nBut let's check if we can reach at t=10.\n\nSuppose we are at y=8 at t=10.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=10, from t=9 on y=7,8,9.\n\nAt t=9, we can be on y=8 or y=9.\n\nIf on y=8 at t=9, then stay to y=8 at t=10.\n\nBut how on y=8 at t=9?\n\nIf on y=9 at t=9, down to y=8 at t=10.\n\nBut to on y=9 at t=9, need y=8 at t=8, impossible.\n\nSo no.\n\nAt t=10, from y=9 at t=9, but same.\n\nSo impossible to reach before t=15 in this way.\n\nPerhaps there is a way to be on y=8 at t=9 by coming from above, but we start from below.\n\nI think H=16 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car states.\n\nPerhaps for some freeways, the unsafe times are different, but in this case, all are similar.\n\nFreeway 8 has different speed, but we already considered.\n\nAnother thing: the player can be on y=0 or y=9, safe, and we can use that to wait.\n\nFor example, at some point go down to y=0 and wait, then go up.\n\nBut that might not help.\n\nFor example, from y=7 at t=7, go down to y=6 at t=8, but unsafe, not possible.\n\nGo down to y=0 over multiple turns, but inefficient.\n\nFor example, from y=7 at t=7, go D to y=6 at t=8, unsafe, cannot.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to be at y<=3 at t=7, then to y=3 at t=8 and t=9, then go up from t=10.\n\nTo minimize, we should be as high as possible at t=7, which is y=4 or 5, but from y=5 at t=7, we can go to y=4 at t=8? y=4 at t=8 unsafe, so we must go to y=3 at t=8 from y=4 at t=7.\n\nSo at t=7, be at y=4.\n\nHow to be at y=4 at t=7.\n\nFrom start, go up directly: t=0 to t=4: y=4 at t=4.\n\nThen t=5: U to y=5\n\nt=6: instead of U, do S or D.\n\nIf at t=6, we are at y=5, then a6: D to y=4 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, y=4, safe.\n\na7: D to y=3 at t=8 (since if U to y=5, unsafe at t=8; S to y=4 unsafe; so D to y=3 safe)\n\nt=8: y=3, safe\n\na8: S to y=3 or D to y=2 or U to y=4 unsafe, so S or D, say S to y=3 at t=9\n\nt=9: y=3, safe\n\na9: U to y=4 at t=10\n\netc., same as before.\n\nIf at t=6, we do S, y7=5, then at t=7, y=5, then a7: D to y=4 at t=8, but y=4 at t=8 unsafe, cannot.\n\nSo must go down at t=6 to be at y=4 at t=7.\n\nNo better.\n\nSo the minimal H is 16 with the path I have.\n\nBut let's write the action sequence.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=14.\n\nt=0: U\n\nt=1: U\n\nt=2: U\n\nt=3: U\n\nt=4: U\n\nt=5: D  (from y=5 to y=4)\n\nt=6: D  (y=4 to y=3)\n\nt=7: S  (y=3 to y=3)\n\nt=8: S  (y=3 to y=3)\n\nt=9: U  (y=3 to y=4)\n\nt=10: U (y=4 to y=5)\n\nt=11: U (y=5 to y=6)\n\nt=12: U (y=6 to y=7)\n\nt=13: U (y=7 to y=8)\n\nt=14: U (y=8 to y=9)\n\nAt t=14, action U, to y=9 at t=15.\n\ny_{H-1} = y_{15} =9, so H-1=15, H=16.\n\nActions for t=0 to 14.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be listed.\n\nBut in the answer format, for turn t_1 + t, t from 0 to H-1.\n\nt_1=0, so turns: 0,1,2,...,14.\n\nActions: as above.\n\nBut we can reduce the waiting at t=7 and t=8.\n\nAt t=7, we are at y=3, and at t=8, we stay at y=3.\n\nBut at t=9, we stay again, but we can go up at t=9 to y=4 at t=10, but at t=9, if we go U, y10=4, but at t=9, we are still at y=3, safe, and no issue.\n\nBut to go up, we have to wait until t=10 to be at y=4.\n\nSince at t=9, y=4 is unsafe, we cannot be there, so we must not move up at t=9 to be at y=4 at t=9, but action at t=9 determines y10, not y9.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt t=9, y_t=3, we choose a_t for y_{t+1}.\n\nIf a9=U, then y10=4.\n\nWe cannot make y9=4 directly.\n\nSo we are at y=3 for turns t=7,8,9.\n\nThen at t=9, action U, to y=4 at t=10.\n\nNo way to shorten.\n\nPerhaps start going up slower to avoid going down.\n\nFor example, at t=3, instead of going to y=4, stay at y=3, but at t=4, y=3 unsafe, so must go to y=4.\n\nNo choice.\n\nSo I think H=16 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's double-check the car states at critical points.\n\nFor example, at t=8, for y=4, car on freeway 4: at T=8, span first car [-59+48, -48+48]=[-11,0], includes 0; second car [ -11+48,48]=[37,48], not, but first car covers 0, so unsafe.\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\ny=8 at t=8: car third one [-35+32, -24+32]=[-3,8] for speed 4, T=8, s=4, -35+4*8= -35+32= -3, -24+32=8, so [-3,8], includes 0, unsafe.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 16.\n\nNow for the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=5 and t=6 we go down, which might seem counterintuitive, but necessary to avoid.\n\nPerhaps we can go down less.\n\nFor example, at t=5, we are at y=5, instead of down, we stay, then at t=6 y=5, then a6: D to y=4 at t=7, then a7: D to y=3 at t=8, then same.\n\nBut then at t=6 we do D instead of at t=5.\n\nBut similar.\n\nIn the first, we did D at t=5 and t=6.\n\nIn this, we do S at t=5, D at t=6, D at t=7.\n\nBut at t=7, we do D to y=3, while in first we did D at t=6 to y=4 at t=7, then D at t=7 to y=3 at t=8.\n\nSame number of actions.\n\nBut in terms of time, same.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nThus, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nH=16\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15? Actions from t=0 to H-1=15, so up to turn 15? t from 0 to 15, but 16 actions? Let's count.\n\nH=16, actions for t=0 to 15? No.\n\nH is the number of turns, meaning the number of actions.\n\nSequence {a_t for t=0 to H-1}, and y_{H-1} =9.\n\nAfter H actions, at time H, y_H =9? No.\n\nAt time t, after t actions, position y_t.\n\nStart at t=0, y_0=0.\n\nAfter action a_0, at t=1, y_1.\n\nAfter a_{H-1}, at t=H, y_H.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{H-1} =9.\n\nt_1=0, so y_{H-1} =9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, y_{0} =0, not 9.\n\nH=9, y_8=9 if we go up each turn.\n\nBut here, with H=16, y_{15}=9.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=14 (since t from 0 to H-2? {a_t for t=0 to H-1}, so for H=16, t from 0 to 15? Indices.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt_1=0, so a_t for t=0,1,2,...,H-1.\n\nAnd after that, at turn t_1 + H -1 = H-1, position is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, for H=16, actions a_0 to a_{15}, and at turn 15, y=9.\n\nIn my sequence, with actions up to a_{14}, we have y_15=9.\n\na_{14} is the last action, at turn 14, which causes y_15=9.\n\nAnd at turn 15, we are at y=9, no action needed, I think.\n\nThe position at turn T is after actions.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t_1 + H -1, we are at (0,9).\n\nWith actions from t=0 to 14, we are at turn 15, y=9.\n\nSo t_1 + H -1 = 0 + H -1 = H-1 =15, so H=16.\n\nActions for t=0 to 15? t from 0 to H-1=15, so 16 actions? But we have only 15 actions in the sequence above.\n\nt=0 to 14 is 15 actions.\n\nH-1=15, so H=16, actions t=0 to 15.\n\nI think I missed one.\n\nIn the sequence, with actions from t=0 to t=14, we have 15 actions, reaching y_15=9.\n\nSo the actions are for t=0 to 14, so H-1=14? Let's clarify.\n\nDefine: after k actions, at turn k, position y_k.\n\nStart: turn 0, y_0=0, before any action.\n\nAfter first action a_0, turn 1, y_1.\n\nAfter second action a_1, turn 2, y_2, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn H, y_H.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt_1=0, so y_{H-1} =9.\n\nFor example, if no action, at turn 0, y=0.\n\nAfter one action, turn 1, y_1.\n\nWe want y_{H-1} =9.\n\nSo for H=1, y_{0}=0 not 9.\n\nH=9, y_8=9.\n\nIn general, with H actions, we reach y_H.\n\nBut the condition is y_{H-1} =9.\n\nWith H actions, we are at turn H.\n\ny_H is at turn H.\n\nBut we want y_{H-1} at turn H-1 to be 9.\n\nFor example, with 9 up actions, at turn 9, y_9=9, so y_{H} =9 with H=9 actions.\n\nBut here y_{H-1} =9.\n\nIf y_{H-1} =9, that means at turn H-1, we are at 9, so the last action was before turn H-1 or at turn H-1.\n\nAt turn T, we perform action a_T.\n\nAfter a_T, we are at turn T+1.\n\nPosition at turn T is y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Delta y_T.\n\nFor turn T, position y_T.\n\nWe want for some H, y_{H-1} =9.\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nFor example, if we reach y_8=9 with 8 actions? Let's see.\n\nSuppose we go up 9 times: a0 to a8 all U.\n\nThen y1=1, y2=2, ..., y9=9.\n\nSo at turn 9, y9=9, so y_{H} =9, thus H-1=9, H=10? Inconsistency.\n\ny_{H-1} =9.\n\nWith 9 actions: a0 to a8, we have y1 to y9, with y9=9.\n\nBut y9 is at turn 9, so for y_k to be 9 at k=9, so H-1=9, thus H=10.\n\nBut actions from t=0 to 9? t=0 to H-1=9, so 10 actions.\n\nBut with 9 up actions, we reach y9=9 with 9 actions, but y9 corresponds to H=9? Let's define.\n\nSet T = turn number.\n\nStart: T=0, y=0.\n\nAction a_0 at T=0, then y_1 = y_0 + Delta a_0\n\nAt T=1, y=y_1, action a_1, y_2 = y_1 + Delta a_1, and so on.\n\nAt turn T, we have position y_T, and we perform action a_T.\n\nAfter H actions, we have performed a_0 to a_{H-1}, and at turn H, we have y_H.\n\nBut we want the position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be (0,9).\n\nt_1=0, so at turn H-1, position (0,9).\n\nThat is, y_{H-1} =9.\n\nFor example, to have y_{8} =9, we need to reach y=9 at turn 8.\n\nWith actions from T=0 to T=7 (8 actions), we can have y8=9, if all U.\n\nThen y_{H-1} = y_8 =9, so H-1=8, H=9.\n\nSimilarly, in general.\n\nIn this problem, to reach y=9 at turn 15, we need y_{15} =9, so H-1=15, H=16.\n\nActions from t=0 to 15? t from 0 to H-1=15, so 16 actions.\n\nBut in my sequence, with 15 actions (t=0 to 14), I have y15=9, so for y15=9, it should be H-1=15, H=16, actions t=0 to 15.\n\nBut I have only up to a14.\n\na14 is at turn 14, causing y15=9.\n\nTo have y_{H-1} =9, with H-1=15, so actions up to a_{14}, since a_{14} determines y_{15}, but position at turn 15 is after a_{14}.\n\nThe action at turn T affects y_{T+1}.\n\nFor position at turn K to be 9, we need to have arrived by turn K.\n\nThe sequence of actions is given for turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1, but t_1 is the start turn.\n\nIn this case, t_1=0, so actions for turns 0 to H-1.\n\nAnd after that, at turn (t_1 + H -1) = H-1, position is (0,9).\n\nSo for turn H-1, y=9.\n\nIn my path, at turn 15, y=9, so H-1=15, H=16.\n\nActions for turns 0 to 15.\n\nBut with actions from 0 to 14, I reach y15=9, so I need one more action? No.\n\nActions for turns 0 to H-1, that is, a0 to a_{H-1}.\n\nFor H=16, actions a0 to a15.\n\nBut with a0 to a14, I have 15 actions, reaching y15=9 at turn 15.\n\nFor turn 15 to be the position, I don't need action at turn 15, only up to a14.\n\nThe last action is at turn H-2 to reach y_{H-1}.\n\nFor example, to have y_{15}=9, I need action a14 at turn 14 to set y15=9.\n\nThen actions from t=0 to 14, 15 actions.\n\nH-1=15, so H=16, but number of actions is H? Let's see the task.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so for t from 0 to H-1, that's H actions.\n\nAnd y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nWith H actions, we reach y_H at turn H.\n\nBut we want y_{H-1} at turn H-1 to be 9.\n\nSo for that, we need to have y_{H-1}=9, which means that at turn H-1, we are at 9, so the action a_{H-1} is not needed or it could be S, but to reach, the last action to go to 9 is at turn H-2 or something.\n\nSuppose we want y_K=9 for some K.\n\nThen with actions a0 to a_{K-1}, we can have y_K=9.\n\nFor example, to have y8=9, actions a0 to a7 all U.\n\nThen y1=1, y2=2, ..., y8=9.\n\nSo with 8 actions, we reach y8=9 at turn 8.\n\nThen for y_{H-1} =9, set H-1=8, so H=9, and actions a0 to a8? t from 0 to H-1=8, so a0 to a8, 9 actions.\n\nBut with a0 to a7, 8 actions, we have y8=9.\n\n a8 is at turn 8, which would set y9, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, for y_{H-1}=9, with actions up to a_{H-2} to set y_{H-1}, and a_{H-1} is also performed, but it might change y_H, but since we only care about position at H-1, a_{H-1} doesn't affect y_{H-1}, it affects y_H.\n\nBut in the action sequence, we include a_{H-1}, but it is not necessary for the position at H-1.\n\nIn this case, for y_{15}=9, we need actions a0 to a14, with a14 setting y15=9.\n\nThen for the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, with y_{H-1}=9.\n\nSo for y15=9, H-1=15, H=16, actions a0 to a15.\n\nBut a15 is at turn 15, which sets y16, but we don't need it.\n\nTo avoid confusion, in the path, after reaching y=9, we can have any action, but since we reached, we can stop or have S.\n\nBut in the sequence, we include up to H-1.\n\nFor y15=9, we have actions a0 to a14, 15 actions, so H=15, then y_{H-1}=y14, but y14=8 in my path, not 9.\n\nProblem.\n\nIn my path, at turn 14, y14=8, then a14=U, to y15=9.\n\nSo at turn 14, y14=8, not 9.\n\nAt turn 15, y15=9.\n\nSo for y15=9, we need H-1=15, H=16, and actions a0 to a15.\n\nBut a15 is extra.\n\nPerhaps we can add a15=S or something.\n\nBut to be precise, let's set the actions such that at turn H-1, we are at 9.\n\nSo for example, in the path, at turn 15, y=9, so set H-1=15, H=16.\n\nActions for turns 0 to 15.\n\nFor turn 15, we can have action S, since we are at y=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, it must be defined.\n\nTo save, we can have reached at turn 14.\n\nBut in this case, we reach at turn 15.\n\nMinimal turn to reach is 15, with y15=9.\n\nSo H-1=15, H=16.\n\nActions a0 to a15, with a15 being S or U or D, but since y=9, if U, y16=9 same, or S, etc.\n\nBut to minimize actions, we can have a15=S, but it doesn't reduce H.\n\nH is the number of turns for actions, but it includes the action at the reach turn.\n\nI think for the sequence, we can list a0 to a14 for H=15, but y_{14}=8 not 9.\n\nSo must have H=16 with a0 to a15.\n\nBut a15 can be S.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 15, action S.\n\nBut let's write the sequence as per the path.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo for the answer, H=16.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nAnd for turn 15, since we are at y=9, we can have action S, for example.\n\nBut the position at turn 15 is already 9, so action at turn 15 can be anything, but we need to specify.\n\nIn the sequence, it must be included.\n\nSo let's set a15=S.\n\nBut in the output, it should be listed.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is 15 if we reach at turn 14.\n\nBut in this case, we reach at turn 15.\n\nIs there a way to reach at turn 14?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=8 at turn 13, then U to y=9 at turn 14.\n\ny=8 at turn 13: safe? y=8 unsafe at t=6,7,8, t=13 safe.\n\nTo be at y=8 at turn 13, we need to come from turn 12 on y=7,8,9.\n\nAt turn 12, y=7 safe, etc.\n\nFrom the low path, at turn 13, we are at y=7, not y=8.\n\nIn the first path, at turn 13, y=7.\n\nTo be at y=8 at turn 13, we need to have gone up faster.\n\nBut from turn 9, we are at y=3, turn 10 y=4, turn 11 y=5, turn 12 y=6, turn 13 y=7, so turn 13 y=7.\n\nIf at turn 9, we are higher, but we can't.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nThus, minimal is at turn 15.\n\nSo H=16.\n\nFor the sequence:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U  ( to y=9 at turn 15)\n\nThen for turn 15, action S, for example.\n\nBut turn 15 action is not necessary, but included.\n\nSince y=9, we can do S.\n\nSo in the box.\n\nI think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 16. This requires a sequence of 16 actions from turn 0 to turn 15.\n\nThe sequence of actions is designed to navigate around unsafe times on the freeways:\n- Freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3\\) are unsafe at turns \\(T = 4, 5\\).\n- Freeways \\(y = 4, 5, 6, 7\\) are unsafe at turns \\(T = 0, 1, 8, 9\\).\n- Freeway \\(y = 8\\) is unsafe at turns \\(T = 6, 7, 8\\).\n\nThe path starts by moving up to \\(y = 5\\) by turn 5. To avoid the unsafe rows at turn 8, the player moves down to \\(y = 3\\) by turn 7 and stays there during turns 7 and 8 (when rows \\(y = 4\\) to \\(y = 7\\) are unsafe). After turn 8, the player moves up sequentially to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 15.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n- Turns 0 to 4: Move up to reach \\(y = 5\\) by turn 5.\n- Turn 5: Move down to \\(y = 4\\) to prepare for descent.\n- Turn 6: Move down to \\(y = 3\\) to be safe for turn 8.\n- Turns 7 and 8: Stay at \\(y = 3\\) to avoid unsafe rows at turn 8.\n- Turns 9 to 14: Move up sequentially to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 15.\n- Turn 15: Stay at \\(y = 9\\) (action \\(S\\) since the position is already reached).\n\nThe sequence ensures the player is never on a freeway row at an unsafe turn, avoiding collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: S \\\\ \\end{array} }",

Collision happens only if I'm on a freeway y at turn T and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that exact turn.\n\nThe player position updates based on the action: U for up (y increases by 1), D for down (y decreases by 1), S for stay (y stays the same). y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars move with constant speed. For right-moving cars, the span shifts to the right over time; for left-moving, to the left. But all cars here are right-moving, according to the table. Let me check:\n\nAll cars have direction \"right\", so they're all moving to the right. That means their spans increase over time.\n\nThe car update: for right-moving, span at time T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]? Let's see the notation.\n\nIt says: for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, at t1, the span is given as (head h, tail τ), but it says Span(t1) = [τ, h]? That might be a inconsistency.\n\nLook: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nBut typically, head and tail, for right-moving, if it's moving right, the head should be the front, so if it's moving right, head is on the right, tail on the left, so span should be from tail to head, [tail, head].\n\nIn the description, for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], and since it's moving right, at time T, it's [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so τ is the left end, h is the right end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], which might imply h is left, τ is right? But it says head h, tail τ, so it's a bit confusing.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's define the span as an interval [min, max] that covers the car.\n\nFor right-moving cars, the min (left end) is increasing, max (right end) is increasing.\n\nFor left-moving, min and max decreasing.\n\nIn this problem, all cars are right-moving, so for each car, the left end and right end both increase with speed s over time.\n\nNow, collision: if at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at time T, meaning the car covers position 0 at that turn.\n\nNote: I only collide if I'm on the freeway at that turn, and the car is on that freeway covering 0.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I choose action to go to y_{T+1}. But during turn T, I am on y_T, so I can be hit by cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nWhen I move to y_{T+1} at the end of turn T, I am not on y_{T+1} during turn T, only from turn T+1 onwards.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in Span(T) but not in Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, I am only on y_T, and I can only collide with cars on y_T at that turn.\n\nThen after action, I move to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nNow, current turn is t1=6, player at (0,4).\n\nI need to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think. Freeways are from y=1 to y=8, as per \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,…,8\". So y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars there.\n\nBut I start at y=4, which is a freeway, and I need to end at y=9, which is not a freeway, so when I am at y=9, I don't have to worry about cars.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need to pass through the freeways.\n\nNow, the car states are given for each freeway k from 1 to 8.\n\nFreeway k corresponds to y=k, I assume.\n\nNow, for each freeway, there are multiple cars with their positions at t1=6.\n\nI need to compute for each future turn T, for each freeway, the span of each car to see if 0 is covered at time T.\n\nSince I care about whether 0 is in the span at specific times.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: three cars: (-30,-41,right,6), (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6)\n\nHead and tail: for the first one, h=-30, τ=-41? But for right-moving, if h is head, it should be larger than tail, but -30 > -41, so h=-30, τ=-41, so min is τ=-41, max is h=-30? Span at t1: [τ, h] = [-41, -30] for right-moving.\n\nBut [ -41, -30 ] is from -41 to -30, which is left to right, but since numbers increase to the right, -41 is left, -30 is right, so min=-41, max=-30.\n\nSimilarly, second car: h=48, τ=37, so [37,48]\n\nThird car: h=12, τ=1, so [1,12]\n\nBut τ and h, for right-moving, τ should be the tail (left), h head (right), so yes.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut in the first car, h=-30, τ=-41, so min=τ=-41, max=h=-30.\n\nAt t1=6, span [ -41, -30 ]\n\nSimilarly, second car: min=37, max=48\n\nThird car: min=1, max=12\n\nAll on freeway 1.\n\nBut min and max, with min < max since right-moving.\n\nIn the span [τ, h], and τ <= h for right-moving, I assume.\n\nHere for first car, τ=-41, h=-30, so τ < h.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nNow, for freeway 2, same as freeway 1: three cars identical: (-30,-41,right,6), (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6)\n\nSimilarly freeway 3 same.\n\nFreeway 4: (-12,-23,right,6), (36,25,right,6)  two cars.\n\nFirst car: min=τ=-23, max=h=-12? h=-12, τ=-23, so min=τ=-23, max=h=-12\n\nSecond car: min=25, max=36? τ=25, h=36, so min=25, max=36\n\nFreeway 5 same as freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 6 same.\n\nFreeway 7 same as 4? Freeway 7: (-12,-23,right,6), (36,25,right,6) yes.\n\nFreeway 8: different: (-40,-51,right,4), (36,25,right,4), (0,-11,right,4)\n\nSpeeds are different.\n\nFirst car: min=τ=-51, max=h=-40\n\nSecond car: min=25, max=36? τ=25, h=36\n\nThird car: min=τ=-11, max=h=0? h=0, τ=-11, so min=-11, max=0\n\nAt t1=6, for freeway 8, third car has span [-11,0], so at t=6, position 0 is covered, since max=0, min=-11, so 0 is included.\n\nNow, I am starting at turn t1=6, position y=4.\n\nAt turn 6, I am on freeway 4.\n\nNow, for freeway 4 at turn 6: cars are min=-23 max=-12 and min=25 max=36, so positions covered: from -23 to -12 and 25 to 36. 0 is not covered, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, I need to check when 0 is covered.\n\nBut I need to go from y=4 to y=9, so I need to move up.\n\ny=4 to y=9, difference of 5, so minimum turns if I go up every time: 5 turns, from t=6 to t=10, y=4,5,6,7,8,9 at t=11? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nStart t=6, y=4.\n\nAfter action at t=6, y_{7} = y_6 + Δy\n\nIf I do U at t=6, y7=5\n\nU at t=7, y8=6\n\nU at t=8, y9=7\n\nU at t=9, y10=8\n\nU at t=10, y11=9\n\nSo from t=6 to t=10, actions at t=6,7,8,9,10, five actions, reach y=9 at turn 11? Turn indices.\n\nTurn t=6: I am at y=4\n\nAfter action a_6, I move to y for turn 7.\n\nTurn t=6: I am on y=4, perform action, then for turn t=7, I am on y_{7} = y_6 + Δy_6\n\nSimilarly, at turn t=7, I am on y_7, etc.\n\nTo be at y=9 at some turn, say turn T, I need y_T =9.\n\nAnd I start at turn 6 with y=4.\n\nEach up action increases y by 1, so I need at least 5 up actions to go from 4 to 9.\n\nBut I can also stay or go down, but that would take more turns, so minimal should be 5 turns if I can go up directly.\n\nBut I have to avoid collisions, so I need to check for each turn and each freeway I might be on.\n\nIn the direct up path, I would be on:\n\nAt turn 6: y=4\n\nTurn 7: y=5\n\nTurn 8: y=6\n\nTurn 9: y=7\n\nTurn 10: y=8\n\nThen at turn 11, after action, y=9, but at turn 11, I am on y=9, which is safe, no freeway.\n\nBut I reach y=9 at turn 11, so the last action is at turn 10, which sets y for turn 11.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=6 to t=6+H-1, for H turns, and after H actions, I am at turn t1 + H with position y=9.\n\nt1=6, after H actions, at turn 6+H, y=9.\n\nAnd I perform actions from t=6 to t=6+H-1.\n\nMinimal H if no obstacles: H=5, actions at t=6,7,8,9,10, all U, then at turn 11, y=9.\n\nNow, I need to check if during turns 6 to 10, when I am on freeways, there is no collision.\n\nAt each turn, for the y I am on, at that turn, 0 should not be covered by any car on that freeway.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway and each turn T >=6, whether 0 is covered.\n\nFirst, general car position at time T.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving with constant speed.\n\nTime from t1=6.\n\nΔT = T - 6\n\nFor a car with min_t1, max_t1 at t1, speed s, at time T, min_T = min_t1 + s * ΔT\n\nmax_T = max_t1 + s * ΔT\n\n0 is covered if min_T <= 0 <= max_T\n\nNow, for each freeway.\n\nStart with freeway 1: cars at t1=6:\n\nCar A: min=-41, max=-30, s=6\n\nCar B: min=37, max=48, s=6\n\nCar C: min=1, max=12, s=6\n\nAt time T, min and max increase by 6*(T-6)\n\n0 covered if for some car, min_T <=0<= max_T\n\nFor car A: min_T = -41 + 6*(T-6), max_T = -30 + 6*(T-6)\n\nSet min_T <=0<= max_T: -41 + 6(ΔT) <=0 and 0<= -30 +6(ΔT)? Better to solve inequality.\n\nmin_T <=0 <= max_T\n\nSo -41 + 6ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= -30 + 6ΔT\n\nFirst: -41 + 6ΔT <= 0 => 6ΔT <= 41 => ΔT <= 41/6 ≈ 6.833, so ΔT <=6 since integer\n\nSecond: 0 <= -30 + 6ΔT => 30 <= 6ΔT => ΔT >= 5\n\nSo for ΔT from 5 to 6 inclusive.\n\nΔT = T-6\n\nAt ΔT=5: min_T = -41 + 30 = -11, max_T = -30 +30 =0\n\n-11 <=0<=0, yes 0<=0 true.\n\nAt ΔT=6: min_T = -41 +36= -5, max_T = -30 +36=6, -5<=0<=6 true.\n\nAt ΔT=7: min_T= -41+42=1, max_T= -30+42=12, 1<=0<=12? 0<1, false.\n\nSimilarly, lower: ΔT=4: min_T= -41+24= -17, max_T= -30+24= -6, -17<=0<= -6? 0 <= -6 false.\n\nSo car A covers 0 only at ΔT=5 and 6, i.e., T=11 and 12? T=6+ΔT\n\nΔT=5: T=11\n\nΔT=6: T=12\n\nT=6 + ΔT\n\nΔT=0: T=6\n\nΔT=1: T=7, etc.\n\nAt T=11: min_T= -41 +6*5= -41+30= -11, max_T= -30+30=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nAt T=12: min_T= -41+36= -5, max_T= -30+36=6, [ -5,6], 0 included.\n\nAt other times not.\n\nNow car B: min=37, max=48, s=6\n\nmin_T =37 +6ΔT, max_T=48+6ΔT\n\nmin_T=37+6ΔT >=37>0, so 0 <= max_T always true since min>0, but min_T >0, so 0 < min_T <= something, so 0 not in [min_T, max_T] since min_T >0.\n\nSimilarly, car C: min=1, max=12, s=6\n\nmin_T=1+6ΔT >=1>0, so min_T >0, so 0 not covered.\n\nThus on freeway 1, 0 covered only when car A covers it, at T=11 and T=12.\n\nSpecifically at T=11 and 12.\n\nNow freeway 2: same cars as freeway 1, so identical, 0 covered at T=11 and 12.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3 same.\n\nNow freeway 4: cars at t1:\n\nCar D: min= -23 (since τ=-23, h=-12), max= -12, s=6\n\nCar E: min=25, max=36, s=6\n\nFor car D: min_T = -23 +6ΔT, max_T = -12 +6ΔT\n\n0 covered if min_T <=0<= max_T\n\n-23 +6ΔT <=0 and 0<= -12 +6ΔT\n\nFirst: -23 +6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=23 => ΔT <= 23/6 ≈3.833, so ΔT <=3\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12 +6ΔT => 12 <=6ΔT => ΔT >=2\n\nSo ΔT=2 and 3.\n\nAt ΔT=2: min_T= -23 +12= -11, max_T= -12+12=0, [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔT=3: min_T= -23+18= -5, max_T= -12+18=6, [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nΔT=4: min_T= -23+24=1, max_T= -12+24=12, 1<=0<=12 false.\n\nCar E min=25>0, never covers 0.\n\nSo freeway 4 has 0 covered at T=8 and T=9 (since T=6+ΔT, ΔT=2, T=8; ΔT=3, T=9)\n\nT=6+2=8, T=6+3=9.\n\nNow freeway 5 same as 4, so T=8 and 9.\n\nFreeway 6 same.\n\nFreeway 7 same as 4, T=8 and 9.\n\nNow freeway 8: cars:\n\nCar F: min= -51 (τ=-51, h=-40), max= -40, s=4\n\nCar G: min=25, max=36, s=4\n\nCar H: min= -11 (τ=-11, h=0), max=0, s=4\n\nAt t1=6, car H has min=-11, max=0, so at T=6, it covers 0.\n\nNow at time T:\n\nCar F: min_T = -51 + 4*ΔT, max_T = -40 + 4*ΔT\n\n0 covered if min_T <=0<= max_T\n\n-51 +4ΔT <=0 and 0<= -40 +4ΔT\n\nFirst: -51 +4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=51 => ΔT <= 51/4=12.75, so ΔT <=12\n\nSecond: 0 <= -40 +4ΔT => 40 <=4ΔT => ΔT >=10\n\nSo ΔT from 10 to 12 inclusive.\n\nCar G min=25>0, never.\n\nCar H: min= -11, max=0, s=4\n\nmin_T = -11 +4ΔT, max_T = 0 +4ΔT =4ΔT\n\n0 covered if min_T <=0<= max_T\n\n-11 +4ΔT <=0 and 0 <= 4ΔT\n\nFirst: -11 +4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=11 => ΔT <= 2.75, so ΔT <=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= 4ΔT always true for ΔT>=0.\n\nBut min_T <=0 <= max_T\n\nSince max_T =4ΔT >=0, and min_T = -11 +4ΔT\n\n0 <= max_T always for ΔT>=0.\n\nmin_T <=0: -11 +4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=11 => ΔT <=2.75, so ΔT=0,1,2\n\nAt ΔT=0: min_T=-11, max_T=0, [-11,0], 0 included\n\nΔT=1: min_T=-11+4=-7, max_T=4, [-7,4], 0 included\n\nΔT=2: min_T=-11+8=-3, max_T=8, [-3,8], 0 included\n\nΔT=3: min_T=-11+12=1, max_T=12, 1<=0<=12 false.\n\nSo car H covers 0 at T=6,7,8 (ΔT=0,1,2)\n\nT=6+0=6, T=7, T=8.\n\nCar F covers at ΔT=10,11,12, T=16,17,18, which is later, not relevant for now.\n\nSo on freeway 8, 0 covered at T=6,7,8 from car H, and also at T=16,17,18 from car F, but T=16 etc is far, we care about near future.\n\nNow, back to the player.\n\nI start at turn 6, y=4.\n\nIn the direct up path:\n\nTurn 6: y=4, freeway 4\n\nAt turn 6, freeway 4: from above, 0 covered at T=8 and 9, not at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, freeway 4: cars min=-23 max=-12 and min=25 max=36, neither covers 0, since -12 <0<25? 0 not in [-23,-12] nor [25,36], so no, 0 not covered at T=6 for freeway 4. Safe.\n\nTurn 7: if I go to y=5, freeway 5\n\nFreeway 5 at T=7: from above, freeway 5 same as 4, 0 covered at T=8 and 9, not at T=7.\n\nAt T=7, ΔT=1 for freeway, but freeway 5 cars same as 4.\n\nAt T=7, ΔT=T-6=1\n\nFor car on freeway 5: car D type: min_T = -23 +6*1 = -17, max_T= -12+6= -6? Earlier calculation.\n\nmin_T = min_t1 + s ΔT = -23 +6*1= -17, max_T= -12+6= -6, so [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nCar E min=25+6=31, max=36+6=42, 0 not in. So safe.\n\nTurn 8: y=6, freeway 6\n\nAt T=8, freeway 6: 0 covered? From above, for freeway 4,5,6 same, at T=8, ΔT=2, min_T= -23+12= -11, max_T= -12+12=0? For car D, min_T=-23+12=-11, max_T=-12+12=0, so [-11,0], 0 included! Oh, so at T=8, for freeway 6 (and 4,5,7), 0 is covered by the first car.\n\nSimilarly at T=9.\n\nSo at turn 8, if I am on freeway 6, and 0 is covered, collision.\n\nIn the path, at turn 8, I would be on y=6, freeway 6, and at T=8, 0 covered, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 9, if I am on y=7, freeway 7, at T=9, 0 covered, collision.\n\nNow turn 10, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nAt turn 10, T=10.\n\nFreeway 8: at T=10.\n\nFirst, car H covers 0 at T=6,7,8, not at T=10.\n\nΔT = T-6=4\n\nCar H: min_T= -11 +4*4= -11+16=5, max_T=0+16=16, [5,16], 0 not in.\n\nCar F: at ΔT=4, min_T= -51 +4*4= -51+16= -35, max_T= -40+16= -24? min=-51, s=4, min_T= -51 +4*4= -51+16= -35, max_T= -40 +16= -24, [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nCar G min=25+16=41, etc, no.\n\nBut at T=10, is 0 covered? From above, car H at T=10: ΔT=4, min_T= -11+16=5, max_T=16, no.\n\nCar F only at later times.\n\nBut freeway 8 also has car at T=6,7,8 covering 0, but T=10 not.\n\nSpecifically, at T=10, ΔT=4:\n\nCar F min_T= -51 +16= -35, max= -40+16= -24? max_T= -40 + sΔT= -40 +16= -24, so [-35,-24] or something, min_T=-35, max_T=-24, both negative.\n\nCar G min=25+16=41>0\n\nCar H min= -11+16=5>0\n\nSo no car covers 0 at T=10 on freeway 8.\n\nSimilarly, at T=11, etc.\n\nBut in the direct path, at turn 8, when I am on y=6, collision, and turn 9 on y=7 collision.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on freeways 6 and 7 at turns 8 and 9? Specifically, at turn 8, freeway 6 has collision, turn 9 freeway 7 has collision.\n\nFreeway 6 and 7 are y=6 and y=7.\n\nIn the path, at turn 8, y=6; turn 9, y=7.\n\nBut I need to be somewhere else at those turns.\n\nPerhaps I can delay or something.\n\nSince the collision times are only at specific turns, I can stay or move down to avoid being on that freeway at that turn.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nMinimal H might be more than 5.\n\nFirst, let's list the collision times per freeway.\n\nFrom above:\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): 0 covered at T=11,12\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2): same, T=11,12\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): same, T=11,12\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): 0 covered at T=8,9\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): same, T=8,9\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): same, T=8,9\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): same, T=8,9\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): 0 covered at T=6,7,8 (from car H)\n\nAnd also at T=16,17,18 but later.\n\nFor our purpose, near turns: T=6,7,8 for y=8.\n\nNow, I start at t=6, y=4.\n\nAt t=6, y=4, freeway 4, which has collision at T=8,9, but not at T=6, so safe at t=6.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nI need to go up, but avoid being on y=6 at t=8, y=7 at t=9, and also for y=8, avoid t=6,7,8 but t=6 I am not on y=8, etc.\n\nLet me list the turns I need to avoid for each y.\n\nFor y=4: avoid T=8,9\n\nBut at T=6, I am on y=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5: avoid T=8,9\n\ny=6: avoid T=8,9\n\ny=7: avoid T=8,9\n\ny=8: avoid T=6,7,8\n\nNow, at t=6, I am on y=4.\n\nI need to be at y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSince from t=8 to t=9, y=6 and y=7 are dangerous, I might stay on lower y or move to higher.\n\nBut y=8 is also dangerous at t=6,7,8, but t=6 I am not on y=8, t=7 I might not be if I go up slowly.\n\nLet's think about the timeline.\n\nTurn by turn.\n\nStart t=6: y=4, safe (since no collision at t=6 for y=4)\n\nNow, I need to choose action a_6.\n\nIf I go up, to y=5 at t=7.\n\nIf I stay, y=4 at t=7.\n\nIf down, y=3 at t=7.\n\nBut going down might not help, since I need to go up eventually.\n\nAt t=7, if I am on y=5, freeway 5.\n\nAt t=7, for freeway 5: collision at T=8,9, not at T=7, so safe, as earlier calculation.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay on y=4 at t=7, also safe for y=4 at t=7.\n\nBut I need to avoid t=8 and t=9 on certain y.\n\nSpecifically, at t=8, I should not be on y=4,5,6,7 because:\n\ny=4: avoid T=8,9\n\ny=5: avoid T=8,9\n\ny=6: avoid T=8,9\n\ny=7: avoid T=8,9\n\nAt t=8, all y from 4 to 7 have collision? y=4,5,6,7 all have 0 covered at T=8.\n\ny=4 at T=8: covered\n\ny=5 same\n\ny=6 same\n\ny=7 same\n\ny=8: at T=8 covered, from car H.\n\ny=8 avoid T=6,7,8.\n\nSo at t=8, all freeways y=1 to 8 have collision? y=1,2,3: at T=8, do they have collision?\n\ny=1: freeway 1, at T=8.\n\nT=8, ΔT=2\n\nFreeway 1: car A at ΔT=2, min_T= -41+12= -29, max_T= -30+12= -18? min=-41, max=-30, s=6, min_T= -41+12= -29, max_T= -30+12= -18, [-29,-18], 0 not in.\n\nCar B min=37+12=49, etc no\n\nCar C min=1+12=13, max=12+12=24, 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=8, freeway 1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 2 and 3 same, safe at T=8.\n\nOnly y=4,5,6,7,8 have issues at some times.\n\nSpecifically at T=8:\n\ny=1: safe\n\ny=2: safe\n\ny=3: safe\n\ny=4: covered (collision)\n\ny=5: covered\n\ny=6: covered\n\ny=7: covered\n\ny=8: covered (from car H)\n\nSo at T=8, only y=1,2,3 are safe; y=4,5,6,7,8 all have collision.\n\nSimilarly at T=9:\n\nT=9, ΔT=3\n\ny=1: car A at ΔT=3, min_T= -41+18= -23, max= -30+18= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nCar C min=1+18=19, etc, no, so safe.\n\nSimilarly y=2,3 safe.\n\ny=4: at ΔT=3, min_T= -23+18= -5, max= -12+18=6, [-5,6], 0 included, collision.\n\nSimilarly y=5,6,7 same, collision.\n\ny=8: at T=9, ΔT=3, car H min_T= -11+12=1, max=0+12=12, [1,12], 0 not in? min_T=1>0, so 0 not covered. car F min_T= -51+12= -39, etc, no, so y=8 safe at T=9.\n\ny=8 at T=9: not covered, as above.\n\nBut at T=8 covered.\n\nNow back to t=8: only y=1,2,3 are safe.\n\nBut I am starting from y=4, and need to go to y=9, so y=1,2,3 are below.\n\nAt t=7, positions:\n\nIf at t=6 I go up, y=5 at t=7.\n\nOr stay, y=4 at t=7.\n\nOr down, y=3 at t=7.\n\nAt t=7, y=5: freeway 5, at T=7, as before, min_T for car: -23+6= -17, max= -6, 0 not in, safe.\n\ny=4 at t=7: similarly safe.\n\ny=3 at t=7: freeway 3, at T=7, ΔT=1, freeway 3 cars like y=1, min car A: -41+6= -35, max= -30+6= -24, [-35,-24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nNow, I need to be safe at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, only y=1,2,3 are safe.\n\nSo I need to be on y=1,2, or 3 at turn 8.\n\nBut at t=7, if I am on y=5, I can go down to y=4, but at t=8, y=4 is not safe.\n\nIf I go down to y=3 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=7 I am on y=4, I can go down to y=3.\n\nOr if on y=3, stay or down.\n\nBut I need to eventually go up.\n\nAlso, at t=9, I need to be safe.\n\nAt t=9: T=9\n\ny=1,2,3: safe, as above.\n\ny=4,5,6,7: collision\n\ny=8: safe, as above.\n\nSo at t=9, y=1,2,3,8 are safe; y=4,5,6,7 not safe.\n\ny=8 is safe at t=9.\n\nThen at t=10, all might be safe except if collision times, but for y=8, at t=10, safe as before.\n\ny=1,2,3 at t=10: let's check.\n\nT=10, ΔT=4\n\ny=1: car A min_T= -41+24= -17, max= -30+24= -6, [-17,-6], 0 not in; car C min=1+24=25, etc, safe.\n\nSimilarly all safe at t=10 except possible later, but near.\n\ny=8 at t=10 safe.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, I need to be at y=8 at some turn, then go up to y=9.\n\nNow, back to path.\n\nI need to be on low y at t=8, like y=3.\n\nThen at t=9, I can be on y=3 or go to y=8? But from y=3 to y=8, I need to go up 5 times, but I can move fast.\n\nActions: each turn I can change y by -1,0,+1.\n\nSo from y=3 to y=8, need 5 up actions.\n\nBut at t=8, I need to be on y=1,2, or 3.\n\nSuppose at t=8, I am on y=3.\n\nThen at t=9, I can go to y=4, but y=4 at t=9 has collision, not safe.\n\nGo to y=2 or stay y=3 or go up to y=4.\n\nBut y=4 not safe at t=9.\n\ny=3 at t=9 is safe.\n\nThen I can go up later.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=8 is safe at t=9, I could be on y=8 at t=9.\n\nBut how to get to y=8 from low y.\n\nFor example, from t=8 on y=3, if I go up, at t=9 y=4, but y=4 not safe at t=9.\n\nIf I could jump, but I can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nSo at t=8, y=3.\n\nThen a_8: if U, y9=4, but at t=9, y=4, collision.\n\nIf S, y9=3, safe.\n\nIf D, y9=2, safe.\n\nBut then I am stuck on low y.\n\nTo reach high y, I need to go up when safe.\n\ny=8 is safe at t=9, so if I can be on y=8 at t=9.\n\nBut at t=8, I need to be on y=7 or y=8 or y=9, but y=7 at t=8 has collision, y=8 at t=8 has collision, y=9 not freeway.\n\nAt t=8, y=8 not safe.\n\nThe only way to be on y=8 at t=9 is to be on y=7 or y=8 or y=9 at t=8, then move.\n\nBut at t=8, y=7 and y=8 not safe, y=9 not possible.\n\nIf at t=8 I am on y=7, then a_8=U, to y=8 at t=9.\n\nBut at t=8, if I am on y=7, collision, since y=7 at t=8 covered.\n\nSimilarly, if on y=8 at t=8, collision.\n\nIf on y=9, not, but can't be.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=8 at t=9, because to be on y=8 at t=9, I must have been on y=7,8, or 9 at t=8, but y=7 and 8 not safe at t=8, and y=9 not freeway, but position: at t=8 I am on some y, then action to set y for t=9.\n\nTo have y_9=8, I must have y_8 =7 or 8 or 9, and a_8 accordingly.\n\nBut if y_8=7, a_8=U, y9=8\n\nIf y_8=8, a_8=S, y9=8\n\nIf y_8=9, a_8=D, y9=8\n\nBut at t=8, if y_8=7, on freeway 7, collision at t=8.\n\nSimilarly y_8=8, collision at t=8.\n\ny_8=9, not possible since y=9 not freeway, but at t=8, if I am on y=9, it's safe, but how to be on y=9 at t=8? I start from y=4, need to go up, but at t=8, if I am on y=9, that means I reached earlier, but with minimal turns, I can't reach y=9 before t=11 in direct path, but with delays.\n\nFor example, if I go up faster, but I can only move one per turn.\n\nFrom t=6 y=4, if all U, t=7 y=5, t=8 y=6, t=9 y=7, t=10 y=8, t=11 y=9.\n\nSo at t=8, I am at y=6, not y=9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at t=8, I need to have gone up 4 times from t=6 to t=8, but from t=6 to t=8, two actions: a6 and a7.\n\nIf a6=U, y7=5; a7=U, y8=6. Can't be higher than 6 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at t=8, y8=8, which requires from y=4 at t=6, with a6 and a7 both U, y7=5, y8=6, not 8.\n\nImpossible to be above y=6 at t=8 from start.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, max y=7 with three up actions.\n\nt=6 y=4, t=7 y=5 (a6=U), t=8 y=6 (a7=U), t=9 y=7 (a8=U)\n\nOr if I do more up, but only two actions to t=8, three to t=9.\n\nSo at t=8, possible y from 2 to 6: if all down, y=2; all up, y=6.\n\nSimilarly at t=9, y from 1 to 7.\n\nBut at t=8, y=6 is not safe, and lower y are safe only for y=1,2,3.\n\nSo at t=8, I must be on y=1,2, or 3.\n\nSimilarly at t=9, I can be on y=1,2,3 or y=8, but y=8 at t=9 is safe, but how to reach y=8 from y=3 in one step? Impossible, max change 1.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=8, at t=9 I can be y=2,3,4.\n\ny=4 at t=9 not safe, y=2 or 3 safe.\n\nThen at t=10, I can go to y=3,4,5 from y=3, etc.\n\nBut to reach y=8, I need to go up from there.\n\nBut y=8 is safe at t=9, but I can't be there because I am low.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=8 at later turns.\n\nFor example, at t=10, y=8 is safe, as earlier.\n\nSimilarly, other times.\n\nSo let's plan a path that avoids the bad times.\n\nStart t=6, y=4, safe.\n\nI need to be at low y at t=8.\n\nSo for example, at t=6, instead of going up, I go down or stay.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nSuppose at t=6, I do S, so y=4 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, I need to choose.\n\nAt t=7, y=4 or whatever.\n\nAt t=7, I am on y=4 (if a6=S), or y=5 (if a6=U), or y=3 (if a6=D).\n\nNow, at t=7, all positions are safe, as we saw earlier.\n\ny=4 at t=7: safe\n\ny=5 at t=7: safe\n\ny=3 at t=7: safe\n\nNow, I need to be at y=1,2,3 at t=8.\n\nSo at t=7, if I am on y=4, I can go down to y=3 at t=8.\n\nIf on y=5, go down to y=4 or y=3? y=4 at t=8 not safe, so I must go down to y=3 or lower.\n\nSimilarly, if on y=3, I can stay or go down.\n\nBut to minimize turns, I should not go down too much.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nOption 1: at t=6, go down to y=3 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, on y=3, I can stay or go down.\n\nAt t=8, I need to be on y=3 or less, so I can stay at y=3.\n\nThen at t=8, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=9, I am on y=3, I can go up to y=4, but at t=9, y=4 has collision, not safe.\n\nGo down to y=2 or stay y=3.\n\nBoth safe at t=9.\n\nThen later go up.\n\nBut this takes time.\n\nSince at t=9, y=8 is safe, I need to reach y=8 quickly after t=9.\n\nBut from y=3 at t=9, I need to go up to y=8.\n\nEach up action takes one turn.\n\nFrom y=3 to y=8, need 5 up actions.\n\nStart from t=9, y=3.\n\nThen a9=U, y10=4\n\nBut at t=10, y=4, is it safe?\n\nAt t=10, T=10.\n\nFor y=4, freeway 4: at T=10, ΔT=4\n\nCar D: min_T= -23 +6*4= -23+24=1, max_T= -12+24=12, [1,12], 0 not in, since min=1>0.\n\nSimilarly car E min=25+24=49, etc, so no, 0 not covered at T=10 for y=4.\n\nSimilarly for other y, at T=10, all should be safe, as the covering times are earlier or later.\n\ny=8 at T=10 safe, as before.\n\nSo at t=10, I can be on y=4, safe.\n\nThen a10=U, y11=5\n\nt=11, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nAt T=11, for y=5: collision at T=8,9, not at T=11.\n\nT=11, ΔT=5\n\nCar D type: min_T= -23 +30=7, max= -12+30=18, [7,18], 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nSimilarly, a11=U, y12=6\n\nt=12, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nT=12, ΔT=6\n\nmin_T= -23+36=13, max= -12+36=24, [13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\na12=U, y13=7\n\nt=13, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nT=13, ΔT=7\n\nmin_T= -23+42=19, max= -12+42=30, [19,30], safe.\n\na13=U, y14=8\n\nt=14, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nAt T=14, ΔT=8\n\nCar H: min_T= -11 +4*8= -11+32=21, max=0+32=32, [21,32], 0 not in.\n\nCar F: min_T= -51 +32= -19, max= -40+32= -8, [-19,-8], 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nThen a14=U, y15=9, reached.\n\nBut this takes many turns: from t=6 to t=14, that's 9 actions? Let's count turns.\n\nStart t=6 y=4\n\nAfter actions to reach y=9 at turn t.\n\nWith the above: t=6 y=4\n\nt=7 y=3 (if I went down)\n\nt=8 y=3\n\nt=9 y=3\n\nThen t=10 y=4\n\nt=11 y=5\n\nt=12 y=6\n\nt=13 y=7\n\nt=14 y=8\n\nt=15 y=9\n\nSo at turn 15, y=9, actions from t=6 to t=14, H=9 actions? t=6 to t=14 is 9 turns? Turn indices.\n\nt1=6, actions at t=6 to t=6+H-1, position at t=6+H.\n\nSet t=6+H =15, y=9, so H=9, actions at t=6 to 14.\n\nBut earlier I thought of being at y=3 at t=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=9 I am at y=3.\n\nBut at t=9, I could be higher if possible.\n\nSince at t=9, y=8 is safe, but I can't reach it from low.\n\nAnother idea: at t=6, I go up to y=5 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, I go down to y=4 or to y=3.\n\nBut y=4 at t=8 not safe, so I must go down to y=3 at t=8.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=6: a6=U, y7=5\n\nt=7: a7=D, y8=4? But at t=8, y=4 not safe.\n\na7=D, to y=4 at t=8, collision.\n\na7=D from y=5 to y=4 at t=8, but y=4 at t=8 collision.\n\nIf a7=DD, to y=3 at t=8.\n\ny=3 at t=8 safe.\n\nThen at t=8, y=3.\n\nThen at t=9, I can go to y=4, but y=4 at t=9 collision, not safe.\n\nSo must stay or down, y=2 or 3 at t=9.\n\nThen same as before, slow.\n\nBut at t=9, y=8 is safe, so if I can be on y=8 at t=9, I can then go up to y=9 at t=10.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at t=9, I need to be on y=7,8,9 at t=8 with appropriate action.\n\nBut at t=8, y=7 and y=8 not safe, and I can't be on y=7 or 8 at t=8 because collision.\n\nUnless I am on y=9 at t=8, but impossible from start.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=8 at t=9.\n\nSimilarly, I can be on y=8 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, y=8 is safe.\n\nSo let's aim to be on y=8 at t=10, then U to y=9 at t=11.\n\nHow to reach y=8 at t=10 from start.\n\nStart t=6 y=4.\n\nTo y=8 at t=10, that's 4 steps, need net +4 in y.\n\nWith actions, each U is +1, S 0, D -1.\n\nSo to increase y by 4 in 4 actions, I need all U, but with obstacles, I might need to detour.\n\nBut in this case, the problem is at t=8 and t=9.\n\nWith all U: t=6 y=4, a6=U, t=7 y=5, a7=U, t=8 y=6 but at t=8 y=6 collision, not possible.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on y=6 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, at t=9, if I am on y=7, collision.\n\nBut in all U, at t=9 y=7 collision.\n\nSo I need to modify.\n\nFor example, at t=7, instead of U, I do S or D to not be at high y at t=8.\n\nBut at t=7, if I am on y=5, and I do S, then at t=8 y=5, but y=5 at t=8 collision.\n\nIf I do D, to y=4 at t=8, collision.\n\nSo the only way is to be on low y at t=8.\n\nSo I must go down at some point.\n\nFor example, at t=6, do D to y=3 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, on y=3, I can do S to y=3 at t=8, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, y=3.\n\nNow at t=9, I want to go up, but if I do U, to y=4 at t=9, but y=4 at t=9 collision.\n\nSo I cannot go up at t=9 to y=4.\n\nMust stay on y=3 or go down.\n\nThen at t=9, y=3.\n\nThen at t=10, I can go U to y=4.\n\nt=10 y=4, safe as earlier.\n\nThen U to y=5 at t=11, safe.\n\nU to y=6 at t=12, safe.\n\nU to y=7 at t=13, safe.\n\nU to y=8 at t=14, safe.\n\nU to y=9 at t=15.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut at t=9, if I go down to y=2, then at t=10 I need to come back, even slower.\n\nSince at t=9, y=8 is safe, but I can't reach it.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=5 at t=7, then at t=7 go down to y=4, but at t=8 y=4 collision, not good.\n\nOr from y=5 at t=7, go down to y=3 at t=8, by doing D twice? No, one action per turn.\n\nAt t=7, from y=5, I can do D to y=4 at t=8, but collision, or do D to y=4, not good, or I can do nothing, but same.\n\nI think I have to be on low y at t=8 and t=9, then go up after t=9.\n\nBut at t=9, I can be on y=8 if I were high, but I am low.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=8 at t=10.\n\nTo be on y=8 at t=10, I need y at t=9 to be 7,8,9 and action.\n\nBut at t=9, if I am on y=7, it has collision at t=9, not safe.\n\nIf on y=8, safe at t=9, but how to be on y=8 at t=9.\n\nFrom start, to be at y=8 at t=9, that's from y=4 at t=6 to y=8 at t=9, with three actions: net +4, so all U and one extra, impossible, max y at t=9 is 7 with three U.\n\ny=7 at t=9, but y=7 at t=9 has collision, not safe.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=7 or 8 at t=9 safely; y=7 not safe, y=8 possible but not reachable.\n\ny=8 at t=9 is safe, but I can't reach it.\n\nSo best is to be on y=8 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, y=8 safe.\n\nTo be on y=8 at t=10, I need to have y at t=9 to be 7,8,9 and a9 accordingly.\n\nIf y9=7, a9=U, y10=8\n\nBut at t=9, if y9=7, on freeway 7, collision at t=9, not safe.\n\nIf y9=8, a9=S, y10=8, and at t=9, y=8 safe.\n\nIf y9=9, a9=D, y10=8, but y=9 not freeway, safe.\n\nBut to have y9=8 or 9.\n\ny9=8: at t=9, position y=8, which is safe as established.\n\nHow to reach y=8 at t=9.\n\nFrom t=6 y=4 to t=9 y=8, three actions, net +4, impossible with max change +1 per turn. With three actions, max y=7 at t=9.\n\nMin y=1.\n\nSo y=8 at t=9 impossible.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 at t=9 impossible.\n\nSo the only way to have y10=8 is from y9=7 with U, or y9=8 with S, or y9=9 with D.\n\nBut y9=7 not safe at t=9, so cannot.\n\ny9=8 possible but not reachable.\n\ny9=9 not reachable.\n\nSo the only possibility is to have y9=7 with U to y10=8, but y9=7 not safe.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be on y=8 at t=10 because it requires being on y=7 at t=9 which is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nSo I must be on y=8 at a later time.\n\nFor example, at t=11 or later.\n\nBut let's see the earliest.\n\nPerhaps from the low path.\n\nSince at t=8 I am on low y, say y=3, then at t=9 I am on y=3, then at t=10 I go to y=4, etc, as before.\n\nBut that takes to t=15 for y=9.\n\nBut maybe I can go faster to higher y after t=9.\n\nFor example, at t=9, I am on y=3, but if I could be on higher y at t=9.\n\nBut at t=9, if I am on y=4, it is not safe, so I can't.\n\nUnless for some y it is safe at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, y=1,2,3,8 are safe; y=4,5,6,7 not safe.\n\nSo I can be on y=3 or y=8 at t=9.\n\ny=8 I can't reach, so only y=3 or lower.\n\nSo I have to be on y=3 at t=9 for example.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nBut to minimize time, I should be as high as possible at t=9, so y=3 is the highest safe at t=9 besides y=8.\n\nSo y=3 at t=9.\n\nThen from t=9 y=3, I need to go to y=9.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, so need 6 actions: to y=4 at t=10, y=5 at t=11, ..., y=9 at t=15.\n\nActions from t=9 to t=14, 6 actions, but I have actions from t=6.\n\nLet's list the sequence.\n\nStart: t=6, y=4\n\nTo avoid t=8 on middle y, I go down.\n\nFor example:\n\na6 = D, so at t=7, y=3\n\nThen at t=7, a7 = S or D, but to be at y=3 for t=8, I can do S.\n\na7 = S, so at t=8, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, a8 = ? At t=9, I need to be on safe y. y=3 is safe at t=9, so I can do S or D to y=2 or 3.\n\nBut to be high, do S to stay y=3.\n\na8 = S, so at t=9, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=9, a9 = U, to y=4 at t=10\n\nAt t=10, y=4, safe (as T=10, no collision for y=4)\n\na10 = U, to y=5 at t=11, safe\n\na11 = U, to y=6 at t=12, safe\n\na12 = U, to y=7 at t=13, safe\n\na13 = U, to y=8 at t=14, safe\n\na14 = U, to y=9 at t=15\n\nSo reached at turn 15.\n\nH=9 actions: from t=6 to t=14.\n\nBut is there a way with fewer turns?\n\nPerhaps I can go up to y=5 or something before, but at t=8 I need to be low.\n\nSuppose at t=6, I do U to y=5 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, I must go down to y=3 at t=8, because if I go to y=4 at t=8, collision, or y=5 collision, or lower.\n\nSo a7 = D from y=5 to y=4, but y=4 at t=8 collision, not good.\n\nTo go directly to y=3, but from y=5, I can only go to y=4 or y=5 or y=6 with one action.\n\nTo reach y=3 at t=8 from y=5 at t=7, I need a7 = D to y=4 at t=8, but then collision, or if I do D, it's to y=4, not y=3 directly.\n\nI can only change by 1 per action.\n\nSo from y=5 at t=7, with a7, I can go to y=4,5,6 at t=8.\n\nBut all have collision at t=8: y=4,5,6 all covered.\n\nSo impossible to be safe at t=8 from y=5 at t=7.\n\nSimilarly, if I start with S at t=6, y=4 at t=7, then from there, to be safe at t=8, I must go to y=3 or lower, so a7 = D to y=3 at t=8.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nSo the only safe way is to be on y=3 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, I can stay or go down, but to be high at t=9, I stay at y=3.\n\nThen at t=9, I am on y=3, which is safe, and I can go up at t=9 to y=4, but y=4 at t=9 collision, so I cannot; I must stay or go down.\n\nSo at t=9, I am on y=3, a9=S, y=3 at t=10? No.\n\nAt t=9, I am on y=3 (from previous), then a9 action determines y for t=10.\n\nIf I do U at t=9, I go to y=4 at t=10.\n\nBut at t=9, when I am on y=3, I am safe, and performing action a9.\n\nAfter action, at turn t=10, I am on y=4.\n\nDuring turn t=9, I am on y=3, so I don't care about y=4 at that turn.\n\nOnly at turn t=10, when I am on y=4, I need to check collision for t=10.\n\nAnd at t=10, y=4 is safe, as we said.\n\nSimilarly, if I do S at t=9, I stay on y=3 at t=10, then go up later.\n\nBut that adds delay.\n\nSo better to go up at t=9 to y=4 at t=10.\n\nIn the sequence I had, at t=9 I am on y=3, a9=U, so for turn t=10, I am on y=4.\n\nAnd at t=10, y=4 safe.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nBut in the sequence, from t=9 y=3 to t=10 y=4, etc.\n\nBut at t=9, when I do a9, I am on y=3, which is safe.\n\nThe collision is only when I am on the freeway at that turn.\n\nSo in the sequence above, with a6=D to y=3 at t=7, a7=S to y=3 at t=8, a8=S to y=3 at t=9, then a9=U to y=4 at t=10, then U to y=5 at t=11, U to y=6 at t=12, U to y=7 at t=13, U to y=8 at t=14, U to y=9 at t=15.\n\nReached at turn 15.\n\nActions from t=6 to t=14, 9 actions.\n\nBut at t=8, I am on y=3, safe; t=9 on y=3, safe; then from t=10 to t=14, all safe.\n\nBut can I reduce the number?\n\nNotice that at t=9, y=8 is safe, and if I can be on y=8 at t=9, I can go to y=9 at t=10.\n\nBut I can't reach y=8 at t=9.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=8 at t=10.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at t=10, I need to be on y=7,8,9 at t=9 with action.\n\nBut at t=9, y=7 not safe, so only possible if on y=8 or 9 at t=9.\n\nBut y=8 at t=9 safe, but unreachable; y=9 not freeway, safe, but unreachable.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9 with the above sequence.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can be higher at some point.\n\nFor example, at t=6, instead of going down, I go up to y=5 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, I go down to y=4, but at t=8 y=4 collision.\n\nOr from y=5 at t=7, I go down to y=4 at t=8, collision.\n\nNo way.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at y=4 for some turns, but at t=8 and t=9, y=4 not safe, so I have to leave.\n\nBut I can go to y=3 before.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=5 at t=7, then at t=7 go down to y=4, but still at t=8 y=4 not safe.\n\nI think it's impossible to avoid without going down to y=3.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8, at t=6,7,8 it is dangerous, but I am not on it.\n\nBut for the path, I think the sequence I have is ok.\n\nBut let's see if I can start going up later.\n\nOr perhaps at t=9, after the danger, I can go up faster, but I have to go step by step.\n\nNotice that from t=10 onwards, all y are safe for the cars, as the covering times are past.\n\nFor example, y=4 to 7 have covering at T=8,9 only, so after that safe.\n\ny=8 has covering at T=6,7,8, so after safe.\n\ny=1,2,3 always safe except at T=11,12 for y=1,2,3, but T=11,12 is later.\n\nFor y=1,2,3, 0 covered at T=11,12.\n\nBut if I am on y=1,2,3 at t=11 or 12, collision, but in my path, I am on higher y at that time.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=11, I am on y=5 or something, not low.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nIn my sequence, from t=10 y=4 to t=14 y=8, all safe.\n\nBut at t=11, y=5, T=11, for y=5: as above, at T=11, car min_T= -23+30=7>0, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, to reduce turns, perhaps I can be at higher y at t=9.\n\nBut at t=9, the only safe y above 3 is y=8, which I can't reach.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=0 or y=9, but y=0 is safe, but below.\n\nFor example, at t=6, go down to y=3 at t=7, then at t=7 go down to y=2 at t=8, then at t=8 go down to y=1 at t=9, then from y=1 go up, but it takes longer to go up from y=1.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo best is to be at y=3 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut at t=9, when I am on y=3, I can immediately go up at t=9 to y=4 at t=10, as above.\n\nIn the action sequence, at t=9, I perform a9=U, which means during turn t=9, I am on y=3, safe, and I move to y=4 for t=10.\n\nNo problem.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut is there a way to save one turn?\n\nSuppose at t=6, I do U to y=5 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, I do D to y=4 at t=8, but at t=8 y=4 collision, not possible.\n\nIf at t=6 I do nothing, S, y=4 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, I do D to y=3 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, I can do U to y=4 at t=9, but at t=9 y=4 collision, not safe.\n\nSo must do S or D at t=8.\n\nSay S to y=3 at t=9.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nSo I think H=9 is minimal.\n\nBut let's count the turns from start.\n\nStart: turn t=6, position y=4\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=6+H, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAfter a6 (t=6 action), at t=7 y=3\n\nAfter a7, at t=8 y=3\n\nAfter a8, at t=9 y=3\n\nAfter a9, at t=10 y=4\n\nAfter a10, at t=11 y=5\n\nAfter a11, at t=12 y=6\n\nAfter a12, at t=13 y=7\n\nAfter a13, at t=14 y=8\n\nAfter a14, at t=15 y=9\n\nSo at turn 15, y=9, with actions at t=6 to t=14, H=9 actions.\n\nMinimal without obstacles is 5, but with obstacles, 9.\n\nBut perhaps I can go to y=8 directly after t=9.\n\nFor example, if at t=9 I am on y=3, but if I could be on y=5 or something, but not possible.\n\nAnother thought: at t=7, I am on y=3 (after a6=D), then at t=7, I could go up to y=4 at t=8, but at t=8 y=4 collision, not possible.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have a6=D, but let's write the actions.\n\nAlso, for freeway 8, at t=6,7,8 it is dangerous, but I am not on it.\n\nNow, in the car state for freeway 8, there is a car at t=6 covering 0, but I am on y=4 at t=6, not y=8.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo the action sequence:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = D  (since t1=6)\n\nThen t_1 +1 =7: a_7 = S\n\nt_1 +2 =8: a_8 = S\n\nt_1 +3 =9: a_9 = U\n\nt_1 +4 =10: a_10 = U\n\nt_1 +5 =11: a_11 = U\n\nt_1 +6 =12: a_12 = U\n\nt_1 +7 =13: a_13 = U\n\nt_1 +8 =14: a_14 = U\n\nThen at turn t_1 +9 =15, y=9.\n\nH=9 actions.\n\nBut t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +8 =14, action at t=14, position at t=15.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=6 to t=14, which is t_1 to t_1 +8, so H=9.\n\nNow, but in the beginning, I have a6=D, going down, but perhaps I can avoid going down if I stay, but I need to be low.\n\nSuppose at t=6, I do S, so at t=7 y=4.\n\nThen at t=7, I must do D to y=3 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, I do S to y=3 at t=9.\n\nThen same as before, a9=U to y=4 at t=10, etc.\n\nBut at t=7, I am on y=4, which is safe, and I go down to y=3 for t=8.\n\nIn terms of actions, I used S at t=6 instead of D, but then at t=7 I do D, so I still have a down action, and it takes the same number of turns.\n\nIn this case, at t=7 I do D, whereas in previous I did S at t=7.\n\nBut number of actions to reach is same.\n\nIn this: t=6 S, y=4 at t=7\n\nt=7 D, y=3 at t=8\n\nt=8 S, y=3 at t=9\n\nt=9 U, y=4 at t=10\n\n...\n\nSame as before but a6=S, a7=D, a8=S, instead of a6=D, a7=S, a8=S.\n\nIn first sequence: a6=D, a7=S, a8=S\n\nSecond: a6=S, a7=D, a8=S\n\nBoth have three actions to reach t=9 at y=3, then same up.\n\nSo same H.\n\nBut in both, I have to go down to y=3 at some point.\n\nNow, to output the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format, for t_1=6.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 6: D or S? Let's choose one.\n\nI think D or S both work, but with D I go down immediately.\n\nPerhaps S is better, but no difference.\n\nLet's use the first one.\n\nIn the initial, I had a6=D to go down fast.\n\nBut let's write.\n\nAlso, in freeway 8, there is a car at t=6 with span including 0, but since I am not on y=8, no issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n\nBut H=9, but perhaps I can reach earlier if I go up after t=9 faster, but I have to go through each y.\n\nUnless I can skip, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=8 is safe at t=9, and I am at y=3, but if I could be at y=7 at t=10, but from y=3 at t=9, to y=7 at t=10, impossible.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nActions:\n\nAt turn 6: D  (to go to y=3 at t=7)\n\nAt turn 7: S  (stay y=3 at t=8)\n\nAt turn 8: S  (stay y=3 at t=9)\n\nAt turn 9: U  (to y=4 at t=10)\n\nAt turn 10: U  (to y=5 at t=11)\n\nAt turn 11: U  (to y=6 at t=12)\n\nAt turn 12: U  (to y=7 at t=13)\n\nAt turn 13: U  (to y=8 at t=14)\n\nAt turn 14: U  (to y=9 at t=15)\n\nAnd H=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 9, action U, which is to go up from y=3.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbers.\n\nt_1=6\n\nActions for turn t: a_t\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nAnd at turn 15, position (0,9)\n\nIn the action, at turn 14, U from y=8 to y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I can have a shorter path if I go to y=0, but y=0 is safe, but going down more takes more turns to come up.\n\nFor example, at t=6 D to y=3 t=7, then D to y=2 t=8, then D to y=1 t=9, then at t=9 U to y=2 t=10, etc, slower.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo H=9 is best.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of turns H=9, and the sequence as above.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 6: & D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: & U \\end{array} }\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so for turn 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.\n\nYes.\n\nSince t_1=6, and actions up to t_1 + H -1 =6+8=14.\n\nH=9.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), a sequence of actions must be determined that minimizes the number of turns \\(H\\). Collisions occur only if the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) at turn \\(T\\) and position 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Movements and Collision Times\nThe car states at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) are given for each freeway. All cars are right-moving, so their spans shift right over time. For each freeway, the times \\(T\\) when position 0 is covered by a car (indicating a collision risk if the player is on that freeway) are:\n\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: 0 covered at T=11, 12  \n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: 0 covered at T=11, 12  \n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: 0 covered at T=11, 12  \n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: 0 covered at T=8, 9  \n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: 0 covered at T=8, 9  \n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: 0 covered at T=8, 9  \n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: 0 covered at T=8, 9  \n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: 0 covered at T=6, 7, 8  \n\nAt turn \\(T=6\\), the player starts at \\(y=4\\) (freeway 4), which is safe since 0 is not covered on freeway 4 at \\(T=6\\). To minimize \\(H\\), the player must avoid being on freeways 4, 5, 6, or 7 at turns 8 and 9, and freeway 8 at turns 6, 7, and 8. The only safe freeways at \\(T=8\\) are \\(y=1, 2, 3\\), and at \\(T=9\\), the safe freeways are \\(y=1, 2, 3, 8\\). However, reaching \\(y=8\\) by \\(T=9\\) is impossible from the starting position with the movement constraints.\n\n### Path to Minimize Turns\nThe minimal path involves moving down to \\(y=3\\) by turn 8 to avoid collisions at turns 8 and 9, then moving up to \\(y=9\\) after the danger periods. The sequence is as follows:\n\n- At turn 6, action \\(D\\) (down) moves to \\(y=3\\) at turn 7.\n- At turn 7, action \\(S\\) (stay) keeps \\(y=3\\) at turn 8, safe since \\(y=3\\) has no collision at \\(T=8\\).\n- At turn 8, action \\(S\\) (stay) keeps \\(y=3\\) at turn 9, safe since \\(y=3\\) has no collision at \\(T=9\\).\n- After turn 9, all freeways are safe for upward movement. Actions \\(U\\) (up) are used to reach \\(y=9\\) by turn 15.\n\nThis path requires \\(H = 9\\) actions (turns 6 to 14), reaching \\(y=9\\) at turn 15. Any attempt to avoid the down movement or reach higher \\(y\\) earlier results in collision or more turns.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_t\\}\\) for \\(t = t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 6\\) to \\(14\\) is:\n\n- Turn 6: \\(D\\) (move down to \\(y=3\\) at turn 7)  \n- Turn 7: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y=3\\) for turn 8)  \n- Turn 8: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y=3\\) for turn 9)  \n- Turn 9: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y=4\\) at turn 10)  \n- Turn 10: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y=5\\) at turn 11)  \n- Turn 11: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y=6\\) at turn 12)  \n- Turn 12: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y=7\\) at turn 13)  \n- Turn 13: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y=8\\) at turn 14)  \n- Turn 14: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y=9\\) at turn 15)  \n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions and minimizes \\(H = 9\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 6: & D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: & U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,5) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 11, and I'm at y=5.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. All cars are moving right, so for each car, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)] since they're right-moving. Direction is given as \"right\" for all.\n\nLet me denote t = T - t₁, so t is the number of turns from now. At turn t₁ + t, the time elapsed is t turns.\n\nFor a right-moving car, initial head h, tail τ, speed s, at time t (from now), the span is:\n\n[τ + s * t, h + s * t]\n\nBecause it moves right, so both ends increase by s per turn.\n\nNow, collision occurs only if at the turn when I'm on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nImportant point: when I move from y to y+1 or y-1, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I only check for collision on that y_T at turn T. When I decide to move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and after the move, at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, so I don't check y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nFrom the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I only care about cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nNow, I start at y=5 at t=0 (turn t₁=11).\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nEach action: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same).\n\ny must be between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nSince I'm at 5 and need to go to 9, I need to go up, but I have to avoid cars on y=6,7,8 when I'm on them.\n\ny=1 to 8 have cars, but I start at y=5, which has cars? Freeway k=1 to 8 correspond to y=1 to 8, I assume.\n\nFreeway k is the y-level, I think.\n\nSo freeway 1 is y=1, freeway 2 is y=2, ..., freeway 8 is y=8.\n\nAt y=5, there are cars, so when I am on y=5, I need to make sure that at that turn, no car on y=5 has 0 in its span.\n\nSimilarly for other levels.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per freeway at t=0 (turn t₁=11).\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): cars: (0, -11, right, 6), (-36, -47, right, 6), (42, 31, right, 6)\n\nBut head and tail: for the first car, head=0, tail=-11? That seems odd, but I think tail is the left end, head is the right end for right-moving, so span [tail, head] or [head, tail]?\n\nLook at the car update: for right-moving, span(t₁) = [τ, h], and at T, [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nIn the table, it says (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor freeway 1: (h, τ, d, s) = (0, -11, right, 6), so at t₁, span is [τ, h] = [-11, 0] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (-36, -47, right, 6), span [-47, -36]\n\nThird car: (42, 31, right, 6), span [31,42]\n\nBut 31 to 42, that doesn't include 0, so only the first car has 0 in its span at t₁? Span [-11,0], so 0 is included.\n\nAt t=0, for y=1, car 1 span [-11,0], which includes 0, so if I were on y=1 at t=0, I would collide, but I'm not, I'm at y=5.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? Cars: (0, -11, right, 6), (-36, -47, right, 6), (42, 31, right, 6) — identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: same again.\n\nFreeway 4: (18,7,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6) — so first car: h=18, τ=7? Head 18, tail 7, so span [7,18] for right-moving? d=right, so span at t₁ is [τ, h] = [7,18]\n\nSecond car: (-48,-59,right,6), span [-59,-48]\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 6: same.\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 8: (-20,-31,right,4), (56,45,right,4), (20,9,right,4)\n\nFirst car: h=-20? Head -20, tail -31, d=right, so span [τ, h] = [-31, -20]\n\nSecond car: h=56, τ=45, span [45,56]\n\nThird car: h=20, τ=9, span [9,20]\n\nNow, at t=0, which freeways have a car with 0 in span?\n\nFor y=1: span [-11,0] contains 0.\n\ny=2: same, [-11,0] contains 0.\n\ny=3: same, contains 0.\n\ny=4: first car [7,18] no 0, second [-59,-48] no, so no car has 0 in span at t=0.\n\ny=5: same as y=4, no 0.\n\ny=6: same, no 0.\n\ny=7: same, no 0.\n\ny=8: first car [-31,-20] no 0, second [45,56] no, third [9,20] no, so no 0.\n\nSo at t=0, only y=1,2,3 have a car at position 0.\n\nBut I'm at y=5, which is safe at t=0.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9. y=9 is the goal, and it's not a freeway, so no cars there. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, but y=0 might have something, but the goal is (0,9), which is not on a freeway.\n\nThe collision is only with cars on freeways y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be fine, no cars.\n\nBut when I'm at y=0 or y=9, I don't need to worry about cars.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=5, I need to increase y by 4, so minimum 4 turns if I go up each time, but I might need to stay or go down to avoid cars.\n\nSince cars are moving, the spans change over time.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions so that when I am on a freeway y at turn t, 0 is not in any car's span on that y at that turn.\n\nLet t be the turn offset, t=0,1,2,... at t=0, position y=5.\n\nI need y_H = 9 for some H.\n\nH is the number of turns from t=0, so at turn t, after t actions, y_t is the position.\n\nAt time t (turn t₁ + t), position y_t.\n\ny_0 = 5\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on action a_t.\n\nI need to reach y_t = 9 for some t, and minimize t.\n\nSince I start at 5 and need to go to 9, and I can only change by -1,0,1 each turn, the minimum possible H is 4, if I go up each turn: y=5,6,7,8,9 in 4 steps.\n\nBut I need to check if I can be on y=6 at some t, y=7 at some t, etc., without collision.\n\ny=5 is safe at t=0, as we saw.\n\nNow, let's see for each freeway, when 0 is occupied by a car.\n\nFor a given freeway k, at time t, 0 is in a car's span if for some car, τ + s*t <= 0 <= h + s*t for right-moving.\n\nSince all are right-moving, I can find for each k, the times when 0 is covered.\n\nThen for each y and t, I can see if it's safe.\n\nBut y from 1 to 8.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway the cars and their span over time.\n\nSince s and positions, I can find when the span covers 0.\n\nFor a car, at time t, the span is [τ + s*t, h + s*t] for right-moving.\n\n0 is covered if τ + s*t <= 0 and 0 <= h + s*t, which is τ + s*t <= 0 <= h + s*t.\n\nSince τ <= h for right-moving? In the span, for right-moving, at start, τ is tail (left), h is head (right), so τ <= h, so [τ, h] with τ <= h.\n\nSo 0 in [τ + s*t, h + s*t] iff τ + s*t <= 0 <= h + s*t.\n\nWhich is equivalent to -h/s <= t <= -τ/s, but since t integer, and s integer, I think.\n\ns is speed, given as numbers, probably integers.\n\ns=6 or 4, integers.\n\nt is integer, time in turns.\n\nSo for each car, I can find the interval of t where it covers 0.\n\nThen for a freeway, if any car covers 0 at time t, it's unsafe.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nNow, let's do this for each k.\n\nFirst, freeway k=1 (y=1):\n\nCars:\n\n1. h=0, τ=-11, s=6, right\n\nCover 0 when: τ + s*t <= 0 <= h + s*t\n\n-11 + 6t <= 0 <= 0 + 6t\n\nLeft: -11 + 6t <= 0 => 6t <= 11 => t <= 11/6 ≈ 1.833, so t <= 1 since t integer? t <= floor(11/6)=1? Let's see.\n\n-11 + 6t <= 0 => 6t <= 11 => t <= 11/6 = 1.833, so for t <= 1\n\nRight: 0 <= 0 + 6t => 0 <= 6t, true for t >= 0\n\nSo both: t <= 1 and t >= 0, so t=0 and t=1.\n\nAt t=0: -11 +0 = -11 <=0, 0<=0, yes.\n\nt=1: -11+6= -5 <=0, 0<=6, yes.\n\nt=2: -11+12=1 >0? 1 <=0? τ + s t = -11 +12 =1, which is >0, so 0 not <= 1? Condition: τ + s t <= 0 and 0 <= h + s t\n\nAt t=2: τ + s t = -11 +12 =1 >0, so τ + s t <=0 false, so not covered.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= h + s t =0 +12=12, true, but first condition false.\n\nSo only t=0,1.\n\nNow second car: h=-36, τ=-47, s=6\n\nCover 0: τ + s t <=0 <= h + s t\n\n-47 +6t <=0 <= -36 +6t\n\nLeft: -47 +6t <=0 => 6t <=47 => t <= 47/6 ≈7.833, t<=7\n\nRight: 0 <= -36 +6t => 36 <=6t => t >= 6\n\nSo t from 6 to 7 inclusive.\n\nt=6: -47+36= -11 <=0, 0 <= -36+36=0, yes 0<=0.\n\nt=7: -47+42= -5 <=0, 0 <= -36+42=6, yes.\n\nt=8: -47+48=1>0, not <=0, so not covered.\n\nThird car: h=42, τ=31, s=6\n\nCover 0: 31 +6t <=0 <=42+6t\n\nLeft: 31+6t <=0 => 6t <= -31, impossible since t>=0, 6t>=0 > -31, so never true. So never covers 0.\n\nSo for y=1, unsafe when t=0,1 (from first car) or t=6,7 (from second car)\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1, since same cars, so same unsafe times: t=0,1,6,7\n\nFreeway 3: same, t=0,1,6,7\n\nNow freeway 4 (y=4):\n\nCars: (18,7,right,6) and (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nFirst car: h=18, τ=7, s=6\n\nCover 0: τ + s t <=0 <= h + s t => 7 +6t <=0 <=18+6t\n\nLeft: 7+6t <=0 => 6t <= -7, impossible, so never.\n\nSecond car: h=-48, τ=-59, s=6\n\nCover 0: -59 +6t <=0 <= -48 +6t\n\nLeft: -59+6t <=0 => 6t <=59 => t <= 59/6≈9.833, t<=9\n\nRight: 0 <= -48 +6t => 48 <=6t => t >=8\n\nSo t from 8 to 9 inclusive.\n\nt=8: -59+48= -11 <=0, 0 <= -48+48=0, yes.\n\nt=9: -59+54= -5 <=0, 0 <= -48+54=6, yes.\n\nt=10: -59+60=1>0, not <=0.\n\nSo for y=4, unsafe only at t=8,9\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nNow freeway 5: same as y=4, since same cars? Freeway 5 has same as 4: (18,7,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6) — yes, identical to freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6: same.\n\nFreeway 7: same, unsafe at t=8,9\n\nNow freeway 8 (y=8):\n\nCars: (-20,-31,right,4), (56,45,right,4), (20,9,right,4)\n\nFirst car: h=-20, τ=-31, s=4\n\nCover 0: τ + s t <=0 <= h + s t => -31 +4t <=0 <= -20 +4t\n\nLeft: -31+4t <=0 => 4t <=31 => t <= 31/4=7.75, t<=7\n\nRight: 0 <= -20 +4t => 20 <=4t => t >=5\n\nSo t from 5 to 7 inclusive.\n\nt=5: -31+20= -11 <=0, 0 <= -20+20=0, yes.\n\nt=6: -31+24= -7 <=0, 0 <= -20+24=4, yes.\n\nt=7: -31+28= -3 <=0, 0 <= -20+28=8, yes.\n\nt=8: -31+32=1>0, not <=0.\n\nSecond car: h=56, τ=45, s=4\n\nCover 0: 45+4t <=0 <=56+4t\n\nLeft: 45+4t <=0, impossible, never.\n\nThird car: h=20, τ=9, s=4\n\nCover 0: 9+4t <=0 <=20+4t\n\nLeft: 9+4t <=0, impossible, never.\n\nSo only first car covers 0 at t=5,6,7.\n\nThus for y=8, unsafe at t=5,6,7\n\nNow, summarize for each y and t, safe or not.\n\ny from 1 to 8, t=0,1,2,...\n\nBut I need for the positions I might be at.\n\nSince I start at y=5 at t=0, and y=5 is safe at t=0, as we saw earlier.\n\nNow, let's make a table for t and y, but y I care about when I might be there.\n\nSince I need to go to y=9, and start at y=5, I should consider moving up through y=6,7,8.\n\ny=6,7,8 are freeways, y=9 is not.\n\nNow, for y=5: freeway 5, which has unsafe times t=8,9, as above.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 same as y=5, unsafe t=8,9\n\ny=7 same, unsafe t=8,9\n\ny=8 unsafe t=5,6,7\n\ny=4 unsafe t=8,9, but I might not go there.\n\nNow, at t=0, I am at y=5, safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimum steps: from y=5 to y=9, I need to be at y=6,7,8,9 at some points.\n\nBut I can stay or move down, but that might increase H.\n\nSince the unsafe times are in the future, I might go quickly before the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, y=8 is unsafe at t=5,6,7, so I should avoid being on y=8 at t=5,6,7.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,6,7 unsafe at t=8,9.\n\nBut t=8,9 is later.\n\nNow, let me list the unsafe periods:\n\n- y=1,2,3: unsafe t=0,1 and t=6,7\n\n- y=4,5,6,7: unsafe t=8,9\n\n- y=8: unsafe t=5,6,7\n\nOther times, these are safe, but other y might have issues, but from above, y=1,2,3 have unsafe at t=0,1,6,7, but I don't plan to go there, so irrelevant.\n\ny=4,5,6,7 have unsafe only at t=8,9, and safe otherwise? y=4 is same as above, unsafe t=8,9 only, similarly 5,6,7.\n\ny=8 unsafe t=5,6,7 only.\n\nFor t not in those, safe.\n\nNow, I need to be on y=6, y=7, y=8 at some safe times.\n\nSince I start at y=5 at t=0, safe.\n\nI can go up to y=6 at t=1, or stay, etc.\n\nLet me consider possible paths.\n\nFirst, if I go directly up: actions U,U,U,U\n\nThen positions:\n\nt=0: y=5, safe\n\nt=1: move U to y=6? At turn t=1, after action, y=6.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nt=0: y=5\n\nAfter action a_0, at turn t=1, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\nIf I do a_0 = U, then y_1 = 6\n\nNow, at turn t=1, I am on y=6.\n\nIs y=6 safe at t=1?\n\ny=6 unsafe only at t=8,9, so at t=1, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, if a_1 = U, y_2 =7 at turn t=2.\n\ny=7 safe at t=2? Unsafe only t=8,9, yes safe.\n\nThen a_2 = U, y_3 =8 at turn t=3.\n\ny=8 at t=3: unsafe times t=5,6,7, so t=3 is safe.\n\nThen a_3 = U, y_4 =9 at turn t=4.\n\ny=9 not freeway, safe.\n\nSo in 4 turns: t=0 to t=4, H=4 turns? t from 0 to 3 actions, y at t=4.\n\nLet's see the sequence:\n\nTurn t₁ + t: at time offset t, position after action? Better to think of the state at each turn.\n\nAt turn T = t₁ + t, position y_T.\n\nFor t=0: T=11, y=5\n\nAfter action a_{t₁} or a_0, at turn T=12, y=6 if U\n\nThen at turn T=12, I am on y=6.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn terms of t:\n\nt=0: turn 11, y=5\n\nAction a_0: if U, then at t=1, turn 12, y=6\n\nAction a_1: if U, at t=2, turn 13, y=7\n\nAction a_2: if U, at t=3, turn 14, y=8\n\nAction a_3: if U, at t=4, turn 15, y=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt turn 11 (t=0): on y=5, safe as before.\n\nAt turn 12 (t=1): on y=6. y=6 unsafe at t=8,9? t is offset, t=1, which is not 8 or 9, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 13 (t=2): on y=7, safe since t=2 not 8 or 9.\n\nTurn 14 (t=3): on y=8, y=8 unsafe at t=5,6,7? t=3, not 5,6,7, so safe.\n\nThen turn 15 (t=4): on y=9, safe.\n\nSo with H=4, actions U,U,U,U, I reach at t=4.\n\nBut is that minimal? H=4 is the minimum possible since I need to increase by 4.\n\nBut let me confirm the times.\n\nt=0: turn 11, y=5\n\nAfter first U: turn 12, y=6\n\nIs y=6 safe at turn 12? Turn 12 corresponds to t=1, since t=0 is turn 11, t=1 is turn 12.\n\ny=6 unsafe when? For freeway 6, which is same as y=4,5,7, unsafe at t=8,9.\n\nt=8: turn 11+8=19, t=9: turn 20.\n\nAt turn 12, t=1, not 8 or 9, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 13: t=2, y=7, safe.\n\nTurn 14: t=3, y=8, y=8 unsafe at t=5,6,7: t=5 turn 16, t=6 turn 17, t=7 turn 18.\n\nTurn 14 is t=3, not in 5-7, safe.\n\nTurn 15: y=9, safe.\n\nSo yes, I can reach in 4 turns with U,U,U,U.\n\nBut the problem is to output the actions starting from turn t₁.\n\nSo for turn t₁=11: action a_{11}\n\nIn the sequence, actions for turn t₁, t₁+1, ..., up to t₁+H-1, and at turn t₁+H, position is 9.\n\nIn this case, actions at turn 11,12,13,14, and at turn 15, position 9.\n\nSo H=4 actions? Let's see.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t₁ + H, position y_{t₁+H}.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn t₁, y_{t₁}\n\nAfter first action, turn t₁+1, y_{t₁+1}\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, turn t₁+H, y_{t₁+H}\n\nWe want y_{t₁+H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions {a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn this case, with H=4, actions at t=0,1,2,3: a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13}, a_{14} all U.\n\nThen at turn 15, y=9.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nI think I missed something.\n\nAt turn 14, when I am on y=8, is it safe?\n\nt=3, which is not unsafe for y=8.\n\nBut let me double-check the car for y=8 at t=3.\n\ny=8, freeway 8, at time t=3 from now.\n\nCars: first car, span [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-31 + 4*3, -20 + 4*3] = [-31+12, -20+12] = [-19, -8]\n\n0 not in [-19,-8], since -8<0? -8 <=0? -8 <0, so 0 not <= -8? 0 > -8, so not in interval.\n\nSimilarly, other cars don't cover 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, at other points.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 8, there is a car with head 20, tail 9, span [9,20] at t=0, which is far right, not near 0.\n\nAt t=3, [9+12,20+12]=[21,32], not near 0.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut the problem is that for freeways 1,2,3, they have cars at t=0,1, but I'm not there.\n\nBut in this path, I only go to y=5,6,7,8, all safe at the times I'm there.\n\ny=5 at t=0 safe, y=6 at t=1 safe, etc.\n\nBut is y=5 safe at t=0? Freeway 5, at t=0, cars: (18,7,right,6) span [7,18] not contain 0, and (-48,-59,right,6) span [-59,-48] not contain 0, so yes.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo it seems I can go directly in 4 turns.\n\nBut why is the car state given? Perhaps I need to consider if I can go faster or something, but 4 is minimum.\n\nPerhaps at some point I have to avoid, but here no need.\n\nBut let me check if at turn 14, y=8 is safe, t=3.\n\ny=8 unsafe only t=5,6,7, so t=3 fine.\n\nt=5 is turn 16, etc.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I can go to y=9 faster, but I can't, since each step changes by at most 1.\n\nUnless I start from y=5, but y=5 to y=9, min 4 steps.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=6 at t=1, but if I do something else, but no need.\n\nBut in the car for freeway 8, at t=4, what happens?\n\nt=4, y=8: span first car: [-31 +4*4, -20+16] = [-31+16, -20+16] = [-15,-4], 0 not in, since -4<0.\n\nt=5: [-31+20, -20+20] = [-11,0], which includes 0, unsafe.\n\nBut at t=4, if I were on y=8, but in my path, at t=3 I am on y=8, then I go up to y=9 at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, I am on y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5,6,7 unsafe at t=8,9, but I reach before that.\n\nt=8 is turn 19, I am at y=9 long before.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nPerhaps I should output the actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", but in this case H=4.\n\nBut is there a reason to think it might not be possible? Seems it is.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car positions.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 1,2,3, at t=0, there is a car at [ -11,0], which includes 0, but I'm not there.\n\nBut for y=4,5,6,7, at t=0, no car at 0.\n\ny=8 no car at 0 at t=0.\n\nBut at t=1, for example, y=1: first car span at t=1: [-11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6], which includes 0, since -5<=0<=6, yes.\n\nBut again, I'm not on y=1.\n\nIn my path, at t=1, I am on y=6.\n\ny=6 at t=1: freeway 6, cars same as y=4.\n\nAt t=1, span first car: [7 +6*1, 18+6] = [13,24] not contain 0.\n\nSecond car: [-59+6, -48+6] = [-53,-42] not contain 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, at t=4, if I delay, but I don't.\n\nI think it should work.\n\nBut let me see if I can do in less than 4, impossible.\n\nSo minimal H is 4.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence.\n\nPerhaps I need to write the actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn t_1=11: action U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nThen at turn 15, position (0,9)\n\nSo H=4.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbering.\n\nTurn t_1 =11: position (0,5)\n\nAfter action a_{11}, at turn 12, position new.\n\na_{11} is action at turn 11.\n\nIn the dynamics, at turn t, you choose action a_t, then position updates for turn t+1.\n\nBut collision is checked at the turn when you are on the position.\n\nFrom the note: when you are at turn T on position y_T, you check collision for freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nIn this case:\n\nAt turn 11: position y=5, on freeway 5, check cars on y=5 at turn 11 (t=0), safe.\n\nChoose action a_{11} = U, so at turn 12, position y=6.\n\nAt turn 12: position y=6, on freeway 6, check cars on y=6 at turn 12 (t=1), safe as above.\n\nChoose action a_{12} = U, at turn 13, y=7.\n\nAt turn 13: y=7, on freeway 7 at turn 13 (t=2), safe.\n\nChoose a_{13} = U, at turn 14, y=8.\n\nAt turn 14: y=8, on freeway 8 at turn 14 (t=3), safe.\n\nChoose a_{14} = U, at turn 15, y=9, not freeway, done.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut is freeway 8 safe at turn 14?\n\nTurn 14 is t=3, as above.\n\nPerhaps I should compute the span.\n\nTurn 14: since t_1=11, turn 14 is T =14, so t = T - t_1 = 14-11=3.\n\ny=8, freeway 8:\n\nFirst car: at t=0, span [τ, h] = [-31,-20], s=4, so at T=14, t=3, span [ -31 +4*3, -20 +4*3] = [-31+12, -20+12] = [-19,-8], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [45,56] at t=0, at t=3 [45+12,56+12]=[57,68] no.\n\nThird car: [9,20] at t=0, at t=3 [9+12,20+12]=[21,32] no.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo I think H=4 is possible.\n\nBut the problem might have a trick, because for freeway 1,2,3, at t=6,7 they are unsafe, but I don't care.\n\nPerhaps I need to avoid being on certain lanes at certain times, but in this path, no issue.\n\nMaybe I can go faster by not staying, but I can't.\n\nOr perhaps go down, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo minimal H is 4.\n\nBut let me see the car state again.\n\nIn freeway 4,5,6,7, there is a car with head 18, tail 7 at t=0, which is [7,18], and at t=1, [13,24], etc., never near 0 except at t=8,9 as computed.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, if I were there at t=4, but I'm not.\n\nAt t=4, y=8: span first car [-31+16, -20+16]=[-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nBut in my path, at t=4 I am at y=9.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 4, with actions U,U,U,U.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut the boxed.\n\nBut let me write it.\n\n**Answer**\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: & U \\end{array} }\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut is there a possibility that I need to wait or something? For example, if I couldn't go directly, but here I can.\n\nPerhaps I miscomputed the unsafe times.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 1,2,3, at t=0, car (0,-11,right,6), head=0, tail=-11, so at t=0, position 0 is occupied, but for other freeways not.\n\nBut for y=5, at t=0, no car at 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps at turn 12, when I am on y=6, but y=6 has cars, but at t=1, not at 0.\n\nI think I'm overthinking.\n\nSo I believe this is correct.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 11\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis\n- The player starts at \\(y = 5\\) at turn 11.\n- The target is \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway and thus has no collision risk.\n- The minimum number of turns required to increase \\(y\\) from 5 to 9 is 4, as each action changes \\(y\\) by at most 1 (using \"U\" to move up).\n- Collision occurs only if, at turn \\(T\\), the player is on a freeway \\(y_T\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y_T \\leq 8\\)) and position 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\).\n\nThe car spans and unsafe times for each freeway are derived as follows:\n\n- **Freeways 1, 2, 3**: Identical cars. Unsafe at turns \\(t = 0, 1, 6, 7\\) (relative to \\(t_1 = 11\\), so absolute turns 11, 12, 17, 18). Not relevant as the player stays on \\(y \\geq 5\\).\n- **Freeways 4, 5, 6, 7**: Identical cars. Unsafe only at \\(t = 8, 9\\) (absolute turns 19, 20). Safe at all other times, including \\(t = 0, 1, 2, 3\\).\n- **Freeway 8**: Unsafe at \\(t = 5, 6, 7\\) (absolute turns 16, 17, 18). Safe at all other times, including \\(t = 3\\).\n\nThe direct path with actions \"U\" (up) at each turn is feasible:\n- At turn 11 (\\(t = 0\\)): Position \\(y = 5\\). Freeway 5 is safe (no car covers 0 at \\(t = 0\\)).\n- At turn 12 (\\(t = 1\\)): Position \\(y = 6\\). Freeway 6 is safe (not unsafe at \\(t = 1\\)).\n- At turn 13 (\\(t = 2\\)): Position \\(y = 7\\). Freeway 7 is safe (not unsafe at \\(t = 2\\)).\n- At turn 14 (\\(t = 3\\)): Position \\(y = 8\\). Freeway 8 is safe (not unsafe at \\(t = 3\\)).\n- At turn 15 (\\(t = 4\\)): Position \\(y = 9\\), goal reached with no collision risk.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H = 4\\) turns, which is minimal. No alternative sequence can reach \\(y = 9\\) in fewer than 4 turns.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe actions for turns \\(t_1 = 11\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 14\\) are all \"U\" (up).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: & U \\end{array} }",
