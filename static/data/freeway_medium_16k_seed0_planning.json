The cars are moving, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row, there's no car that covers position x=0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. All cars seem to be right-moving, based on the data. Let me list out the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, (h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=3). Since it's right-moving, the span is [τ, h] = [37, 48], and it moves right at speed 3.\n\nIn the span notation, for right-moving, it's given as [τ, h] initially, and then at time T, it's [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all here are right-moving.\n\nt1 is the current turn, which is 0 in this case, since t0=0.\n\nSo current turn t=0.\n\nPlayer at (0,0), which is not on a freeway, since freeways are y=1 to 8. y=0 and y=9 are probably safe, but we need to reach (0,9).\n\ny=0 is the starting point, and y=9 is the goal. Since freeways are y=1 to 8, we need to move through those rows, but only when we are on that row, we check for collision at x=0.\n\nNow, collision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on freeway k (so y_T = k), and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn T.\n\nAlso, when we move, we are not on the new row until the next turn. For example, if at turn T I move from y to y+1, then at turn T, I am on y, and at turn T+1, I am on y+1. So for collision, at each turn, I care about the row I'm currently on at that turn.\n\nThe note says: if I decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, I will NOT be considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I won't be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 is in span at T but not at T+1. But since I'm not on y_{T+1} at T, I don't care about that row at T anyway.\n\nThe key point is that collision is checked only for the row I'm currently on at each turn.\n\nAlso, at y=0 and y=9, there are no cars, so no collision possible there.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9, so I need to pass through y=1 to 8, but I can stay or move up/down, but since I start at 0 and need to go to 9, I should be moving up most of the time, but I might need to wait or move down to avoid cars, but moving down might not be efficient since I need to go up.\n\nBut let's see the car positions and speeds.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each row.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=3)\n\nSince right-moving, initial span at t=0: [τ, h] = [37, 48]\n\nAt time T, span: [37 + 3T, 48 + 3T]\n\nCollision if y_T = 1 and 0 in [37 + 3T, 48 + 3T]\n\nBut 37 + 3T <= 0 <= 48 + 3T? Since the car is at position around 40, which is far right, and moving right, so for x=0, it's never covered because the span is always positive and increasing, so 0 is never in [37+3T, 48+3T] for T>=0, since min is 37>0? 37>0, yes, and increasing, so always positive, never near 0. So on row 1, no car ever covers x=0. Is that right?\n\n[37 + 3T, 48 + 3T], T>=0, min is 37 at T=0, which is greater than 0, so 0 < 37 <= left end, so 0 not in interval. Similarly for all T, left end 37+3T >=37>0, so x=0 is never occupied on row 1. So row 1 is always safe.\n\nBut let's confirm the span. For right-moving, initial [τ, h] = [37,48], so positions from 37 to 48 inclusive? I think it's a continuous span, but since it's grid, probably integer positions.\n\nThe collision is if 0 is in the span, meaning the car covers position 0.\n\nBut with [37,48] at T=0, and moving right, it will always be to the right of 0, so no issue for x=0.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nNow freeway 2: three cars:\n\nCar1: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nDirection right, but head and tail: it says head h=-48, tail τ=-59? But for right-moving, the span should be [τ, h], but if τ is tail and h is head, and moving right, if tail is left and head is right.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h], which is from tail to head, so tail should be less than head.\n\nHere for car1: τ=-59, h=-48, so τ < h, since -59 < -48, so [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nThen at time T, span = [ -59 + 12T, -48 + 12T ]\n\nSimilarly, car2: (-12, -23, right, 12)\n\nτ=-23, h=-12? It says (-12, -23, ...) but head and tail: let's see the tuple: (head h, tail τ, direction, speed)\n\nIn the table: Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor car2 on row2: (-12, -23, right, 12)\n\nSo h=-12, τ=-23\n\nSince d=right, initial span [τ, h] = [-23, -12]? τ is tail, h is head, so for right-moving, tail is left, head is right, so if τ < h, then [τ, h] is correct.\n\nHere τ=-23, h=-12, so τ < h, -23 < -12, so initial span [-23, -12]\n\nSimilarly, car3: (24, 13, right, 12) so h=24, τ=13, τ=13 < h=24, so [13,24]\n\nNow for row2, at time T, the spans are:\n\nCar1: [ -59 + 12T, -48 + 12T ]\n\nCar2: [ -23 + 12T, -12 + 12T ]  // since initial [-23,-12]\n\nCar3: [13 + 12T, 24 + 12T]\n\nCollision on row2 if at turn T, y_T=2 and 0 in any of these spans.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nBut row2 has multiple cars, so if 0 in any span at T, collision.\n\nNow let's find when 0 is covered for each car on row2.\n\nFirst car: 0 in [ -59 + 12T, -48 + 12T ] ?\n\nSo -59 + 12T <= 0 <= -48 + 12T\n\nSince the interval is inclusive, I assume.\n\nSo left: -59 + 12T <= 0 => 12T <= 59 => T <= 59/12 = 4.916, so T <= 4 since T integer? T is turn, discrete.\n\nT is turn number, integer, starting from 0.\n\nSimilarly, right: 0 <= -48 + 12T => 12T >= 48 => T >= 4\n\nSo for T=4: -59 + 12*4 = -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, so [ -11, 0 ], and 0 <=0, so 0 is included since <=.\n\n-48 + 12T at T=4: -48+48=0, so right end is 0.\n\nSimilarly, left end -59+48= -11.\n\nSo [ -11, 0 ], so 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, at T=5: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 1>0, so 0 not in.\n\nAt T=3: -59+36= -23, -48+36= -12, [ -23, -12], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=4, car1 covers 0? At T=4, span [ -11, 0], so position 0 is covered.\n\nNow car2: [ -23 +12T, -12 +12T ]\n\n0 in [ -23+12T, -12+12T ]\n\nLeft: -23+12T <=0 => 12T <=23 => T<=23/12=1.916, T<=1\n\nRight: 0 <= -12+12T => 12T >=12 => T>=1\n\nSo for T=1: -23+12= -11, -12+12=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nT=2: -23+24=1, -12+24=12, [1,12], not 0.\n\nT=0: [-23,-12], not 0.\n\nSo car2 covers 0 at T=1.\n\nCar3: [13+12T, 24+12T], min 13>0 at T=0, increasing, so always >0, never covers 0.\n\nSo for row2, collision at T=1 (from car2) and T=4 (from car1).\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? According to table:\n\nFreeway 3: (-48,-59,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12), (24,13,right,12)\n\nIdentical to row2? But different row.\n\nCars are the same as row2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same, (-48,-59,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12), (24,13,right,12)\n\nAnd freeway 5: (48,37,right,6) but head 48, tail 37? h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=6\n\nτ=37, h=48, so for right-moving, initial span [τ,h] = [37,48]\n\nAt T: [37+6T, 48+6T], always positive and increasing, min 37>0, so never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same, (48,37,right,6), so same as row5? No, row5 and row6 both have this car, but it's the same type, but different rows.\n\nFreeway 6: (48,37,right,6), so identical to row5.\n\nThen freeway 7: (-48,-59,right,4)\n\nh=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=4\n\nInitial span [τ,h] = [-59,-48]\n\nAt T: [-59 +4T, -48 +4T]\n\n0 in this when -59+4T <=0 <= -48+4T\n\nLeft: -59+4T <=0 => 4T<=59 => T<=14.75, T<=14\n\nRight: 0<= -48+4T => 4T>=48 => T>=12\n\nSo for T=12: -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, [ -11,0], 0 included\n\nT=13: -59+52= -7, -48+52=4, [ -7,4], 0 included? -7<=0<=4, yes\n\nT=14: -59+56= -3, -48+56=8, [ -3,8], 0 included\n\nT=15: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], not 0\n\nT=11: -59+44= -15, -48+44= -4, [ -15,-4], not 0\n\nSo car on row7 covers 0 at T=12,13,14\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as row7, (-48,-59,right,4), so covers 0 at T=12,13,14\n\nNow, back to row1: we said no cover at 0.\n\nRow2: covers at T=1 and T=4\n\nRow3: same as row2, so covers at T=1 and T=4\n\nRow4: same, T=1 and T=4\n\nRow5: no cover, as span always >0\n\nRow6: no cover\n\nRow7: covers at T=12,13,14\n\nRow8: same, T=12,13,14\n\nNow, the player starts at turn t=0, position y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nEach turn, I can move up, down, or stay, changing y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\ny must be integer between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nAt each turn, when I am on a freeway row (y=1 to 8), I must not be there when that row has a car covering x=0 at that turn.\n\nSince I start at y=0 at t=0, and y=0 is safe.\n\nI need to end at y=9, which is also safe.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H, meaning the number of actions, from t=0 to t=H-1, so after H actions, at time H, I am at position.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, I perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position is updated after action.\n\nDefine the state.\n\nAt time t (turn t), I am at position (0, y_t).\n\nI perform action a_t, which causes y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nThen at time t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nCollision is checked at each time t for the row y_t, if y_t is between 1 and 8, and if there is a car on that row with 0 in span at time t.\n\nIn the collision rule: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the row at turn T.\n\nAlso, the note about moving: when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, not on y_{T+1} yet.\n\nSo for each turn T, I need y_T, and for that, if 1<= y_T <=8, then no car on row y_T should have 0 in span at T.\n\nNow, to go from y=0 to y=9, I need to increase y by 9, so minimum 9 moves up, but I might stay or move down, which would require more turns, so to minimize H, I should avoid unnecessary moves and go up as fast as possible, but avoiding the collision times.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=0 to t=H-1, so after H actions, I reach y=9 at time H.\n\nStart: at t=0, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_0 at t=0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{H-1} at t=H-1, y_H = y_{H-1} + Δy_{H-1} =9\n\nAnd y_t for t=0 to H-1 must be safe, meaning no collision at those times.\n\nAt time t, position y_t must be safe.\n\nFor t=0, y=0, safe.\n\nAt time H, y_H=9, safe, but since we reach y=9 at time H, and time H is not when we perform action, I think we only care up to time H-1 for actions, but for collision, we care about time t from 0 to H-1, since at time t, we are on y_t.\n\nWhen we reach time H, we are at y_H=9, and no action at H, so we don't check collision at time H, I think. The collision is during the path, up to when we are moving.\n\nThe goal is to have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, but in terms of time index.\n\nIn the problem: \"reach (0,9)\" and \"at turn T for collision\".\n\nSet t1=0 for simplicity.\n\nStart at time 0, y=0.\n\nAfter H turns (actions), at time H, we should be at y=9.\n\nAnd for each time t from 0 to H-1, we are at y_t, and it must be safe (no collision).\n\nAt time H, we are at y=9, which is safe, and no action, so no issue.\n\nSo we need to find actions from t=0 to t=H-1 such that y_H=9, and for t=0 to H-1, y_t safe.\n\ny_t starts at 0, ends at 9.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1, so to go from 0 to 9, net +9, so if I only move up, H=9, y_t = t for t=0 to 9, but y_t from 0 to 9, at times t=0 to 9, but at time t, y_t=t.\n\nThen we need to check for each t, if y_t between 1 and 8, is it safe at that time.\n\nBut y_t = t for t=0 to 8, and at t=9, y=9.\n\nBut for collision, we care t=0 to 8, since at t=9, y=9 safe.\n\ny_t from t=0: y0=0, y1=1, ..., y8=8, y9=9.\n\nFor t from 0 to 8, y_t = t.\n\nNow for each row:\n\nRow 1: y_t=1 when t=1.\n\nAt t=1, is row1 safe? Row1 has no car covering 0 at any time, as we saw, so safe.\n\nRow 2: y_t=2 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, row2: from earlier, row2 has collision at t=1 and t=4.\n\nAt t=2, is there collision? For row2, cars: at t=2, car1 span [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24], not 0\n\nCar2: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], not 0? -23+24=1, -12+24=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nCar3: [13+24,24+24]= [37,48], not 0.\n\nSo at t=2, no car covers 0 on row2. Only at t=1 and t=4.\n\nSimilarly, row3: same as row2, so at t=3, y_t=3.\n\nAt t=3, row3: similar to row2 at t=3.\n\nRow3 cars: same as row2, at t=3:\n\nCar1: [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23,-12], not 0\n\nCar2: [-23+36, -12+36] = [13,24], not 0\n\nCar3: [13+36,24+36]= [49,60], not 0\n\nNo cover at t=3.\n\nBut row3 has collision at t=1 and t=4, same as row2.\n\nAt t=4, y_t=4 for row4? Let's systematic.\n\nIn the direct path, y_t = t for t=0 to 8.\n\nAt time t, row y_t=t.\n\nFor t=1: row1, safe, no issue.\n\nt=2: row2, at t=2, as above, no cover, safe.\n\nt=3: row3, at t=3, no cover as above, safe.\n\nt=4: row4, at t=4, row4 has cars same as row2, so at t=4, car1 covers 0? Row4 car1: [-59 +12*4, -48+12*4] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], 0 included, so collision if on row4 at t=4.\n\nBut in direct path, at t=4, y_t=4, which is row4, and 0 covered, so collision. Not safe.\n\nSimilarly, row4 at t=4 is unsafe.\n\nt=5: row5, at t=5, row5 has car (48,37,right,6), span at T: [37+6T,48+6T], at T=5, [37+30,48+30]=[67,78], not 0, and row5 always safe, as no cover.\n\nt=6: row6, similar, safe.\n\nt=7: row7, at t=7, row7 has car (-48,-59,right,4), span at T: [-59+4T, -48+4T]\n\nAt T=7: [-59+28, -48+28] = [-31, -20], not 0.\n\nBut row7 covers at T=12,13,14, so at t=7, not covered.\n\nt=8: row8, similar, at t=8: [-59+32, -48+32] = [-27,-16], not 0.\n\nThen t=9, y=9, safe.\n\nBut at t=4, on row4, collision.\n\nSo direct path not possible because at t=4, on row4, which has car covering 0.\n\nSimilarly, row2 and row3 also have issue at t=1 and t=4, but in this path, at t=1, y=1 row1 safe; t=2 row2 safe; t=3 row3 safe; only t=4 row4 unsafe.\n\nBut row4 is unsafe only at t=4? Row4 has same cars as row2, unsafe at t=1 and t=4.\n\nBut at t=4, y=4, row4 unsafe.\n\nTo avoid, I need to not be on row4 at t=4.\n\nSince row4 is unsafe only at t=4, but safe at other times.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nNow, rows 1,5,6 are always safe.\n\nRows 2,3,4: unsafe at t=1 and t=4.\n\nRows 7,8: unsafe at t=12,13,14.\n\nBut since we start from t=0, and want minimal H, probably H small, so t=12,13,14 might not be reached if H small.\n\nIn direct path, H=9, but fails at t=4.\n\nSo I need to delay or something.\n\nFor example, at t=4, I should not be on row4.\n\nBut row4 is unsafe only at t=4, safe at other times.\n\nSimilarly, I could be on row4 at different time.\n\nSince I can move slower or faster, or even move down.\n\nBut moving down might cost extra turns.\n\nTo minimize H, I should avoid the critical times.\n\nList the unsafe times for each row:\n\nRow 1: always safe\n\nRow 2: unsafe at t=1,4\n\nRow 3: unsafe at t=1,4\n\nRow 4: unsafe at t=1,4\n\nRow 5: always safe\n\nRow 6: always safe\n\nRow 7: unsafe at t=12,13,14\n\nRow 8: unsafe at t=12,13,14\n\nNow, since I start at y=0, t=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe critical point is around t=4 for rows 2,3,4.\n\nFor example, if I go directly, at t=4, y=4 is bad.\n\nI could stay at some row to avoid.\n\nSince row5 and row6 are always safe, I can be there anytime.\n\nBut I need to go through.\n\nOne idea: go up to row4 before t=4 or after t=4.\n\nFor example, at t=4, if I am not on row4, but on another row.\n\nSince row1,5,6 safe, I could be on them.\n\nBut y must increase.\n\nLet's think the path.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at time H.\n\nMinimal H at least 9.\n\nWith H=9, y_t from 0 to 9.\n\nBut at t=4, y_t=4 must be safe, but it's not.\n\nSo I need to have y_4 ≠ 4.\n\nSimilarly, at t=1, if y_t=2,3, or4, it would be unsafe, but in the sequence, at t=1, if I am on row2,3, or4, it is unsafe.\n\nIn direct path, at t=1, y=1, row1 safe; only row2,3,4 unsafe at t=1, but row1 is safe at t=1.\n\nAt t=1, row1: y=1, safe.\n\nRow2: unsafe at t=1.\n\nBut in path, if at t=1, I am on row1, it is safe, since row1 safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=4, row4 unsafe.\n\nSo for H=9 to work, I need that at t=4, I am not on row4.\n\nSimilarly, at t=1, I should not be on row2,3,4, but since I start from y=0, at t=1, I can be at y=1 (if move up) or y=0 (stay) or y=-1 impossible, so only y=0 or1.\n\ny=0 safe, y=1 row1 safe.\n\nSo at t=1, possible to be safe.\n\nNow at t=4, I need y_4 such that if y_4 between 1-8, it is safe.\n\ny_4 could be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, but since I need to reach 9, and start from 0, y_4 probably around 4.\n\nBut if y_4=4, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if y_4=2, row2 unsafe at t=4? Row2 unsafe at t=1 and t=4, so at t=4, if y_t=2, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly for y=3 or4 at t=4, all unsafe.\n\nWhat about y=1? Row1 safe always, so at t=4, on row1 safe.\n\ny=5? Row5 always safe.\n\ny=6 safe.\n\ny=7 row7 unsafe only at t=12-14, so at t=4 safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 safe at t=4.\n\ny=0 safe, but y=0 at t=4 might be low.\n\nSo at t=4, to be safe, I can be on y=0,1,5,6,7,8, or even y=9 if possible, but y=4 not possible.\n\ny=2,3,4 are unsafe at t=4.\n\nNow for the path to H=9, at time t, y_t.\n\nWe have y_0=0\n\ny_9=9\n\nFor t=4, y_4 must be not 2,3,4.\n\nSince net change +9 in 9 steps, if I move up every step, y_t=t.\n\nBut y_4=4 not allowed.\n\nSo I need to have y_4 different.\n\nFor example, if I stay at some point or move down, but that might increase H.\n\nBut for H=9, it might be possible with different sequence.\n\ny_t must go from 0 to 9 in 9 steps, with |y_{t+1} - y_t| <=1.\n\nThe position at t=4 is y_4.\n\nThen from t=0 to t=4, I have 4 actions, so y_4 can be from 0 to 4, depending on actions.\n\nSimilarly, from t=4 to t=8, 4 actions to y_8, then to y_9.\n\ny_9=9.\n\nNow, y_4 must be in {0,1,5,6,7,8} to be safe at t=4, but y_4 <=4 because in 4 steps from y_0=0, max y_4=4 if all up.\n\nMin y_4=0 if all stay or down, but down not possible from 0.\n\ny_4 can be 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nBut to be safe at t=4, y_4 must be 0,1, or possibly other, but 5,6,7,8 not possible since y_4 <=4.\n\nSo only possible y_4=0 or 1 to be safe at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, y_4=0 or 1.\n\nIf y_4=0, that means I stayed or moved down, but from y=0, I can only stay or move up, not down, since y=0 min.\n\ny_t >=0, so from t=0 to t=4, with 4 actions, y_4 can be 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If I never move up, y_4=0\n\n- If I move up once and stay three times, y_4=1\n\n- Up twice, stay twice, y_4=2\n\n- Up three, stay once, y_4=3\n\n- Up four times, y_4=4\n\nBut y_4=2,3,4 unsafe at t=4, so only y_4=0 or 1 possible for safety.\n\nSimilarly, if y_4=0, that means I stayed at y=0 for first 4 turns? But at t=0, I am at y=0, perform action.\n\nAfter action at t=0, y_1.\n\nThen at t=1, y_1, and so on.\n\nAt time t=4, y_4.\n\nTo have y_4=0, I need to be at y=0 at time 4.\n\nThat means from t=0 to t=3, I must have actions that keep me at 0 or back to 0.\n\nFor example, at t=0, if I stay (S), y_1=0\n\nAt t=1, stay, y_2=0\n\n...\n\nBut at each time, when I am at y=0, it is safe, but I need to go up eventually.\n\nIf y_4=0, then from there, I need to reach y=9 in 5 more steps? To y_9=9.\n\nBut with 5 steps, min to go up 9 steps, but y_4=0, need to go to y_9=9, so 9 up in 5 steps, impossible since max change per step +1, so in 5 steps, max y_9=5, but need 9, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, if y_4=1, then y_4=1, need to reach y_9=9, so need +8 in 5 steps, which is possible only if I move up every step, y_5=2, y_6=3, ..., y_9=6? y_4=1, then after 5 actions: if all up, y_5=2, y_6=3, y_7=4, y_8=5, y_9=6 <9, not enough.\n\ny_4=1 at time t=4.\n\nAfter action at t=4, y_5\n\nAt t=5, y_5\n\n...\n\nAt t=8, y_8\n\nAfter action at t=8, y_9\n\nSo from y_4 to y_9, there are 5 actions: a_4 to a_8, determining y_5 to y_9.\n\ny_9 = y_4 + sum_{k=4 to8} Δy_k\n\nEach Δy <=1, so y_9 <= y_4 + 5\n\nSimilarly, y_9 >= y_4 -5\n\nBut we need y_9=9.\n\nIf y_4=1, then y_9 <= 1+5=6 <9, impossible to reach 9.\n\nSimilarly, if y_4=0, y_9 <=5<9.\n\nThus, for H=9, it is impossible to have y_9=9 with y_4 <=1, but y_4 must be <=1 for safety, contradiction.\n\nTherefore, H=9 is impossible.\n\nMinimal H must be greater than 9.\n\nNow, what about H=10.\n\nWith H=10 actions, from t=0 to t=9, y_{10}=9.\n\nAt time t from 0 to 9, y_t must be safe.\n\ny_0=0, y_{10}=9.\n\nNow, at t=4, y_4 must be safe, so y_4 not 2,3,4.\n\nBut with 4 actions to y_4, y_4 <=4, so y_4=0 or 1 possible.\n\ny_4=0 or 1.\n\nThen y_{10}=9.\n\nWith 6 actions from t=4 to t=9, y_{10} = y_4 + sum_{t=4 to9} Δy_t <= y_4 +6\n\nSimilarly >= y_4 -6.\n\nIf y_4=0, y_{10} <=6<9, impossible.\n\nIf y_4=1, y_{10} <=1+6=7<9, impossible.\n\ny_{10} <= y_4 +6, since 6 actions increase.\n\nActions from t=4 to t=9: a_4 to a_9, 6 actions.\n\ny_{10} = y_4 + Δy_4 + ... + Δy_9\n\nEach Δy <=1, so y_{10} <= y_4 +6\n\nSet to 9, so y_4 +6 >=9, so y_4 >=3.\n\nBut earlier for safety at t=4, y_4 <=1, contradiction.\n\ny_4 >=3 for reachability, but y_4 <=1 for safety, impossible.\n\nThus H=10 also impossible.\n\nH=10 actions, y_{10}=9.\n\ny_4: from t=0 to t=3, 4 actions, y_4 <=4.\n\ny_4 >= ? No lower bound except 0.\n\nBut for y_{10}=9, with y_{10} = y_4 + sum_{t=4}^{9} Δy_t\n\nNumber of actions from t=4 to t=9: t=4,5,6,7,8,9: 6 actions.\n\nEach Δy_t <=1, so y_{10} <= y_4 +6\n\ny_{10} =9, so 9 <= y_4 +6, thus y_4 >=3.\n\nSimilarly, y_4 <=4.\n\nSo y_4 =3 or 4.\n\nBut for safety at t=4, y_4 must not be 2,3,4, so if y_4=3 or 4, unsafe, or 2 but not possible since y_4>=3.\n\ny_4=3 or 4, both unsafe at t=4.\n\nThus impossible for H=10.\n\nNow H=11.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=10, y_{11}=9.\n\nTime t from 0 to 10.\n\nAt t=4, y_4 must be safe.\n\ny_4: from t=0 to t=3, 4 actions, y_4 <=4.\n\ny_{11}=9 with 7 actions from t=4 to t=10? y_{11} = y_4 + sum_{t=4}^{10} Δy_t\n\nActions a_4 to a_{10}, 7 actions.\n\ny_{11} <= y_4 +7\n\nSet to 9, so 9 <= y_4 +7, thus y_4 >=2.\n\nSimilarly, y_4 <=4.\n\nSo y_4=2,3,4.\n\nBut for safety at t=4, y_4 must not be 2,3,4, all unsafe.\n\ny_4=2,3, or4 all unsafe at t=4.\n\nThus still impossible for H=11.\n\nH=12.\n\nActions t=0 to t=11, y_{12}=9.\n\nTime t from 0 to 11.\n\nAt t=4, y_4 must be safe.\n\ny_4 from 4 actions, <=4.\n\ny_{12} = y_4 + sum_{t=4}^{11} Δy_t\n\nActions a_4 to a_{11}, 8 actions.\n\ny_{12} <= y_4 +8\n\n9 <= y_4 +8, so y_4 >=1.\n\ny_4 <=4.\n\nSo y_4=1,2,3,4.\n\nNow for safety at t=4, y_4 must be 1 or 0, but y_4>=1, so y_4=1 possible (since row1 safe), or y_4=0 but y_4>=1, so only y_4=1.\n\ny_4=1 is safe, row1 always safe.\n\ny_4=2,3,4 unsafe.\n\nSo possible y_4=1.\n\nThen y_4=1.\n\nNow y_{12}=9, so from y_4=1 to y_{12}=9, need +8 in 8 actions, which is possible only if all moves up, no stay or down.\n\ny_{12} = y_4 + sum Δy, 8 actions, each Δy <=1, so to gain 8, must all be +1.\n\nSo from t=4 to t=11, all actions U, so y_t = y_4 + (t-4) for t=4 to 12.\n\ny_4=1, y_5=2, y_6=3, y_7=4, y_8=5, y_9=6, y_{10}=7, y_{11}=8, y_{12}=9.\n\nNow, we need to ensure that for all t from 0 to 11, y_t is safe.\n\nWe have from t=4 to 11: y_t as above.\n\nt=4: y_4=1, row1 safe.\n\nt=5: y_5=2, row2 at t=5.\n\nIs row2 safe at t=5?\n\nRow2: cars at t=5.\n\nCar1: [-59+12*5, -48+12*5] = [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 1<=0? 1>0, so 0 not in, safe.\n\nCar2: [-23+60, -12+60] = [37,48], not 0.\n\nCar3: [13+60,24+60]= [73,84], not 0.\n\nSo row2 safe at t=5.\n\nt=6: y_6=3, row3 at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, row3 cars at t=6: car1 [-59+72, -48+72]= [13,24], not 0\n\nCar2 [-23+72,-12+72]= [49,60], not 0\n\nCar3 [13+72,24+72]= [85,96], not 0\n\nSafe.\n\nt=7: y_7=4, row4 at t=7.\n\nRow4 same as row2, at t=7: car1 [-59+84, -48+84] = [25,36], not 0? -59+84=25, -48+84=36, [25,36], not 0.\n\nCar2 [-23+84, -12+84]= [61,72], not 0\n\nCar3 [13+84,24+84]= [97,108], not 0\n\nSafe.\n\nt=8: y_8=5, row5, always safe.\n\nt=9: y_9=6, row6, safe.\n\nt=10: y_{10}=7, row7 at t=10.\n\nIs row7 safe at t=10?\n\nRow7: car (-48,-59,right,4), span at T: [-59+4T, -48+4T]\n\nAt t=10: [-59+40, -48+40] = [-19, -8], not 0, safe.\n\nt=11: y_{11}=8, row8 at t=11: similar, [-59+44, -48+44] = [-15,-4], not 0, safe.\n\nNow, we also need from t=0 to t=3.\n\ny_4=1 at t=4.\n\ny_4=1 means at time t=4, position y=1.\n\nHow to get from y_0=0 to y_4=1 in 4 actions.\n\nWith 4 actions, to have y_4=1.\n\nSince y_0=0, y_4=1, so net change +1 in 4 steps.\n\nPossible with, for example, one up and three stays, or other combinations.\n\nBut we need to check safety at each step.\n\nt from 0 to 3.\n\ny_0=0, safe.\n\nNow, actions from t=0 to t=3 determine y_1,y_2,y_3,y_4.\n\ny_4=1.\n\nSince y_4=1, and we have to be safe at t=0,1,2,3.\n\ny_t for t=0,1,2,3 must be safe.\n\ny_0=0 safe.\n\ny_4=1.\n\nNow, possible sequences.\n\nFor example, I could go up at some point.\n\nBut at t=1, if I am on row2,3,4, it might be unsafe, but row1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly at other times.\n\nSince I need y_4=1, I can, for instance, stay at y=0 for first three turns, then move up at t=3 to y=1 at t=4.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nOption: at t=0, stay (S), so y_1=0\n\nAt t=1, stay (S), y_2=0\n\nAt t=2, stay (S), y_3=0\n\nAt t=3, move up (U), so y_4=1\n\nThen positions:\n\nt=0: y=0, safe\n\nt=1: y=0, safe\n\nt=2: y=0, safe\n\nt=3: y=0, safe\n\nt=4: y=1, safe as above.\n\nThen from t=4 to t=11, all U: a_4=U, y_5=2; a_5=U, y_6=3; ... up to a_{11}=U, y_{12}=9\n\nWe need actions up to a_{11}, since H actions from t=0 to H-1, here H=12 actions? Let's index.\n\nActions: a_t for t=0 to 11, 12 actions.\n\nAt time t, after action, y_{t+1}, but position at time t is y_t.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nt=0: a_0=S, y_1=0? After action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nFor t=0: y_0=0\n\na_0: if S, then y_1 = y_0 + 0 =0\n\na_1: if S, y_2=0\n\na_2: if S, y_3=0\n\na_3: U, y_4 = y_3 +1 =0+1=1\n\nThen a_4: U, y_5=1+1=2\n\na_5: U, y_6=3\n\na_6: U, y_7=4\n\na_7: U, y_8=5\n\na_8: U, y_9=6\n\na_9: U, y_{10}=7\n\na_{10}: U, y_{11}=8\n\na_{11}: U, y_{12}=9\n\nNow, times t from 0 to 11:\n\nt=0: y_t=0, safe\n\nt=1: y_t=0 (since y_1=0), safe\n\nt=2: y_t=0, safe\n\nt=3: y_t=0, safe\n\nt=4: y_t=1, safe\n\nt=5: y_t=2, row2 at t=5, safe as before\n\nt=6: y_t=3, row3 at t=6, safe\n\nt=7: y_t=4, row4 at t=7, safe\n\nt=8: y_t=5, row5 safe\n\nt=9: y_t=6, row6 safe\n\nt=10: y_t=7, row7 at t=10, safe\n\nt=11: y_t=8, row8 at t=11, safe\n\nAll seem safe.\n\nBut at t=11, y_t=8, row8 at t=11: as above, span [-15,-4] not 0, safe.\n\nAnd y_{12}=9 reached.\n\nNow, is this minimal H? H=12 actions.\n\nBut earlier we saw H=9,10,11 impossible, so H=12 should be minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can do with H=11.\n\nEarlier for H=11, we had issue at t=4.\n\nWith H=11, actions t=0 to 10, y_{11}=9.\n\nThen y_4 >=2? y_{11} = y_4 + sum_{t=4}^{10} Δy_t, 7 actions, y_{11} <= y_4 +7, 9<= y_4 +7, y_4 >=2.\n\ny_4 <=4.\n\ny_4=2,3,4.\n\nBut at t=4, if y_4=2, row2 unsafe; y_4=3 row3 unsafe; y_4=4 row4 unsafe; all unsafe at t=4.\n\nUnless for some row, it is safe at t=4, but rows 2,3,4 all unsafe at t=4.\n\nRow1 safe but y_4=1 not possible since y_4>=2.\n\ny_4>=2 and <=4, all unsafe.\n\nThus H=11 impossible.\n\nSimilarly H=10,9 impossible.\n\nSo minimal H=12.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have actions.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output the actions from t_1 = t_0 =0.\n\nSo for turn 0 to 11.\n\nIn the sequence: a_0=S, a_1=S, a_2=S, a_3=U, then a_4 to a_{11} all U.\n\na_4 to a_{11} is 8 actions, from t=4 to 11.\n\nList:\n\nTurn 0: S (since a_0=S)\n\nTurn 1: S (a_1=S)\n\nTurn 2: S (a_2=S)\n\nTurn 3: U (a_3=U)\n\nTurn 4: U (a_4=U)\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nIn terms of turn index: turn t_1 + t, but t_1=0, so turn 0 to turn 11.\n\nAnd after 12 actions, at time 12, y=9.\n\nIn the output, it should be for each turn, the action.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 0, action S, then at turn 1, action S, etc.\n\nBut let's write in the box.\n\nThe minimal H is 12.\n\nBut is there a shorter way? We thought not.\n\nPerhaps I can go up faster in the beginning or something, but earlier analysis shows H<12 impossible.\n\nAnother idea: since rows 5 and 6 are always safe, I could go to them earlier, but in this case, with H=12, it works.\n\nBut let's check if at t=1, for example.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=1, I am at y=0, safe, no issue.\n\nBut row2 is unsafe at t=1, but I am not on it.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nPerhaps I can start moving up earlier to save time, but with H=12, it's minimal.\n\nFor example, if I move up at t=0 to y=1 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, y=1, safe.\n\nThen I need to have y_4=1, since if y_4=1.\n\nFrom y_1=1, to y_4=1 in 3 actions.\n\nFor example, stay or move down, but move down to y=0, then up, but that might take more actions.\n\nTo have y_4=1, with y_1=1, I can stay for three actions: a_1=S, y_2=1; a_2=S, y_3=1; a_3=S, y_4=1.\n\nThen same as before, but I moved up at t=0.\n\nThen actions: a_0=U, y_1=1\n\na_1=S, y_2=1\n\na_2=S, y_3=1\n\na_3=S, y_4=1\n\nThen a_4 to a_{11} all U, y_5=2, ..., y_{12}=9\n\nNow, times: t=0: y=0 safe\n\nt=1: y=1 safe\n\nt=2: y=1 safe? At t=2, y_t=1, row1 safe.\n\nt=3: y_t=1, safe\n\nt=4: y_t=1, safe\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut now I have one more action? With H=11? Actions from a_0 to a_{10} for y_{11}=9?\n\ny_{11}=9.\n\nIn this case, with a_0=U, y_1=1\n\nThen to y_4=1, with a_1=S, a_2=S, a_3=S, y_4=1\n\nThen from y_4=1 to y_{11}=9, need +8 in 7 actions? Actions a_4 to a_{10}, 7 actions.\n\ny_{11} = y_4 + sum_{t=4}^{10} Δy_t <= y_4 +7 =1+7=8 <9, cannot reach y=9.\n\ny_{11} <=8 if y_4=1.\n\nBut need y_{11}=9, impossible.\n\nIf I move up faster later, but max y_{11}= y_4 +7=8<9.\n\nSo I need y_{11}=9, so with y_4=1, I must have more actions.\n\nIn the first sequence, with H=12, y_{12}=9.\n\nIn this alternative, if I start with up, I still need 12 actions to reach y=9 from y=0 with y_4=1.\n\nFor example, a_0=U, y_1=1\n\na_1=S, y_2=1\n\na_2=S, y_3=1\n\na_3=S, y_4=1\n\nThen a_4=U, y_5=2\n\n...\n\nup to a_{10}=U, y_{11}=8? y_4=1, a_4=U, y_5=2; a_5=U, y_6=3; ... a_{10}=U, y_{11}=7? Let's index.\n\ny_4=1 at t=4\n\na_4=U, y_5=2 at t=5\n\na_5=U, y_6=3 at t=6\n\na_6=U, y_7=4 at t=7\n\na_7=U, y_8=5 at t=8\n\na_8=U, y_9=6 at t=9\n\na_9=U, y_{10}=7 at t=10\n\na_{10}=U, y_{11}=8 at t=11\n\nThen to reach y=9, I need another action, a_{11}=U, y_{12}=9.\n\nSo still 12 actions.\n\nIf I move up earlier, but I have to have y_4=1, so I cannot be higher at t=4.\n\nThus, minimal H=12.\n\nIn the sequence, the first three actions are stay, then up all the way.\n\nIn the output, we need to list the actions.\n\nBut in the car state, there is also row7 and row8 unsafe at t=12,13,14, but in this path, at t=10, y=7; t=11, y=8; t=12 not a time we are at, since we care up to t=11.\n\nAt t=10, y=7, row7 at t=10 safe; t=11, y=8, row8 at t=11 safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps I can reduce by not staying all at beginning.\n\nFor example, go to y=1 earlier, but still need to be at y=1 at t=4.\n\nSuppose at t=0, U, y_1=1\n\nThen I can stay at y=1 until t=4.\n\nBut at t=1, y=1 safe; t=2, y=1 safe; etc.\n\nBut to have y_4=1, I need to stay, so actions might be same.\n\nI could move up to row5 or something, but at t=4, I need to be at low row to have room to go up, but in this case, since rows 5-6 safe, but if I go to y=5 at t=4, then to y=9 in 5 actions? y_4=5, then y_{9} <=5+5=10, possible, but at t=4, if y_4=5, which is row5, safe, but earlier for H=12, we have y_4=1.\n\nBut with y_4=5, I can reach faster?\n\nFor example, with H smaller.\n\ny_4=5, then to y_9=9, need +4 in 5 actions, easy.\n\nBut y_4=5, with 4 actions from start.\n\ny_0=0, to y_4=5 in 4 actions, impossible, since max y_4=4 with all up.\n\ny_4 <=4.\n\nCannot be 5.\n\nSimilarly, y_4=4 possible but unsafe at t=4.\n\nSo only y_4=1 or less, but less not useful.\n\nThus, the sequence we have is fine.\n\nNow, about row7 and row8, unsafe at t=12,13,14, but in our path, we pass row7 at t=10, which is before 12, safe; row8 at t=11, before 12, safe.\n\nIf we were later, might be issue, but here no.\n\nSo H=12 is achievable.\n\nNow, in the action sequence, for turn t=0 to 11.\n\nt_1=0, so turns: turn 0, turn 1, ..., turn 11.\n\nActions: as above.\n\nIn the output, it should be:\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: S\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let's write in the box.\n\nThe problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nH=12, so t=0 to 11.\n\nAnd t1=0.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\end{array} }\n\nBut in text, perhaps.\n\nSince it says \"Answer Format\" with Turn t1: a_{t1}, etc.\n\nIn the car state, freeway 2,3,4 have multiple cars, but we handled.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 2,3,4, the cars are identical, but rows are different.\n\nBut we considered each row separately.\n\nIn the beginning, I thought row1 safe, but let me confirm row1 car.\n\nFreeway 1: (48,37,right,3), initial [37,48], at T, [37+3T,48+3T], always >0, so no cover at 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo minimal H=12.\n</think>\nTo reach the position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) in minimal turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the analysis shows that the minimum number of turns \\(H\\) is 12. This is because paths with fewer turns (e.g., \\(H = 9, 10, 11\\)) are impossible due to collisions at critical times, particularly at turn \\(t = 4\\) on rows 2, 3, and 4, which are unsafe at that time.\n\nThe sequence of actions achieves \\(y_{12} = 9\\) with all positions \\(y_t\\) for \\(t = 0\\) to \\(11\\) being safe:\n- At turns \\(t = 0, 1, 2\\), staying (S) keeps the player at \\(y = 0\\), which is safe and avoids the unsafe rows 2, 3, and 4 at \\(t = 1\\) and \\(t = 4\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 3\\), moving up (U) reaches \\(y_4 = 1\\) at \\(t = 4\\), which is row 1 and safe at all times.\n- From turns \\(t = 4\\) to \\(t = 11\\), moving up (U) each turn increases \\(y\\) by 1 per turn, reaching \\(y_{12} = 9\\).\n\nThe positions and safety are verified as follows:\n- \\(t = 0\\): \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no freeway).\n- \\(t = 1\\): \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no freeway).\n- \\(t = 2\\): \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no freeway).\n- \\(t = 3\\): \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no freeway).\n- \\(t = 4\\): \\(y = 1\\) (row 1, always safe).\n- \\(t = 5\\): \\(y = 2\\) (row 2, safe at \\(t = 5\\) since no car covers \\(x = 0\\)).\n- \\(t = 6\\): \\(y = 3\\) (row 3, safe at \\(t = 6\\) since no car covers \\(x = 0\\)).\n- \\(t = 7\\): \\(y = 4\\) (row 4, safe at \\(t = 7\\) since no car covers \\(x = 0\\)).\n- \\(t = 8\\): \\(y = 5\\) (row 5, always safe).\n- \\(t = 9\\): \\(y = 6\\) (row 6, always safe).\n- \\(t = 10\\): \\(y = 7\\) (row 7, safe at \\(t = 10\\) since car span \\([-19, -8]\\) excludes 0).\n- \\(t = 11\\): \\(y = 8\\) (row 8, safe at \\(t = 11\\) since car span \\([-15, -4]\\) excludes 0).\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1 = 0\\) to \\(t_1 + 11 = 11\\) (since \\(H = 12\\)) is given below.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\end{array} }",

So we have:\n  Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is at freeway i (i.e., y_T = i) and 0 is in the span of any car on freeway i at turn T.\n\nWe start at turn 1 at (0,0). We must end at (0,9). The moves: U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), S (stay: y same). The y coordinate is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nWe cannot go above 9 or below 0.\n\nThe goal is to get to y=9 as quickly as possible, avoiding collisions on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nNote: at the starting position (0,0) and the goal (0,9) there are no cars (since cars are on freeways 1 to 8). So we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nWe need to traverse from y=0 to y=9, passing through the freeways 1 to 8 without getting hit by cars.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting from turn t1 (which is 1) until we reach y=9.\n\nWe must minimize H (the number of turns, including the starting turn? Note: we start at turn 1 and after H-1 actions we are at turn t1+H-1? But the problem says: a sequence {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). So H is the number of actions? Actually, the sequence has H actions: from t1 to t1+H-1? Then the turn at which we arrive at (0,9) is t1 + H - 1.\n\nBut note: we start at turn 1 (t1=1) at (0,0). Then we take an action at turn 1, which moves us to a new y at turn 2? Actually, the update is:\n\n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t. We choose a_t (action at turn t) and then at turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, we start at turn 1: at (0,0). Then we take action a1 at turn1, and then at turn2 we are at y2 = y1 + Delta y1.\n\nWe must reach (0,9) at some turn T. The problem says: we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9. Since t1=1, we want y_{1+H-1} = y_H = 9.\n\nSo after H-1 actions? Actually, we take H actions: at turn1, turn2, ..., turnH? But the sequence is from t=0 to H-1? Let me read:\n\n  sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\n\nSo for t=0: a_{t1+0} = a1\n      t=1: a_{t1+1} = a2\n      ...\n      t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1} = a_{1+H-1}\n\nThen the turn at which we take the last action is 1+H-1 = H. And then at the next turn (turn H+1) we are at y_{H+1}. But we require that at turn t1+H-1 (which is H) we are at (0,9). So that means:\n\n  We are at (0,9) at turn H? But note: the position at turn H is determined by the action at turn H-1? Actually, the position at turn t is the result of the action at turn t-1.\n\nBut the problem says: \"at turn T, the player is at (0, y_T)\".\n\nWe start at turn1: y1=0.\n\nAfter action a1 (at turn1), we are at turn2: y2 = y1 + Delta y1.\n\nSo the position at turn T is the result of the actions taken from turn1 to turn T-1.\n\nWe want: at turn T (which is t1+H-1 = 1+H-1 = H) we are at y_H = 9.\n\nThat means we must have taken actions from turn1 to turn H-1, and then at turn H we are at 9.\n\nTherefore, the number of actions is H-1? But the problem says the sequence has H actions? Let me check:\n\n  We have actions from t=0 to H-1: that's H actions? And they are for turns: t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1 -> turns 1, 2, ..., H.\n\nBut then the position at turn H+1 is determined by the last action at turn H? But we require the position at turn H to be 9.\n\nActually, the position at turn t is the state at the beginning of turn t? And then we take action a_t to move to the next state at turn t+1.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the player is at (0, y_t) at turn t\". So at turn t, we are at y_t. Then we take action a_t, and then at turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nWe require at turn (t1+H-1) we are at 9. Since t1=1, we require at turn (1+H-1)=H we are at 9.\n\nTherefore, we must have taken H-1 actions: from turn1 to turn H-1, and then at turn H we are at 9.\n\nBut the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1: that is, for turns 1 to H. So we are taking H actions? But the last action (at turn H) would then determine the state at turn H+1.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me re-read the problem:\n\n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n  and then \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nSo at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\nWe start at turn t1 (which is 1). So we require at turn (1 + H - 1) = H, we are at 9.\n\nHow do we get to y_H = 9? \n\nWe start at turn1: y1=0.\n\nWe take action a1 at turn1 -> then at turn2: y2 = 0 + Delta a1.\n\nWe take action a2 at turn2 -> then at turn3: y3 = y2 + Delta a2.\n\n...\n\nWe take action a_{H-1} at turn H-1 -> then at turn H: y_H = y_{H-1} + Delta a_{H-1} = 9.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of actions is for turns 1 to H-1, so the number of actions is H-1.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence has H actions: from t=0 to H-1? That would be H actions. \n\nThis implies that the problem counts the starting turn as an action? But note: at turn1, we are at (0,0) and we are going to take an action at turn1. Then at turn2 we are at a new y. So we need to take actions until we get to turn H, where we are at 9. The actions we take are at turns 1,2,...,H-1. So the number of actions is H-1.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence has H actions? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be including an action at turn H? But then that action would change the state at turn H+1, which we don't care about because we already reached 9 at turn H.\n\nSo I think the problem's notation is:\n\n  We take actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. So that's H actions.\n\n  And then at turn t1+H (which is 1+H) we are at the state after the last action? But the problem says we are to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThis does not match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using 0-indexed for the sequence? But the turn numbers are given as t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nLet me check the update rule: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\", so the action at turn t affects the state at turn t+1.\n\nWe start at turn1: y1=0.\n\nWe want at turn T: y_T=9.\n\nWe have: T = t1 + H - 1 = 1 + H - 1 = H.\n\nSo we want y_H = 9.\n\nHow many actions are taken? From turn1 to turn H-1: that's H-1 actions.\n\nBut the problem says: sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} -> this would be for t from 0 to H-1: that's H actions, for turns: t1+0=1, t1+1=2, ..., t1+H-1=H.\n\nSo the last action is at turn H. Then the state at turn H+1 is determined by the action at turn H.\n\nBut we require the state at turn H to be 9. So the action at turn H would be irrelevant? And we haven't taken an action at turn H to get to state at turn H? \n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding. The problem says:\n\n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nand then we are to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut if we take an action at turn t1+H-1, then the state at turn (t1+H-1+1) = t1+H is the result. We want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9? How? The state at turn t1+H-1 is determined by the actions taken at turns t1 to t1+H-2.\n\nSo to have the state at turn T = t1+H-1 be 9, we must have taken actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., T-1 = t1+H-2. So the last action we take is at turn t1+H-2. Therefore, the sequence should be from t=0 to t=H-2? But that would be H-1 actions.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence has H actions and we are to write from t=0 to H-1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem counts the starting state as turn0? But the problem says \"current turn is t1\" and t1=1, and the player is at (0,0) at turn t1.\n\nI think the problem has a mistake? Or maybe I am misreading.\n\nLooking again: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". And the sequence is for actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nBut then the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state at the beginning of that turn. Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? Then the state at turn t1+H is determined. But we don't care about that.\n\nBut we require the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9. How does that happen? \n\nWe start at turn t1: state (0,0). Then we take an action at turn t1, which moves us to turn t1+1: state y_{t1+1}.\n\nWe require at turn t1+H-1: state y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo the actions we take are at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2. Then the state at turn t1+H-1 is the result of the action at turn t1+H-2.\n\nSo the sequence should be for actions at turns t1 to t1+H-2, so the length is H-1.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} -> that's H actions, for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThis implies that we are taking one extra action? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal H includes the starting turn? But the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we are to be at turn t1+H-1. Since we start at turn t1, the total turns we are taking is (t1+H-1 - t1) + 1 = H turns? But the state at turn t1 is already given, and we are to be at turn t1+H-1? Then the total number of turns we are in the game from start to finish is (t1+H-1) - t1 + 1 = H turns? But that includes the starting turn.\n\nBut we need to output actions for H turns? That doesn't match.\n\nI think there is a standard way: we are to take actions at each turn until we reach the goal. The goal is reached at the moment we are at (0,9). So we don't take an action on the turn we are at (0,9). Therefore, the last action is taken at turn H-1 (relative to the starting turn) to get to turn H.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence has H actions? \n\nI think the problem's H is defined as the number of actions? But then the turn at which we reach 9 is t1 + H? Because:\n\n  Start: turn t1: state0\n  After 1 action (at turn t1): state1 at turn t1+1\n  ...\n  After H actions: state at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says we reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me try to reinterpret.\n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSuppose we let H be the total number of turns from the start (including the starting turn) until the turn we are at the goal. Then:\n\n  We start at turn t1 (turn1) and we are at (0,0).\n  We want to be at (0,9) at turn T. Then H = T - t1 + 1? But then T = t1 + H - 1.\n\nAnd the number of actions we take is H-1? But the sequence is for H actions? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might consider that we take an action at the goal turn? But that doesn't make sense.\n\nI think there might be a typo in the problem. Looking at common usage: usually, the number of actions is the number of moves. The minimal H here is the number of actions? But then the turn we arrive is t1 + H.\n\nBut the problem says we arrive at t1+H-1.\n\nGiven the confusion, I will assume that the sequence of actions has length H, and then the state at turn t1+H is the result of the last action. But the problem says we are to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the action at turn t1+H-1 is the last action and it leads to state at turn t1+H, but the problem says we are to be at turn t1+H-1 at (0,9). So that means we must be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action at that turn? But then we move away.\n\nThis is not making sense.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". And the action sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} at that turn? But then we move to y_{t1+H} which might not be 9.\n\nBut the problem doesn't say we must stay at 9, only that we reach it at turn t1+H-1.\n\nHowever, the goal is to be at (0,9) at some turn, and then we stop? But the problem doesn't specify that we stop; it only says we must reach (0,9) and that is the last turn we care about.\n\nSo we can be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, and then we might take an action that moves us away at turn t1+H, but that is not part of the requirement.\n\nBut that seems odd.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is defined as the number of turns from the start until the turn we reach the goal, inclusive. And then the actions are taken at the first H-1 turns? But the problem says the sequence has H actions.\n\nAnother possibility: the turn numbering might be such that the first action is at turn0? But the problem says the current turn is t1=1.\n\nI think I have to go by the mathematical requirement: at turn t1+H-1, y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nHow many actions have been taken? The actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2. Because the action at turn t1+H-2 would determine the state at turn t1+H-1.\n\nTherefore, the actions in the sequence should be for turns: t1 to t1+H-2, so the length is H-1.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence is indexed from t=0 to H-1, so that's H actions.\n\nThis is a discrepancy.\n\n Given the time, I will assume that the problem means that we are to take actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and then the state at turn t1+H is the result, and we require that state to be (0,9). Then the turn at which we are at (0,9) is t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says t1+H-1.\n\n Alternatively, the problem's \"H\" is the number of actions, and then the turn at which we are at (0,9) is t1 + H.\n\n But the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and then \"at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nI think there might be a off-by-one in the problem.\n\n To resolve, let me assume that the intended meaning is:\n\n  We want to be at (0,9) at turn T, and T = t1 + (number of actions taken).\n\n Since we start at turn t1 and take an action at turn t1, then at turn t1+1 we are at a new state. After k actions, we are at turn t1+k.\n\n So to be at (0,9) at turn t1+k, we need to take k actions.\n\n Then the problem says: we are to be at turn t1+H-1 = 1+H-1 = H.\n\n So we require k = H-1? That is, we take H-1 actions, and then at turn 1 + (H-1) = H, we are at 9.\n\n Then the number of actions is H-1.\n\n But the problem says the sequence has H actions? That would be for k = H actions, then we would be at turn 1+H.\n\n But then we would require that turn 1+H = turn (1+H-1) = H? -> only if H=H, which is not possible.\n\n I think the problem has a mistake. Given the time, I will assume that the sequence should be for the actions that get us to (0,9) at the next turn, and that the turn we reach is t1+H-1 means that we have taken H-1 actions.\n\n Therefore, the sequence should have H-1 actions.\n\n But the problem asks for the sequence in a boxed format with H actions.\n\n How about we let H be the number of actions? Then the turn at which we reach is t1 + H.\n\n But the problem requires turn t1+H-1.\n\n This is off by one.\n\n I think the only logical way is to assume that the minimal H they want is the number of actions, and then the turn of arrival is t1+H.\n\n But then it doesn't match the \"t1+H-1\" in the problem.\n\n Given the provided examples in the problem might be missing, I have to make a decision.\n\n Let me look at the car update: it uses T>t1, and at turn T, we check the car spans.\n\n We are at turn t1=1.\n\n We want to avoid collisions on freeways 1..8 at every turn from 1 to the turn before we reach 9, but note that at the turn we are at 9, we are safe.\n\n Since we start at turn1 at y=0 (safe), and then we move to y1 (at turn2) which might be 0 or 1.\n\n Collision is checked at turn T if we are on a freeway i (1..8) at turn T.\n\n So at turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, we must ensure that no car on freeway y_T has a span that contains 0 at that exact turn.\n\n We start at turn1: y1=0 (safe) -> no action has been taken yet.\n\n Then we take an action at turn1 to move to y2.\n\n So the first action is at turn1, and it determines y2.\n\n Then at turn2, we are at y2, and we check for collision on freeway y2 (if y2 in [1,8]).\n\n We take actions until we are at 9.\n\n The earliest we can be at 9 is after at least 9 moves upward? But we can also move down and then up, but that would take more turns.\n\n Minimal if we only move up: 9 actions: \n   turn1: U -> y2=1\n   turn2: U -> y2=2\n   ...\n   turn9: U -> y10=9\n\n So at turn10, we are at 9.\n\n Therefore, we are at 9 at turn10.\n\n In the problem's terms: we want turn t1+H-1 = 1+H-1 = H to be 10, so H=10.\n\n Then the sequence of actions is from turn1 to turn9 (9 actions), but the problem says the sequence has H=10 actions? That doesn't match.\n\n If we let H=10, then the sequence is for turns 1 to 10 (10 actions), but we only need 9 actions to get to 9 at turn10.\n\n So the 10th action (at turn10) would be after we are at 9, and it might move us away.\n\n But the problem says we only require to reach at turn t1+H-1 = turn1+10-1= turn10.\n\n So at turn10, we must be at 9, and then we take an action at turn10 which might move us to 8 or 10, but 10 is not allowed (y in [0,9]), so we can only go to 8 or stay.\n\n But the goal is to be at 9 at turn10, and then we output an action for turn10? But the action at turn10 is not needed to reach 9 at turn10; it is taken after.\n\n This is not satisfactory.\n\n Given the complexity, I will assume that the intended meaning is that we take actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and then the state at turn t1+H is the result, and we require that state to be (0,9). Then the turn of arrival is t1+H.\n\n And the minimal H is the number of actions taken.\n\n Then in the example above, we take 9 actions (from turn1 to turn9), and then at turn10 we are at 9. So H=9.\n\n But the problem's condition is: at turn t1+H-1 = 1+9-1 = turn9 we would be at 9? But we are at 9 at turn10.\n\n So to have turn9 be 9, we would have to be at 9 at turn9, which requires 8 actions: \n   turn1: U -> y2=1\n   turn2: U -> y3=2\n   ...\n   turn8: U -> y9=8\n   turn9: U -> y10=9 -> but then at turn9 we are at 8, not 9.\n\n So to be at 9 at turn9, we must have taken actions from turn1 to turn8, and then at turn9 we are at 9. So that's 8 actions.\n\n Therefore, if we want to be at 9 at turn9, then we need 8 actions.\n\n Then the problem's condition: turn t1+H-1 = 1+H-1 = turn H = 9, so H=9.\n\n Then the sequence has H=9 actions: for turns 1 to 9.\n\n But then the last action (at turn9) is the one that moves us to 9 at turn10. So at turn9 we are at 8, and then we take U and at turn10 we are at 9. But the problem requires at turn9 ( which is 1+9-1=9) we are at 9. But we are at 8 at turn9.\n\n This is not matching.\n\n Therefore, the only consistent way is to assume that the state at turn t is the state after the action taken at turn t-1, and we start at turn1 with state0.\n\n We require state at turn T = 9, where T = t1+H-1 = H.\n\n We take actions at turns 1 to T-1 = H-1.\n\n The sequence of actions is for turns 1 to H-1, so the length is H-1.\n\n Then the problem's sequence indexing: {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} should be for t=0 to H-1, which is turns 1 to 1+H-1 = turns 1 to H.\n\n But we only need actions for turns 1 to H-1. So the last action in the sequence (t=H-1) is for turn H, which is not taken if we only need actions up to turn H-1.\n\n Given the time, I will assume that the minimal H is the number of turns from the start until the turn we are at 9, inclusive. Then the number of actions is H-1.\n\n And the sequence should have H-1 actions. But the problem asks for H actions.\n\n I think there is a mistake in the problem statement. I will proceed to solve the problem as follows:\n\n We must reach (0,9) at some turn T (>=1), and we want to minimize T - 1 ( the number of actions) or minimize T ( the turn number)? The problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then defines H by the turn we arrive: T = t1+H-1.\n\n So to minimize H, we minimize T = 1+H-1 = H, so we are minimizing the turn number T.\n\n Therefore, we want the smallest turn number T>=1 such that we can be at (0,9) at turn T.\n\n Then the number of actions is T-1.\n\n Then the sequence of actions will be for turns 1 to T-1, so length T-1.\n\n But the problem says the sequence has H actions, and H = T - t1 + 1 = T - 1 + 1 = T.\n\n So they want a sequence of T actions, but we only need T-1 actions.\n\n So we will have to output T actions, but the last action (at turn T) is not needed and may be arbitrary, but then at turn T we are at 9, and then the action at turn T will change it.\n\n But the problem only requires to reach at turn T ( which is t1+H-1 = 1+H-1 = H, and we let T=H).\n\n So if we are at 9 at turn T, then the action at turn T is taken while we are at 9. We can choose 'S' (stay) to remain at 9. Or any action, but 'S' is safe.\n\n Therefore, we can do: actions for turns 1 to T-1 to reach 9 at turn T, and then at turn T, action 'S' to stay.\n\n Then the sequence length is T = H.\n\n So in the example: to arrive at turn10, we take 9 actions of 'U' and then at turn10, we take 'S'. So the sequence has 10 actions.\n\n But note: at turn10, we are already at 9 (from turn10's perspective, we are at 9 at the beginning of the turn), and then we take 'S' and remain at 9 for turn11.\n\n The requirement is to reach (0,9) at turn10, and we are at 9 at turn10 (beginning) -> so we are safe.\n\n Then we output 10 actions.\n\n Therefore, the plan is: find the minimal turn T (>=1) such that we can be at (0,9) at turn T, with a sequence of actions from turn1 to turn T-1 that brings us to 9 at turn T, and then for turn T, we output 'S' (or any action, but 'S' is safe and doesn't change anything).\n\n However, note that at turn T, if we are at 9, and we are not on a freeway (9 is safe), so any action is fine, but 'S' is natural.\n\n But the sequence must be of length H, and H = T - 1 + 1 = T? Let's see:\n\n  T = turn at which we are at 9 = turn10 in the example.\n  Then H = ? from the problem: T = t1+H-1 = 1+H-1 = H.\n  So H = T.\n\n  Then the sequence is for turns: t1 to t1+H-1 = 1 to 1+T-1 = 1 to T.\n\n  In the example, T=10, so turns 1 to 10.\n\n  The actions for turns1 to 9 are 'U', and turn10 is 'S'.\n\n  This works.\n\n Therefore, we must find the minimal T>=1 such that there is a sequence of actions for turns1 to T-1 that brings us to 9 at turn T, and avoiding collisions on freeways at every turn from 2 to T-1 (note: at turn1 we are at 0, safe; at turn T we are at 9, safe).\n\n But note: at turn1, we are at 0, safe. The first action is at turn1, and then at turn2, we are at y2, which might be in a freeway.\n\n We need to avoid collision at every turn i (from 1 to T) if at that turn we are on a freeway (1..8).\n\n Specifically, at turn i, if y_i in {1,2,...,8}, then we must ensure that no car on freeway y_i has a span that contains 0 at turn i.\n\n And at turn1, y1=0 -> safe.\n turn T, y_T=9 -> safe.\n\n So only turns 2 to T-1 might be in freeways and need to be checked.\n\n However, note that at turn T, we are at 9, so we don't need to check for that turn even if we then take an action to move away in the next turn, but the requirement is only to be at 9 at turn T.\n\n Now, we are ready to solve.\n\n We want the minimal T such that there exists a sequence of actions a1, a2, ..., a_{T-1} that results in y_T = 9, and for every turn i from 1 to T, if y_i is in [1,8], then at turn i, on freeway y_i, no car has a span containing 0.\n\n We then output the sequence: a1, a2, ..., a_{T-1}, and then a_T = 'S' (for turn T).\n\n But note: at turn T, we are at 9, and we are outputting an action for turn T. That action is 'S', and it doesn't affect our state at turn T (which is the state at the beginning of turn T) meeting the goal.\n\n However, the action at turn T does affect the state at turn T+1, but we don't care.\n\n Therefore, we can do that.\n\n Now, the minimal T: we start at turn1: y1=0.\n We want to be at y_T=9.\n\n The minimal T if there were no cars would be: \n   We need to move up 9 steps. The fastest is to move up every turn. Then:\n      turn1: y1=0\n      turn2: y2=1\n      turn3: y2=2\n      ...\n      turn10: y10=9.\n\n   So T=10.\n\n   Then we output 10 actions: U for turns1-9, and S for turn10.\n\n But with cars, we may have to wait (use 'S') or even move down to avoid collisions, which might increase T.\n\n So we need to simulate the car positions at every turn and see if the path is clear.\n\n We are to find the minimal T such that there is a path from y1=0 to y_T=9, with actions in {U, D, S}, and avoiding collisions.\n\n We can use BFS over the state (turn, y) but turn can be large because the cars move and might have large speeds and positions.\n\n However, note that the car positions are linear in time, and the freeways are fixed. The collision on freeway i at turn t depends on whether 0 is in the span of any car on freeway i at turn t.\n\n We can precompute for each freeway i and for each turn t whether there is a car on freeway i at turn t that covers 0.\n\n But the turn t might be very large if we take a long time, but we hope to find a path in a bounded time.\n\n Note: the minimal T is at least 10 (if we move up continuously). But we might have to detour, so T might be larger.\n\n How to bound? We can try from T=10 upward until we find a path.\n\n We'll do a BFS or Dijkstra over the state (t, y) for t from 1 up to some limit, and y in [0,9].\n\n State: (turn, y)\n We start at (1,0) with cost=0 actions, but we are not counting actions, we are counting turns.\n\n We want to reach (T,9) for the smallest T.\n\n From state (t, y), we can choose an action a in {U, D, S} and then:\n\n   y_next = y + \n        if a='U': +1 (capped at 9)\n        if a='D': -1 (capped at 0)\n        if a='S': 0\n\n   Then next state is (t+1, y_next).\n\n And we require that at the new turn (t+1), if y_next is in [1,8], then freeway y_next at turn t+1 must not have any car covering 0.\n\n But note: the state we are at (t+1, y_next) means at turn t+1, we are at y_next.\n\n So we need to check freeway y_next at turn t+1.\n\n We must also check the intermediate state? No, because the only collision is at the turn we are on the freeway.\n\n However, note: when we are at turn t+1, we are on freeway y_next at that turn.\n\n What about the previous state? At turn t, we were at y, and if y was in [1,8] then we checked that at turn t there was no collision.\n\n But in our BFS, when we are at state (t,y), it means we are at turn t and we are safe. Then we take an action and move to (t+1, y_next), and then we check safety at (t+1, y_next).\n\n So the BFS:\n\n   Let Q be a queue of (t, y)\n   Start: (1,0) is safe, so we put it with a path [].\n\n   Then for each state (t,y), we try actions that lead to (t+1, y_next) and if y_next is safe at turn t+1 (meaning either y_next=0,9 or if in [1,8] then no car on freeway y_next covers 0 at turn t+1), then we add (t+1, y_next) to the queue.\n\n   We want to reach (t,9) for some t. Then T = t.\n\n   Then the actions are the sequence we stored.\n\n   But note: the action at the last state (t,9) is not needed for reaching 9 at turn t, but we have to output an action for turn t. We will output 'S' for turn t.\n\n   However, in the BFS, we only have actions from turn1 to turn t-1. For turn t, we haven't chosen an action yet.\n\n   So in the BFS, we will have a path of actions for turns1 to t-1 that brings us to (t,9). Then we will output that path and then an extra 'S' for turn t.\n\n   Therefore, the total number of actions in the sequence is t.\n\n   And the minimal T (turn at which we are at 9) is t, and then H = t.\n\n   Then the sequence has H = t actions: the actions for turns1 to t-1 that we found, and then 'S' for turn t.\n\n   But note: the action for turn t is not used in the BFS to reach (t,9). We are at (t,9) at the beginning of turn t, so we are safe. Then we choose 'S' to stay.\n\n   This is valid.\n\n Now, we need to check for a given freeway i and turn t, whether there is a car on freeway i that covers 0.\n\n We are given the initial state of the cars at turn1.\n\n For a car on freeway i at turn1: \n   (head, tail, direction, speed) = (h, tau, d, s)\n\n   Since all are right-moving: d='right'\n\n   At turn t, the car's span is: [tau + s*(t-1), h + s*(t-1)]\n\n   We need to check if 0 is in [tau + s*(t-1), h + s*(t-1)].\n\n   Note: because it's right-moving, and at turn1 the span is [tau, h] (since head is at h, tail at tau, and head>tail for right-moving? But the given example: \n        freeway1: (51,40,right,3) -> at turn1: [40,51] -> 0 not in [40,51]\n        freeway2: (-36,-47,right,12) -> at turn1: [-47, -36]? But the given: \"(-36, -47, right, 12)\" -> head=-36, tail=-47. But for right-moving, the head is the right end? So the span is [tail, head] = [-47, -36] -> then at turn1, the car is from -47 to -36, so 0 not in there.\n\n   But the problem says for right-moving: \n        [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n   So at turn T, the span is [tau + s*(T-1), h + s*(T-1)].\n\n   We then check if 0 is in that interval.\n\n   Note: the interval is [A, B] where A = tau+s*(T-1), B = h+s*(T-1). And since it's right-moving and head>tail, we have h>tau, so B>A.\n\n   Therefore, 0 in [A, B] if A<=0<=B.\n\n We have to do this for every car on freeway i.\n\n For freeway i, we are given a list of cars.\n\n For example, freeway2 has three cars: \n   car1: (-36, -47, right, 12)\n   car2: (0, -11, right, 12) -> head=0, tail=-11 -> at turn1: [-11,0] -> 0 is included! \n   car3: (36,25,right,12) -> [25,36]\n\n   But note: at turn1, freeway2 has a car at [-11,0] that includes 0.\n\n   So at turn1, if we were on freeway2, we would collide.\n\n   But we start at turn1 at freeway0, so safe.\n\n   However, if we were to move to freeway2 at turn2, we would be at freeway2 at turn2, so we need to check freeway2 at turn2.\n\n   For car2 on freeway2: \n        at turn2: A = -11 + 12*(2-1) = -11+12 = 1, B=0+12=12 -> span [1,12] -> 0 not in there.\n\n   So at turn2, the car2 on freeway2 does not cover 0.\n\n   But car1: A = -47+12= -35, B=-36+12=-24 -> [-35,-24] -> 0 not in.\n   car3: A=25+12=37, B=36+12=48 -> [37,48] -> 0 not in.\n\n   So freeway2 at turn2 is safe.\n\n   But at turn1, freeway2 is not safe (because of car2: [ -11,0] at turn1).\n\n   So we must avoid being on freeway2 at turn1.\n\n   We are at turn1 at freeway0, so safe.\n\n   At turn2, freeway2 is safe.\n\n   So if we move up at turn1, we go to freeway1 at turn2.\n\n   For freeway1: only one car: (51,40,right,3) -> at turn2: A=40+3*(1)=43, B=51+3=54 -> [43,54] -> 0 not in, safe.\n\n   So we can move to freeway1 at turn2.\n\n   Then at turn3, we might move to freeway2: we need to check freeway2 at turn3.\n\n        car1: A=-47+12*2 = -47+24 = -23, B=-36+24=-12 -> [-23,-12] -> safe.\n        car2: A=-11+24=13, B=0+24=24 -> [13,24] -> safe.\n        car3: A=25+24=49, B=36+24=60 -> [49,60] -> safe.\n\n   So freeway2 at turn3 is safe.\n\n   But can we move upward continuously? Let's check freeway3 at turn3 and turn4.\n\n   freeway3 has the same cars as freeway2: \n        car1: (-36,-47,right,12) -> at turn3: [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23,-12]\n        car2: (0,-11,right,12) -> [-11+24, 0+24] = [13,24]\n        car3: (36,25,right,12) -> [25+24, 36+24] = [49,60]\n        all safe.\n\n   freeway4: same as freeway2 and 3 -> safe.\n\n   freeway5: (54,43,right,6) -> at turn5 (if we get to freeway5 at turn5): \n        A = 43+6*(5-1)=43+24=67, B=54+24=78 -> safe.\n\n   freeway6: same as freeway5 -> safe.\n\n   freeway7: (-44,-55,right,4) -> at turn7: \n        A=-55+4*(7-1) = -55+24 = -31, B=-44+24=-20 -> safe.\n   freeway8: same as freeway7 -> safe.\n\n   So it seems that moving up continuously might work? Let's check freeway1 at turn2: safe, freeway2 at turn3: safe, freeway3 at turn4: safe, freeway4 at turn5: safe, freeway5 at turn6: safe, freeway6 at turn7: safe, freeway7 at turn8: safe, freeway8 at turn9: safe, and then at turn10: freeway9 (safe).\n\n   But what about freeway1 at turn2: we did above -> safe.\n\n   However, let me check freeway2 at turn2: we are not there if we move continuously, because at turn2 we are at freeway1, turn3 at freeway2.\n\n   But what if we move faster? We cannot.\n\n   Or slower? We might have to avoid a collision by waiting.\n\n   But in this case, it seems safe to move up every turn.\n\n   However, we must check every freeway at the turn we are on it.\n\n   We will be:\n     turn1: y1=0 (safe)\n     turn2: y2=1 -> check freeway1 at turn2: car: [40+3, 51+3] = [43,54] -> safe.\n     turn3: y3=2 -> freeway2 at turn3: as above, safe.\n     turn4: y4=3 -> freeway3 at turn4: \n             car1: -47+12*3 = -47+36 = -11, -36+36=0 -> [-11,0] -> 0 is included! \n\n        Oh! freeway3 at turn4: car1: [-47+12*(4-1), -36+12*(4-1)] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included. \n\n        So if we are on freeway3 at turn4, we collide.\n\n   Therefore, we cannot be on freeway3 at turn4.\n\n   We have to avoid that.\n\n   So we must not be at freeway3 at turn4.\n\n   How? We can either:\n     - At turn3, instead of moving up to freeway3, we move down to freeway1 (if we were at freeway2 at turn3) -> then at turn4 we are at freeway1.\n     - Or at turn3, we stay at freeway2.\n     - Or at turn2, we don't move up to freeway1, but stay at freeway0 (but then we are at freeway0 at turn2, safe) and then at turn3 move up to freeway1.\n\n   We need to find a path that avoids freeway3 at turn4.\n\n   We are at turn3: at freeway2 (safe) at turn3.\n\n   Options at turn3:\n        a3 = 'U' -> y4=3: freeway3 at turn4: not safe.\n        a3 = 'D' -> y4=1: freeway1 at turn4: check freeway1 at turn4: \n              car: [40+3*(4-1)=40+9=49, 51+9=60] -> safe.\n        a3 = 'S' -> y4=2: freeway2 at turn4: check freeway2 at turn4:\n              car1: -47+12*3 = -11, -36+12*3=0 -> [-11,0] -> 0 is included! -> not safe.\n\n        So only 'D' is safe.\n\n   So from turn3 (at freeway2), we must move down to freeway1 at turn4.\n\n   Then at turn4, we are at freeway1.\n\n   Then at turn4, we can plan to move up later.\n\n   We want to minimize the turn when we reach 9.\n\n   This detour will cost extra turns.\n\n   We are at turn4: y4=1.\n\n   Then we can:\n        turn4: U -> y5=2 (freeway2 at turn5: check: \n                freeway2 at turn5: \n                    car1: -47+12*4 = -47+48=1, -36+48=12 -> [1,12] -> does not include 0? But we are checking if 0 is in the span -> 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n                car2: -11+48=37, 0+48=48 -> [37,48] -> safe.\n                car3: 25+48=73, 36+48=84 -> safe.\n                so safe.\n        turn5: U -> y6=3 (freeway3 at turn6: \n                car1: -47+12*5 = -47+60=13, -36+60=24 -> [13,24] -> safe.\n                car2: -11+60=49, 0+60=60 -> safe.\n                car3: 25+60=85, 36+60=96 -> safe.\n                safe.\n        turn6: U -> y7=4 (freeway4 at turn7: \n                same as freeway2 and 3, but at turn7: \n                car1: -47+12*6 = -47+72=25, -36+72=36 -> [25,36] -> safe (0 not in)\n                car2: -11+72=61, 0+72=72 -> safe.\n                car3: 25+72=97, 36+72=108 -> safe.\n                safe.\n        turn7: U -> y8=5 (freeway5 at turn8: \n                car: [43+6*(8-1)=43+42=85, 54+42=96] -> safe.\n        turn8: U -> y9=6 (freeway6 at turn9: \n                same as freeway5: [43+6*8=43+48=91, 54+48=102] -> safe.\n        turn9: U -> y10=7 (freeway7 at turn10: \n                car: (-44,-55,right,4) -> at turn10: \n                      A=-55+4*9 = -55+36 = -19, B=-44+36=-8 -> [-19,-8] -> safe.\n        turn10: U -> y11=8 (freeway8 at turn11: \n                same as freeway7: at turn11: \n                      A=-55+4*10 = -55+40 = -15, B=-44+40=-4 -> [-15,-4] -> safe.\n        turn11: U -> y12=9 (safe)\n\n   So we reach at turn12.\n\n   Then we output 12 actions: \n        turn1: U\n        turn2: U\n        turn3: D\n        turn4: U\n        turn5: U\n        turn6: U\n        turn7: U\n        turn8: U\n        turn9: U\n        turn10: U\n        turn11: U\n        turn12: S\n\n   But is this minimal? Maybe there is a shorter path.\n\n   Alternatively, at turn3 (at freeway2), we moved down to freeway1 at turn4.\n\n   But could we at turn2 do something differently? \n\n   At turn2, we are at freeway1 (safe). What if at turn2 we don't move up to freeway2 at turn3, but stay at freeway1 for turn3? \n        turn2: S -> then at turn3: y3=1 (freeway1) -> check freeway1 at turn3: \n               car: [40+3*(3-1)=40+6=46, 51+6=57] -> safe.\n\n        Then at turn3: we can move up to freeway2 at turn4: \n               freeway2 at turn4: we already know car1: [-11,0] -> unsafe? \n               Actually, freeway2 at turn4: \n                  car1: -47+12*3 = -47+36 = -11, -36+36=0 -> [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\n        So we cannot move up to freeway2 at turn4.\n\n        Alternatively, we can move down to freeway0 at turn4? \n               turn3: D -> y4=0 (safe)\n\n        Then at turn4: at freeway0, then we can move up to freeway1 at turn5, etc.\n\n        This will take even more turns.\n\n   Or at turn3 (after staying at turn2), we might stay again at turn3: then at turn4: y4=1 (freeway1) -> safe (as above).\n\n        Then at turn4: move up to freeway2 at turn5: \n               freeway2 at turn5: \n                  car1: -47+12*4 = -47+48=1, -36+48=12 -> [1,12] -> does not include 0 -> safe.\n\n        Then we can continue upward.\n\n        The timeline:\n            turn1: y1=0 -> safe.\n            turn1: U -> turn2: y2=1\n            turn2: S -> turn3: y3=1\n            turn3: S -> turn4: y4=1\n            turn4: U -> turn5: y5=2 (freeway2 at turn5: safe as above)\n            turn5: U -> turn6: y6=3 (freeway3 at turn6: \n                     car1: -47+12*5 = -47+60=13, -36+60=24 -> safe.\n            then continue as before: \n                     turn6: U -> turn7:4, safe (freeway4 at turn7: car1: -47+12*6 = -47+72=25, safe)\n                     turn7: U -> turn8:5, safe\n                     turn8: U -> turn9:6, safe\n                     turn9: U -> turn10:7, safe\n                     turn10: U -> turn11:8, safe\n                     turn11: U -> turn12:9 -> then at turn12: we are at 9.\n\n        This is also 12 turns.\n\n   But note: we are at 9 at turn12, and then we output an action for turn12: 'S'. So total actions: 12.\n\n   The first detour (with down at turn3) also took 12 turns.\n\n   Is there a path that takes 11 turns? \n\n   We would have to reach 9 at turn11.\n\n   That means we must have taken 10 actions (from turn1 to turn10) that sum to +9 in y.\n\n   The minimal steps is 9 ups, so 9 actions, but we had to detour. In both detours we used one extra move (one down or two stays) so we used 10 or 11 moves? \n\n   In the first detour: \n        actions: \n          turn1: U (0->1)\n          turn2: U (1->2)\n          turn3: D (2->1)  -> this is one extra move (the down) and then we need to go from 1 to 9: 8 ups -> total moves: 1 (for turn1) + 1 (turn2) + 1 (turn3) + 8 (turns4-11) = 11 moves, then at turn12 we are at 9.\n\n   But we are at 9 at turn12, not turn11.\n\n   To be at 9 at turn11, we would have to cover 9 units in 10 actions? \n\n   The net upward movement must be +9.\n\n   Let u be the number of U, d the number of D, and s the number of S, then:\n        u - d = 9\n        u + d + s = 10\n\n   Then 2u + s = 19 -> u = (19-s)/2. Since u must be integer, s must be odd.\n\n   s can be 1, then u=9, d=0 -> but then we have one stay. But we need to avoid collisions.\n\n   Or s=3, u=8, d=0? -> u-d=8, not 9.\n\n   Or s= -? \n\n   Actually, from the equations:\n        u = 9 + d\n        then 9+d + d + s = 10 -> 9 + 2d + s = 10 -> 2d+s=1.\n\n   So d=0, s=1 -> then u=9.\n        or d=1, s=-1 -> not possible.\n\n   So the only possibility is: 9 U's and 1 S.\n\n   We need to distribute 9 U's and 1 S in 10 actions, and the net is 9.\n\n   The S can be at any turn.\n\n   We start at 0.\n\n   We must be at freeway1 at turn2, freeway2 at turn3, ... until freeway9 at turn10? Not necessarily, because we can insert a stay anywhere.\n\n   For example, we could do:\n\n        turn1: U -> 1\n        turn2: U -> 2\n        turn3: U -> 3\n        turn4: U -> 4  -> but then at turn4, freeway4: \n               freeway4 at turn4: \n                  car1: -47+12*3 = -47+36 = -11, -36+36=0 -> [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\n   So we cannot be at freeway4 at turn4.\n\n   We could insert the stay earlier.\n\n   Suppose we do:\n\n        turn1: U ->1\n        turn2: U ->2\n        turn3: S ->2  (at turn3: freeway2: safe? at turn3: freeway2: \n               car1: -47+12*2 = -47+24=-23, -36+24=-12 -> safe.\n               car2: -11+24=13,0+24=24 -> safe.\n               car3:25+24=49,36+24=60 -> safe.\n               safe)\n        turn4: U ->3 (freeway3 at turn4: unsafe as before: car1: [-11,0] -> unsafe)\n\n   So we cannot do that.\n\n   Insert the stay at turn4: then at turn4, we would be at freeway3? \n        turn1:U->1\n        turn2:U->2\n        turn3:U->3 (freeway3 at turn3: \n               car1: -47+12*2=-47+24=-23, -36+24=-12 -> safe)\n        turn4: S ->3 (freeway3 at turn4: unsafe)\n\n   So we cannot stay at freeway3 at turn4.\n\n   What if we avoid freeway4 at turn4 by being at freeway3 at turn4 and then not moving? that's the same.\n\n   Or if we move down at turn4? but then we would not have net 9.\n\n   Or if we insert the stay at a different freeway.\n\n   How about we be at freeway3 at turn5 instead of turn4? \n\n   Timeline for minimal without waiting was:\n        turn1:0->1\n        turn2:1->2\n        turn3:2->3 -> then at turn4 we would be at 4 (which is unsafe).\n\n   Instead, we do:\n        turn1:U->1\n        turn2:U->2\n        turn3:U->3 (at turn3: freeway3: safe, as above)\n        turn4: we cannot stay at 3 (unsafe) and cannot move to 4 (because then we are at freeway4 at turn4, which we haven't checked? actually freeway4 at turn4 is the same as freeway3 at turn4: car1: [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\n        But freeway4 has the same cars as freeway3? yes, according to the table.\n\n   So freeway4 at turn4 is also unsafe.\n\n   Therefore, we must not be on freeway3 or freeway4 at turn4.\n\n   The only safe freeways at turn4 are freeway0,1,2,5,6,7,8? We have to check:\n\n        freeway0: safe.\n        freeway1: car: [40+3*3=49, 51+3*3=60] -> safe.\n        freeway2: unsafe (car1: [-11,0])\n        freeway3: unsafe (car1: [-11,0])\n        freeway4: unsafe (car1: [-11,0])  [because same as freeway2,3?]\n        freeway5: car: [43+6*3=43+18=61,54+18=72] -> safe.\n        freeway6: same as freeway5 -> safe.\n        freeway7: car: [-55+4*3=-55+12=-43, -44+12=-32] -> safe.\n        freeway8: same as freeway7 -> safe.\n\n   So we could move to freeway5 at turn4? But how? We are at freeway3 at turn3. To move to freeway5 at turn4, we would have to move up twice in one action? That's not allowed. We can only change by -1,0,+1.\n\n   So from freeway3 at turn3, we can only go to freeway2,3, or4.\n\n   And at turn4, freeway2,3,4 are unsafe.\n\n   So the only safe move from freeway3 at turn3 is to go to freeway2? -> unsafe at turn4.\n\n   Therefore, we cannot be at freeway3 at turn3 if we want to be safe at turn4.\n\n   This means we must not arrive at freeway3 at turn3.\n\n   Therefore, the direct upward move is blocked at turn3.\n\n   We must have a detour.\n\n   Given that, the minimal T is 12.\n\n   But let me try to see if we can do it in 11 turns with a different detour.\n\n   We start:\n        turn1: U ->1 (safe)\n        turn2: S ->1 (safe)  [at turn2: freeway1: safe; at turn3: freeway1: safe (as above)]\n        turn3: U ->2 (freeway2 at turn3: safe, as above)\n        turn4: we are at freeway2. We have to choose an action for turn4.\n\n        At turn4, freeway2 is unsafe (car1: [-11,0]), so we must leave freeway2.\n\n        We can go to freeway1 or freeway3.\n\n        freeway1 at turn4: safe.\n        freeway3 at turn4: unsafe.\n\n        So we move down to freeway1.\n\n        turn4: D ->1.\n\n        Then at turn5: at freeway1.\n\n        Then we need to get to 9 from 1 in 6 actions (from turn5 to turn10) to be at 9 at turn11.\n\n        We need net +8 in 6 actions.\n\n        Let u be number of U, d be number of D, s be number of S in these 6 actions: \n             u - d = 8\n             u + d + s = 6\n             -> 2u + s = 14 -> u = (14-s)/2.\n\n        s must be even. s=0 -> u=7, then d = u-8 = -1 -> not possible.\n        s=2 -> u=6, then d = 6-8 = -2 -> not possible.\n        s=4 -> u=5, d=5-8 = -3 -> not possible.\n\n        So it's impossible to gain 8 in 6 actions.\n\n   Therefore, we cannot reach 9 at turn11 from freeway1 at turn5.\n\n   Another try:\n\n        turn1: U (0->1)\n        turn2: U (1->2)\n        turn3: D (2->1)   [then at turn4: at freeway1]\n        Then from turn4: at 1, we need to get to 9 in 7 actions (turn4 to turn10) for turn11: net +8 in 7 actions.\n             u - d = 8\n             u + d + s = 7\n             -> 2u + s = 15 -> u=(15-s)/2.\n             s=1: u=7, d= -1 -> not possible.\n             s=3: u=6, d=6-8=-2 -> not possible.\n             s=5: u=5, d=5-8=-3 -> not possible.\n\n   Also impossible.\n\n   Therefore, there is no path to reach 9 at turn11.\n\n   So minimal T is 12.\n\n   Now, we have to choose a sequence of 12 actions.\n\n   We have at least two options.\n\n   Option 1 (with down at turn3):\n        turn1: U\n        turn2: U\n        turn3: D\n        turn4: U\n        turn5: U\n        turn6: U\n        turn7: U\n        turn8: U\n        turn9: U\n        turn10: U\n        turn11: U\n        turn12: S\n\n   But we must check safety at every turn.\n\n   We did:\n        turn1: y1=0 -> safe.\n        turn2: y2=1 -> freeway1: [40+3,51+3] = [43,54] -> safe.\n        turn3: y3=2 -> freeway2: \n                car1: -47+12*2 = -47+24=-23, -36+24=-12 -> safe.\n                car2: -11+24=13, 0+24=24 -> safe.\n                car3: 25+24=49, 36+24=60 -> safe.\n        turn4: y4=1 (after moving down from 2 to 1) -> freeway1: [40+3*3=40+9=49, 51+9=60] -> safe.\n        turn5: y5=2 (after moving up) -> freeway2: \n                car1: -47+12*4 = -47+48=1, -36+48=12 -> [1,12] -> safe (0 not in)\n                car2: -11+48=37,0+48=48 -> safe.\n                car3:25+48=73,36+48=84 -> safe.\n        turn6: y6=3 -> freeway3: \n                car1: -47+12*5 = -47+60=13, -36+60=24 -> safe.\n                car2: -11+60=49,0+60=60 -> safe.\n                car3:25+60=85,36+60=96 -> safe.\n        turn7: y7=4 -> freeway4: \n                car1: -47+12*6 = -47+72=25, -36+72=36 -> safe.\n                car2: -11+72=61,0+72=72 -> safe.\n                car3:25+72=97,36+72=108 -> safe.\n        turn8: y8=5 -> freeway5: \n                car: [43+6*7=43+42=85,54+42=96] -> safe.\n        turn9: y9=6 -> freeway6: \n                same as freeway5: [43+6*8=43+48=91,54+48=102] -> safe.\n        turn10: y10=7 -> freeway7: \n                car: [-55+4*9=-55+36=-19, -44+36=-8] -> safe.\n        turn11: y11=8 -> freeway8: \n                same as freeway7: [-55+4*10=-55+40=-15, -44+40=-4] -> safe.\n        turn12: we are at y12=9 -> safe.\n\n   Then the action at turn12 is 'S'.\n\n   So the sequence is:\n\n        Turn 1: U\n        Turn 2: U\n        Turn 3: D\n        Turn 4: U\n        Turn 5: U\n        Turn 6: U\n        Turn 7: U\n        Turn 8: U\n        Turn 9: U\n        Turn 10: U\n        Turn 11: U\n        Turn 12: S\n\n   But note: the turn numbering in the output is for turns starting at t1=1.\n\n   So:\n\n        Turn 1: U\n        Turn 2: U\n        Turn 3: D\n        Turn 4: U\n        Turn 5: U\n        Turn 6: U\n        Turn 7: U\n        Turn 8: U\n        Turn 9: U\n        Turn 10: U\n        Turn 11: U\n        Turn 12: S\n\n   This is 12 actions.\n\n   Option 2 (with two stays):\n\n        turn1: U\n        turn2: S   [y2=1]\n        turn3: S   [y3=1]\n        turn4: U   [y4=2]\n        turn5: U   [y5=3]\n        turn6: U   [y6=4]\n        turn7: U   [y7=5]\n        turn8: U   [y8=6]\n        turn9: U   [y9=7]\n        turn10: U  [y10=8]\n        turn11: U  [y11=9]\n        turn12: S\n\n   Check safety:\n        turn1:0-> safe.\n        turn2:1-> freeway1: [40+3,51+3]=[43,54] -> safe.\n        turn3:1-> freeway1: [40+3*2=46,51+6=57] -> safe.\n        turn4:2-> freeway2: \n                car1: -47+12*3 = -47+36=-11, -36+36=0 -> unsafe! \n\n   Oh no! at turn4, freeway2 is unsafe.\n\n   So this path is not valid.\n\n   We could do:\n\n        turn1:U (0->1)\n        turn2:S (1->1)\n        turn3:U (1->2)  [at turn3: freeway2: safe (as above: car1: [-23,-12]) \n        turn4: then we are at freeway2 at turn4: unsafe.\n\n   So we must leave freeway2 at turn4.\n\n   We could at turn3: after being at freeway2 at turn3, we move down to freeway1 at turn4: then safe.\n\n   Then the timeline:\n\n        turn1:U->1\n        turn2:S->1\n        turn3:U->2\n        turn4:D->1\n        turn5:U->2\n        turn6:U->3\n        ... and then as before.\n\n   This will take more than 12 turns.\n\n   Therefore, the first option is valid and minimal.\n\n   So we output:\n\n        Turn 1: U\n        Turn 2: U\n        Turn 3: D\n        Turn 4: U\n        Turn 5: U\n        Turn 6: U\n        Turn 7: U\n        Turn 8: U\n        Turn 9: U\n        Turn 10: U\n        Turn 11: U\n        Turn 12: S\n\n   But wait, is there a path with T=12 that uses a down and then continues and doesn't require 11 ups from turn4? We only did 8 ups from turn4 to turn11: that's 8 ups, which gets us to 1+8=9 at turn12.\n\n   And then turn12: we are at 9, and we output 'S'.\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   However, note that at turn11: we are at y11=8 (because we did 8 ups from turn4 to turn11: turn4:1, turn5:2, turn6:3, turn7:4, turn8:5, turn9:6, turn10:7, turn11:8). Then at turn11, we do U to get to 9 at turn12.\n\n   But then the action at turn12 is after we are already at 9. So the action at turn11 is U, and then at turn12 we are at 9, and then we output S.\n\n   The sequence above is:\n\n        Turn1: U  -> to 1 at turn2\n        Turn2: U  -> to 2 at turn3\n        Turn3: D  -> to 1 at turn4\n        Turn4: U  -> to 2 at turn5\n        Turn5: U  -> to 3 at turn6\n        Turn6: U  -> to 4 at turn7\n        Turn7: U  -> to 5 at turn8\n        Turn8: U  -> to 6 at turn9\n        Turn9: U  -> to 7 at turn10\n        Turn10: U -> to 8 at turn11\n        Turn11: U -> to 9 at turn12\n        Turn12: S -> to 9 at turn13? \n\n   But note: the state at turn12 is the result of the action at turn11. \n        So at the beginning of turn12, we are at 9.\n        Then we take action S at turn12, and then at turn13 we are still at 9.\n\n   But the problem requires that at turn12 (which is t1+12-1=1+12-1=12) we are at 9.\n\n   In this case, at turn12 (beginning) we are at 9, so we are safe and meet the goal.\n\n   The action at turn12 is 'S', which is valid.\n\n   Therefore, the above sequence is valid.\n\n   However, we have to ensure that at turn12 we are at 9 at the beginning, and we are.\n\n   But let me write the y for each turn:\n\n        turn1: y1=0\n        turn2: y2=1 (after a1=U)\n        turn3: y3=2 (after a2=U)\n        turn4: y4=1 (after a3=D)\n        turn5: y5=2 (after a4=U)\n        turn6: y6=3 (after a5=U)\n        turn7: y7=4 (after a6=U)\n        turn8: y8=5 (after a7=U)\n        turn9: y9=6 (after a8=U)\n        turn10: y10=7 (after a9=U)\n        turn11: y11=8 (after a10=U)\n        turn12: y12=9 (after a11=U)  -> so at the beginning of turn12, we are at 9.\n\n   Then we take a12=S, and then y13=9.\n\n   So the actions for turn11 is U, and for turn12 is S.\n\n   Therefore, the sequence is:\n\n        Turn 1: U\n        Turn 2: U\n        Turn 3: D\n        Turn 4: U\n        Turn 5: U\n        Turn 6: U\n        Turn 7: U\n        Turn 8: U\n        Turn 9: U\n        Turn 10: U\n        Turn 11: U   [this gets us to 9 at turn12]\n        Turn 12: S\n\n   But note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and H=12.\n\n   So t from 0 to 11: \n        t=0: a1\n        t=1: a2\n        ...\n        t=11: a12\n\n   So we output:\n\n        Turn 1: a_{1} = U\n        Turn 2: a_{2} = U\n        Turn 3: a_{3} = D\n        Turn 4: a_{4} = U\n        Turn 5: a_{5} = U\n        Turn 6: a_{6} = U\n        Turn 7: a_{7} = U\n        Turn 8: a_{8} = U\n        Turn 9: a_{9} = U\n        Turn 10: a_{10} = U\n        Turn 11: a_{11} = U\n        Turn 12: a_{12} = S\n\n   But the turn numbers in the output should be: \n        Turn 1: ...\n        Turn 2: ...\n        ...\n\n   So that's 12 lines.\n\n   We have 12 actions.\n\n   This is minimal.\n\n   We have to check if there's a shorter path? We already ruled out T=11.\n\n   Therefore, we output this sequence.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=12.\n\n   Final Answer:\n\n   \\boxed{\n   Turn 1: U\n   Turn 2: U\n   Turn 3: D\n   Turn 4: U\n   Turn 5: U\n   Turn 6: U\n   Turn 7: U\n   Turn 8: U\n   Turn 9: U\n   Turn 10: U\n   Turn 11: U\n   Turn 12: S\n   }\n\n   However, we must double-check if there is a path with T=10 or 11. We did, and found none.\n\n   But let me check freeway3 at turn5 (if we try to go faster) is safe, and freeway4 at turn6 is safe, so why did we have to detour? The issue was at turn4 we would have been on freeway3 or freeway4 and they were unsafe.\n\n   But in our successful path, we were at freeway3 at turn6 (safe) and freeway4 at turn7 (safe). \n\n   And we avoided being on freeway3 and freeway4 at turn4.\n\n   So the detour at turn3 and turn4 (going down and then up) made us one turn behind the direct path, and then we caught up by not waiting.\n\n   And then we used 12 turns.\n\n   We think this is minimal.\n\n   We output the sequence.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\) is 12. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by moving down at turn 3 to avoid an unsafe condition on freeway 3 at turn 4, then continuing upward. The actions are as follows:\n\n- **Turn 1**: Move up to \\(y = 1\\) (safe, freeway 1 at turn 2 has no car covering 0).\n- **Turn 2**: Move up to \\(y = 2\\) (safe, freeway 2 at turn 3 has no car covering 0).\n- **Turn 3**: Move down to \\(y = 1\\) (safe, freeway 1 at turn 4 has no car covering 0).\n- **Turn 4**: Move up to \\(y = 2\\) (safe, freeway 2 at turn 5 has no car covering 0).\n- **Turn 5**: Move up to \\(y = 3\\) (safe, freeway 3 at turn 6 has no car covering 0).\n- **Turn 6**: Move up to \\(y = 4\\) (safe, freeway 4 at turn 7 has no car covering 0).\n- **Turn 7**: Move up to \\(y = 5\\) (safe, freeway 5 at turn 8 has no car covering 0).\n- **Turn 8**: Move up to \\(y = 6\\) (safe, freeway 6 at turn 9 has no car covering 0).\n- **Turn 9**: Move up to \\(y = 7\\) (safe, freeway 7 at turn 10 has no car covering 0).\n- **Turn 10**: Move up to \\(y = 8\\) (safe, freeway 8 at turn 11 has no car covering 0).\n- **Turn 11**: Move up to \\(y = 9\\) (safe, as \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway).\n- **Turn 12**: Stay at \\(y = 9\\) (safe, and the goal is reached at turn 12).\n\nThe position \\((0, 9)\\) is achieved at the beginning of turn 12. The action at turn 12 ensures the player remains at \\(y = 9\\) for subsequent turns, but the goal is already met.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 1: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ S} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 1) at turn t_1 = 3. I need to get to (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The vertical axis goes from 0 to 9, so freeways are from y=1 to y=8, and I start at y=1, which is a freeway, so I have to be careful with cars there.\n\nThe goal is (0,9), which is not a freeway; it's the top row. But since collisions only happen on freeways y=1 to 8, once I'm at y=9, I'm safe, and y=0 might be safe too, but I start at y=1.\n\nNow, the player moves with actions U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), or S (stay, y same). y must stay within 0 to 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nCars move on each freeway. For each car, I'm given its position at turn t_1=3: head, tail, direction, and speed. Direction is \"right\" or \"left\", but in the update, for left-moving, span moves left, for right-moving, span moves right.\n\nIn the car update:\n\n- Left-moving: span [h, τ] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] at turn T.\n\n- Right-moving: span [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it's (57,46,right,3), so head=57, tail=46? But for right-moving, it says span is [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head, so for right-moving cars, tail is smaller, head is larger, I think.\n\nLet's clarify the notation.\n\nIn the car state table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 1: (57,46,right,3). Since direction is right, and for right-moving, span is [τ, h], so τ should be the left end, h the right end. Here τ=46, h=57, so τ < h, so [46,57] at t1=3.\n\nSimilarly, for others.\n\nThen at turn T, for right-moving car, span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving; let me check.\n\nFreeway 1: (57,46,right,3) — right\n\nFreeway 2: (-12,-23,right,12), (24,13,right,12), (60,49,right,12) — all right\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-12,-23,right,12), (24,13,right,12), (60,49,right,12) — identical to freeway 2?\n\nFreeway 4: same, (-12,-23,right,12), etc.\n\nFreeway 5: (-48,-59,right,6) — right\n\nFreeway 6: same, (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: (-36,-47,right,4) — right\n\nFreeway 8: same, (-36,-47,right,4)\n\nAll cars are right-moving. No left-moving cars.\n\nAnd collision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that y, there is a car such that 0 is in the car's span at that turn. That is, the car covers position x=0 at time T.\n\nPlayer is at (0, y_T) at turn T, so for collision, if y_T is between 1 and 8, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you won't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T even if they cover 0 at T.\n\nBut for the current position, at turn T, you are on y_T.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=1 to y=9 in min turns, avoiding being on a freeway y when a car on y covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nSince I start at y=1 at t=3, and need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns would be if I go up every turn, but y=1 to y=9, difference of 8, so at least 8 turns if I go up each time, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions, so H could be more than 8.\n\nBut let's see the car positions and when they cover x=0.\n\nFirst, for each freeway, I need to find when a car covers x=0, meaning for some car, span includes 0 at turn T.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, the span moves to the right with time.\n\nFor a right-moving car with initial span [τ, h] at t1=3, speed s.\n\nAt turn T, span is [τ + s*(T-3), h + s*(T-3)]\n\n0 is in span if τ + s*(T-3) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-3)\n\nSince τ <= h, this is equivalent to:\n\nτ + s*(T-3) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-3)\n\nSo, from first inequality: τ + s*(T-3) <= 0 ⇒ s*(T-3) <= -τ ⇒ T-3 <= -τ/s\n\nSince s>0.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= h + s*(T-3) ⇒ s*(T-3) >= -h ⇒ T-3 >= -h/s\n\nSo T must satisfy ceil( -h/s ) <= T-3 <= floor( -τ/s )? Let's see.\n\nFrom T-3 >= -h/s and T-3 <= -τ/s\n\nSince τ <= h, -τ/s >= -h/s, so the interval is T-3 >= ceil( -h/s ) and T-3 <= floor( -τ/s )? No.\n\nInequalities:\n\nT-3 >= -h/s  (since s>0, inequality direction)\n\nT-3 <= -τ/s\n\nAnd since τ <= h, -τ/s >= -h/s, so T-3 must be between ceil( -h/s ) and floor( -τ/s ), but since T integer, we need to find integer T such that max( ceil(-h/s), something ) but let's compute the range.\n\nT-3 must satisfy:\n\nlower bound L = ceil( -h/s )\n\nupper bound U = floor( -τ/s )\n\nThen T-3 must be >= L and <= U, so if L <= U, then T in [3 + L, 3 + U]\n\nOtherwise no collision from this car.\n\nThen for each freeway, if there are multiple cars, we need to know if at least one car covers 0 at T.\n\nBut for the player, we care about when the freeway is dangerous, i.e., when 0 is covered by some car on that row at that turn.\n\nSo let's list for each freeway y, the set of turns T where if player is on y at T, collision occurs.\n\nFreeway y=1: only one car: (h=57, τ=46, right, s=3) at t=3\n\nSo at T, span: [46 + 3*(T-3), 57 + 3*(T-3)]\n\n0 in span if 46 + 3*(T-3) <= 0 <= 57 + 3*(T-3)\n\nFirst, 46 + 3*(T-3) <= 0 ⇒ 3*(T-3) <= -46 ⇒ T-3 <= -46/3 ≈ -15.333, so T-3 <= -16 since integer? T-3 <= floor(-46/3) = floor(-15.333) = -16\n\n-46/3 = -15.333, so T-3 <= -15.333, since T-3 integer, T-3 <= -16\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 57 + 3*(T-3) ⇒ 3*(T-3) >= -57 ⇒ T-3 >= -57/3 = -19\n\nSo T-3 >= -19 and T-3 <= -16\n\nSince -19 <= T-3 <= -16\n\nT-3 >= ceil(-57/3) = ceil(-19) = -19\n\nT-3 <= floor(-46/3) = floor(-15.333) = -16\n\nYes, so T-3 from -19 to -16, so T from 3-19= -16 to 3-16= -13? T-3 = -19, -18, -17, -16\n\nSo T = 3 + (-19) = -16, 3-18=-15, 3-17=-14, 3-16=-13\n\nBut turns are probably non-negative, but T=-16 to -13 are negative turns, which might not be relevant since we start at t=3. So for t>=3, no collision on freeway 1 because the car has passed x=0 long ago.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (h=-12, τ=-23, right, s=12) at t=3\n\nh=-12, τ=-23, so τ < h.\n\nSpan at T: [ -23 + 12*(T-3), -12 + 12*(T-3) ]\n\n0 in span if -23 + 12*(T-3) <= 0 <= -12 + 12*(T-3)\n\nFirst inequality: -23 + 12*(T-3) <= 0 ⇒ 12*(T-3) <= 23 ⇒ T-3 <= 23/12 ≈ 1.916, so T-3 <= 1\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12 + 12*(T-3) ⇒ 12*(T-3) >= 12 ⇒ T-3 >= 1\n\nSo T-3 >=1 and T-3 <=1, so T-3=1, T=4\n\nNow second car on freeway 2: (h=24, τ=13, right, s=12)\n\nSpan at T: [13 + 12*(T-3), 24 + 12*(T-3)]\n\n0 in span: 13 + 12*(T-3) <= 0 <= 24 + 12*(T-3)\n\nFirst: 13 + 12*(T-3) <=0 ⇒ 12*(T-3) <= -13 ⇒ T-3 <= -13/12 ≈ -1.083, so T-3 <= -2\n\nSecond: 0 <= 24 + 12*(T-3) ⇒ 12*(T-3) >= -24 ⇒ T-3 >= -2\n\nSo T-3 >= -2 and T-3 <= -2? T-3 <= floor(-13/12) = floor(-1.083) = -2? -13/12 ≈ -1.083, so 12*(T-3) <= -13, since 12*(T-3) integer, <= -14? Let's see.\n\n12*(T-3) <= -13, since 12*(T-3) must be integer <= -13, so <= -13? -13 is possible if 12*(T-3) = -13, but 12*(T-3) must be multiple of 12? No, T-3 integer, but s*(T-3) may not integer? s=12, T-3 integer, so 12*(T-3) integer.\n\nBut -13 is not multiple of 12, so 12*(T-3) <= -13, the largest integer multiple <= -13 is -14? -12 is greater than -13, no.\n\n12*(T-3) <= -13, since 12*(T-3) is integer, and -13 is not integer multiple, but 12*(T-3) must be integer, so possible values: ..., -24, -12, 0, but -12 > -13? -12 is greater than -13, so 12*(T-3) <= -13 means 12*(T-3) <= -14? Because -12 = -12 > -13, so next is -24, etc.\n\nLet k = T-3, integer.\n\n12k <= -13, since 12k integer, 12k <= -14? For example, k=-1, 12*(-1)= -12 > -13? -12 > -13, so -12 <= -13 is false. k=-2, 12*(-2)= -24 <= -13 true.\n\nSimilarly, 12k >= -24 from second inequality.\n\nFrom first inequality: 13 + 12k <= 0 ⇒ 12k <= -13\n\nSince 12k integer, 12k <= -14? No, -13 is the value, but 12k must be <= -13, and since 12k integer, it must be <= -14? For example, 12k = -12 is -12 > -13, so not <= -13. 12k = -24 <= -13, etc. So the inequality 12k <= -13 holds for k <= -2 since for k=-1, -12 > -13, not <=; k=-2, -24 <= -13 true; k=-3, -36 <= -13 true, etc.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= 24 + 12k ⇒ 12k >= -24 ⇒ k >= -2\n\nSo k >= -2 and k <= ? From 12k <= -13, for k integer, k <= ceil(-13/12) or what? -13/12 ≈ -1.083, so k <= -2 since for k=-1, 12k=-12 > -13, not <= -13; for k=-2, 12k=-24 <= -13 true. And k >= -2 from above.\n\nSo k >= -2 and k <= -2? k >= -2 and k <= -2 only if k=-2.\n\nk >= -2 from second, and for first, 12k <= -13, which for k=-2, -24 <= -13 true, for k=-1, false. But k >= -2 and 12k <= -13.\n\nFor k=-2, 12k=-24 <= -13 true.\n\nFor k=-1, 12k=-12, which is not <= -13, false.\n\nFor k=0, worse.\n\nSo only k=-2.\n\nk >= -2 and the inequality holds only for k <= -2.083 or something, but since k integer, k <= -2.\n\nk >= -2 and k <= -2, so k=-2.\n\nThus T-3 = -2, T=1\n\nBut T=1 < t1=3, so in the past, not relevant for future turns.\n\nNow third car on freeway 2: (h=60, τ=49, right, s=12)\n\nSpan at T: [49 + 12*(T-3), 60 + 12*(T-3)]\n\n0 in span: 49 + 12k <= 0 <= 60 + 12k, where k=T-3\n\n49 + 12k <=0 ⇒ 12k <= -49 ⇒ k <= -49/12 ≈ -4.083, so k <= -5? ceil or floor.\n\n12k <= -49, k integer, so k <= floor(-49/12) = floor(-4.083) = -5? -5*12=-60 <= -49, -4*12=-48 > -49? -48 > -49, so -48 not <= -49, so k <= -5.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 60 + 12k ⇒ 12k >= -60 ⇒ k >= -5\n\nSo k >= -5 and k <= -5, so k=-5, T=3-5= -2, again past.\n\nSo for freeway 2, only possible collision at T=4 from first car, but we have T=4 from first car? First car had T=4.\n\nFor first car on freeway 2: at T=4, span: τ + s*(T-3) = -23 +12*(1) = -23+12= -11? Let's compute.\n\nAt T=4, k=T-3=1, span: [τ + s k, h + s k] = [-23 +12*1, -12 +12*1] = [-11, 0]\n\n-23+12= -11, -12+12=0, so [ -11, 0 ], so at T=4, span includes x=0? [ -11, 0 ], so from -11 to 0, so x=0 is included, since tail at 0? [ -11, 0 ], so positions from -11 to 0 inclusive? Assuming integer positions, I think.\n\nThe grid is discrete? It says \"position\" and cars have head and tail, so probably integer x.\n\nSo span [a,b] means x from a to b inclusive, I assume.\n\nSo at T=4, for first car on freeway 2, span [-11,0], so x=0 is covered.\n\nFor other T, not covered for t>=3 except T=4.\n\nBut T=4 is in future.\n\nSimilarly, for other cars on freeway 2, no coverage at t>=3.\n\nNow for freeway 3: same as freeway 2? From table: freeway 3 has same cars: (-12,-23,right,12), (24,13,right,12), (60,49,right,12)\n\nIdentical to freeway 2, so same as above, collision only at T=4.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same, collision at T=4.\n\nNow freeway 5: car (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nh=-48? τ=-59, so τ < h.\n\nSpan at T: [ -59 + 6*(T-3), -48 + 6*(T-3) ]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 6k <= 0 <= -48 + 6k, k=T-3\n\nFirst: -59 + 6k <=0 ⇒ 6k <= 59 ⇒ k <= 59/6 ≈9.833, so k <=9\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 6k ⇒ 6k >=48 ⇒ k >=8\n\nSo k >=8 and k <=9\n\nT-3=8 or 9, T=11 or 12\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same car, same as freeway 5, so collision at T=11,12\n\nFreeway 7: car (-36,-47,right,4)\n\nh=-36, τ=-47\n\nSpan at T: [ -47 + 4*(T-3), -36 + 4*(T-3) ]\n\n0 in span: -47 + 4k <= 0 <= -36 + 4k, k=T-3\n\nFirst: -47 + 4k <=0 ⇒ 4k <=47 ⇒ k <= 47/4=11.75, so k <=11\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 + 4k ⇒ 4k >=36 ⇒ k >=9\n\nSo k >=9 and k <=11, T-3=9,10,11, T=12,13,14\n\nSimilarly freeway 8: same, collision at T=12,13,14\n\nNow summarize dangerous turns for each freeway:\n\ny=1: no collision for t>=3\n\ny=2: collision at T=4\n\ny=3: collision at T=4 (same as y=2)\n\ny=4: collision at T=4 (same)\n\ny=5: collision at T=11,12\n\ny=6: collision at T=11,12\n\ny=7: collision at T=12,13,14\n\ny=8: collision at T=12,13,14\n\nPlayer starts at t=3, position y=1.\n\nAt t=3, y=1, but y=1 is freeway, is there a car? We said for y=1, no collision at t=3 or later, so at t=3, on y=1, no car covers x=0, so safe.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: if I go up every turn, from y=1 to y=9, 8 steps, so at turns t=3 to t=10, positions y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nt=3: y=1\n\nAfter action at t=3, move to t=4, y=2 if U, etc.\n\nLet's list the position at each turn.\n\nAt turn T, position is y_T, after action from previous.\n\nStart at turn t=3, y=1.\n\nThen at turn T, I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThe position at turn T is fixed when I arrive, before action.\n\nI think I need to define the state.\n\nAt the beginning of turn T, player is at position y_T.\n\nThen player chooses action a_T, which causes y_{T+1} = y_T + delta, with delta based on a_T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, player is at y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T based on y_T and the cars at T.\n\nFor turn T, if y_T between 1 and 8, and if there is a car on that row covering x=0 at T, collision.\n\nIn this case, at t=3, y=1, no collision, safe.\n\nNow, if I go up at t=3, to y=2 at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, y=2, and for y=2, collision at T=4, so if I am on y=2 at t=4, I collide.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=3 or y=4 at t=4, same, collision at t=4.\n\nBut at t=4, only if I am on y=2,3, or 4, I collide because those freeways have collision at t=4.\n\ny=2,3,4 all have collision at t=4.\n\nNow, if at t=3, I do something else.\n\nActions at t=3: U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, then y_{4} = y_3 +1 = 2, so at t=4, on y=2, collide.\n\nIf D, y_{4} = y_3 -1 = 0, so at t=4, on y=0, which is not freeway, so no collision, safe.\n\nIf S, y_{4} = y_3 =1, at t=4, on y=1, and y=1 has no collision at t=4 or later, so safe.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9.\n\nIf I go down to y=0 at t=4, I have to come back up, which might take more turns.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay, I'm still at y=1.\n\nBut at t=4, y=2,3,4 are dangerous, but y=1 is safe, y=0 safe, y=5 to 8 might be safe at t=4.\n\nFor y=5 at t=4: from above, dangerous at T=11,12, not 4, so safe.\n\nSimilarly y=6,7,8 safe at t=4.\n\nBut I can't be on y=5 at t=4 if I'm at y=1 at t=3, because I can only move to adjacent or stay.\n\ny_{t+1} can be y_t, y_t+1, or y_t-1.\n\nSo from y=1 at t=3, at t=4 I can be at y=0,1, or 2.\n\ny=2 is dangerous at t=4, y=0 and y=1 are safe.\n\nSo if I go up to y=2 at t=4, I die.\n\nSo I must not go up at t=3, or if I do, I collide.\n\nSo actions: at t=3, I can do D to go to y=0 at t=4, or S to stay at y=1 at t=4.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=2,3,4 at t=4.\n\nAlso, later, y=5 and 6 at t=11,12, y=7 and 8 at t=12,13,14.\n\nt=12,13,14 for y=7,8.\n\nNow, from start, at t=3, y=1.\n\nIf I stay at t=3 (S), then at t=4, y=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=4, I can choose action for t=5.\n\nAt t=4, since y=1, I can go to y=0,1,2 at t=5.\n\nBut t=4 is over, and at t=5, I can be on different rows.\n\nNow, for t=5, which rows are dangerous?\n\nFrom above, no freeway has danger at t=5 except later.\n\ny=2,3,4: only danger at t=4, so at t=5, no danger for them.\n\ny=5: danger at t=11,12\n\netc.\n\nSo at t=5, all freeways are safe, since no car covers x=0 at t=5.\n\nSimilarly for t=6 to t=10, except y=5 and 6 at t=11,12, but t=11 is later.\n\nt=5 to t=10 should be safe for all rows, except we need to check.\n\nFor example, y=2 at t=5: from earlier, only danger at t=4, so safe at t=5.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\ny=5 at t=5: danger only at t=11,12, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, up to t=10.\n\nt=10: for y=5, danger at t=11,12, so t=10 safe.\n\nt=11 dangerous for y=5,6.\n\nt=12 dangerous for y=5,6,7,8.\n\nt=13,14 for y=7,8.\n\nNow, back to the player.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nMinimal H: since from y=1 to y=9, 8 steps, but due to dangers, I might need to delay or something.\n\nBut at t=4, I cannot be on y=2,3,4.\n\nSo one way is to avoid being on those rows at t=4.\n\nOptions:\n\n- At t=3, go down to y=0 at t=4.\n\nThen at t=4, on y=0, safe. Then from there, I can go up.\n\nBut y=0 to y=9, 9 steps, starting from t=4.\n\nAt t=4, position y=0.\n\nThen I need to reach y=9, so at least 9 actions, from t=4 to t=12? Let's see.\n\nAfter H actions, from t=3 to t=3+H-1 position.\n\nStart at t=3, y=1.\n\nAfter t actions, at turn t=3+t, position y_{3+t}, for t=0 to H.\n\nBetter to think of the turn sequence.\n\nLet T be the turn number.\n\nAt T=3, y=1.\n\nI apply actions at T=3, T=4, ..., up to some T when y=9.\n\nEach action changes the position for the next turn.\n\nAfter H actions, I reach y=9 at turn T=3+H.\n\nBecause: after 0 actions, at T=3, y=1.\n\nAfter 1 action (at T=3), at T=4, y_{4} = y_3 + delta.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn T=3+H, y_{3+H} =9.\n\nAnd I need to minimize H, the number of actions.\n\nAlso, for each turn T from 3 to 3+H-1, when I am at y_T, if y_T in 1-8, no collision, which depends on T and y_T.\n\nAt T=3+H, I reach y=9, which is safe, no need to check collision since not freeway.\n\nNow, from above, the dangerous points are:\n\n- At T=4, y=2,3,4 are dangerous.\n\n- At T=11, y=5,6 dangerous\n\n- At T=12, y=5,6,7,8 dangerous\n\n- At T=13, y=7,8 dangerous\n\n- At T=14, y=7,8 dangerous\n\nOther turns are safe for all rows.\n\nI need to plan a path from y=1 at T=3 to y=9 at some T=3+H, avoiding being on dangerous (y,T) pairs.\n\nSince I start at T=3, and need to go up, but I have to skip T=4 for y=2,3,4.\n\nOne way: at T=3, I can stay or go down.\n\nIf I go down at T=3, to y=0 at T=4.\n\nThen at T=4, I am at y=0.\n\nFrom there, I can go up to y=1 at T=5, or directly, but y=1 at T=5 is safe, since no danger.\n\nThen I can continue up.\n\nBut let's see the timeline.\n\nSince from T=5 to T=10, all safe, I can move freely.\n\nThen I need to avoid T=11,12 for y=5,6; T=12,13,14 for y=7,8.\n\nBut T=11,12,13,14 are later.\n\nFirst, deal with the immediate problem at T=4.\n\nOption 1: at T=3, stay (S), so at T=4, y=1, safe.\n\nThen at T=4, I am at y=1.\n\nNow, I can go up to y=2 at T=5, or stay, or down.\n\nSince T=5 is safe for all, I can go up to y=2 at T=5.\n\nThen to y=3 at T=6, y=4 at T=7, and so on, up to y=8 at T=10? Let's compute.\n\nAt T=4, y=1\n\nAction at T=4: U, then y=2 at T=5\n\nT=5: y=2, action U, y=3 at T=6\n\nT=6: y=3, U, y=4 at T=7\n\nT=7: y=4, U, y=5 at T=8\n\nT=8: y=5, U, y=6 at T=9\n\nT=9: y=6, U, y=7 at T=10\n\nT=10: y=7, U, y=8 at T=11\n\nNow at T=11, y=8? y=8 is freeway, and at T=11, for y=8, danger? y=8 has danger at T=12,13,14, not at T=11.\n\nFrom above, y=8 dangerous at T=12,13,14.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at T=11: danger at T=12,13,14, not T=11.\n\ny=5 and 6 dangerous at T=11 and 12.\n\nAt T=11, y=8, which is safe since danger starts T=12.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9.\n\nAt T=10, y=7, then U to y=8 at T=11.\n\nThen at T=11, y=8, I can go U to y=9 at T=12.\n\nAt T=12, y=9, which is not freeway, safe.\n\nBut at T=11, when I am at y=8, it is safe, as above.\n\nNow, what about earlier points.\n\nIn this path:\n\nT=3: y=1\n\nAction at T=3: S, so y=1 at T=4? No.\n\nAt T=3, position y=1, I do action S, so y_{4} = y_3 + 0 =1, so at T=4, position y=1.\n\nThen at T=4, I do U, so y_{5} = y_4 +1 =2, so at T=5, y=2.\n\nThen at T=5, U, y_6=3 at T=6\n\nT=6, U, y_7=4 at T=7\n\nT=7, U, y_8=5 at T=8\n\nT=8, y=5, action U, y_9=6 at T=9\n\nT=9, y=6, U, y_10=7 at T=10\n\nT=10, y=7, U, y_11=8 at T=11\n\nT=11, y=8, U, y_12=9 at T=12\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nT=3: y=1, safe\n\nT=4: y=1, safe (since y=1 no danger)\n\nT=5: y=2, and T=5, no danger for y=2, safe\n\nT=6: y=3, safe\n\nT=7: y=4, safe\n\nT=8: y=5, at T=8, danger only at T=11,12, so safe\n\nT=9: y=6, at T=9, danger at T=11,12, not 9, safe\n\nT=10: y=7, at T=10, danger at T=12,13,14, not 10, safe\n\nT=11: y=8, at T=11, danger at T=12,13,14, not 11, safe\n\nT=12: y=9, not freeway, safe\n\nSo no collision, and I reach y=9 at T=12.\n\nNumber of actions: from T=3 to T=11, actions at T=3 to T=11, that's 9 actions? T=3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11: that's 9 actions, reaching at T=12.\n\nStart at T=3, after 0 actions.\n\nAfter 1 action (T=3), at T=4\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at T=3+k\n\nSet at T=3+k, y=9.\n\nIn this case, at T=12, y=9, so 3+k=12, k=9 actions.\n\nBut minimal possible is 8 actions, to reach at T=11: from y=1 to y=9 in 8 steps.\n\nBut in this case, with the danger at T=4, I had to stay at T=3, so I lost a turn, thus taking 9 turns.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach faster.\n\nAnother option: at T=3, go down to y=0 at T=4.\n\nThen at T=4, y=0, safe.\n\nThen at T=4, I can go up to y=1 at T=5.\n\nThen from T=5, I can go up each turn to y=9 at T=12 or earlier?\n\nAt T=4, y=0\n\nAction at T=4: U, to y=1 at T=5\n\nThen T=5: y=1, U to y=2 at T=6\n\nT=6: y=2, U to y=3 at T=7\n\nT=7: y=3, U to y=4 at T=8\n\nT=8: y=4, U to y=5 at T=9\n\nT=9: y=5, U to y=6 at T=10\n\nT=10: y=6, U to y=7 at T=11\n\nAt T=11, y=7, which is safe? y=7 at T=11, danger at T=12,13,14, not T=11, safe.\n\nThen at T=11, U to y=8 at T=12\n\nAt T=12, y=8, but y=8 at T=12 is dangerous! Because y=8 has collision at T=12.\n\nOh, problem.\n\nAt T=12, y=8, and freeway 8 has car covering x=0 at T=12.\n\nSo collision.\n\nIf I go to y=8 at T=12, I collide.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=9 at T=12 from y=8 at T=11.\n\nIn this path: at T=11, y=7, I can go U to y=8 at T=12, but T=12 y=8 collision.\n\nOr I can stay or go down, but I need to go up.\n\nAt T=10, y=6, instead of U to y=7 at T=11, I could go directly to y=8? No, only adjacent moves.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + delta, with |delta| <=1.\n\nSo from y=6 at T=10, I can go to y=5,6,7 at T=11.\n\nNot directly to y=8.\n\nBack to the first path where I stayed at T=3.\n\nIn that path, I reached y=8 at T=11, which is safe, then to y=9 at T=12.\n\nAt T=11, y=8 safe, T=12 y=9 safe.\n\nBut in the down-then-up path, I had issue at T=12.\n\nCan I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I don't stay at T=3, but go down, but that might take longer.\n\nAnother idea: since from T=5 to T=10 safe, I can move faster, but I have to be at y=1 at T=4 or something.\n\nAt T=3, y=1, if I go up, I die at T=4 on y=2.\n\nSo I must not go up at T=3.\n\nOnly S or D.\n\nIf S, I stay at y=1 for T=4.\n\nThen I can proceed as before.\n\nIf D, I go to y=0 at T=4, then to y=1 at T=5, but now at T=5 I am at y=1, which is same as if I stayed at T=3 but at later turn.\n\nIn S case, at T=4 y=1, in D case at T=5 y=1, so I lost one turn, same as before.\n\nIn D case: T=3 y=1, D, T=4 y=0, then U to T=5 y=1.\n\nNow from T=5 y=1, same as in S case at T=4 y=1, but one turn later.\n\nIn S case, at T=4 y=1, I can go to y=2 at T=5.\n\nHere at T=5 y=1, go to y=2 at T=6, etc., so I reach everything one turn later, so y=9 at T=13, which is worse.\n\nFor example: T=5 y=1, U to T=6 y=2, T=6 U to T=7 y=3, ..., up to T=12 y=8, T=13 y=9.\n\nBut at T=12 y=8, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt T=12, y=8 is dangerous, so I need to avoid that.\n\nIn the first path, I was at y=8 at T=11, safe, then to y=9 at T=12.\n\nIn this delayed path, at T=12 y=8, collision.\n\nSo I need to adjust for later dangers.\n\nBack to the first plan.\n\nIn the first path with stay at T=3, I have:\n\nActions:\n\nT=3: S (stay, y=1 at T=4)\n\nT=4: U (to y=2 at T=5)\n\nT=5: U (to y=3 at T=6)\n\nT=6: U (to y=4 at T=7)\n\nT=7: U (to y=5 at T=8)\n\nT=8: U (to y=6 at T=9)\n\nT=9: U (to y=7 at T=10)\n\nT=10: U (to y=8 at T=11)\n\nT=11: U (to y=9 at T=12)\n\nNow, at T=11, y=8, and T=11, for y=8, danger at T=12,13,14, not T=11, so safe.\n\nT=12, y=9, safe.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nFor example, can I be at y=9 before T=12?\n\nMinimal turns: if no obstacles, from y=1 at T=3, to y=9 at T=11 with 8 actions: y increases by 8, so T=3+8=11.\n\nSo at T=11, y=9.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at T=11, I need to be at y=8 at T=10, since action at T=10 U to y=9 at T=11.\n\nNow, at T=10, y=8.\n\nBut y=8 at T=10: is it safe? T=10, for y=8, danger at T=12,13,14, not T=10, so safe.\n\nThen at T=11, y=9, safe.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at T=10, I need to come from y=7 at T=9 or earlier.\n\nFrom start, at T=3 y=1, to y=8 at T=10, that's 7 moves up? From y=1 to y=8, delta y=7, so in 7 actions, I can be at y=8 at T=3+7=10.\n\nSimilarly, to y=9 at T=11.\n\nBut the problem is at T=4, I cannot be on y=2,3,4.\n\nIf I go up directly, at T=3, if I go U, then at T=4 y=2, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nSo I must not go up at T=3.\n\nTherefore, I cannot start going up immediately.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=2 is T=5, as in the first path.\n\nThen y=3 at T=6, y=4 at T=7, y=5 at T=8, y=6 at T=9, y=7 at T=10, y=8 at T=11, y=9 at T=12.\n\nI could be faster in the middle.\n\nFor example, from y=1 at T=4 (after stay at T=3), I go U to y=2 at T=5.\n\nBut I need to reach y=8 at T=10.\n\ny=8 at T=10: from y=1 at T=4 to y=8 at T=10, that's 6 turns, delta y=7, so I need 7 actions, but from T=4 to T=10 is 6 actions? Positions: at T=4 y=1, after action at T=4, to T=5 y=?, ..., after action at T=10, to T=11 y=?.\n\nTo be at y=8 at T=10, that means after action at T=9, I arrive at y=8 at T=10.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=9 at T=11, after action at T=10.\n\nNow, at T=10, y=8.\n\nI need to have y=8 at T=10.\n\nFrom T=4 y=1, to T=10 y=8, that requires increasing by 7 in 6 steps (from T=4 to T=9 actions).\n\nActions from T=4 to T=9, 6 actions, to go from y=1 to y=8, which requires net +7, but with moves of +1,0,-1, it is possible only if all moves are +1, but 6 moves +1 would be y=7, not y=8.\n\nAfter k actions starting from T=4, at T=4+k.\n\nAt T=4, y=1.\n\nAfter first action (T=4), at T=5, y= y_4 + delta\n\n...\n\nAfter m actions, at T=4+m, y = y_4 + sum_{i=0}^{m-1} delta_i\n\nTo have at T=10, y=8, T=10 = 4 + m, so m=6, so after 6 actions from T=4, at T=10.\n\ny = 1 + sum of 6 deltas.\n\nSet y=8, so sum deltas =7.\n\nBut each delta in {-1,0,1}, so sum <=6, cannot be 7. Impossible to have y=8 at T=10 starting from y=1 at T=4.\n\nMax y at T=10: if all U, y=1 +6*1=7 at T=10.\n\nSimilarly, min y=1-6=-5, but capped, but max is 7.\n\nSo y<=7 at T=10 if start from y=1 at T=4.\n\nTherefore, cannot be at y=8 at T=10.\n\nEarliest at T=10, y=7 max.\n\nThen at T=10, y=7, then U to y=8 at T=11.\n\nThen at T=11, y=8, which is safe for T=11, then U to y=9 at T=12.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf I can be at higher y earlier, but I start from y=1 at T=3, and at T=4 I can be at y=0 or y=1, not higher.\n\nSo no, I think 9 actions to reach at T=12 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can avoid the later dangers with fewer actions.\n\nAnother thing: at T=11 and T=12, there are dangers, but in the path I have y=8 at T=11, safe, then to y=9 at T=12.\n\ny=5 and 6 at T=11 and 12 dangerous, but in my path, at T=11, I am at y=8, not y=5 or 6.\n\nAt T=11, y=5 and 6 are dangerous, but I am at y=8.\n\nSimilarly at T=12, y=5,6,7,8 dangerous, but I am at y=9.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at T=11, but as above, impossible because I need to be at y=8 at T=10, which requires from y=1 at T=3 to y=8 at T=10.\n\nAt T=3 y=1, to T=10 y=8.\n\nAfter actions from T=3 to T=9, 7 actions, to go from y=1 to y=8, sum deltas=7, with 7 actions, all +1, but at T=4, if I go U, I go to y=2 at T=4, which collides.\n\nIf I do something else, I cannot reach y=8 with all +1 in 7 actions because of the collision at T=4.\n\nFor example, at T=3, S, to y=1 at T=4, then from T=4 to T=10, 6 actions to y=8, impossible as sum deltas max 6, y=7.\n\nAt T=3, D, to y=0 at T=4, then to y=1 at T=5, then to y=8 at T=10: from T=5 y=1 to T=10 y=8, 5 actions, max y=1+5=6 at T=10, not 8.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo indeed, cannot reach before T=12.\n\nThus minimal H=9 actions, reaching at T=12.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have actions from T=3 to T=11.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be the actions starting from t_1=3.\n\nIn the sequence I have:\n\nTurn t_1 =3: S\n\nTurn t_1 +1 =4: U\n\nTurn t_1 +2 =5: U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 +8 =11: U\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0.\n\nSet t_1 =3.\n\nActions at time t, for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H.\n\nIn this case, H=9, so actions at t=3 to 11, reach at t=12.\n\nThe sequence: for turn t, action a_t.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nIn the path: after turn 3 action S, at turn 4 y=1\n\nTurn 4 action U, at turn 5 y=2\n\n...\n\nTurn 11 action U, at turn 12 y=9\n\nYes.\n\nBut at turn 10 action U, to y=8 at turn 11, then turn 11 U to y=9 at turn 12.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, I have 9 actions.\n\nBut is there a shorter path by going down or something? Probably not, since going down would add extra moves.\n\nPerhaps I can stay less, but I think not.\n\nAnother thing: at later points, I might need to avoid, but in this case, it worked.\n\nBut let me confirm the car at freeway 8 at T=12.\n\nFor example, at T=12, y=8 is dangerous, but I am not there; I am at y=9.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 earlier by not going through all, but no.\n\nSince from T=5 to T=10 all safe, I could move slower, but that would increase H, not decrease.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nNow, in the action sequence, all actions except the first are U, first is S.\n\nBut let me write the answer.\n\nThe answer should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  (which is S)\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} (U)\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 +8: U\n\nt_1=3, so turns 3 to 11.\n\nH=9, so t from 0 to 8, actions at t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me make sure about the car positions.\n\nFor example, at T=11, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nCar on freeway 8: at t1=3, (-36,-47,right,4)\n\nAt T=11, k=T-3=8, span: [ -47 + 4*8, -36 + 4*8 ] = [ -47 + 32, -36 + 32 ] = [ -15, -4 ]\n\nSo [ -15, -4 ], which is from x=-15 to -4, so x=0 not covered, since -4 <0, not <=0? -4 <=0, but the span is [ -15, -4 ], so positions from -15 to -4 inclusive, all negative, so x=0 not in span, so indeed safe at T=11.\n\nAt T=12, k=9, span [ -47 + 36, -36 + 36 ] = [ -11, 0 ], so [ -11, 0 ], includes x=0, dangerous.\n\nBut at T=12, I am at y=9, safe.\n\nSimilarly, other points.\n\nSo the sequence should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I can have a different sequence, but this has minimal H.\n\nAnother sequence: for example, at T=3, I could go down to y=0 at T=4, but as before, it would take more turns and might have issues later.\n\nFor example, if I go down at T=3, to y=0 at T=4.\n\nThen at T=4, I could go up to y=1 at T=5? Or stay, but go up.\n\nThen at T=5 y=1, then I need to go up, but to reach y=9, with the dangers.\n\nAt T=11, y=5 and 6 dangerous, so I need to not be on y=5 or 6 at T=11.\n\nSimilarly, at T=12, avoid y=5,6,7,8.\n\nBut in the sequence, if I start later, I might be at critical points at critical times.\n\nFor example, suppose I go slowly.\n\nAt T=3, D, to y=0 at T=4\n\nT=4, U, to y=1 at T=5\n\nT=5, S, to y=1 at T=6? Then at T=6, U to y=2 at T=7, and so on.\n\nBut I will be at lower y later, so when I reach y=5, it might be at T=11 or something.\n\nFor instance, from T=5 y=1, if I go up each turn: T=5 y=1, U to T=6 y=2, T=6 U to T=7 y=3, T=7 U to T=8 y=4, T=8 U to T=9 y=5, T=9 y=5, but at T=9, if I go U to y=6 at T=10, or stay.\n\nAt T=9 y=5, and T=9, safe, since danger at T=11,12.\n\nThen at T=9, U to y=6 at T=10.\n\nT=10 y=6, safe (danger T=11,12 not 10).\n\nThen at T=10, I need to go to y=7 or something.\n\nBut at T=11, y=6 is dangerous if I am there.\n\nAt T=10, y=6, I can go U to y=7 at T=11.\n\nThen at T=11, y=7, which is safe for T=11 (danger T=12,13,14).\n\nThen at T=11, U to y=8 at T=12.\n\nBut at T=12, y=8 dangerous.\n\nIf at T=10, I go directly to y=8? No, can't.\n\nFrom T=10 y=6, I can only go to y=5,6,7 at T=11.\n\nIf I go to y=7 at T=11, safe, then to y=8 at T=12, dangerous.\n\nIf I stay at y=6 at T=11, but at T=11, y=6 dangerous, collision.\n\nSo I must not be on y=6 at T=11.\n\nSimilarly, I must go to y=7 at T=11.\n\nBut then to y=8 at T=12, collision.\n\nUnless I go to y=9 from y=8 at T=11, but at T=11 I am at y=7, to y=8 at T=12, not to y=9 directly.\n\nTo reach y=9 at T=12, I need to be at y=8 at T=11? Action at T=11 U to y=9 at T=12.\n\nBut at T=11, if I am at y=8, it is safe, as before.\n\nIn this delayed path, at T=11 I am at y=7, not y=8.\n\nSo to avoid T=12 on y=8, I need to be at y=8 earlier or later.\n\nBut earlier not possible, later would take more turns.\n\nFor example, at T=10 y=6, I could stay or go down to avoid T=11, but then I need to go up later.\n\nSuppose at T=10 y=6, I go S, to y=6 at T=11, but at T=11 y=6 dangerous, collision.\n\nGo D to y=5 at T=11, also dangerous.\n\nSo I must leave y=6 before T=11.\n\nAt T=10, I must go U to y=7 at T=11, safe.\n\nThen at T=11, y=7, I can go U to y=8 at T=12, but collision at T=12.\n\nOr stay at y=7 at T=12, but at T=12 y=7 dangerous.\n\nOr go D to y=6 at T=12, dangerous.\n\nSo all bad.\n\nTherefore, in this path, I cannot avoid collision at T=12 if I go to y=8 or stay on y=7,8.\n\nBut if I can be at y=9 at T=12, but from y=7 at T=11, I go to y=8 at T=12, not y=9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at T=12, I need to be at y=8 at T=11, which in this path I am not.\n\nTherefore, the only safe way is the first path where I am at y=8 at T=11, safe, then to y=9 at T=12.\n\nHence, the sequence with stay at T=3 is necessary and minimal.\n\nSo back to the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) is 9, with the sequence of actions starting from turn 3 to turn 11.\n\nThe sequence avoids collisions by:\n- Staying at \\(y = 1\\) at turn 4 to avoid the collision on freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4\\) at turn 4.\n- Moving upward continuously from turn 5 to turn 11 to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 12, avoiding dangerous turns for other freeways:\n  - Freeways \\(y = 5, 6\\) are dangerous at turns 11 and 12, but the player is at \\(y = 7\\) at turn 10, \\(y = 8\\) at turn 11 (safe, as \\(y = 8\\) is only dangerous from turn 12 onward), and \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12.\n  - Freeways \\(y = 7, 8\\) are dangerous at turns 12, 13, 14, but the player is at \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12, which is not a freeway and thus safe.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n- Turn 3: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 1\\) for turn 4, avoiding collision on \\(y = 2, 3, 4\\) at turn 4.\n- Turns 4 to 11: Move up (U) each turn to increase \\(y\\) by 1 per turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 3: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\end{array} }",

The position is given as (x,y), but since I'm always at x=0, I only care about the y-coordinate for my position, but for cars, I need to check if they cover x=0 at the time I'm on their freeway.\n\nThe collision happens only if at turn T, when I'm on freeway y_T, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn T. If I move to a different y, I'm not on that freeway until the next turn.\n\nLet me list out the car states for each freeway at turn t_1=4.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head 60, tail 49, direction right, speed 3. Since it's right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] with τ=49, h=60, s=3, t_1=4.\n\nFor a right-moving car, span at time T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]. But τ and h are given at t_1, so at T, it's [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all cars here are right-moving, I think. Direction is given as \"right\" for all.\n\nFreeway 1: (h=60, τ=49, d=right, s=3)\n\nFreeway 2: three cars: (0,-11,right,12), (36,25,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nSimilarly for freeway 3 and 4, same as freeway 2? Let me see.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2: (0,-11,right,12), (36,25,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nFreeway 4: same: (0,-11,right,12), (36,25,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nFreeway 5: one car: (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5: (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: (-32,-43,right,4)\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7: (-32,-43,right,4)\n\nAnd freeway 1 has different.\n\nI start at y=1, which is freeway 1, at turn 4.\n\nI need to go to y=9. y=9 is the top, no cars there, so once I reach y=9, I'm safe.\n\ny=0 to y=9, freeways are y=1 to y=8 for cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no collision there.\n\nI start at (0,1), so at turn 4, I'm on y=1.\n\nNow, I need to move up to y=9.\n\nActions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same).\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on action.\n\nAnd y must be in 0 to 9.\n\nNow, collision: at each turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, at turn T, there is a car such that 0 is in [low, high] of its span at T.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] for each car.\n\nt_1 is fixed at 4.\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - t_1, so at time T = t_1 + Δt, span is [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt] for right-moving car.\n\nThen 0 is in [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt] if τ + s*Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s*Δt.\n\nSince the car is moving right, τ + s*Δt is the left end, h + s*Δt is the right end, and since it's right-moving, h > τ, I assume.\n\nIn the description, for right-moving, span is [τ, h] at t_1, with τ tail, h head, so τ < h.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right here.\n\nSo for a car, at time T, the span covers x=0 if min(τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt) ≤ 0 ≤ max(τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt), but since s>0 and right-moving, τ + s*Δt ≤ h + s*Δt, so it's τ + s*Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s*Δt.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but not here.\n\nSo condition: τ + s*Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s*Δt\n\nNow, for each freeway and each car, I need to find when this is true for x=0.\n\nBut since I care about when I'm on that freeway, I need to avoid being there when for some car on that row, the inequality holds.\n\nNow, I start at y=1 at t=4.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns would be at least 8, since I need to go from y=1 to y=9, each U move increases y by 1, so with all U, it would take 8 moves: from t=4 to t=11, y from 1 to 9.\n\nBut I might have to wait or go down sometimes to avoid cars.\n\nBut going down might increase turns, so I should avoid that if possible.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when it is unsafe, meaning that at time T, there is a car covering x=0.\n\nSince cars move continuously, I need the times when 0 is covered.\n\nFor each freeway, I'll compute the set of Δt where for some car, τ + s*Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s*Δt.\n\nΔt = T - t_1 = T - 4.\n\nT is the turn number.\n\nStart with freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, τ=49, h=60, s=3.\n\nSo condition: 49 + 3*Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 60 + 3*Δt\n\nSince 49 + 3*Δt ≤ 0 implies 3*Δt ≤ -49, Δt ≤ -49/3 ≈ -16.333, which is less than 0 since Δt ≥0? Δt = T-4, T≥4, so Δt ≥0.\n\n49 + 3*Δt ≥49 >0, so 49 + 3*Δt ≤0 is impossible for Δt≥0.\n\nSimilarly, 0 ≤ 60 + 3*Δt is always true since 60+3*Δt ≥60>0.\n\nBut the inequality is τ + s*Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s*Δt, so left part: 49 + 3*Δt ≤0, which requires Δt ≤ -49/3, impossible for Δt≥0.\n\nTherefore, for freeway 1, at any time T≥4, 0 is never in the span because the car is at positions starting from 49 to 60 at t=4, moving right, so it only covers x>49, which is greater than 0, so x=0 is never covered. So freeway 1 is always safe.\n\nIs that right? τ=49, h=60, s=3, so at t=4, span [49,60], all x>0. Moving right, so for T>4, span [49+3Δt, 60+3Δt], which for Δt>0 is even larger, so min is at least 49>0, so indeed, x=0 is never covered. So freeway y=1 is always safe.\n\nNow, I am at y=1 at t=4, and it's safe, so I can stay or move.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nNow, freeway 2: three cars.\n\nFirst car: τ=-11, h=0, s=12? Head and tail.\n\nCar: (h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=12)\n\nSo at t=4, span [τ, h] = [-11, 0]? Since right-moving, at t=4, head is at h=0, tail at τ=-11.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, I think h is the right end, τ is left end? Let's see the update.\n\nFor right-moving: span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nAt t_1, when T=t_1, [τ + s*0, h + s*0] = [τ, h], so if h=0, τ=-11, then [ -11, 0 ] at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, second car: h=36, τ=25, s=12, so [25,36] at t=4.\n\nThird car: h=-48? τ=-59? h=-48, τ=-59, s=12.\n\nSince right-moving, τ should be left, h right, so if τ=-59, h=-48, then at t=4, span [ -59, -48 ].\n\nNow, for freeway 2, at time T, with Δt=T-4.\n\nFirst car: τ=-11, h=0, s=12, so span at T: [ -11 + 12Δt, 0 + 12Δt ]\n\nCondition for coverage: -11 + 12Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 0 + 12Δt\n\n0 + 12Δt is 12Δt, and -11 +12Δt ≤0.\n\nSo -11 +12Δt ≤0 and 0 ≤ 12Δt\n\nFirst, 0 ≤ 12Δt is always true for Δt≥0 since s=12>0.\n\nThen -11 +12Δt ≤0 implies 12Δt ≤11, Δt ≤ 11/12.\n\nBut Δt is integer? Turn-based, so T is integer, Δt integer.\n\nT is turn number, so Δt = T - t_1 integer, T≥4.\n\nSo Δt ≥0 integer.\n\nSo for first car: -11 +12Δt ≤0 and 0≤12Δt.\n\n0≤12Δt true for Δt≥0.\n\n-11 +12Δt ≤0 iff 12Δt ≤11 iff Δt ≤ 11/12 <1, so since Δt integer ≥0, Δt=0.\n\nAt Δt=0, T=4, -11 +0 = -11 ≤0 ≤0, 0 is included.\n\nAt Δt=1, -11+12=1, 0+12=12, so [1,12], 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly for other Δt.\n\nSo first car covers x=0 only at Δt=0, T=4.\n\nNow second car: τ=25, h=36, s=12.\n\nSpan at T: [25 +12Δt, 36 +12Δt]\n\n25 +12Δt ≤0? 25+12Δt ≥25>0, so impossible. 0 ≤36+12Δt always true, but left condition 25+12Δt ≤0 false, so never covers x=0.\n\nThird car: τ=-59, h=-48, s=12.\n\nSpan at T: [-59 +12Δt, -48 +12Δt]\n\nNow, -59 +12Δt ≤0 ≤ -48 +12Δt?\n\nFirst, -59 +12Δt ≤0 iff 12Δt ≤59 iff Δt ≤ 59/12 ≈4.916, so Δt ≤4 since integer.\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -48 +12Δt iff 48 ≤12Δt iff Δt ≥ 48/12 =4.\n\nSo both: Δt ≥4 and Δt ≤4, so only at Δt=4, T=8.\n\nAt Δt=4, -59+48= -11? -59 +12*4 = -59+48= -11, and -48+48=0, so span [-11,0], so 0 covered.\n\nFor other Δt, not covered.\n\nSo for freeway 2, unsafe when:\n\n- At T=4 (Δt=0), from first car\n\n- At T=8 (Δt=4), from third car\n\nOther times safe.\n\nFirst car at T=4, third car at T=8.\n\nT=4 is now, but I am at y=1 at t=4, not on y=2, so for freeway 2, at t=4, it is unsafe, but I am not on it yet.\n\nI need to be on the freeway to collide.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Cars: (0,-11,right,12), (36,25,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nSame as y=2.\n\nSo similarly, unsafe at T=4 and T=8.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same cars, so unsafe at T=4 and T=8.\n\nNow freeway 5: one car: τ=-53, h=-42, s=6? Head and tail: (-42,-53,right,6), so h=-42, τ=-53.\n\nRight-moving, so at t=4, span [ -53, -42 ]? τ=-53, h=-42.\n\nSpan at T: [ -53 +6Δt, -42 +6Δt ]\n\nCover x=0 if -53 +6Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -42 +6Δt\n\nWhich is -53 +6Δt ≤0 and 0 ≤ -42 +6Δt\n\nFirst: -53 +6Δt ≤0 iff 6Δt ≤53 iff Δt ≤ 53/6 ≈8.833, so Δt ≤8\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -42 +6Δt iff 42 ≤6Δt iff Δt ≥ 42/6 =7\n\nSo both: Δt ≥7 and Δt ≤8, so Δt=7 or 8.\n\nT=4+7=11 or T=4+8=12.\n\nAt T=11, Δt=7, span: -53+42= -11? -53+6*7= -53+42= -11, -42+42=0, so [-11,0], covers 0.\n\nAt T=12, Δt=8, -53+48= -5, -42+48=6, so [-5,6], covers 0.\n\nFor Δt=7: -53+42= -11, -42+42=0, so [-11,0], yes 0.\n\nΔt=8: -53+48= -5, -42+48=6, [ -5,6], 0 covered.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5? Cars: (-42,-53,right,6), so same as y=5.\n\nSo unsafe at T=11 and T=12.\n\nFreeway 7: car (-32,-43,right,4), so τ=-43, h=-32, s=4.\n\nSpan at T: [ -43 +4Δt, -32 +4Δt ]\n\nCover x=0 if -43 +4Δt ≤0 ≤ -32 +4Δt\n\nWhich is -43 +4Δt ≤0 and 0 ≤ -32 +4Δt\n\nFirst: -43 +4Δt ≤0 iff 4Δt ≤43 iff Δt ≤ 43/4=10.75, so Δt≤10\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -32 +4Δt iff 32 ≤4Δt iff Δt ≥ 32/4=8\n\nSo Δt ≥8 and Δt≤10, so Δt=8,9,10.\n\nT=4+8=12, T=13, T=14.\n\nAt T=12: Δt=8, -43+32= -11, -32+32=0, [-11,0]\n\nT=13: Δt=9, -43+36= -7, -32+36=4, [-7,4], covers 0.\n\nT=14: Δt=10, -43+40= -3, -32+40=8, [-3,8], covers 0.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7, car (-32,-43,right,4), so unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nNow, freeway 1 is always safe, as we saw.\n\nI start at y=1, turn t=4.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so once I reach, no issue.\n\nNow, minimal turns: with all U, I can go from y=1 at t=4 to y=9 at t=12? Let's see:\n\nAt t=4, y=1\n\nAfter action at t=4, move to y_{t+1}\n\ny_{t} is position at turn t.\n\nAfter action a_t, position at turn t+1 is y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAt turn t, I am at (0, y_t), perform action a_t, then at turn t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nCollision is checked at each turn based on where I am.\n\nAt turn T, if I am on freeway y_T, and for that row, at turn T, x=0 is covered by some car.\n\nNow, for all U actions:\n\nStart: t=4, y=1, safe as we saw.\n\nAction a_4: U, then at t=5, y=2.\n\nNow, at t=5, y=2, freeway 2.\n\nIs freeway 2 safe at t=5?\n\nFrom earlier, freeway 2 unsafe at t=4 and t=8.\n\nt=5 not unsafe, so should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, action a_5: U, to y=3 at t=6.\n\nFreeway 3 at t=6: unsafe only at t=4 and t=8, so t=6 safe.\n\na_6: U, to y=4 at t=7.\n\nFreeway 4 at t=7: unsafe at t=4 and t=8, t=7 safe.\n\na_7: U, to y=5 at t=8.\n\nNow, freeway 5 at t=8: we have unsafe times for y=5: T=11 and 12, not t=8, so should be safe? Freeway 5 is y=5.\n\nAt t=8, Δt = t-4 =4, for y=5, unsafe at Δt=7,8 T=11,12, so t=8 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_8: U, to y=6 at t=9.\n\nFreeway 6 at t=9: unsafe at T=11,12, t=9 safe.\n\na_9: U, to y=7 at t=10.\n\nFreeway 7 at t=10: unsafe at T=12,13,14, t=10 not, so safe.\n\na_10: U, to y=8 at t=11.\n\nFreeway 8 at t=11: unsafe at T=12,13,14, t=11 not, so safe.\n\na_11: U, to y=9 at t=12.\n\nAt t=12, y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nSo with all U actions from t=4 to t=11, I reach y=9 at t=12.\n\nNow, check if any collision:\n\nt=4: y=1, safe.\n\nt=5: y=2, freeway 2 at t=5: not unsafe time (unsafe at t=4 and t=8), so safe.\n\nt=6: y=3, safe.\n\nt=7: y=4, safe.\n\nt=8: y=5, freeway 5 at t=8: unsafe at t=11,12, not t=8, safe.\n\nt=9: y=6, safe.\n\nt=10: y=7, safe.\n\nt=11: y=8, freeway 8 at t=11: unsafe at t=12,13,14, t=11 not, so safe.\n\nt=12: y=9, safe.\n\nSo all good, in 8 moves, from t=4 to t=11, actions at t=4 to t=11.\n\nNumber of turns: from start to end.\n\nI start at t=4, after H turns, I am at turn t_1 + H -1 or something.\n\nLet's see the sequence.\n\nAt turn t_1 =4, I am at (0,1).\n\nI perform actions for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and after H actions, I am at turn t_1 + H.\n\nThe position at turn t_1 + H should be (0,9).\n\nAfter k actions, I am at turn t_1 + k.\n\nAt turn t_1 + k, position y_{t_1 + k}.\n\nTo be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nIn this case, with all U, at t=4, y=1\n\na4: U, t=5 y=2\n\na5: U, t=6 y=3\n\na6: U, t=7 y=4\n\na7: U, t=8 y=5\n\na8: U, t=9 y=6\n\na9: U, t=10 y=7\n\na10: U, t=11 y=8\n\na11: U, t=12 y=9\n\nSo at turn 12, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nI performed actions from t=4 to t=11, that's 8 actions, H=8.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, here t from 0 to 7? Let's see the indexing.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0, a_{t_1} = a4\n\nt=1, a5\n\n...\n\nup to t=H-1, a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nAnd after that, at turn t_1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, a_{t_1 + H -1} should be such that after it, at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, a11 is U at t=11, to y=9 at t=12.\n\nt_1 + H = 4 + H.\n\nSet 4 + H = 12, so H=8.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=7 relative, a_{4} to a_{11}.\n\nt from 0 to H-1=7.\n\na_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to 7: a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, a11.\n\nAll U.\n\nAnd we saw no collision.\n\nBut is this minimal H? H=8, and since I need to go up 8 steps, it must be at least 8, so yes, minimal.\n\nBut let me double-check the unsafe times, especially for y=5 and y=6 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nt=8, y=5: freeway 5 unsafe at T=11 and 12, not 8.\n\nSimilarly, t=9 y=6, unsafe at T=11,12, not 9.\n\nt=11 y=8, freeway 8 unsafe at T=12,13,14, t=11 not included, so safe.\n\nAt t=12, I am at y=9, not on freeway 8.\n\nThe collision is only if on the freeway at that turn.\n\nAt t=12, if I were on y=8, it would be unsafe, but I move to y=9 at t=12, so at t=12 I am on y=9, not y=8.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=11, I am on y=8, and freeway 8 at t=11 is safe, as we said.\n\nThen action U, so at t=12, y=9, safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut the problem has multiple cars on some freeways, but in this path, I avoided the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, freeway 2 is unsafe at t=4 and t=8, but I am on y=2 at t=5, not at t=4 or t=8.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nt=8 is unsafe for freeway 2, but at t=8, I am on y=5, not on y=2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 unsafe at t=4 and t=8, but at t=4 I am on y=1, at t=8 on y=5.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 1: we thought always safe, but is there any car? Only one car, which is far right, so yes.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1, it has one car, but we saw it never covers x=0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut freeway 2,3,4 have cars that cover x=0 at t=4 and t=8, but not at other times.\n\nt=4 is now, but I start on y=1.\n\nIn the sequence, I go to y=2 at t=5, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=8 I am on y=5.\n\nNow, for freeway 5 and 6, unsafe at t=11 and 12.\n\nIn my path, at t=11, I am on y=8, not y=5 or 6.\n\nAt t=12, I am on y=9.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 and 8 unsafe at t=12,13,14.\n\nAt t=12, I am on y=9, not on them.\n\nSo all clear.\n\nTherefore, with H=8, all U actions.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nt_1=4, so actions from turn 4 to turn 11.\n\nIn the boxed format.\n\nBut let me see if I can do it faster? No, because I need to increase y by 8, each U increases by 1, so minimum 8 actions.\n\nIf I use D, it would take more turns, so no.\n\nS would keep me at same y, but I need to move up, so S doesn't help to reduce turns.\n\nSo H=8 is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 4, I am at y=1, and I take action U to go to y=2 at t=5.\n\nBut at t=4, I could stay or something, but that would waste a turn.\n\nSimilarly, no need.\n\nPerhaps I can start later, but since I need to reach asap, H=8 is fine.\n\nBut let me check if at t=4, on y=1, if I stay, y=1 still, then later I need to go up, but it would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if I stay at t=4, S, then at t=5 y=1, then U to y=2 at t=6, and so on, reach y=9 at t=13, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, the all U sequence is optimal.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 2,3,4, at t=8, unsafe, but I am not there.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut let me write the sequence.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U (for turn 4)\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1} = U (turn 5)\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + 7: a_{t_1 +7} = U (turn 11)\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to 7.\n\nt=0: turn 4\n\nt=1: turn 5\n\n...\n\nt=7: turn 11\n\nThen at turn 12, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, it says {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for H=8, t=0 to 7, actions a4 to a11.\n\nAll U.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut the player position is given as (0,1) at turn t_1=4, and we need to reach (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, all actions are U.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point I might be forced to avoid, but in this case, no.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 5 at t=8, but t=8 is not unsafe.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, at the turn I move, I am not on the target freeway until next turn.\n\nFor example, at turn T, if I am at y_T, and I take action U, then at turn T+1, I am at y_{T+1} = y_T +1.\n\nAt turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and collision check based on cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nThen after action, at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, check cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nIn my sequence, all safe.\n\nBut for instance, at t=11, y=8, freeway 8, which is safe at t=11, since unsafe only from t=12.\n\nThen I move U to y=9 at t=12.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier? But from y=1 to y=9, minimum 8 moves, so no.\n\nUnless I start from different, but fixed start.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the car state for freeway 2,3,4, it says cars like (0,-11,right,12), which at t=4, span [-11,0], so covers x=0.\n\nBut I am not on it.\n\nSimilarly at t=8.\n\nNow, but for freeway 1, is there any issue? No.\n\nBut let me see freeway 1 again: car (60,49,right,3), τ=49, h=60, so at t=4, [49,60], moving right, so [49+3Δt, 60+3Δt], all positive, x=0 never covered.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nIn freeway 5,6,7,8, we have unsafe times, but I avoid them in the path.\n\nIn my path, I am on y=5 at t=8, which is safe, not at t=11 or 12.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nThus, the sequence should be all U for 8 turns.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\end{array} }\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so for turn 4 to 11.\n\nBut in the sequence, it should be up to turn 11, since actions at t=11 leads to y=9 at t=12.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =4 +8 -1=11, yes.\n\nH=8.\n\nIn the turn labels, it should be the turn number.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the answer, I think the sequence implies H.\n\nIn the box, I need to list the actions.\n\nPerhaps I should specify H, but the format shows the sequence with turn numbers.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me see if there is any mistake.\n\nAnother point: in freeway 2,3,4, there are multiple cars, but I only care if at least one covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nI think I covered.\n\nFor example, freeway 2 at t=4, first car covers, at t=8, third car covers.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, but at t=4, I am on y=1, not affected.\n\nPerhaps I can move immediately.\n\nBut with all U, it works.\n\nSuppose I try to go faster, but cannot.\n\nOr if I go down, but that would increase time.\n\nFor example, if at some point I need to avoid, but here no need.\n\nSo I think H=8 is minimal and achievable.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Movements and Safe Times\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: The car (head=60, tail=49, direction=right, speed=3) never covers x=0 at any turn \\(T \\geq 4\\) because the span starts at [49, 60] and moves right, so x=0 is always safe.\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Unsafe at turns \\(T = 4\\) and \\(T = 8\\) due to car coverage at x=0. Safe at all other times.\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Identical to freeway 2, unsafe at \\(T = 4\\) and \\(T = 8\\), safe otherwise.\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Identical to freeway 2, unsafe at \\(T = 4\\) and \\(T = 8\\), safe otherwise.\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Unsafe at turns \\(T = 11\\) and \\(T = 12\\).\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Identical to freeway 5, unsafe at \\(T = 11\\) and \\(T = 12\\).\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Unsafe at turns \\(T = 12\\), \\(T = 13\\), and \\(T = 14\\).\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Identical to freeway 7, unsafe at \\(T = 12\\), \\(T = 13\\), and \\(T = 14\\).\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9) Minimally\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 8, as the player must increase their y-coordinate from 1 to 9, requiring exactly 8 upward moves (each \"U\" action increases y by 1). Any deviation (e.g., \"D\" or \"S\") would increase \\(H\\), so \\(H = 8\\) is optimal.\n\nThe sequence of actions from turn 4 to turn 11 (where \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 4 + 8 - 1 = 11\\)) uses all \"U\" actions:\n- At turn 4: Start at y=1 (safe, as freeway 1 is always safe).\n- Action \"U\" at turn 4: Move to y=2 at turn 5.\n- Turn 5: y=2 is safe (freeway 2 unsafe only at T=4 and T=8).\n- Action \"U\" at turn 5: Move to y=3 at turn 6.\n- Turn 6: y=3 is safe (freeway 3 unsafe only at T=4 and T=8).\n- Action \"U\" at turn 6: Move to y=4 at turn 7.\n- Turn 7: y=4 is safe (freeway 4 unsafe only at T=4 and T=8).\n- Action \"U\" at turn 7: Move to y=5 at turn 8.\n- Turn 8: y=5 is safe (freeway 5 unsafe at T=11 and T=12, not T=8).\n- Action \"U\" at turn 8: Move to y=6 at turn 9.\n- Turn 9: y=6 is safe (freeway 6 unsafe at T=11 and T=12, not T=9).\n- Action \"U\" at turn 9: Move to y=7 at turn 10.\n- Turn 10: y=7 is safe (freeway 7 unsafe from T=12 onward, not T=10).\n- Action \"U\" at turn 10: Move to y=8 at turn 11.\n- Turn 11: y=8 is safe (freeway 8 unsafe from T=12 onward, not T=11).\n- Action \"U\" at turn 11: Move to y=9 at turn 12.\n- Turn 12: y=9 has no cars, so safe and goal reached.\n\nNo collisions occur, as all positions during the path avoid the unsafe times for their respective freeways.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{7}\\) (for \\(H=8\\)) is:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving right or left with given speeds, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a freeway at a certain turn, no car has a span that includes 0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car positions at turn t_1 = 5. The cars are given with their positions at turn t_1, and I need to find where they are at future turns based on their direction and speed.\n\nLet me list out all the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nDirection is right, so it's moving right, meaning increasing x. Head is at -48, tail at -59? That seems odd because usually head is in front, so if it's moving right, head should be greater than tail. Let me check the notation.\n\nThe car update says: for left-moving, span is [h, τ] and it moves left, so h decreases. For right-moving, it says span is [τ, h] and moves right, so τ and h increase.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nBut it says direction right, so for right-moving cars, the span is given as (tail, head) or what? Let's see the notation.\n\nIt says: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nBut for right-moving, it should be that tail is less than head, I think. Here for freeway 1, h = -48, τ = -59, and since direction is right, head should be the front, so if it's moving right, head should be to the right of tail, so h > τ. Here -48 > -59, so h = -48, τ = -59, so head is at -48, tail at -59, so the car is from x=-59 to x=-48? But that's only 11 units, and it's moving right with speed 3.\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nIn freeway 2,3,4: all have (12,1,right,12), but 12>1, so head=12, tail=1, so car from 1 to 12, moving right with speed 12.\n\n(48,37,right,12): 48>37, so from 37 to 48.\n\n(-36,-47,right,12): -36 > -47, so from -47 to -36.\n\nFor freeway 5 and 6: (-36,-47,right,6) similarly.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8: (-28,-39,right,4): -28 > -39, so from -39 to -28.\n\nAll these are right-moving cars, so at any future turn T, the position will be shifted by s*(T - t_1) to the right.\n\nt_1 is 5.\n\nSo for a car at turn t_1 with span [τ, h] for right-moving (since direction right, span is [τ, h] with τ < h), and at turn T, span is [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all here are right-moving, I think. Freeway 1 has one car, others have multiple, but all right-moving.\n\nFreeway 1: direction right, so same.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, when I am on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car with 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nThat is, if for some car on freeway k, and y_T = k, then 0 must not be in [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)] for that car.\n\nSince the car spans are intervals, and we need 0 not in that interval.\n\nAlso, note that I start at y=2 at turn t_1=5.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is the top, but y=9 is not a freeway, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, and y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, so when I'm at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nThe grid has y=0 to 9, and freeways with cars are y=1 to 8.\n\nPlayer position is (0,y), so when at (0,y), if y between 1 and 8, I need to avoid cars on that row at that turn.\n\nIf y=0 or y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is y=9, so once I'm there, I'm safe.\n\nNow, I can move up, down, or stay, but since I want to minimize turns, I should move up as much as possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy = +1 for U, -1 for D, 0 for S.\n\ny must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nI start at y=2 at turn t=5.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of moves up is 7, since 9-2=7, but I might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, which would increase turns.\n\nBut with cars, I might need more turns.\n\nFirst, I need to find for each freeway and each turn, whether position x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nSince the cars move, I need the span at turn T for each car.\n\nt_1 = 5, so at turn T, the time elapsed is T - 5.\n\nLet δ = T - 5, so at turn 5 + δ, for δ >=0.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to know if at turn 5+δ, x=0 is covered by any car on that row.\n\nIf not, then it's safe to be on that freeway at that turn.\n\nSince there might be multiple cars, I need that for all cars on that freeway, 0 is not in the span.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars and their spans at time δ relative to t_1=5.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car, head h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right, speed s=3.\n\nAt δ=0, span [τ, h] = [-59, -48]?

Yes, safe at δ=0.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways at δ=0.\n\nNow, I need to be on freeway k at turn T only if it is safe at that T.\n\nWhen I move, I am on a freeway at turn T if y_T = k between 1 and 8.\n\nIf I am at y_T, and y_T between 1 and 8, I need no car on that row has 0 in span at T.\n\nNow, let's plan the path.\n\nStart: T=5, y=2, which is freeway 2.\n\nAt T=5, δ=0, freeway 2 safe, as above.\n\nNow, I can choose action at T=5: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go up, at T=6, I will be at y=3.\n\ny=3 is freeway 3.\n\nAt T=6, what is δ? T=6, t_1=5, so δ=1.\n\nFor freeway 3, unsafe at δ=3, T=8.\n\nAt δ=1, T=6, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 3 cars same as freeway 2: unsafe only at δ=3.\n\nAt δ=1, T=6: first car [1+12*1,12+12*1]=[13,24], not 0\n\nSecond [37+12,48+12]=[49,60], not\n\nThird [-47+12,-36+12]=[-35,-24], negative, not 0. So safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go up again to y=4 at T=7, freeway 4.\n\nAt T=7, δ=2.\n\nFreeway 4 same, unsafe only at δ=3.\n\nAt δ=2, T=7: cars [1+24,12+24]=[25,36] no, [37+24,48+24]=[61,72] no, [-47+24,-36+24]=[-23,-12] no, safe.\n\nThen to y=5 at T=8, freeway 5.\n\nBut at T=8, δ=3.\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe at δ=6 and 7, not δ=3.\n\nδ=3, T=8.\n\nFreeway 5 car: (-36,-47,right,6), at δ=3: [-47+18, -36+18] = [-29, -18], all negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, to y=6 at T=9, freeway 6.\n\nAt T=9, δ=4.\n\nFreeway 6 car: same, at δ=4: [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23,-12], not 0, safe.\n\nThen to y=7 at T=10, freeway 7.\n\nAt T=10, δ=5.\n\nFreeway 7: car (-28,-39,right,4), unsafe at δ=7,8,9.\n\nAt δ=5: [-39+20, -28+20] = [-19, -8], not 0, safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at T=11, freeway 8.\n\nAt T=11, δ=6.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, unsafe at δ=7,8,9.\n\nAt δ=6: [-39+24, -28+24] = [-15, -4], not 0, safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at T=12.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no car, safe.\n\nNow, let's list the turns:\n\nT=5: y=2, action? I need to specify actions.\n\nAt T=5, I start at y=2. I need to choose action for turn T=5, which determines y at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, at each turn, I choose action.\n\nIn this plan, I go up every turn.\n\nSo at T=5, action U, then y=3 at T=6\n\nT=6, action U, y=4 at T=7\n\nT=7, action U, y=5 at T=8\n\nT=8, action U, y=6 at T=9\n\nT=9, action U, y=7 at T=10\n\nT=10, action U, y=8 at T=11\n\nT=11, action U, y=9 at T=12\n\nNow, at T=12, y=9, reached.\n\nBut I need to be at y=9 at some turn, and then stop.\n\nThe position is at the end of the turn, I think.\n\nLet's see: at turn t, I am at position (0, y_t), then I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo after H turns, I am at y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nI need y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nIn this case, t_1=5, start y_5=2.\n\nAfter actions from t=5 to t=11, I reach y_12=9.\n\nSo H=7 actions? From t=5 to t=11 inclusive, that's 7 turns: t=5,6,7,8,9,10,11.\n\nActions at t=5 to t=11, and y_12=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=5 to t=11, that's 7 actions, H=7.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so actions at time t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, position at t_1 + H.\n\nWe need position at t_1 + H to be (0,9).\n\nSo with H actions, we reach at time t_1 + H.\n\nIn this case, to go from y=2 to y=9, min H=7 with all U.\n\nBut in the path above, I reached at T=12 with 7 actions.\n\nBut is there any collision?\n\nIn the path: at each turn, when I am on a freeway, was it safe?\n\nAt T=5: y=2, freeway 2, δ=0, safe as before.\n\nT=6: y=3, freeway 3, δ=1, safe.\n\nT=7: y=4, freeway 4, δ=2, safe.\n\nT=8: y=5, freeway 5, δ=3, safe (car at [-29,-18])\n\nT=9: y=6, freeway 6, δ=4, car at [-23,-12], safe.\n\nT=10: y=7, freeway 7, δ=5, car at [-19,-8], safe.\n\nT=11: y=8, freeway 8, δ=6, car at [-15,-4], safe.\n\nThen at T=12, y=9, not freeway, done.\n\nBut at T=12, I don't need to be on freeway, since I'm at y=9.\n\nThe collision is only when on freeway y=1 to 8.\n\nSo this seems safe and takes 7 turns.\n\nBut is there a problem?\n\nWhat about freeway 7 and 8 at later turns? But I was there at T=10 and 11, which are safe.\n\nBut let me confirm if I can reach faster.\n\nMinimal H: since I need to increase y by 7, with only U, D, S, the min number of actions to go from y=a to y=b is |b-a| if I can go directly, but with obstacles, I might need more.\n\nHere, with no obstacles, H=7.\n\nIn this case, no obstacles in the direct path at those times.\n\nBut let me check if at some point I have to avoid.\n\nFor example, at T=8, if I were on freeway 2,3,4, it would be unsafe, but I was on y=5 at T=8, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, other unsafe times are later.\n\nSo with H=7, it seems possible.\n\nBut the problem is to find minimal H, and this is 7, which is minimal possible, so should be fine.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nI need to output the sequence.\n\nt_1=5.\n\nActions from t=5 to t=11.\n\na_t for t=5 to t=11.\n\nAll U.\n\nBut let me write:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U (to go to y=3)\n\nIn the sequence, at turn t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo for turn t_1=5, action a_5, then y_6 = y_5 + Δy.\n\ny_5=2, if a_5=U, y_6=3.\n\nThen at turn 6, a_6, and so on.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 11: U, then at turn 12, y=9.\n\nBut the actions are up to when? The sequence has H actions, from t=5 to t=5+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t_1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nHere H=7, actions at t=5,6,7,8,9,10,11, all U.\n\nPosition at t=12: (0,9)\n\nNow, but in the car states, for freeway 2,3,4, at T=8 (δ=3) it is unsafe, but I was not there at that time.\n\nAt T=8, I was on y=5, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, other times.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 5 at other times.\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe at δ=6,7, T=11,12.\n\nAt T=11, δ=6, I was on y=8, not y=5.\n\nAt T=12, δ=7, I am at y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 unsafe at δ=6,7, T=11,12, same.\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe at δ=7,8,9, T=12,13,14.\n\nAt T=12, I am at y=9.\n\nSo all fine.\n\nBut is there a way with H=6? That would mean reaching at t=11.\n\ny_11=9.\n\nBut from y_5=2 to y_11=9, that requires increasing by 7 in 6 steps, so I need to move up 7 times in 6 actions? Not possible, since each action changes y by at most 1, so in 6 actions, max y increase is 6, to y=8, or with down or stay, less.\n\ny start at 2, after k actions, y <= 2 + k.\n\nTo have y=9, need 2 + k >=9, k>=7.\n\nSimilarly, after H actions, y_{t1+H} <= y_{t1} + H, so 9 <= 2 + H, so H >=7.\n\nEquality only if all U.\n\nSo H=7 is minimal, and achievable as above.\n\nBut in the path above, with all U, I reached in 7 actions.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbers.\n\nt1=5, start y5=2.\n\nAfter action a5 at t=5: U, y6=3\n\na6 at t=6: U, y7=4\n\na7 at t=7: U, y8=5\n\na8 at t=8: U, y9=6\n\na9 at t=9: U, y10=7\n\na10 at t=10: U, y11=8\n\na11 at t=11: U, y12=9\n\nSo at t=12, y=9.\n\nActions from t=5 to t=11, 7 actions.\n\nH=7.\n\nThe sequence is a_t for t=5 to 11, all U.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be listed as turns from t_1.\n\nNow, but the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nH=7.\n\nBut is there any issue I missed?\n\nAnother thing: the note about collision.\n\nIt says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nIn this case, when I move, I change row at the next turn.\n\nFor example, at turn T, I am at y_T, then I choose action, which moves me to y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, I am on row y_T, so I need to be safe from cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nThen, when I move, at turn T, I leave y_T and go to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, I am still on y_T, and only at T+1 I am on y_{T+1}.\n\nSo the collision check is only for the row I am on at that turn.\n\nIn my path, at each turn, I was on a row that was safe at that time.\n\nFor example, at T=8, I was on y=5, freeway 5, which at T=8 (δ=3) was safe.\n\nNot on y=4 or y=6 at that time.\n\ny=4 at T=7, which was safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster, but not possible.\n\nMaybe I can stay or something, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo minimal H=7.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 1, but I didn't go there, and it's unsafe at high T, but not relevant.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nt_1=5.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nAnd H=7.\n\nBut in the sequence, it should be from t=5 to t=11.\n\nThe actions are for turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 5 + 7 -1 = 11, yes.\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nAlso, for freeway 3,4, etc., at T=8 it is unsafe, but I was not there.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose I had to be on y=3 at T=8, it would be unsafe, but I wasn't.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I can reach with H=7 but different path, but this is direct.\n\nAnother thing: y=9 is the target, and it's safe.\n\nBut in the beginning, I am at y=2, which is freeway 2, safe at T=5.\n\nAll seems good.\n\nBut let me check freeway 5 at T=11.\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe at T=11, δ=6.\n\nBut at T=11, I was on y=8, not y=5.\n\nSimilarly, at T=11, y=8, freeway 8, which at δ=6 is safe, as I had [-15,-4].\n\nδ=6 for T=11, t1=5, δ=6.\n\nFreeway 8 car: at δ=6, [-39+24, -28+24] = [-15,-4], yes, not 0.\n\nAt T=12, if I were on y=8, it would be unsafe because δ=7, freeway 8 unsafe at δ=7,8,9.\n\nδ=7: T=12, [-39+28, -28+28] = [-11,0], so 0 is included, so if at T=12, y=8, collision.\n\nBut in my path, at T=12, I am at y=9, so not on freeway.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nSo all fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7, with all up actions.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nNow, I think that's it.\n\nBut the problem has multiple cars on some freeways, but in this case, for freeway 2,3,4, only one car is unsafe at specific time, and I avoided it.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo I think correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) is 7. The sequence of actions consists of moving up (U) at every turn from turn 5 to turn 11, resulting in the player reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12.\n\n### Verification of Path and Collision Avoidance:\n- **Turn 5 (δ = 0)**: Player at \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2).  \n  Freeway 2 cars:  \n  - (12, 1, right, 12): span at δ=0 is [1, 12], 0 not in span.  \n  - (48, 37, right, 12): span at δ=0 is [37, 48], 0 not in span.  \n  - (-36, -47, right, 12): span at δ=0 is [-47, -36], 0 not in span.  \n  Safe.

Goal reached.\n\n### Why \\(H = 7\\) is Minimal:\n- The player starts at \\(y = 2\\) and needs to reach \\(y = 9\\), requiring a minimum increase of 7 in the y-coordinate.\n- Each action can change y by at most +1 (with U). Thus, at least 7 up actions are needed.\n- With all actions as U, the path is collision-free as verified above, achieving \\(y = 9\\) in exactly 7 actions (reaching at turn 12).\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 5: \\ U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\ U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\ U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\ U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\ U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\ U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\ U }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, staying within 0 to 9.\n\nCars move left or right at constant speeds. For collision, at turn T, if I'm on a freeway y, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that turn, I crash. But if I move to a different y at turn T, I'm not on that new y until the next turn, so I only care about the cars on my current y at the exact turn.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t1=6, and I need to compute where they are at future turns.\n\nFirst, list all the cars for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-45, -56, right, 3) → since direction is right, head is at the right, so span at t1=6 is [τ, h] = [-56, -45]? No.\n\nThe notation says: for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ], and for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h]. But in the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor right-moving cars, head is the front, which is larger x if moving right, so span should be [tail, head] since tail is left, head is right when moving right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, head is front, which is smaller x if moving left, so span is [head, tail] with head < tail.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 1: (-45, -56, right, 3)\n\nDirection right, so head should be larger x, but here head=-45, tail=-56, and -45 > -56, so head is at x=-45, tail at x=-56, so since moving right, the span is from left to right: [tail, head] = [-56, -45].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nRight-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSince τ and h are at t1.\n\nFor freeway 1 at t1: head h = -45, tail τ = -56, direction right, speed s=3.\n\nAt time T, position: since moving right, both increase by s(T-t1).\n\nSo Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-56 + 3(T-6), -45 + 3(T-6)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would decrease.\n\nBut here all cars given are right-moving, I think.\n\nFreeway 1: right, so ok.\n\nFreeway 2: (24,13,right,12), (60,49,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3,4 same as 2? No.\n\nFreeway 3: (24,13,right,12), (60,49,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12) — same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same.\n\nFreeway 5: (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5? (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7? (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nFreeway 1: one car.\n\nFreeway 2: three cars.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars, same as 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same as 2 and 3.\n\nFreeway 5: one car.\n\nFreeway 6: one car, same as 5.\n\nFreeway 7: one car.\n\nFreeway 8: one car, same as 7.\n\nBut freeway 2,3,4 all have identical cars? Let's see:\n\nFreeway 2: (24,13,right,12), (60,49,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFor (24,13,right,12): head=24, tail=13, so span at t1: [13,24]\n\nSimilarly (60,49,right,12): [49,60]\n\n(-24,-35,right,12): tail=-35, head=-24? Head=-24, tail=-35, so since -24 > -35, span [ -35, -24 ]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 3 and 4, same cars.\n\nFreeway 5: (-30,-41,right,6): head=-30, tail=-41, span [ -41, -30 ]\n\nFreeway 6 same.\n\nFreeway 7: (-24,-35,right,4): head=-24, tail=-35, span [ -35, -24 ]\n\nFreeway 8 same.\n\nNow, I start at y=3 at turn t1=6.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=3 is a freeway, so I need to check if at turn 6, on y=3, is there a car where 0 is in span.\n\nAt turn t1=6, for freeway 3, cars:\n\nFirst car: span [13,24] at t1, 0 not in [13,24], 0<13.\n\nSecond car: [49,60], 0<49, not in.\n\nThird car: [-35,-24], -35<0<-24? -35 to -24, 0 is greater than -24? -24 is negative, 0 > -24, so 0 not in [-35,-24] because -35 to -24 is all negative, 0 is not negative, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but I'm on y=3 at turn 6.\n\nAt turn 6, I am at (0,3), so for freeway 3, need to check if 0 in any car span at turn 6.\n\nAs above, no, since min x is -35>? -35<0 but -35 to -24, max is -24<0, so all x<=-24<0, so 0 not in span. Similarly others have min x -35 or 13>0, so at turn 6, no collision on y=3.\n\nBut I need to move to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns is at least the difference in y, which is 6, since from 3 to 9, I need to go up 6 steps, so H at least 6, if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, but since I want minimal turns, I should go up as much as possible, only deviate if necessary.\n\nBut going down might be necessary if a car is blocking the path.\n\nNow, the collision depends on when I am on which freeway at which turn.\n\nSince I start at turn t1=6, position y=3.\n\nI need actions from t=6 onwards, for H turns, until I reach y=9.\n\nLet t be the turn number, starting from t=6.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t, and I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y, with delta y based on a_t.\n\nThen at turn t, I am on freeway y_t, and I check if for that freeway, at turn t, 0 is in any car's span for that freeway.\n\nIf yes, collision.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am on y_{t+1}, and check for that freeway at turn t+1, and so on.\n\nI need to reach y=9, so when I first reach y=9, at some turn T, I am at (0,9), and if at that turn, on freeway 9, but y=9 is not a freeway, freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe grid has y=0 to 9, freeways with cars are y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no collision possible there.\n\nSo when I am at y=0 or y=9, no need to worry about cars.\n\nI start at (0,3) at t=6, y=3 is freeway.\n\nI need to get to (0,9), which is safe.\n\nMinimal H: since from y=3 to y=9, I need at least 6 up moves, but I might have stay or down moves, which increase turns, so to minimize H, I should avoid extra moves, so ideally, I go up every turn for 6 turns, to reach y=9 at t=12.\n\nBut I need to check if during these turns, when I am on freeways y=3,4,5,6,7,8 at turns t=6 to t=11, I am not colliding with cars.\n\nAt turn t=6, y=3, as we saw, no collision.\n\nNow, I need to simulate the car positions over time.\n\nSet t1=6.\n\nFor a freeway, at turn T, the car spans.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway the car spans as a function of T.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need to know for each T, if there is any car on that freeway where 0 is in its span at T.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway and T, if there exists a car such that min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nSince spans are intervals.\n\nNow, for freeway 1: only one car, right-moving, s=3.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(T-6), h + s(T-6)] with τ=-56, h=-45, s=3.\n\nSo [ -56 + 3(T-6) , -45 + 3(T-6) ]\n\nLet k = T-6, time from now, k=0 at t=6.\n\nSo span at T: [ -56 + 3k , -45 + 3k ]\n\n0 in span if -56 + 3k <= 0 <= -45 + 3k\n\nSo -56 + 3k <= 0 and 0 <= -45 + 3k\n\nFirst: -56 + 3k <= 0 => 3k <= 56 => k <= 56/3 ≈ 18.666, so k<=18 since integer? k integer, T integer, I assume.\n\nTurns are discrete, so k integer.\n\n-56 + 3k <= 0 => 3k <= 56 => k <= 18 since 3*18=54<56, 3*19=57>56, so for k<=18, -56+3k <= -56+54=-2<0? Let's compute.\n\n-56 + 3k <=0 when 3k <=56, k<=18 since k=18, 3*18=54, -56+54=-2 <=0 true; k=19, -56+57=1>0 false.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -45 + 3k => 45 <= 3k => k >= 15.\n\nSo 0 in span when k>=15 and k<=18.\n\nk from 0 to ...\n\nAt k=15: -56 + 3*15 = -56+45= -11, -45+45=0, so [ -11, 0 ], 0 is included.\n\nAt k=16: -56+48= -8, -45+48=3, [ -8,3], 0 in\n\nk=17: -56+51= -5, -45+51=6, [-5,6], 0 in\n\nk=18: -56+54= -2, -45+54=9, [-2,9], 0 in\n\nk=19: -56+57=1, -45+57=12, [1,12], 0 not in, min=1>0\n\nk=14: -56+42= -14, -45+42= -3, [-14,-3], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, 0 in car span when k=15,16,17,18, i.e., T=21,22,23,24.\n\nBut freeway 1 is y=1, so when I am on y=1 at these turns, collision possible.\n\nBut I start from y=3, going up, might not go to y=1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,12) head=24, tail=13, s=12\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(T-6), h + s(T-6)] = [13 + 12k, 24 + 12k] where k=T-6\n\n0 in span if 13+12k <=0 <=24+12k\n\nBut 13+12k <=0? 12k <= -13, impossible since k>=0, 13+12k >=13>0, so min >0, 0 not in span ever for this car.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (60,49,right,12), span [49+12k, 60+12k], min 49+12k >=49>0, so 0 never in.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12) head=-24, tail=-35, s=12\n\nSpan: [τ + s k, h + s k] = [-35 +12k, -24 +12k]\n\n0 in span if -35+12k <=0 <= -24+12k\n\nFirst: -35+12k <=0 => 12k <=35 => k<=2.916, so k<=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24+12k => 24 <=12k => k>=2\n\nSo k=2 only.\n\nk=2: -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nk=1: -35+12= -23, -24+12= -12, [ -23,-12], all neg, 0 not in\n\nk=3: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, [1,12], min>0, 0 not in\n\nSo for freeway 2, only at k=2, T=8, for the third car, 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 3 and 4, since same cars, same thing.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2, so at T=8, on y=3, if I am there, collision possible from the third car.\n\nBut at T=8, k=2.\n\nNow freeway 4 same.\n\nNow freeway 5: one car (-30,-41,right,6) head=-30, tail=-41, s=6\n\nSpan: [-41 +6k, -30 +6k]\n\n0 in span if -41+6k <=0 <= -30+6k\n\nFirst: -41+6k <=0 => 6k <=41 => k<=6.833, k<=6\n\nSecond: 0 <= -30+6k => 30<=6k => k>=5\n\nSo k=5,6\n\nk=5: -41+30= -11, -30+30=0, [ -11,0]\n\nk=6: -41+36= -5, -30+36=6, [ -5,6]\n\nk=4: -41+24= -17, -30+24= -6, [ -17,-6], no\n\nk=7: -41+42=1, -30+42=12, [1,12], no\n\nSo for freeway 5, 0 in span at k=5,6, T=11,12\n\nSimilarly freeway 6 same as 5, so at T=11,12 on y=5 or 6?

At t=8, y=5, we said safe.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=2,3,4 have danger at T=8, but at t=8, I am on y=5, not on y=3 or 4.\n\nAt t=8, y=5, which is safe, as above.\n\nThen t=9: y=6, safe\n\nt=10: y=7, safe\n\nt=11: y=8, safe\n\nt=12: y=9, safe\n\nAnd I reached in 6 turns: from t=6 to t=12? Turns: at t=6 start, after 0 actions, y=3.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, I am at y.\n\nSet t=6: after action a_6, at t=7, y=4 if U, etc.\n\nDefine the sequence.\n\nI need actions from t=6 to t=6+H-1, and at turn t=6+H-1, I am at y=9.\n\nStart: at turn t=6, position y=3.\n\nAfter action a_6, at turn t=7, y_{7} = y_6 + delta y_6.\n\nSimilarly, after a_{t}, at turn t+1, y_{t+1}.\n\nI reach y=9 at some turn T, meaning at turn T, I am at y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, no issue.\n\nThe minimal H is the number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nFrom y=3 to y=9, with only up moves, it takes 6 actions: a_6 to a_11, and at t=12, y=9.\n\nActions: a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9, a_10, a_11 all U.\n\nThen at t=7: y=4, t=8:y=5, t=9:y=6, t=10:y=7, t=11:y=8, t=12:y=9.\n\nNow, collision checks at each turn:\n\nAt turn t=6: y=3, T=6, k=0, for y=3, as before, no car has 0 in span, safe.\n\nt=7: y=4, T=7, k=1, for y=4, cars: at k=1, spans: first car [13+12,24+12]=[25,36]>0, second [49+12,60+12]=[61,72]>0, third [-35+12,-24+12]=[-23,-12]<0, all not contain 0, safe.\n\nt=8: y=5, T=8, k=2, for y=5, car: [-41+12, -30+12]=[-29,-18]<0, not contain 0, safe. (since s=6, k=2, -41+12=-29? 6*2=12, -41+12=-29, -30+12=-18, yes)\n\nt=9: y=6, T=9, k=3, for y=6, same car, [-41+18, -30+18]=[-23,-12]<0, safe.\n\nt=10: y=7, T=10, k=4, for y=7, car: [-35+16, -24+16]=[-19,-8]<0, safe. (s=4, k=4, 4*4=16)\n\nt=11: y=8, T=11, k=5, for y=8, same as y=7, [-35+20, -24+20]=[-15,-4]<0, safe.\n\nt=12: y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nAnd I reached at t=12.\n\nBut H is the number of turns? The sequence of actions.\n\nI have actions from t=6 to t=11, that's 6 actions, H=6.\n\nAt turn t=6+H-1, I am at y=9.\n\nIn this case, after 6 actions, at turn 12, y=9.\n\nt=6 + H -1 =12, so 6 + H -1 =12, H-1=6, H=7? Let's see.\n\nTurn index: start at turn t=6, after 0 actions, y=3.\n\nAfter first action a_6 at turn 6, at turn 7, y=4.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t} at turn t, I move to y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\nSo to reach y=9 at some turn T.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn t=6 + H, position y.\n\nSet the turn when I arrive at y=9.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn T.\n\nFrom y=3, with up moves, I can be at y=9 at T=12.\n\nThe actions are taken from turn t=6 to t=11 for H=6 actions.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nt1=6, actions from t=6 to t=6+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=6 + H, I am at y.\n\nIn this case, to be at y=9 at T=12, so 6 + H =12, H=6.\n\nActions at t=6,7,8,9,10,11.\n\nAll U.\n\nAnd as above, no collision at any point.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=3 has danger at T=8, but at T=8, I was at y=5, not y=3.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut let me confirm the danger times.\n\nFor example, at T=8, which y have danger?\n\ny=2,3,4 have danger at T=8, but I was not on them at that time.\n\nSimilarly, at T=11,12, y=5 and 6 have danger, but at T=11, I was at y=8? t=11, y=8, which has danger starting at T=12? y=8 danger at T=12,13,14.\n\nAt T=11, y=8, safe as above.\n\nAt T=12, I am at y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo minimal H is 6, with all up actions.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I did in 6 turns.\n\nBut is there a reason to go faster? I can't go faster than 6 up moves.\n\nI could go slower, but that increases H, not minimal.\n\nSo H=6 should be fine.\n\nBut let me check if at some point I need to avoid.\n\nFor example, suppose I go up to y=4 at t=7, then at t=8, if I were on y=4, it would be dangerous, but I am on y=5 at t=8, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier? No, from y=3 to y=9, min 6 steps.\n\nUnless I start at turn 6, y=3, if I could be at y=9 earlier, but no, each move changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo min H=6.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nSo actions: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nt_1=6.\n\nSo Turn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nAnd at turn 12, y=9.\n\nH=6.\n\nBut the sequence should be from t=6 to t=6+H-1=11, so 6 actions.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut is there any mistake?\n\nOne thing: at turn t=11, I am at y=8, and at T=11, which is k=5, for y=8, safe, then I go up to y=9 at t=12.\n\nBut at T=12, if I were on y=8, it would be dangerous, but I am not, I am on y=9.\n\nSimilarly for y=7 at T=12, but I was on y=7 at t=10, not at t=12.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 2,3,4 have multiple cars, but I think I handled.\n\nAnother thing: when I am on a freeway, I need to avoid if 0 in span at that turn.\n\nBut in the path above, at no turn was I on a freeway when 0 is in a car span for that freeway.\n\nFor example, at T=8, y=3 has danger, but I was on y=5 at that time.\n\nSimilarly, at T=12, y=5 has danger, but I was on y=9.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=6 with all up actions.\n\nBut let me confirm the initial position.\n\nAt turn t=6, y=3, no collision.\n\nThen after U, at t=7, y=4, no collision as above.\n\nU to t=8, y=5, no.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nPerhaps I should write the sequence.\n\nSo for H=6:\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nThen at turn 12, position (0,9).\n\nNow, the answer should be in a box.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", and I think H=6 is minimal.\n\nBut is there a way with H<6? No, impossible.\n\nH=5: after 5 actions, y=3+5=8 at turn 11, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 in fewer than 6 actions, I need to increase by more, but each action at most +1, so min 6 actions from y=3 to y=9.\n\nSo H=6 is minimal.\n\nThus the sequence is all U.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 3 has cars, but at turn 6, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should check if at some point I must wait.\n\nFor example, suppose I go up to y=4 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=8, if I go up to y=5, fine.\n\nIf I stayed on y=4 at t=8, then collision, but I didn't stay, I went up.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6, with all actions U.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut the answer format should be:\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  \nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}  \n...  \n}\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 6: U  \nTurn 7: U  \nTurn 8: U  \nTurn 9: U  \nTurn 10: U  \nTurn 11: U\n\nBut t_1 + H -1 = 6 + 6 -1 =11, yes.\n\nSince H=6, turns from 6 to 11.\n\nI think that's it.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if there is a car at other times.\n\nFor example, at T=8, on y=3, if I were there, but I was not.\n\nSimilarly, no.\n\nPerhaps for y=8 at T=12, but I left at T=11.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) is 6, achieved by moving up (U) at every turn.

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 7, but since we're starting from turn t_1, I should think of the turns relative to t_1. So let's set t=0 for turn t_1, meaning the first action is at t=0.\n\nThe player starts at y=4. I need to reach y=9. Since y increases by 1 for U, decreases by 1 for D, or stays for S, and y must be between 0 and 9, I need to move up 5 times to go from 4 to 9. But I have to avoid the cars on the way.\n\nThe collision condition is that at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn, then collision. But note: when you move to a new row, you're not on that row until the next turn. Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\" And the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, you are on row y_T. If for that row, at that turn, 0 is in the span of a car on that row, you collide. When you take an action at turn T, it determines y_{T+1}, but at turn T, you are still on y_T. Only at turn T+1 do you move to y_{T+1}.\n\nAlso, for the car spans, they move continuously. Since the cars move at constant speed, and we're dealing with integer turns, I need to compute for each freeway and each turn whether 0 is occupied by a car.\n\nThe cars are given at turn t_1=7. So for turn T relative to t_1, I need to compute the span at that absolute turn.\n\nSet τ = T - t_1, so τ is the number of turns since t_1.\n\nAt time τ (relative), the absolute turn is t_1 + τ.\n\nFor a car, at turn t_1, span is [h, τ] or [τ, h] depending on direction.\n\nFor left-moving, span is [h, τ], and at turn T, it becomes [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, span is [τ, h] at t_1, becomes [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)] at T.\n\nIn the table, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: right or left. In the table, all are \"right\", I think. Let me check.\n\nFreeway 1: (-42, -53, right, 3) — head -42, tail -53? That seems odd because for right-moving, head should be larger, but here head -42 is greater than tail -53? -42 > -53, yes, so for right-moving, head is the front, so if moving right, head > tail.\n\nIn this case, head -42, tail -53, so since -42 > -53, and direction right, so at t_1, the car is from x= -53 to x= -42? Tail to head.\n\nThe span: for right-moving, it says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" and τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn the notation: \"head h, tail τ\", so for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], meaning from tail to head, with τ < h since moving right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] with h < τ.\n\nIn freeway 1: (-42, -53, right, 3) — head -42, tail -53. Since direction right, tail -53, head -42, so Span(t_1) = [-53, -42]? But [τ, h] = [-53, -42], and since τ = -53 < h = -42, it's increasing x.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut for freeway 2,3,4, it has multiple cars: e.g., freeway 2: (36,25,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFor each, head and tail.\n\nFirst car: head 36, tail 25, direction right, so Span(t_1) = [25,36]\n\nSecond: head -48? Tail -59, head -48, so [ -59, -48]\n\nThird: head -12, tail -23, so [ -23, -12]? Tail -23, head -12, so [τ,h] = [-23, -12]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, all cars are right-moving, from the table.\n\nFreeway 1: right\n\nFreeway 2: all right\n\nFreeway 3: all right\n\nFreeway 4: all right\n\nFreeway 5: (-24,-35,right,6) so [ -35, -24]\n\nFreeway 6: same, (-24,-35,right,6) [ -35, -24]\n\nFreeway 7: (-20,-31,right,4) [ -31, -20]\n\nFreeway 8: (-20,-31,right,4) [ -31, -20]\n\nAll cars moving right.\n\nNow, for collision: at turn T (absolute), for freeway k, if player is on y_T = k, and for that k, at that turn, 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, I need to check if any car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe player is only on one freeway per turn, specifically at turn T, player is on row y_T.\n\nTo go from y=4 to y=9, I need to move up 5 times. But I can also move down or stay to avoid cars, but since I need to minimize turns, I should move up as much as possible, only deviating if necessary to avoid collision.\n\nSince moving down or staying might be needed to wait for a car to pass, but in this case, all freeways have cars, and I need to check when x=0 is free for each row at each turn.\n\nFirst, let's define the relative turn τ. Set τ = 0 at t_1=7.\n\nSo at τ=0, player at y=4.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, such that after H turns, y = y_{t_1 + H} =9? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1, so after H actions, the position is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nThe player position is updated after the action. At turn T, player is at position (0, y_T), then action a_T determines Δy, so y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T, take action a_T, then at turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1}.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn T based on y_T and the cars at that turn.\n\nTo reach (0,9), we need y_{t_1 + H} =9, meaning after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, we are at y=9.\n\nSince we start at τ=0, y=4, after H turns, at τ=H, y=9.\n\nThe actions are for t=0 to H-1.\n\nNow, for each freeway and each relative turn τ, I need to know if x=0 is occupied.\n\nFor a given freeway k, and relative time τ (so absolute time t = t_1 + τ = 7 + τ), the span of each car at time t.\n\nSince all cars move at constant speed, and direction.\n\nFor right-moving cars: at time t, span is [τ + s * τ, h + s * τ]? Let's see.\n\nAt absolute time T, for a car with initial tail τ, head h, direction right, speed s, at time t_1, span [τ, h]\n\nThen at time T = t_1 + τ_rel, the span is [τ + s * τ_rel, h + s * τ_rel]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right here.\n\nIn this case, all right-moving.\n\nτ_rel is the relative time since t_1, so let's use τ for that.\n\nSo for a car on freeway k with (tail, head, dir, s) given at t_1.\n\nAt relative time τ, span is [tail + s * τ, head + s * τ] for right-moving.\n\nThen, x=0 is occupied if there exists a car such that tail + s*τ ≤ 0 ≤ head + s*τ.\n\nSince the car spans may not cover 0, we need to find for each freeway k and each τ, whether 0 is covered by any car on k.\n\nThen, for the player, at turn τ (relative), if player is on row y_τ, and for that row, at τ, 0 is occupied, then collision.\n\ny_τ depends on the actions taken.\n\nI need to find a path from y=4 at τ=0 to y=9 at some τ=H, with minimal H.\n\nSince the grid is small, I can compute for each freeway, for each τ, the status of x=0.\n\nFirst, let's list all freeways and their cars.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: tail -53, head -42, speed 3, direction right.\n\nAt τ, span: [ -53 + 3τ, -42 + 3τ ]\n\n0 occupied if -53 + 3τ ≤ 0 ≤ -42 + 3τ\n\nSolve: -53 + 3τ ≤ 0 => 3τ ≤ 53 => τ ≤ 53/3 ≈ 17.666, so τ ≤ 17\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -42 + 3τ => 42 ≤ 3τ => τ ≥ 14\n\nSo for τ from 14 to 17 inclusive.\n\nτ=14: -53 + 3*14 = -53 + 42 = -11 ≤ 0, and -42 + 42 = 0 ≤ 0, so 0 covered? -42 + 3*14 = -42 + 42 = 0, and -53 + 42 = -11, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nAt τ=14, span: tail + sτ = -53 + 42 = -11, head + sτ = -42 + 42 =0, so [ -11, 0], so 0 is included.\n\nAt τ=15: -53 + 45 = -8, -42 + 45 =3, [ -8,3], 0 covered.\n\nτ=16: -53+48= -5, -42+48=6, [-5,6], 0 covered.\n\nτ=17: -53+51= -2, -42+51=9, [-2,9], 0 covered.\n\nτ=18: -53+54=1, -42+54=12, [1,12], 0 not covered since 0<1.\n\nτ=13: -53+39= -14, -42+39= -3, [-14,-3], 0 not covered.\n\nSo for freeway 1, 0 occupied at τ=14,15,16,17.\n\nNow freeway 2: has three cars.\n\nFirst car: (36,25,right,12) tail 25, head 36, speed 12\n\nAt τ, span [25 + 12τ, 36 + 12τ]\n\n0 occupied if 25+12τ ≤ 0 ≤ 36+12τ\n\nBut 25+12τ ≤ 0 only if τ negative, which not possible, since τ≥0. 25+12τ ≥25>0, so never ≤0. Similarly, 36+12τ>0, so 0 never in [25+12τ, 36+12τ] since min is 25>0.\n\nSecond car: (-48,-59,right,12) tail -59, head -48, speed 12\n\nSpan at τ: [ -59 + 12τ, -48 + 12τ ]\n\n0 occupied if -59+12τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48+12τ\n\nLeft: -59+12τ ≤0 => 12τ ≤59 => τ ≤ 59/12 ≈4.916, so τ≤4\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -48+12τ => 48 ≤12τ => τ≥4\n\nSo τ=4: -59+48= -11 ≤0, -48+48=0≤0, so 0 covered.\n\nτ=5: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not covered.\n\nτ=3: -59+36= -23, -48+36= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not covered.\n\nSo only at τ=4.\n\nThird car: (-12,-23,right,12) tail -23, head -12, speed 12\n\nSpan: [ -23 +12τ, -12 +12τ ]\n\n0 occupied if -23+12τ ≤0 ≤ -12+12τ\n\nLeft: -23+12τ ≤0 => 12τ≤23 => τ≤23/12≈1.916, τ≤1\n\nRight: 0≤ -12+12τ => 12≤12τ => τ≥1\n\nSo τ=1: -23+12= -11≤0, -12+12=0≤0, covered.\n\nτ=0: -23+0= -23, -12+0= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not covered.\n\nτ=2: -23+24=1, -12+24=12, [1,12], 0 not covered.\n\nSo only τ=1.\n\nThus for freeway 2, 0 occupied at τ=1 (from third car) and τ=4 (from second car). First car never covers 0.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? From table, freeway 3 has same cars: (36,25,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nExactly the same as freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same cars.\n\nSo freeway 3: 0 occupied at τ=1 and τ=4.\n\nFreeway 4: same.\n\nNow freeway 5: one car: (-24,-35,right,6) tail -35, head -24, speed 6\n\nSpan: [ -35 +6τ, -24 +6τ ]\n\n0 occupied if -35+6τ ≤0 ≤ -24+6τ\n\nLeft: -35+6τ ≤0 => 6τ≤35 => τ≤35/6≈5.833, τ≤5\n\nRight: 0≤ -24+6τ => 24≤6τ => τ≥4\n\nSo τ=4: -35+24= -11≤0, -24+24=0≤0, covered.\n\nτ=5: -35+30= -5, -24+30=6, [-5,6], 0 covered.\n\nτ=6: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not covered.\n\nτ=3: -35+18= -17, -24+18= -6, [-17,-6], 0 not covered.\n\nSo occupied at τ=4 and τ=5.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5? Freeway 6: (-24,-35,right,6) same as freeway 5.\n\nSo occupied at τ=4,5.\n\nFreeway 7: (-20,-31,right,4) tail -31, head -20, speed 4\n\nSpan: [ -31 +4τ, -20 +4τ ]\n\n0 occupied if -31+4τ ≤0 ≤ -20+4τ\n\nLeft: -31+4τ ≤0 => 4τ≤31 => τ≤31/4=7.75, τ≤7\n\nRight: 0≤ -20+4τ => 20≤4τ => τ≥5\n\nSo τ=5: -31+20= -11≤0, -20+20=0≤0, covered.\n\nτ=6: -31+24= -7, -20+24=4, [-7,4], 0 covered.\n\nτ=7: -31+28= -3, -20+28=8, [-3,8], 0 covered.\n\nτ=8: -31+32=1, -20+32=12, [1,12], 0 not covered.\n\nτ=4: -31+16= -15, -20+16= -4, [-15,-4], 0 not covered.\n\nSo occupied at τ=5,6,7.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: (-20,-31,right,4) so occupied at τ=5,6,7.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway and τ, when 0 is occupied (collision if player on that row at that τ).\n\nτ from 0 up, we need to go to y=9.\n\nFreeway y=1 to 8.\n\nAt τ=0:\n\ny=1: occupied? From above, freeway 1 occupied at τ=14,15,16,17, not at τ=0.\n\nFreeway 2: occupied at τ=1 and 4, not at 0.\n\nSimilarly, all others not occupied at τ=0 except possibly, but from above:\n\ny=1: not occ at τ=0\n\ny=2: occ at τ=1 and 4, not 0\n\ny=3: same as y=2, not at 0\n\ny=4: same as y=2? Freeway 4 has same, not at 0\n\ny=4 freeway, from table, freeway 4 has cars, not occ at τ=0\n\ny=5: occ at τ=4,5, not 0\n\ny=6: same, not 0\n\ny=7: occ at τ=5,6,7, not 0\n\ny=8: same, not 0\n\nAt τ=0, all freeways are free at x=0, so no collision anywhere.\n\nPlayer starts at y=4, which is free at τ=0.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9. y=9 is the top row, and there are no cars on y=9, since freeways are y=1 to 8. So once I reach y=9, I'm safe, no cars.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should move up as fast as possible.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on a row when it is occupied at that turn.\n\nAt τ=0, y=4, safe.\n\nI can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go up to y=5 at τ=1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn τ, I am at y_τ, take action a_τ, then at τ+1, I am at y_{τ+1}.\n\nCollision at τ depends on y_τ and the cars at τ for that row.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, y=4, freeway 4: at τ=0, is it occupied? Freeway 4 same as freeway 2, not occupied at τ=0, so safe.\n\nNow, I take action at τ=0. If I take U, then at τ=1, I go to y=5.\n\nBut at τ=1, where am I?\n\nAt τ=0, I am at y=4.\n\nAfter action a_0, at τ=1, I am at y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0.\n\nIf a_0 = U, y_1 = 5.\n\nThen at turn τ=1, I am on row y=5.\n\nNow, for row y=5, which is freeway 5? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=5 corresponds to freeway 5.\n\nAt τ=1, is freeway 5 occupied?\n\nFrom above, freeway 5 occupied at τ=4 and 5, not at τ=1, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go up again.\n\nBut let's list the occupation times for each row.\n\nMake a table for each freeway (row) and τ.\n\nτ min and max: since we need to go up, τ from 0 to say 10 or so.\n\nBut cars: the critical τ are small except freeway 1 which is later.\n\nFor row 1 (freeway 1): occ at τ=14,15,16,17\n\nRow 2: occ at τ=1 and 4\n\nRow 3: occ at τ=1 and 4 (since same as row 2)\n\nRow 4: occ at τ=1 and 4\n\nRow 5: occ at τ=4 and 5\n\nRow 6: occ at τ=4 and 5 (same as row 5)\n\nRow 7: occ at τ=5,6,7\n\nRow 8: occ at τ=5,6,7\n\nNow, player starts at row 4 at τ=0.\n\nI need to reach row 9, which is always safe.\n\nMinimal moves: to go from 4 to 9, need 5 up moves. With no obstacles, H=5, but I might need to wait or detour if collision.\n\nBut rows have obstacles at certain τ.\n\nNow, at τ=0, y=4, safe.\n\nIf I go up at each step, let's simulate.\n\nOption 1: always up.\n\nτ=0: y=4, action U, then to y=5 at τ=1\n\nAt τ=1, y=5? At turn τ=1, player is at y_1.\n\nAfter action at τ=0, at τ=1, y=5.\n\nAt τ=1, is y=5 occupied? Row 5 at τ=1: from above, row 5 occupied at τ=4,5, not τ=1, so safe.\n\nThen action at τ=1: U, to y=6 at τ=2\n\nAt τ=2, y=6, row 6 at τ=2: occupied? Row 6 occ at τ=4,5, not τ=2, safe.\n\nAction U at τ=2, to y=7 at τ=3\n\nAt τ=3, y=7, row 7 at τ=3: occupied? Row 7 occ at τ=5,6,7, not τ=3, safe.\n\nAction U at τ=3, to y=8 at τ=4\n\nAt τ=4, y=8, row 8 at τ=4: occupied? Row 8 occ at τ=5,6,7, not τ=4? τ=4, row 8 occ at τ=5,6,7, so at τ=4, not occupied, safe.\n\nAction U at τ=4, to y=9 at τ=5\n\nAt τ=5, y=9, but y=9 has no freeway, so no collision, and we reached y=9.\n\nNow, at τ=5, we are at y=9, which is the goal.\n\nH=5 turns? Let's see the sequence.\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=4 (t=0 to 4), 5 actions.\n\nAt τ=0: action U, to y=5 at τ=1\n\nAt τ=1: action U, to y=6 at τ=2\n\nAt τ=2: action U, to y=7 at τ=3\n\nAt τ=3: action U, to y=8 at τ=4\n\nAt τ=4: action U, to y=9 at τ=5\n\nAt τ=5, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, were there any collisions?\n\nAt each turn τ, we need to check collision when we are on a row.\n\nAt τ=0: y=4, row 4 not occ, safe.\n\nτ=1: y=5, row 5 not occ at τ=1 (occ at 4,5, but τ=1 not), safe.\n\nτ=2: y=6, row 6 not occ at τ=2 (occ at 4,5), safe.\n\nτ=3: y=7, row 7 not occ at τ=3 (occ at 5,6,7, but τ=3<5), safe.\n\nτ=4: y=8, row 8 not occ at τ=4 (occ at 5,6,7), τ=4<5, safe.\n\nτ=5: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nBut at τ=5, we are at y=9, which is after the action, but collision is checked at each turn based on position at that turn.\n\nAt τ=5, y=9, no issue.\n\nIn this sequence, we never were on a row when it was occupied.\n\nBut let's confirm the occupation:\n\nFor row 5: occ at τ=4 and 5.\n\nAt τ=1, when we were on row 5, it was not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 at τ=2, not occ.\n\nRow 7 at τ=3, not occ.\n\nRow 8 at τ=4, not occ.\n\nAnd at τ=5, we are on row 9.\n\nSo no collision, and we reached in 5 turns.\n\nBut is row 4 occupied at some point? We left at τ=0.\n\nBut in this path, we didn't stay, so fine.\n\nThe problem is to reach (0,9), and we did in 5 actions.\n\nBut let's check if at τ=4, when we are on row 8, is it occupied? Row 8 at τ=4 not occ.\n\nBut row 8 is occ at τ=5,6,7, but at τ=4, not.\n\nSimilarly, if I had stayed, but I didn't.\n\nIn the sequence, at τ=4, I am on row 8, and I take U to go to row 9 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5, if I were on row 8, it would be occupied, but I moved to row 9.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nBut let's double-check the rows.\n\nFreeway 8: at τ=4, span: for the car, tail -31 +4*4 = -31+16= -15, head -20+16= -4, so [-15,-4], 0 not covered.\n\nAt τ=5: -31+20= -11, -20+20=0, covered.\n\nBut at τ=5, I am on row 9, not row 8.\n\nSimilarly, for row 5: at τ=1, car on row 5: tail -35 +6*1= -29, head -24+6= -18, [-29,-18], 0 not covered.\n\nAt τ=4: -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, covered, but at τ=4, I am on row 8, not row 5.\n\nSo in this sequence, all good.\n\nBut the player starts at τ=0 on row 4.\n\nNow, row 4 at τ=0: freeway 4, which has cars, but at τ=0, not occupied, as we said.\n\nIn the sequence, I used 5 up moves, reached at τ=5.\n\nIs it possible in less? From 4 to 9, minimum 5 moves, all up, so H=5 is minimum possible.\n\nAnd we achieved it without collision.\n\nBut the problem is that at τ=1, for row 2,3,4 are occupied? Let's see.\n\nAt τ=1, row 2 is occupied because freeway 2 at τ=1, from earlier, occupied by the third car.\n\nBut in my sequence, at τ=1, I am on row 5, not on row 2.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=4, row 2,3,4,5 are occupied, but at τ=4, I am on row 8, which is not occupied at τ=4.\n\nRow 8 at τ=4 not occ.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should list the position at each τ.\n\nτ=0: position y=4, row 4 not occ, safe.\n\nAction U: to y=5 at τ=1\n\nτ=1: position y=5, row 5 at τ=1: not occ (occ at τ=4,5), safe.\n\nAction U: to y=6 at τ=2\n\nτ=2: position y=6, row 6 at τ=2: not occ (occ at τ=4,5), safe.\n\nAction U: to y=7 at τ=3\n\nτ=3: position y=7, row 7 at τ=3: not occ (occ at τ=5,6,7, τ=3<5), safe.\n\nAction U: to y=8 at τ=4\n\nτ=4: position y=8, row 8 at τ=4: not occ (occ at τ=5,6,7, τ=4<5), safe.\n\nAction U: to y=9 at τ=5\n\nτ=5: position y=9, no freeway, safe. Reached.\n\nSo H=5, sequence: U, U, U, U, U for actions at τ=0 to 4.\n\nBut τ relative to t_1, so actions at t_1 + t for t=0 to 4.\n\nIn the answer, it should be for turn t_1 + t.\n\nt_1=7.\n\nSo turn 7: a_{7} = U\n\nTurn 8: a_{8} = U\n\nTurn 9: a_{9} = U\n\nTurn 10: a_{10} = U\n\nTurn 11: a_{11} = U\n\nAfter 5 actions, at turn 12, position y=9? Let's see.\n\nStart: turn t_1=7, position y=4.\n\nAction at turn 7: a_7 = U, so at turn 8, y=5\n\nAction at turn 8: a_8 = U, at turn 9, y=6\n\nAction at turn 9: a_9 = U, at turn 10, y=7\n\nAction at turn 10: a_10 = U, at turn 11, y=8\n\nAction at turn 11: a_11 = U, at turn 12, y=9\n\nReached at turn 12, so H=5 actions.\n\nBut the sequence is for actions from t=0 to H-1, so 5 actions.\n\nIn the box, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U (for turn 7)\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} = U (turn 8)\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 +4: a_{t_1+4} = U (turn 11)\n\nt_1=7, so turns: 7,8,9,10,11.\n\nActions at these turns.\n\nIn the sequence, it says \"a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\", so t from 0 to 4 for H=5.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 7: a_7\n\nTurn 8: a_8\n\n...\n\nTurn 11: a_11\n\nAll U.\n\nBut is there a problem at any point?\n\nAt turn 8 (τ=1), position y=5, freeway 5.\n\nAt τ=1, freeway 5: car span [ -35 +6*1, -24 +6*1] = [-29, -18], which is from x=-29 to -18, not covering x=0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 11 (τ=4), position y=8, freeway 8.\n\nAt τ=4, freeway 8: car [ -31 +4*4, -20 +4*4] = [-31+16, -20+16] = [-15, -4], not covering 0, safe.\n\nAt τ=5, turn 12, y=9, safe.\n\nBut what about row 2 at τ=1? Freeway 2 at τ=1 is occupied, but I am not on row 2, I am on row 5.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=4, row 4 is occupied, but I am on row 8.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8\", and in this case, I avoided.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to start immediately.\n\nAnother thing: at the start, τ=0, turn t_1=7, position (0,4), which is given, and no action taken yet? At turn T, we are at position, then we take action.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn t_1, we take first action.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output actions starting from turn t_1.\n\nIn this case, with all U, it works.\n\nBut let me confirm if row 4 at τ=0 is safe.\n\nFreeway 4: cars at τ=0.\n\nCars on freeway 4: same as freeway 2: (36,25,right,12), at τ=0, [25,36], not cover 0.\n\n(-48,-59,right,12), at τ=0, [-59,-48], not cover 0.\n\n(-12,-23,right,12), at τ=0, [-23,-12], not cover 0.\n\nAll not cover 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo minimal H is 5.\n\nBut the player could go down or stay to avoid, but since we can go straight up, no need.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose at some point I had to wait.\n\nFor example, if I were to be on row 5 at τ=4, it would be occupied, but in this path, I am on row 5 only at τ=1, not at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is five U actions.\n\nNow for the answer format.\n\nSo actions at turn 7,8,9,10,11.\n\nIn the box:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nBut t_1=7, so:\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSince t_1 is given as 7, but in the answer, it should be with the turn number.\n\nIn the box, it should be written with the turns.\n\nPerhaps:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U\n}\n\nBut let's make sure the turn numbering.\n\nThe sequence is for actions from t=0 to H-1 relative, absolute turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nH=5, t_1=7, so turns 7 to 11 inclusive, 5 actions.\n\nAfter that, at turn 12, position y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The minimum number of moves required to go from \\(y = 4\\) to \\(y = 9\\) is 5 upward moves, as each \"U\" action increases \\(y\\) by 1.\n- The car occupation at \\(x = 0\\) for each freeway and relative turn \\(\\tau\\) (where \\(\\tau = 0\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\)) is as follows:\n  - Freeway 1: Occupied at \\(\\tau = 14, 15, 16, 17\\)\n  - Freeway 2: Occupied at \\(\\tau = 1, 4\\)\n  - Freeway 3: Occupied at \\(\\tau = 1, 4\\) (same as freeway 2)\n  - Freeway 4: Occupied at \\(\\tau = 1, 4\\) (same as freeway 2)\n  - Freeway 5: Occupied at \\(\\tau = 4, 5\\)\n  - Freeway 6: Occupied at \\(\\tau = 4, 5\\) (same as freeway 5)\n  - Freeway 7: Occupied at \\(\\tau = 5, 6, 7\\)\n  - Freeway 8: Occupied at \\(\\tau = 5, 6, 7\\) (same as freeway 7)\n- At \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn 7), all freeways are free at \\(x = 0\\), so the starting position is safe.\n- A sequence of \"U\" actions (all upward moves) allows the player to reach \\(y = 9\\) in 5 turns without collision:\n  - At turn 7 (\\(\\tau = 0\\)): Player at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4, unoccupied at \\(\\tau = 0\\)); action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 8.\n  - At turn 8 (\\(\\tau = 1\\)): Player at \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5, unoccupied at \\(\\tau = 1\\)); action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 9.\n  - At turn 9 (\\(\\tau = 2\\)): Player at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, unoccupied at \\(\\tau = 2\\)); action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 10.\n  - At turn 10 (\\(\\tau = 3\\)): Player at \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7, unoccupied at \\(\\tau = 3\\)); action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 11.\n  - At turn 11 (\\(\\tau = 4\\)): Player at \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8, unoccupied at \\(\\tau = 4\\)); action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12.\n- At turn 12 (\\(\\tau = 5\\)), the player is at \\(y = 9\\), which has no freeway and is thus safe. The goal is reached.\n- No detours or waits are needed, as the path avoids all occupied times for the relevant freeways.\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 5, with the sequence of actions starting from turn \\(t_1 = 7\\).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 8, and the player is at (0,5). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe grid has freeways at y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically (changing y by -1, 0, or +1 per turn) and we must avoid being on a freeway row y at a turn T if at that turn there is a car on freeway y such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is within the car's span at that turn.\n\nImportant: When moving, at turn T we are on row y_T. If we choose an action at turn T that moves us to y_{T+1} (either up or down), then at turn T we are still on y_T and at turn T+1 we are on y_{T+1}. Thus, if we are moving from row y to row y+1 at turn T, then at turn T we are on row y and at turn T+1 we are on row y+1. We only check the car on the row we are currently on at each turn.\n\nCar update:\n  For a car given at turn t1 (current turn) with head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s:\n    - For a left-moving car (direction left? note: the problem says left-moving: span becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n    - For a right-moving car: [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the representation in the table:\n  - For freeway 1: (-39, -50, right, 3) -> since it's right-moving, the head is at the right end? But the representation is (head, tail, direction, speed). \n  However, the update rule for right-moving says: from [tau, h] at t1 to [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] at T.\n\nBut in the table, for freeway 1: (head, tail) = (-39, -50). Since it's right-moving, the car's head (front) is at -39 and tail at -50? But that would imply the car is from -50 to -39? But the update rule for right-moving says the initial span is [tau, h] = [-50, -39]? Then at time T, the span becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] = [-50 + 3*(T-8), -39 + 3*(T-8)].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: three cars: \n  (48,37,right,12) -> initial span [37,48]? Then at T: [37+12*(T-8), 48+12*(T-8)]\n  (-36,-47,right,12) -> initial span [-47,-36]? Then at T: [-47+12*(T-8), -36+12*(T-8)]\n  (0,-11,right,12) -> initial span [-11,0]? Then at T: [-11+12*(T-8), 0+12*(T-8)]\n\nBut note: the collision condition is that at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (meaning y_T = k) and if 0 (the player's x) is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T, then collision.\n\nWe start at (0,5) at turn t1=8. We need to get to (0,9). The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). We cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe are going to plan the moves step by step. We are at y=5 at turn 8. We need to go to y=9, so we have to go up 4 times. But we have to avoid the freeways at y=1 to 8 at the turns we are on them.\n\nSince we are at y=5 at turn 8, we are on freeway 5 at turn 8. We must check if at turn 8, on freeway 5, is there a car that covers x=0?\n\nFreeway 5: only one car: (-18, -29, right, 6)\n  This is right-moving. Initial span: [tau, h] = [-29, -18]? But wait: the representation is (head, tail). The update rule for right-moving uses [tau, h] as the initial span? But the table says: head = -18, tail = -29. So the head is at -18 and tail at -29? That would mean the car extends from -29 to -18? But that is a length of 12? \n\nHowever, the update rule says for right-moving: from [tau, h] to [tau+s*dt, h+s*dt]. So if we take tau = -29 and h = -18, then the initial span is [-29, -18]. Then at turn 8 (dt=0): the span is [-29, -18]. Does 0 lie in [-29, -18]? No, because -29<=0<=-18 is false. So at turn 8, on freeway 5, we are safe.\n\nBut note: we are at turn 8 at y=5. We are safe at turn 8.\n\nNow, we plan the next moves. We have to go from y=5 to y=9. The minimal number of moves is 4 (if we go up every time). But we must check each freeway we step on at the exact turn.\n\nWe will simulate turn by turn. We are at turn 8: y=5.\n\nWe can choose actions: U (go to y=6), D (go to y=4), or S (stay at y=5). But we want to go up, so we prefer U. But we must check safety at each step.\n\nLet's check the cars at the required freeways for the next few turns.\n\nWe note that the cars on freeways 2,3,4 have the same three cars? And freeways 6,7,8 also have cars.\n\nWe are going to try to go up as fast as possible, but we must avoid collisions.\n\nStep 1: At turn 8 (t=8), we are at y=5. We choose an action for turn 8. We want to move up. So let's try a_t1 (turn 8) = U.\n\nThen at turn 9, we will be at y=6.\n\nBut at turn 9, we will be on freeway 6. We must check freeway 6 at turn 9.\n\nFreeway 6: has one car: (-18, -29, right, 6) -> same as freeway 5? But wait, the table says for freeway 6: (-18, -29, right, 6). So same as freeway 5? \n\nBut note: the car on freeway 6 is (-18, -29, right, 6). At turn 9 (dt=1 from t1=8), the car on freeway 6 will be:\n  Since it's right-moving: initial span at t1=8: [tau, h] = [-29, -18]. Then at T=9: \n      [ -29 + 6*(9-8), -18 + 6*(9-8) ] = [-29+6, -18+6] = [-23, -12]\n  Does 0 lie in [-23, -12]? No, because 0 is not between -23 and -12 (it's greater than -12). So safe.\n\nSo at turn 9, we are at y=6 and safe.\n\nNow we choose action at turn 9: U. Then at turn 10, we are at y=7.\n\nCheck freeway 7 at turn 10.\n\nFreeway 7: car (-16, -27, right, 4)\n  Initial span at t1=8: [tau, h] = [-27, -16] (since it's right-moving and head=-16, tail=-27)\n  At turn 10 (dt=2): \n      [-27 + 4*(10-8), -16 + 4*(10-8)] = [-27+8, -16+8] = [-19, -8]\n  0 is not in [-19, -8] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn 10, we choose U again. Then at turn 11, we are at y=8.\n\nCheck freeway 8 at turn 11.\n\nFreeway 8: car (-16, -27, right, 4) -> same as freeway 7? \n  Initial span at t1=8: [-27, -16]\n  At turn 11 (dt=3): \n      [-27 + 4*(11-8), -16 + 4*(11-8)] = [-27+12, -16+12] = [-15, -4]\n  0 is not in [-15, -4] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn 11, we choose U. Then at turn 12, we are at y=9. And we are done because y=9 is the goal (and there are no freeways above 8, so no car check needed for y=9? Actually, the freeways are only from 1 to 8, so when we are at y=9 we are safe).\n\nSo the sequence would be:\n  Turn 8: U -> to y=6 at turn9\n  Turn 9: U -> to y=7 at turn10\n  Turn10: U -> to y=8 at turn11\n  Turn11: U -> to y=9 at turn12\n\nTotal H=4 turns? But wait, we started at turn8 and we did actions at turn8,9,10,11 -> 4 actions, and at turn12 we are at y=9. So we have reached at turn12? But note the problem says: we start at turn t1=8 and we do actions for t=0 to H-1. So H is the number of actions. Then the last action is at turn t1+H-1. And at that turn, we are at (0,9). \n\nIn this case, at turn11 (which is t1+3) we do the last action (U) and then at the next state (turn12) we are at (0,9). But note: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? \n\nActually, the player update: after action at turn t, we get the state at turn t+1. So if we do action at turn t1+H-1, then the state at turn t1+H is (0,9). But the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? \n\nLet me read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nSo we require that at the end of the sequence of H actions, at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nBut in our plan, after 4 actions (H=4):\n  At turn8 (t1+0): we start at y=5, then we do action U -> then at turn9 (t1+1) we are at y=6.\n  At turn9 (t1+1): we do U -> at turn10 (t1+2) we are at y=7.\n  At turn10 (t1+2): we do U -> at turn11 (t1+3) we are at y=8.\n  At turn11 (t1+3): we do U -> at turn12 (t1+4) we are at y=9.\n\nBut we require that at turn t1+H-1 = 8+4-1 = 11, we are at y=9? But at turn11 we are at y=8, and at turn12 we are at y=9. So at turn11 we are not at 9. Therefore, this sequence does not satisfy the condition that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nWe must be at (0,9) at the turn after the last action? But the problem states: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nSo we need to be at y=9 at the turn t1+H-1. How do we achieve that? \n\nWe start at turn t1=8 at y=5. We do H actions. The state after the last action (which is applied at turn t1+H-1) gives the state at turn t1+H. But we require the state at turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9). \n\nThis means that the last action must be applied at turn t1+H-2? \n\nLet me clarify the timeline:\n\n  Turn t1: we are at state (0, y_{t1}=5). We choose action a_{t1} (first action). Then we move to state (0, y_{t1+1}) at turn t1+1.\n\n  We do actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1 (total H actions).\n\n  Then the state at turn t1+H is the state after the last action.\n\nBut the problem requires: at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nThis implies that we must have reached (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 without the last action? \n\nActually, the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state we are in before we apply the last action? \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". So we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? Then we don't need to do an action at that turn? But we are required to provide H actions. \n\nAlternatively, we must be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nSo let me re-read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThis means: after applying the actions from t1 to t1+H-1, the state at turn t1+H-1 is (0,9). \n\nBut how is that possible? \n\nThe timeline:\n\n  Turn t1: we are at state (0, y_{t1}) at the start of the turn. Then we choose an action a_{t1}. Then we update to state (0, y_{t1+1}) at the start of turn t1+1.\n\n  So after applying action at turn t, we are at state at turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, to have the state at turn t1+H-1 be (0,9), we must have arrived there by the action taken at turn t1+H-2. Then we do not need to take an action at turn t1+H-1? But the sequence has H actions, including an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThis is confusing. \n\nLooking at the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to H-1, so the actions are at turns: t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAnd then the state at turn t1+H-1 is y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut note: the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state that we are in at the beginning of that turn. Then we apply action a_{t1+H-1} to get to the next state. \n\nSo if we require y_{t1+H-1}=9, then at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are already at 9. Then we don't need to move? But we still have to provide an action for that turn? \n\nThe problem says: we are to provide a sequence of actions until we reach (0,9). And we must have y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nSo if we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we can choose any action? But note that if we are at 9, we cannot go up (since max is 9). We can choose S or D? But if we choose D we go to 8, which is not desired? \n\nBut the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). So we must have arrived at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1. This means that the last action (at turn t1+H-2) must have brought us to (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. Then at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9) and we do an action? But then we might leave? \n\nThis is problematic. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at (0,9) at the next state, i.e., at turn t1+H. But then the condition is y_{t1+H}=9. \n\nBut the problem explicitly says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nSo we must be at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1. Therefore, the last action that moved us was at turn t1+H-2, which brought us to y=9 at turn t1+H-1. Then at turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9 and we must do an action. But we don't need to move? We can do S (stay). \n\nSo the minimal H would be the number of actions required to get to y=9 by turn t1+H-1. \n\nWe start at turn t1=8 at y=5. We need to get to y=9. The minimal steps to go from 5 to 9 is 4 steps (if we go up 4 times). Then:\n\n  We do 4 actions: at turns 8,9,10,11 (which are t1+0, t1+1, t1+2, t1+3) -> H=4.\n\n  Then we require that at turn t1+H-1 = 8+4-1 = 11, we are at y=9.\n\nBut in our earlier plan, we are at y=8 at turn11? How do we get to y=9 at turn11? \n\nWe must be at y=9 at the beginning of turn11. So we must have arrived at turn11. Therefore, we need to get from y=5 to y=9 in 3 actions? But that's impossible because each action can only move one step. \n\nAlternatively, we have to count the state at turn8 as the starting state. Then:\n\n  Turn8 (start): y=5.\n  Action at turn8: we do U -> then at turn9: y=6.\n  Action at turn9: U -> turn10: y=7.\n  Action at turn10: U -> turn11: y=8.\n  Action at turn11: U -> turn12: y=9.\n\nSo we are at y=9 at turn12. But we are required to be at y=9 at turn11? \n\nThis suggests we need to get there earlier? But that's impossible. \n\nAlternatively, the problem means that the last action is at turn t1+H-1 and then the state at that same turn (after the action) is (0,9)? But that's not how the update works. \n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), avoiding collisions ... such that y_{t1+H-1}=9.\"\n\nAnd the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo the state at time t+1 depends on the action at time t.\n\nTherefore, the state at time t1+H-1 is:\n\n  y_{t1+H-1} = y_{t1+H-2} + Delta y_{t1+H-2}\n\nBut we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nWe start at y_{t1} = 5.\n\nWe apply actions at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2, t1+H-1 (total H actions) to get to y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut note: the action at t1+H-1 will affect y_{t1+H}, not y_{t1+H-1}. \n\nSo how can we have y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\nThe state y_{t1+H-1} is determined by the actions taken from t1 to t1+H-2. The action at t1+H-1 is taken after we are already at y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nSo if we are at y=9 at turn t1+H-1, then we can choose an action (like S) to stay. \n\nTherefore, we must have arrived at y=9 by turn t1+H-1 (i.e., at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9). Then we do an action at that turn (which might be S) to stay at 9.\n\nSo the minimal H is the number of actions required to get from 5 to 9 (which is 4) plus one action to \"stay\" at 9? But that would be 5 actions? \n\nBut then we are at y=9 at turn t1+H-1? \n\nLet's see:\n\n  Start at turn8 (t1=8): y8=5.\n  Action at turn8: U -> y9=6.\n  Action at turn9: U -> y10=7.\n  Action at turn10: U -> y11=8.\n  Action at turn11: U -> y12=9.  -> This is after 4 actions, and we are at y12=9. But we want y_{t1+H-1}=9. If H=4, then t1+H-1=8+4-1=11, and we want y11=9, but we have y11=8.\n\nAlternatively, if we do 5 actions:\n\n  Action0 (turn8): U -> y9=6.\n  Action1 (turn9): U -> y10=7.\n  Action2 (turn10): U -> y11=8.\n  Action3 (turn11): U -> y12=9.\n  Action4 (turn12): ? -> but then we are at y13? \n\nAnd we require y_{t1+H-1}=y_{8+5-1}=y12=9. \n\nSo if we do:\n\n  Turn8: U -> y9=6\n  Turn9: U -> y10=7\n  Turn10: U -> y11=8\n  Turn11: U -> y12=9   [now at turn12, we are at 9]\n  Then we need an action at turn12: and we are already at 9, so we can do S.\n\nBut then the state at turn12 (which is t1+4) is 9, and we do an action at turn12 to stay. Then the state at turn13 would be 9. But we don't care about turn13.\n\nAnd the condition is that at turn t1+H-1 = 8+5-1 = 12, we are at y=9. Which is satisfied.\n\nSo H=5? But we could have arrived at 9 at turn12 and then done nothing? But the problem requires a sequence of H actions. \n\nBut is there a way to arrive at 9 earlier? \n\nThe earliest we can be at 9 is at turn12 (if we start at turn8 at 5 and do 4 ups: then we are at 9 at turn12). Then we must do an action at turn12 (the fifth action) to satisfy the sequence of H=5 actions and then at turn12 (which is t1+4) we are at 9? But t1+H-1 = 8+5-1=12, so yes.\n\nBut note: the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1=12 we are at 9. And we are, because the action at turn11 (the fourth action) got us to 9 at turn12. Then we do an action at turn12 (the fifth action) to stay.\n\nBut we must check safety at every turn we are on a freeway (y between 1 and 8). When we are at y=9, there is no freeway, so we are safe.\n\nHowever, during the moves we must avoid collisions on the freeways we traverse.\n\nSo let's reexamine the plan for H=5:\n\n  Turn8 (action U): we move from y=5 to y=6. \n      At turn8, we are on y=5: we already checked at turn8 for freeway5: safe.\n      Then after action U, at turn9 we are on y=6.\n\n  Turn9 (action U): move to y=7.\n      At turn9, we are on y=6: we checked the car on freeway6 at turn9: [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\n  Turn10 (action U): move to y=8.\n      At turn10, we are on y=7: we checked freeway7 at turn10: [-19,-8] -> safe.\n\n  Turn11 (action U): move to y=9.\n      At turn11, we are on y=8: we checked freeway8 at turn11: [-15,-4] -> safe.\n\n  Turn12 (action S): we are at y=9, and we do S -> then at turn13 we are still at y=9. \n      At turn12, we are on y=9: no freeway -> safe.\n\nBut the requirement is to be at (0,9) at turn12 (t1+H-1=12). And we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn12? Actually, at the beginning of turn12 we are at y=9 (because the action at turn11 moved us to 9 at turn12). Then we do action S at turn12 to stay.\n\nBut note: the problem doesn't require us to stay at 9 for any duration, only to reach it at turn t1+H-1. So we could also do any action at turn12? But if we do D, we go to 8, which is not 9. So we must do S (or if we are at 9 and do U, we cannot, so U is invalid? The update: if we try U at y=9, then y_{t+1} = min(9, 9+1)=9? Or does it stay? The problem says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, and if we are at 9 and do U, then we try to go to 10, but it's bounded to 9. So it stays at 9. \n\nSo we could do U or S at turn12. But S is safe.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\n  Turn8: U\n  Turn9: U\n  Turn10: U\n  Turn11: U\n  Turn12: S\n\nBut is there a way with fewer actions? H=4? \n\nFor H=4, we require y_{t1+4-1}=y_{11}=9.\n\nHow can we be at y=9 at turn11? \n\nWe start at turn8 at y=5. \n\n  Turn8: action -> to y6 at turn9.\n  Turn9: action -> to y7 at turn10.\n  Turn10: action -> to y8 at turn11.\n  Turn11: action -> to y9 at turn12.\n\nSo we are at y=9 at turn12, not turn11. \n\nCan we be at y=9 at turn11? \n\nWe would have to do:\n\n  Turn8: from y5 to y6? then turn9: to y7, turn10: to y8, turn11: we start at y8 and do an action to go to y9 at turn12. But then at turn11 we are at y8, not 9.\n\nAlternatively, can we go faster? We can only move one step per turn. \n\nTherefore, minimal H is 5.\n\nBut let me check if we can avoid the last S? \n\nThe problem says: we must provide a sequence of H actions and at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. \n\nWith H=5, we are at 9 at turn12 (which is t1+4, and 8+5-1=12) -> correct.\n\nWith H=4, we are at 9 at turn12? but then turn t1+H-1=8+4-1=11, and at turn11 we are at 8, not 9.\n\nSo H must be at least 5.\n\nBut wait: is there a way to be at 9 earlier by using a different path? For example, going down first? That would take more turns. \n\nSo we try the direct path: 4 ups and then one stay. \n\nBut we must check the cars again for the entire path, because we might have missed something.\n\nIn our earlier check, we assumed we move up at every step and checked the freeways we step on at the next turn? Actually, we must check the freeway at the turn we are on that freeway.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n  At turn8: we are at y=5. Check freeway5 at turn8: car (-18,-29,right,6) -> initial span at turn8: [-29, -18] (since right-moving: [tau,head] = [-29,-18]). 0 not in [-29,-18] -> safe.\n\n  Then we do U at turn8: so at turn9 we are at y=6.\n\n  At turn9: we are on y=6. Check freeway6 at turn9: car (-18,-29,right,6) -> at turn9 (dt=1): [-29+6*1, -18+6*1] = [-23,-12]. 0 not in [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\n  Then do U at turn9: at turn10 we are at y=7.\n\n  At turn10: on freeway7: car (-16,-27,right,4) -> at turn10 (dt=2): [-27+4*2, -16+4*2] = [-27+8, -16+8] = [-19,-8]. 0 not in [-19,-8] -> safe.\n\n  Then do U at turn10: at turn11 we are at y=8.\n\n  At turn11: on freeway8: car (-16,-27,right,4) -> at turn11 (dt=3): [-27+4*3, -16+4*3] = [-27+12, -16+12] = [-15,-4]. 0 not in [-15,-4] -> safe.\n\n  Then do U at turn11: at turn12 we are at y=9.\n\n  Then at turn12: we do S (or U, but U would be bounded to 9) -> safe.\n\nBut note: the problem requires that we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, which for H=5 is turn12. But at turn12 we are at y=9? Yes, because the action at turn11 moved us to y=9 at turn12. So at the beginning of turn12, we are at y=9. Then we do an action (S) at turn12.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\n  Turn8: U\n  Turn9: U\n  Turn10: U\n  Turn11: U\n  Turn12: S\n\nBut we must also consider the cars on freeways 2,3,4? We never step on them, so we don't need to check? \n\nWe are moving: 5->6->7->8->9. We only step on freeways 5,6,7,8. We did check freeways 5,6,7,8 at the respective turns.\n\nWhat about freeways 1,2,3,4? We are not on them, so no need.\n\nBut wait: at turn8 we are on freeway5, then at turn9 on freeway6, etc. So we never touch 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut the problem has multiple cars on freeways 2,3,4? For example, freeway2 has three cars at turn8: \n  (48,37,right,12): initial span [37,48] -> at any time T, [37+12*(T-8), 48+12*(T-8)]\n  (-36,-47,right,12): initial span [-47,-36] -> becomes [-47+12*(T-8), -36+12*(T-8)]\n  (0,-11,right,12): initial span [-11,0] -> becomes [-11+12*(T-8), 0+12*(T-8)]\n\nBut note: the car (0,-11,right,12) at turn8: span is [-11,0]. At turn8, if we were on freeway2, then 0 is in [-11,0]? Yes, because 0 is the upper bound. So at turn8, freeway2 is blocked at x=0? \n\nBut we are not on freeway2 at turn8, we are on freeway5. So we are safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3 and 4 have the same cars? So at turn8, freeway3 and 4 are blocked at x=0? But again, we are not on them.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut wait: what if we had to go through these freeways? In this case, we don't.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5.\n\nBut is there a way with H=4? We would have to be at y=9 at turn11. That would require:\n\n  Start: turn8: y5.\n  After action at turn8: at turn9: y6.\n  After action at turn9: at turn10: y7.\n  After action at turn10: at turn11: y8.\n  Then we require at turn11 we are at y9? But that would require the action at turn10 to take us from y7 to y9? But we can only move one step. So impossible.\n\nTherefore, H=5 is minimal.\n\nBut note: we could potentially go faster by using the same number of moves? Or maybe we can skip a step? No.\n\nAlternatively, we could go down first? That would take more moves. For example, go down to 4 then up? That would be at least 5 moves: 5->4->5->6->7->8->9: 6 moves. Worse.\n\nSo the direct up is best.\n\nBut we must ensure that at every step we are safe. We already checked the freeways we are on.\n\nBut what about freeway5 at turn8: we are safe. But what if we stay? But we don't need to.\n\nAnother thing: what if there is a car that will hit us if we are too slow? But in this case, the cars are moving and we are moving vertically, so we only care about the exact turn we are on the freeway.\n\nBut note: the cars on freeway5: at turn8: [-29,-18]. Then at turn9: [-23,-12], turn10: [-17,-6], turn11: [-11,0] -> at turn11, the car on freeway5 spans [-11,0]. So if we were on freeway5 at turn11, we would be hit. But we are not on freeway5 at turn11, we are on freeway8.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6: \n  turn8: [-29,-18] (initial)\n  turn9: [-23,-12] -> we were on freeway6 at turn9: safe.\n  turn10: [-17,-6] -> if we were on freeway6 at turn10, we would be safe? 0 not in [-17,-6].\n  turn11: [-11,0] -> if we were on freeway6 at turn11, then 0 is in the car? because the span is [-11,0] and 0 is included. So we would collide.\n\nBut in our plan, we are on freeway6 only at turn9. At turn11 we are on freeway8. So safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7: \n  turn8: [-27,-16]\n  turn9: [-23,-12]? Wait, at turn9: [-27+4*1, -16+4*1] = [-23,-12] -> safe for 0.\n  turn10: [-19,-8] -> safe.\n  turn11: [-15,-4] -> safe.\n\nFreeway8: \n  turn8: [-27,-16]\n  turn9: [-23,-12]\n  turn10: [-19,-8]\n  turn11: [-15,-4] -> safe.\n\nSo all clear.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n}\n\nBut note: the current turn is t1=8, and we start at (0,5). \n\nThe problem says: \"current turn is {t_1}\" and then the state is given at turn t1. So we are at the beginning of turn8 at (0,5). Then we provide actions for turn8, turn9, etc.\n\nSo the above sequence is for H=5.\n\nBut let me confirm the last turn: at turn12, we are at y=9, and we do S. Then we are done.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=5.\n\nBut note: the minimal number of moves to get from 5 to 9 is 4, but we need one extra action to account for the requirement that we are at 9 at the turn after the last move? But the requirement is to be at 9 at the turn index t1+H-1. And with H=5, we are at 9 at turn12 (which is 8+5-1=12). So it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, could we have done:\n\n  Turn8: S -> stay at 5? Then we are at 5 at turn9. Then we do U at turn9: to 6 at turn10, etc. That would take more turns.\n\nSo not minimal.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n\nBut wait: at turn12, we are at y=9 and we do S. But the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". At turn12, we are at y=9, so no freeway, so safe.\n\nBut what if we do U at turn12? Then we try to go to 10, but it's bounded to 9, so we stay at 9. So that would also be safe. But S is clearer.\n\nThe problem doesn't specify that we have to stay at 9, only that we reach it. So either is acceptable. But S is explicitly staying.\n\nSo we can do S.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on freeway5 at turn8: \n  The car is (-18, -29, right, 6). \n  For a right-moving car, the initial span at t1=8 is [tail, head]? The problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\". And the table gives (head, tail). So head=-18, tail=-29? Then the span is [tail, head] = [-29, -18]. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway2: \n  The car (0, -11, right, 12): head=0, tail=-11. Then the initial span at t1=8 is [tau, h] = [-11, 0]. So 0 is included? \n  But we are not on freeway2 at turn8.\n\nBut note: if we were on freeway2 at turn8, then we would collide. But we are at y=5.\n\nSimilarly, at turn9: \n  freeway2: \n      (48,37,right,12): at turn9: [37+12*(1), 48+12*(1)] = [49,60] -> 0 not in.\n      (-36,-47,right,12): [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24] -> 0 not in.\n      (0,-11,right,12): [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway2 at turn9 is safe? But we are not on it.\n\nWe are on freeway6 at turn9: safe.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nTherefore, we output the sequence.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) is 5. The sequence of actions ensures the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) by turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 12\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n- **Turn 8 (current turn)**: The player is at \\(y = 5\\).

Action \\(S\\) (stay) keeps the player at \\(y = 9\\) at turn 13.  \n  - No collision check needed as \\(y = 9\\) has no freeway.\n\nAt turn 12 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 8 + 5 - 1 = 12\\)), the player is at \\((0, 9)\\), satisfying the goal. The sequence minimizes \\(H\\) as moving directly upward is the shortest path, and fewer than 5 actions cannot reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 11 (since each action changes \\(y\\) by at most 1, and starting at \\(y = 5\\), 4 actions reach \\(y = 9\\) only by turn 12, requiring a fifth action to satisfy \\(y_{12} = 9\\)).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,6) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 9. I must output a sequence of actions starting from turn t_1.\n\nThe player moves vertically: up (U) increases y by 1, down (D) decreases by 1, or stay (S) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, each with multiple cars defined by head, tail, direction, and speed. Direction is either left or right, but in the car state, it's given as \"right\" or \"left\"? Looking at the table, all are \"right\" in this case. Let me check:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 3) — direction is right.\n\nFreeway 2: (60,49, right,12), (-24,-35,right,12), (12,1,right,12) — all right.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 3 and 4 have the same cars? No, let's see: freeway 2,3,4 all have identical car lists: (60,49,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12), (12,1,right,12). That seems odd, but I'll take it as is.\n\nFreeway 5: (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5, (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: (-12,-23,right,4)\n\nFreeway 8: (-12,-23,right,4)\n\nAll cars are moving right, meaning they're increasing in position over time.\n\nCar update for right-moving: span at time T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)], where at t_1, span is [τ, h]? Let me read carefully.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\nFor right-moving car: at turn t_1, span is [τ, h] with τ < h? In the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nIn the table, for example, (60,49,right,12). If head is 60 and tail is 49, and direction right, since head > tail, so span is from tail to head, so [49,60] at t_1.\n\nSimilarly, (-24,-35,right,12): head -24, tail -35, since -24 > -35, so span [-35,-24] at t_1.\n\n(12,1,right,12): [1,12] at t_1.\n\nFor freeway 1: (-36,-47,right,3): head -36, tail -47, -36 > -47, so span [-47,-36] at t_1.\n\nFreeway 5: (-12,-23,right,6): head -12, tail -23, -12 > -23, span [-23,-12] at t_1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, at time T, for right-moving car, span becomes [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince it's moving right, positions increase.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on that freeway y_T, and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at time T.\n\nImportant point: if the player moves to y_{T+1} at turn T, they are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, only at turn T+1. So for collision, at turn T, we only care about cars on y_T.\n\nThe condition is: collision at turn T if y_T is the freeway, and 0 is in span of some car on that freeway at time T.\n\nAnd 0 is the x-position, I assume, since player is at (0, y).\n\nPlayer is always at x=0, moving vertically.\n\nNow, t_1 = 9, player at y=6.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H, so I should go up as much as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nSince I start at y=6, and need to go to y=9, that's 3 steps up, so minimum H=3 if no collisions, but I need to check for each turn where I am, and if at that position, at that time, there is a car on that row whose span covers 0.\n\nSince I move at turn t, the position y_{t} is where I am at the beginning of turn t, I think.\n\nLet's see the update: at turn t, I perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, and y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\ny_{t_1} is given as 6, so at turn t_1, I am at (0,6).\n\nThen I perform action a_{t_1}, which sets y_{t_1 + 1}, and so on, until y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nFor collision: at turn T, I am at position y_T, and collision occurs if for that y_T, at time T, there is a car on freeway y_T with 0 in its span at time T.\n\nTime T is the turn number.\n\nt_1 = 9.\n\nNow, let's list the cars for each freeway at t_1=9.\n\nFirst, for freeway k, the cars.\n\nI need to compute for each future turn, for each freeway, whether there is a car covering x=0.\n\nBut since I only care when I am on that freeway, I can compute for each row, at which times 0 is covered.\n\nThen for my path, when I am on row y at time t, it should not be that 0 is covered on row y at time t.\n\nSince the cars move, the coverage changes with time.\n\nLet me define the span for each car at time T relative to t_1.\n\nSet τ = T - t_1, so τ=0 at t_1.\n\nThen for a right-moving car, span at time T = [τ + s τ, h + s τ] where τ = T - t_1.\n\nSince τ = T - t_1, and s is speed.\n\nFor car on freeway, at time T, span is [τ + s (T - t_1), h + s (T - t_1)] for right-moving.\n\nWith the head and tail at t_1.\n\nSimilarly for left, but all are right here.\n\nNow, 0 is in span if min(span) ≤ 0 ≤ max(span).\n\nSince for right-moving, tail ≤ head, so min is tail, max is head, so tail + s (T - t_1) ≤ 0 ≤ head + s (T - t_1)\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all right.\n\nNow, let's list all freeways and their cars.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: head=-36, tail=-47, s=3, right.\n\nSo at time T, span: [ -47 + 3*(T-9), -36 + 3*(T-9) ]\n\n0 in span if -47 + 3*(T-9) ≤ 0 ≤ -36 + 3*(T-9)\n\nSet u = T-9, so for u ≥ 0.\n\n-47 + 3u ≤ 0 ≤ -36 + 3u\n\nSolve inequalities:\n\nFirst: -47 + 3u ≤ 0 => 3u ≤ 47 => u ≤ 47/3 ≈ 15.666, so u ≤ 15 since integer? T integer, u integer.\n\nT is turn, so integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 ≤ -36 + 3u => 3u ≥ 36 => u ≥ 12\n\nSo for u from 12 to 15 inclusive.\n\nu=12,13,14,15.\n\nT = t_1 + u = 9 + u, so T=21,22,23,24.\n\nFor freeway 1, 0 covered at T=21,22,23,24.\n\nBut freeway 1 is y=1.\n\nNow, freeway 2: three cars.\n\nFirst car: head=60, tail=49, s=12, right.\n\nSpan at T: [49 + 12u, 60 + 12u] where u=T-9\n\n0 in span? 49 + 12u ≤ 0 ≤ 60 + 12u\n\nBut 49 + 12u ≥ 49 >0 for u≥0, so min >0, so 0 never ≤ min, so never covered. Similarly, max=60+12u>0, but min>0 so 0 not in span. So no collision possible from this car.\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway 2: head=-24, tail=-35, s=12, right.\n\nSpan: [-35 + 12u, -24 + 12u]\n\n0 in span if -35 +12u ≤ 0 ≤ -24 +12u\n\nSo -35 +12u ≤ 0 => 12u ≤ 35 => u ≤ 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so u≤2\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -24 +12u => 12u ≥24 => u≥2\n\nSo u=2\n\nT=9+2=11\n\nThird car on freeway 2: head=12, tail=1, s=12, right.\n\nSpan: [1 +12u, 12 +12u]\n\n0 in span: 1+12u ≤ 0 ≤ 12+12u\n\n1+12u ≤0? 12u ≤ -1, impossible since u≥0. So min=1+12u≥1>0, so 0 not in span. Never.\n\nSo for freeway 2, only possible collision at T=11 from the second car.\n\ny=2 at that time.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? Cars are identical: (60,49,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12), (12,1,right,12)\n\nSo same as above, only possible collision at T=11 on y=3.\n\nFreeway 4: same cars, so only possible collision at T=11 on y=4.\n\nNow freeway 5: one car: head=-12, tail=-23, s=6, right.\n\nSpan: [-23 +6u, -12 +6u]\n\n0 in span if -23+6u ≤0 ≤ -12+6u\n\n-23+6u ≤0 => 6u ≤23 => u≤23/6≈3.833, u≤3\n\n0 ≤ -12+6u => 6u ≥12 => u≥2\n\nSo u=2,3\n\nT=11,12\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same car, head=-12,tail=-23,s=6,right, so same, collision at T=11,12 on y=6.\n\nFreeway 6 is y=6.\n\nNow freeway 7: head=-12,tail=-23,s=4,right.\n\nSpan: [-23 +4u, -12 +4u]\n\n0 in span: -23+4u ≤0 ≤ -12+4u\n\n-23+4u ≤0 => 4u≤23 => u≤5.75, u≤5\n\n0≤ -12+4u => 4u≥12 => u≥3\n\nSo u=3,4,5\n\nT=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 8: same, head=-12,tail=-23,s=4,right, so collision at T=12,13,14 on y=8.\n\nNow, summarize for each row and time when 0 is covered:\n\ny=1: covered at T=21,22,23,24\n\nBut we start from T=9, and we want to reach y=9 quickly, so T=21+ is late, probably not relevant for minimal path.\n\ny=2: covered only at T=11 (from freeway 2 car)\n\ny=3: covered at T=11 (from freeway 3 car)\n\ny=4: covered at T=11 (from freeway 4 car)\n\ny=5: no cars? Freeway 5 has a car, but y=5 is covered at T=11,12\n\nFreeway 5: y=5, covered at T=11,12\n\ny=6: covered at T=11,12 (from freeway 6 car)\n\ny=7: covered at T=12,13,14 (freeway 7)\n\ny=8: covered at T=12,13,14 (freeway 8)\n\ny=9: no freeway, since freeways 1-8, y=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nPlayer starts at y=6 at T=9.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, we just need to get there.\n\nBut we might need to avoid rows when they are covered.\n\nAt T=9, player is at y=6.\n\ny=6 is covered at T=11 and 12, but at T=9, is it covered?\n\nAt T=9, u=0.\n\nFor y=6, freeway 6 car: span at u=0: [-23, -12], min=-23, max=-12, both negative, so 0 not in span, so safe at T=9.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nNow, we can move up, down, or stay.\n\nMinimal steps to y=9: from 6 to 9, need +3, so 3 up moves, but might have to delay if collision.\n\nFirst, if we go straight up: actions U,U,U.\n\nThen sequence:\n\nAt T=9, y=6, action U, so y_{10} =7\n\nAt T=10, y=7, action U, so y_{11}=8\n\nAt T=11, y=8, action U, so y_{12}=9, done.\n\nNow, check collisions.\n\nAt each turn T, we are at y_T, and check if on that row, at time T, 0 is covered.\n\nT=9: y=6, row y=6 at T=9: as above, u=0, span [-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=10: y=7, row y=7 at T=10.\n\nFreeway 7: car with s=4, at u=T-9=1\n\nSpan: [-23 +4*1, -12 +4*1] = [-19, -8], min=-19, max=-8, both <0, so 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=11: y=8, row y=8 at T=11.\n\nFreeway 8: car with s=4, u=2\n\nSpan: [-23 +4*2, -12 +4*2] = [-23+8, -12+8] = [-15, -4], both negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at T=11, we move to y=9? In the sequence:\n\nAfter action at T=11, y_{12}=9, so at T=11 we are at y=8, and we perform action U to go to y=9.\n\nThen at T=12, we would be at y=9, but since y=9 has no cars, and we reach y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, H=3 turns: actions at t=9,10,11 to go to y=7,8,9.\n\nAt T=12, we are at y=9, but we don't need to be there at T=12 for the position, the position is set after action.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position y_T.\n\nWe perform action a_T, which sets y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for T from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and after H actions, y_{t_1 + H} =9? No.\n\nStart: at turn t_1, position y_{t_1} =6.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy\n\nSimilarly, after a_{t_1 +1}, y_{t_1 +2}, and so on, until y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nThe position after H actions is y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H -1}? Let's see the problem.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\n\" such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAnd the actions are from t= t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, with H actions, we go from y_{t_1} to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\ny_{t_1 + H} = y_{t_1} after H actions.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of the position at the start of each turn.\n\nAt the start of turn t_1, position y_{t_1} =6.\n\nWe perform action a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nThen at start of turn t_1 +1, position y_{t_1 +1}, perform a_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nAfter performing the last action at turn t_1 + H -1, we set y_{t_1 + H}, but we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is the position at the start of turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter performing action at t_1 + H -1, we set y_{t_1 + H}, but for the position to be 9 at the start of turn t_1 + H -1, that means before performing the action at that turn.\n\nThe condition is that at turn t_1 + H -1, the position is (0,9), so y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAt that turn, we may or may not perform an action, but since we reach it, we don't need to move further.\n\nThe actions are up to t_1 + H -1, and at that point, y is already 9.\n\nFor example, if we start at y=6, and we do nothing, but we need to reach 9, so we need actions.\n\nSuppose H=3, actions at t=9,10,11.\n\nThen:\n\nAfter a9, y10 = y9 + Δy9\n\nAfter a10, y11 = y10 + Δy10\n\nAfter a11, y12 = y11 + Δy11\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{11} =9? t1=9, H=3, t1 + H -1 =9+3-1=11, so y11=9.\n\nIn the sequence, after action at t=11, we set y12, but we need y11=9.\n\ny11 is set by action at t=10.\n\nLet's clarify:\n\n- At start of turn t=9: y9=6\n\n- Perform a9, set y10 = y9 + Δy9\n\n- Start of turn t=10: y10\n\n- Perform a10, set y11 = y10 + Δy10\n\n- Start of turn t=11: y11\n\n- Perform a11, set y12 = y11 + Δy11\n\nWe need y11 =9, at the start of turn t=11.\n\nSo for H=3, we need to have y11=9.\n\nThat means after two actions, from t=9 and t=10, we reach y11=9.\n\nStart from y9=6.\n\nAfter a9, y10 =6 + Δy9\n\nThen after a10, y11 = y10 + Δy10 = (6 + Δy9) + Δy10\n\nSet this to 9.\n\nSimilarly, with H actions from t=t1 to t1+H-1, we set y_{t1+1} to y_{t1+H}, and y_{t1+H-1} is the position at start of turn t1+H-1.\n\nFor y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nIn terms of steps: from y_{t1} to y_{t1+H-1}, it takes (H-1) actions? Let's count.\n\ny_{t1} to y_{t1+1} with one action, to y_{t1+2} with two actions, ..., to y_{t1+k} with k actions.\n\nSo to reach y_{t1+H-1}, it takes (H-1) actions? No.\n\nFrom y_{t1} to y_{t1+1} : one action (at t1)\n\nFrom y_{t1} to y_{t1+2} : two actions (at t1 and t1+1)\n\nGenerally, to reach y_{t1+k}, it takes k actions from t1 to t1+k-1.\n\nSet y_{t1+k} after k actions.\n\nBut we need y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nSo let k = H-1, then y_{t1 + (H-1)} =9, which is reached after (H-1) actions from t1 to t1 + (H-2)? Messy.\n\nDefine m = H-1, so we need to reach y_{t1 + m} =9 with m actions from t1 to t1+m-1.\n\nThen H = m+1.\n\nEasier to think the number of turns to move.\n\nFrom y=6 to y=9, need to increase by 3, so minimum 3 up moves, taking 3 turns, with H=3, y_{11} =9.\n\nActions at t=9,10,11 to set y10,y11,y12, but we need y11=9.\n\nSo with actions at t=9 and t=10, we set y10 and y11.\n\ny11 must be 9.\n\nSimilarly, for minimal H, since we need to go to 9, H at least 3.\n\nNow back to the straight up path.\n\nAt T=9, y=6, safe as we saw.\n\nWe perform action, say U, so y10=7.\n\nAt T=10, y=7, position (0,7) at time T=10.\n\nCheck freeway 7 at T=10: u=1, span [-23+4*1, -12+4*1] = [-19,-8], 0 not in, safe.\n\nWe can do U, so y11=8.\n\nAt T=11, y=8, position (0,8) at time T=11.\n\nFreeway 8 at T=11: u=2, span [-23+4*2, -12+4*2] = [-15,-4], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen we need y11=9, so at T=11, we must have y11=9, so we need to set it to 9 with action at T=11? But at T=11, we are at y11, and we perform action to set y12, but y11 is already set.\n\nTo have y11=9, we must reach it by action at T=10.\n\nIn the sequence for H=3:\n\nActions at t=9,10,11.\n\nAfter a9, y10 = y9 + Δy9 =6 + Δy9\n\nAfter a10, y11 = y10 + Δy10 = (6 + Δy9) + Δy10\n\nSet y11=9.\n\nThen after a11, y12 = y11 + Δy11, but we don't care about y12, as long as y11=9.\n\nIn terms of collision, at each turn T, when we are at position y_T, we check for collision at that time.\n\nFor T=9: y9=6, safe\n\nT=10: y10, which depends on a9\n\nT=11: y11, which depends on previous actions.\n\nIn the straight up:\n\nSuppose a9 = U, so y10 =7\n\nThen at T=10, y=7, which is safe as above.\n\nThen a10 = U, so y11=8\n\nAt T=11, y=8, which is safe as above.\n\nBut we need y11=9, but y11=8, so not yet 9.\n\nThen at T=11, we need to set y11=9, but y11 is already 8, we can do U, but action at T=11 sets y12, not y11.\n\ny11 is the position at start of T=11, which is 8, and we perform a11 to set y12.\n\nBut we need y11 to be 9, which it is not.\n\nFor H=3, we need y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{11} =9.\n\nWith actions at t=9 and t=10, we set y11.\n\nSo from y9=6, we need to reach y11=9 with two actions: at t=9 and t=10.\n\nSo Δy9 + Δy10 = 3, so both U, or other combinations, but since we want min time, both U.\n\nSo a9=U, a10=U, then y10=7, y11=8? y10 = y9 + Δy9 =6 +1 =7 (if U)\n\nThen y11 = y10 + Δy10 =7 +1 =8 if U.\n\ny11=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y11=9, we need to go from 6 to 9 in two steps, which requires Δy9 + Δy10 =3, so both U, but each U gives +1, so y10=7, y11=8, not 9.\n\nMaximum increase per step is 1, so from 6, after one action, y10 <=7, after two actions, y11 <=8, cannot reach 9 in two actions from 6.\n\ny9=6, after a9, y10=6,7, or 5\n\nThen after a10, y11 = y10 + Δy10, so if y10=7, y11=6,7,8; not 9.\n\nIf y10=6, y11=5,6,7; etc. No way to have y11=9 from y9=6 in two actions.\n\nThus, minimum H must be at least 4.\n\nWith H=4, actions at t=9,10,11,12? t1 + H -1 = t1 +3 for H=4.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} = y_{9+4-1} = y_{12} =9\n\nActions at t=9,10,11 to set y10,y11,y12, and y12=9.\n\nBut we need y_{12}=9.\n\nFrom y9=6, to y12=9, need +3 in three steps, so possible with three U.\n\nNow, with H=4, y_{12}=9.\n\nIn terms of turns: actions at t=9,10,11.\n\nThen positions:\n\nT=9: y9=6\n\nAfter a9, y10\n\nT=10: y10\n\nAfter a10, y11\n\nT=11: y11\n\nAfter a11, y12\n\nAnd y12=9.\n\nCollision checked at each T for y_T.\n\nFor minimal H, H=4 seems possible if we can go up directly.\n\nNow, in direct path: a9=U, so y10=7\n\nT=10, y=7, which is safe as before (at u=1, span [-19,-8], safe)\n\na10=U, y11=8\n\nT=11, y=8, at u=2 for y=8, span [-15,-4], safe\n\na11=U, y12=9, and y=9 no cars.\n\nBut at T=11, y=8, we do U to set y12=9.\n\nNow, is there any collision? T=9 y=6 safe, T=10 y=7 safe, T=11 y=8 safe.\n\nBut earlier I thought about coverage at T=11 and 12 for other rows, but not relevant.\n\ny=6 is covered at T=11 and 12, but at T=9 and 10, we are not on y=6 except at T=9 which is safe.\n\nAt T=9, y=6, u=0, safe.\n\nAt T=10, we are at y=7, not on y=6.\n\nSimilarly, at T=11, we are at y=8.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut in this case, we reach y12=9 at T=12, but the position at T=11 is y11=8, not 9.\n\nWith H=4, y_{12}=9.\n\nBut is there a way with H=3? We saw it's impossible because we cannot reach y=9 from y=6 in two steps.\n\nMinimal H is 4.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn.\n\nt1=9, we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nWith H=4, t1 + H -1 =9+4-1=12, so y12=9.\n\nActions at t=9,10,11 to achieve this.\n\nIn the sequence, we output actions for t=9 to t=11.\n\nNow, but in the direct path, it works, but let's check if at some point we might be on a covered row.\n\nIn this case, no.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=6 covered at T=11,12, but we are not there at those times.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nBut at T=11, y=8 is safe.\n\nHowever, let's see freeway 8 at T=11: u=2, span [-15,-4], safe.\n\nBut what about T=12? We don't care, since at T=12, if we are at y=9, no cars.\n\nIn this path, we are never on a covered row at the wrong time.\n\nBut is there a problem with other rows?\n\nFor example, if we stayed, but we don't.\n\nAnother thing: at T=10, y=7, freeway 7 at T=10: u=1, span [-19,-8], safe.\n\nBut freeway 7 is covered at T=12,13,14, but we are there at T=10, which is not covered.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut the player is at (0,y) and cars are on the row, but x=0.\n\nIn this case, seems fine.\n\nBut let's see the car on y=6 at T=11.\n\nAt T=11, u=2, for y=6, freeway 6 car: s=6, span [-23 +6*2, -12 +6*2] = [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11, 0]\n\nMin=-11, max=0, so 0 is in span? -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nOh! I think I missed this.\n\nFor freeway 6 at T=11, u=2, span [-23 +12, -12 +12] = [-11, 0], so 0 is in [ -11, 0 ], yes, since tail + s u = -23 +12 = -11, head + s u = -12 +12 =0.\n\nSo 0 ≤ 0, which is true, so 0 is covered at T=11 on y=6.\n\nSimilarly, at T=12, u=3, [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6], 0 in [ -5,6], yes.\n\nBut in our path, at T=11, we are at y=8, not y=6, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, at T=10, y=7, freeway 7 at T=10: u=1, span [-23+4, -12+4] = [-19,-8], 0 not in.\n\nAt T=11, y=8, freeway 8: u=2, [-23+8, -12+8] = [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nBut in the direct path with H=4, it should work.\n\nBut H=4, actions at t=9,10,11: U,U,U\n\ny10=7, y11=8, y12=9\n\nCollisions: T=9 y=6 safe, T=10 y=7 safe, T=11 y=8 safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is there a way with H=3? We cannot, as we need to increase by 3, but from t=9 to t=11, we go from y9 to y11 with two actions, y11 <=8<9, cannot reach 9.\n\nIf we start by staying or down, but that would take more turns, worse.\n\nSo minimal H is 4.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier, but no.\n\nPerhaps at t=9, we can go down or something, but that would make it longer.\n\nSo U,U,U with H=4.\n\nBut in the action sequence, for H=4, we have three actions: at t=9,10,11.\n\nt from t1 to t1+H-1, so for H=4, actions at t=9,10,11.\n\nOutput:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +2: a_{t_1+2} = U  // since t1+ H-1 = t1+3 for H=4? H=4, t1+H-1 =9+4-1=12, but actions up to t=11.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn the answer format: \"a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\"\n\nSo for t=0: a_{t1}, t=1: a_{t1+1}, ..., t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nThen after these actions, y_{t1 + H} should be? No.\n\nAfter performing a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, we set y_{t1+1} to y_{t1+H}.\n\nAnd we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is set by the actions up to a_{t1 + H -2}.\n\nFor example, H=4, actions at t=t1, t1+1, t1+2 (since t from 0 to H-1=3, so t=0,1,2,3? t=0 to H-1, so for H=4, t=0,1,2,3? Index.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so actions: a_{t1 + 0}, a_{t1 +1}, ..., a_{t1 + H-1}\n\nFor H=4, actions at t=9,10,11,12? t1=9, H=4, actions at 9+0=9, 9+1=10, 9+2=11, 9+3=12? 9 + (H-1) =9+3=12.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so for H=4, t=0,1,2,3, so actions at t1+0, t1+1, t1+2, t1+3.\n\nThen after these, we have set y_{t1+1} to y_{t1+4}.\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{9+4-1} = y_{12} =9.\n\nWith actions at t=9,10,11,12, we set y10,y11,y12,y13.\n\nTo have y12=9, we need the actions up to a11 to set y12.\n\nAction at t sets y_{t+1}.\n\nSo action at t=9 sets y10\n\na10 sets y11\n\na11 sets y12\n\na12 sets y13\n\nFor y12 to be 9, it is set by a11.\n\nWe need y12=9, so with actions from a9 to a11, we can set y10,y11,y12.\n\nSpecifically, a11 sets y12.\n\nBut y12=9.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, for H=4, we have actions at t=9,10,11,12? But we only need up to a11 to set y12.\n\nThe action at t=12 would set y13, but since we already reached y12=9, we might not need it, but the sequence must have exactly H actions.\n\nWe need to specify H actions to reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn this case, with H=4, we need four actions, but we can have a12 do nothing, for example.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nTo minimize H, we should not have extra actions.\n\nWith three actions, we can reach y12=9.\n\nActions at t=9,10,11: a9 sets y10, a10 sets y11, a11 sets y12.\n\nSet y12=9.\n\ny9=6, so we need to go from 6 to 9 in three steps: from y10 to y12, with three actions, but y10, y11, y12 set.\n\ny10 = y9 + Δa9\n\ny11 = y10 + Δa10\n\ny12 = y11 + Δa11\n\nSo y12 = y9 + Δa9 + Δa10 + Δa11\n\nSet to 9, y9=6, so Δa9 + Δa10 + Δa11 =3, so all U.\n\nThen y10=7, y11=8, y12=9.\n\nCollisions: at T=9, y9=6, safe\n\nT=10, y10=7, safe (freeway 7 at T=10: u=1, span[-19,-8], safe)\n\nT=11, y11=8, safe (freeway 8 at T=11: u=2, span[-15,-4], safe)\n\nThen at T=12, we are at y12=9, no cars, but we don't check collision for T=12 since we are at y=9, and the position is reached.\n\nThe collision is only when we are on freeway 1-8.\n\nAt T=12, y=9, no freeway, so no issue.\n\nWith H=3 actions: at t=9,10,11, we reach y12=9.\n\nt1+H-1 = t1+3-1=11? H=3, t1+H-1=9+3-1=11, y11=9.\n\nBut with three actions, we can set y11.\n\ny11 = y9 + Δa9 + Δa10\n\nSet to 9, so Δa9 + Δa10 =3, impossible since each Δy <=1.\n\nSo cannot reach y11=9 from y9=6 with two actions.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 4, with actions at t=9,10,11, reaching y12=9.\n\nAnd in this case, the path is direct U,U,U.\n\nBut earlier I thought about coverage, but in this path, no collision.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point we are on a covered row.\n\nFor example, at T=10, y=7, freeway 7 covered at T=12,13,14, but at T=10, not covered.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut is there a problem with y=6 at T=11? Covered, but we are not there.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nBut let's see if we can do it faster, but no.\n\nPerhaps we can go up slower to avoid, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: the player can stay or go down, but that would increase H, not minimal.\n\nSo minimal H=4.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 2,3,4, there is a car that covers at T=11 for y=2,3,4.\n\nBut we are not on those rows at that time.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think U,U,U is safe.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nt1=9\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nThen y12=9.\n\nH=4, but the sequence has three actions? For H=4, we need four actions?\n\nI'm confused about H.\n\nDefine H as the number of turns from t1 to the reach turn.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nWith actions from t=t1 to t=t1 + H -1.\n\nEach action corresponds to a turn.\n\nFor example, to reach at turn T, with y_T=9.\n\nFrom start turn t1, to reach at turn T, it takes (T - t1) actions, from t=t1 to t=T-1.\n\nThen y_T is set by action at T-1.\n\nAnd y_T=9.\n\nThe reach turn is T = t1 + H -1.\n\nSo the number of actions is (T - t1) = (t1 + H -1 - t1) = H-1.\n\nActions at t from t1 to (t1 + H -1) -1 = t1 + H -2? Let's set T = t1 + H -1, the reach turn.\n\nThen y_T =9.\n\nTo reach y_T, we need actions from t=t1 to t=T-1, number of actions: (T-1) - t1 +1 = T - t1.\n\nSince T = t1 + H -1, so T - t1 = (t1 + H -1) - t1 = H-1.\n\nSo number of actions is H-1.\n\nFor example, start at t1, y_t1 given.\n\nAfter one action at t1, we set y_{t1+1}, but y_{t1+1} may not be 9.\n\nTo have y_T=9, we need actions at t=t1, t1+1, ..., T-1.\n\nThat's (T - t1) actions.\n\nAnd T = t1 + H -1, so actions from t=t1 to t= (t1 + H -1) -1 = t1 + H -2? t from t1 to T-1, T-1 = (t1 + H -1) -1 = t1 + H -2.\n\nFor H=4, T = t1 +4-1 = t1+3\n\nActions at t=t1, t1+1, t1+2 (since to T-1=t1+2)\n\nThen y_{t1+3} set by action at t1+2.\n\nAnd y_{t1+3} =9.\n\nNumber of actions: 3 for H=4.\n\nIn general, H actions? No.\n\nThe answer format says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nThen after these actions, we have set y_{t1+1} to y_{t1+H}.\n\nAnd we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, with H actions, we set y_{t1+1} to y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe need y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, y_{t1+H-1} is set by the (H-1)-th action? Let's index.\n\nAfter action a_{t1+0}, set y_{t1+1}\n\nAfter a_{t1+1}, set y_{t1+2}\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t1 + k}, set y_{t1 + k +1}\n\nAfter the last action a_{t1 + H-1}, set y_{t1 + H}\n\nNow, we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is set by action a_{t1 + H -2}, for H>1.\n\nFor example, to have y_{t1+H-1} =9, it is set by a_{t1 + H -2}.\n\nIn the sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1, a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, the action a_{t1 + H -2} sets y_{t1 + H -1}, and a_{t1 + H -1} sets y_{t1 + H}, which may be anything.\n\nFor minimal H, we can choose a_{t1 + H -1} to be S, for example, but we need to specify the action.\n\nIn this case, for our path, with t1=9, to reach y12=9, we need H such that t1 + H -1 =12, so 9 + H -1 =12, H-1=3, H=4.\n\nThen actions at t=9,10,11,12? For t from 0 to H-1=3, so t=0,1,2,3: actions at 9,10,11,12.\n\nBut to set y12=9, we can have a11 set y12=9, and a12 can be S, setting y13=9 or something.\n\nBut y13 is not needed.\n\nTo avoid extra action, with H=4, we have four actions, but we only need three to reach y12=9.\n\nWith actions at t=9,10,11, we set y10,y11,y12, and we can have y12=9.\n\nThen for H=4, we need to include a12, which sets y13, but we can set it to S, so y13=9, but we don't care.\n\nBut the position at t1+H-1=12 is y12, which is 9.\n\nIn the sequence, we can have a12=S or U, but since y12=9, U would go to 10, invalid, so S.\n\nBut let's see if we can have H smaller.\n\nWith H=3, t1+H-1=11, y11=9.\n\nBut from y9=6, to y11=9, impossible as we need +3 in two steps, max +2.\n\nSo H=4 is minimal.\n\nNow for the sequence with H=4: actions at t=9,10,11,12.\n\nWe can have:\n\na9 = U, set y10=7\n\na10 = U, set y11=8\n\na11 = U, set y12=9\n\na12 = S, set y13=9, but not necessary.\n\nThen at turn t=12, we are at y12=9, which is the position.\n\nCollision check at each turn.\n\nT=9: y9=6, safe\n\nT=10: y10=7, safe\n\nT=11: y11=8, safe\n\nT=12: y12=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nWith a12=S, no problem.\n\nBut we can have only three actions if we define H properly, but the problem requires H actions.\n\nPerhaps for the reach turn, with three actions, we can have y11= something, but not 9.\n\nSo I think H=4 is correct.\n\nAnother way: suppose we go up in three steps, but start earlier, but we start at t=9.\n\nPerhaps stay at some point, but not necessary.\n\nSo I think U,U,U and then S for the last action, but we can have the last action be U to reach, but in this case with a11=U setting y12=9, and a12=S.\n\nBut let's output the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, for t=0 to H-1, with H=4.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t1: a9 = U\n\nTurn t1+1: a10 = U\n\nTurn t1+2: a11 = U\n\nTurn t1+3: a12 = S  // since at t=12, we are already at y12=9, we can stay.\n\nBut we need to specify.\n\nPerhaps we can have a12 not needed, but we must include H actions.\n\nTo save, but H is minimal turns, meaning minimal number of actions or minimal time to reach?\n\nThe problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and \"sequence of actions for t=0 to H-1\".\n\nI think H is the number of actions.\n\n\"minimal number of turns H\" and \"sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\"\n\nSo H is the number of actions.\n\nThen with H actions, we set y_{t1+1} to y_{t1+H}.\n\nAnd we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, with H=3 actions: a9,a10,a11\n\nSet y10, y11, y12.\n\nWe need y_{11} =9? t1 + H -1 =9+3-1=11, so y11=9.\n\nBut with actions, y11 is set by a10.\n\ny11 = y10 + Δa10, and y10 = y9 + Δa9 =6 + Δa9\n\nSo y11 = 6 + Δa9 + Δa10\n\nSet to 9, so Δa9 + Δa10 =3, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, if H=4 actions: a9,a10,a11,a12\n\nSet y10,y11,y12,y13\n\nNeed y_{t1+H-1} = y_{9+4-1} = y_{12} =9\n\nSo y12=9.\n\ny12 is set by a11.\n\ny12 = y11 + Δa11\n\nBut y11 = y10 + Δa10, etc.\n\nFrom y9=6, after three actions a9,a10,a11, we set y12.\n\ny12 = y9 + Δa9 + Δa10 + Δa11 =6 + Δa9 + Δa10 + Δa11\n\nSet to 9, so Δa9 + Δa10 + Δa11 =3, all U.\n\nThen y10=7, y11=8, y12=9.\n\nThen with a12, we need to set something, but we have to include a12.\n\nWe can set a12=S, so y13=9.\n\nThen at turn T=12, position y12=9, which is good.\n\nCollisions as before.\n\nIn the sequence, a12 can be S.\n\nNow, but at T=11, y11=8, which is safe.\n\nIs there any reason to not go direct? For example, if we go to y=9 earlier, but we can't.\n\nPerhaps avoid being on certain rows at certain times, but in this case, no issue.\n\nBut let's check freeway 5 at T=11 and 12.\n\ny=5 covered at T=11,12, but we are not on y=5.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the car state for freeway 2,3,4 at T=11, y=2,3,4 are covered, but we are on y=8 at T=11.\n\ny=8 at T=11 is safe.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's list all coverage times again.\n\nAt T=11:\n\n- y=2 covered (from freeway 2 car)\n\n- y=3 covered (freeway 3)\n\n- y=4 covered (freeway 4)\n\n- y=5 covered (freeway 5)\n\n- y=6 covered (freeway 6)\n\nBut y=7 at T=11: freeway 7 at T=11, u=2, span [-23+8, -12+8] = [-15,-4], 0 not in, safe.\n\ny=8 at T=11: [-15,-4], safe.\n\nIn our path, at T=11, we are at y=8, safe.\n\nAt T=10, y=7, safe.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be U, U, U, S for the actions.\n\nBut the last S is not necessary, but we have to include it for H=4.\n\nPerhaps we can reach with H=3 by going down or something, but that would take longer.\n\nFor example, at t=9, go down to y=5, then up, but y=5 covered at T=11,12, and at T=10, if we are at y=5, etc., it might be worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo minimal H=4 with actions U,U,U,S.\n\nBut in the sequence, for t=0,1,2,3: a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=S.\n\nThen output.\n\nBut let's see if we can have only three actions with different H.\n\nSuppose we define H such that with three actions, we reach at turn 11, but y11=9 impossible.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps the player can move faster, but no, only one step per turn.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\nBut in the answer format, we need to box the sequence.\n\nSo for t1=9:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nBut H=4, turns from t1 to t1+3.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 1, but it's at late time, not relevant.\n\nAnother thing: the car on freeway 7 and 8 at later times, but we are not there.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The minimum vertical distance to cover is 3 units (from \\(y = 6\\) to \\(y = 9\\)), requiring at least 3 \"up\" (U) actions. However, due to the game dynamics, reaching \\(y = 9\\) in exactly 3 actions is impossible because:\n  - After one action (at turn 9), \\(y_{10} \\leq 7\\).\n  - After two actions (at turns 9 and 10), \\(y_{11} \\leq 8\\).\n  - Thus, \\(y_{11} = 9\\) cannot be achieved, so \\(H = 3\\) is insufficient.\n- The minimal \\(H\\) is 4, achieved with three \"up\" actions and one \"stay\" (S) action to reach \\(y_{12} = 9\\). The sequence must satisfy \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{12} = 9\\).\n- Collision avoidance:\n  - At turn 9 (\\(y = 6\\)): Freeway 6 car span at \\(u = T - 9 = 0\\) is \\([-23, -12]\\), 0 not in span, safe.\n  - At turn 10 (\\(y = 7\\)): Freeway 7 car span at \\(u = 1\\) is \\([-19, -8]\\), 0 not in span, safe.\n  - At turn 11 (\\(y = 8\\)): Freeway 8 car span at \\(u = 2\\) is \\([-15, -4]\\), 0 not in span, safe.\n  - At turn 12 (\\(y = 9\\)): No freeway, safe.\n- The actions \\(U, U, U, S\\) ensure the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12 without collisions.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- \\(H = 4\\) turns (actions at turns 9, 10, 11, 12).\n- Actions:\n  - Turn 9: U (move up to \\(y = 7\\))\n  - Turn 10: U (move up to \\(y = 8\\))\n  - Turn 11: U (move up to \\(y = 9\\))\n  - Turn 12: S (stay at \\(y = 9\\), required to complete the sequence for \\(H = 4\\).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: S\n}",

The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are moving on the freeways, and I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at position 0 at that turn. The collision happens only if at turn T, I'm on freeway y_T and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nThe key point is that when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1. So I don't get hit by cars on y+1 at turn T; I only care about cars on my current y at each turn.\n\nNow, I start at y=7 at turn t_1 = 10.\n\nI need to reach y=9. Since I'm at 7, I need to go up twice to get to 9. But I might need to wait or something to avoid cars.\n\nThe minimal H should be at least 2, since I need two ups to go from 7 to 9. But let's see if that's possible or if there are cars in the way.\n\nFirst, I need to check for each freeway and each turn if there's a car at position 0.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t_1=10, and they move with constant speed.\n\nLet me denote the turns from t=10 onwards.\n\nAt turn T, for a car, its span is based on the initial span at t_1=10 and the speed.\n\nFor a car, at time t_1, head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nThen at turn T, the span changes.\n\nFor left-moving, which is decreasing x, I think? The notation says:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, it says [h, τ], and h and τ are positions, I assume.\n\nBut in the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-33, -44, right, 3)\n\nBut -33 and -44, and direction right.\n\nThen for right-moving, it says: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd for left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nI need to interpret what head and tail mean.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-33, -44, right, 3)\n\nDirection right, so it should be moving right, so increasing x.\n\nIn the right-moving case, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end, I think.\n\nBecause it says [τ, h] for right-moving, and it moves to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so τ is smaller, h is larger.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, [h, τ] with h and τ, and it moves to [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if it's moving left, decreasing x, h should be the right end or left end?\n\nIn [h, τ], if it's decreasing, and h - sΔT, τ - sΔT, so if s>0, both decrease, so the span shifts left. So [h, τ] with h > τ, I think, so that [h, τ] is from higher to lower? But typically, we write intervals with min to max.\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nLet's look at the car state.\n\nFor freeway 1: (-33, -44, right, 3)\n\n-33 and -44, with -33 > -44, since -33 is larger.\n\nDirection right, so moving right.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], and from the values, τ = -44, h = -33, since -44 < -33, so [τ, h] = [-44, -33], which makes sense, tail at -44, head at -33.\n\nThen at time T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-44 + 3(T-10), -33 + 3(T-10)]\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nIn general, for a car, at t_1, the span is from min to max position.\n\nFor right-moving, since it's moving right, τ is the left end (tail), h is the right end (head), so [left, right] = [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nFor left-moving, it would be [h, τ] with h being the head, which is the front, so for left-moving, front is left, so h < τ, I think? But in the notation, it says for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nIf it's moving left, and h is head, τ is tail, then if moving left, head should be on the left, so h < τ, and [h, τ] with h small, τ large, then [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] shifts left.\n\nIn the car states given, all directions are right, I think. Let me check.\n\nFreeway 1: right\n\nFreeway 2: all right\n\nFreeway 3: all right\n\nFreeway 4: all right\n\nFreeway 5: right\n\nFreeway 6: right\n\nFreeway 7: right\n\nFreeway 8: right\n\nAll cars are right-moving, no left-moving. So I only need the right-moving formula.\n\nFor right-moving cars:\n\nAt t_1=10, span is [τ, h] for each car, meaning [left_end, right_end] with left_end = τ, right_end = h, and τ < h.\n\nThen at turn T, span is [τ + s(T-10), h + s(T-10)]\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, I am on freeway k, and for some car on freeway k, 0 is within [τ + s(T-10), h + s(T-10)] inclusive, I assume.\n\nNow, I start at y=7 at turn 10.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe player position at turn T is y_T.\n\ny_{t} for t >=10.\n\nAt turn 10, y=7.\n\nThen based on action, y changes.\n\nI need to find actions from t=10 to some t=10+H-1 such that at turn 10+H-1, y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t=10 to t=10+H-1, that's H actions? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nThen the position after H actions: at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9? Let's see.\n\nStart at turn t_1, position given.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy\n\nSimilarly, after a_{t_1 + k}, at turn t_1 + k +1, y_{t_1 + k +1} = y_{t_1 + k} + Δy\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} is the position after H actions.\n\nBut we want to reach (0,9), so y_{t_1 + H -1} =9? Let's see the turn when we are at y=9.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\n\"such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAnd the actions from t=0 to H-1, so for t=0, action at t_1, affecting position at t_1+1.\n\nLet me set t_1 =10.\n\nAt turn 10, position (0,7)\n\nAfter action a_10, at turn 11, y_11 = y_10 + Δy_10\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{10 + k}, at turn 11+k, y_{11+k} = y_{10+k} + Δy_{10+k}\n\nThe actions are a_t for t from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, we have H new positions: from turn 11 to turn 10+H.\n\nTurn 10: initial position.\n\nAfter first action a_{t_1}, position at turn t_1+1.\n\nAfter second action a_{t_1+1}, position at turn t_1+2.\n\n...\n\nAfter H-th action a_{t_1+H-1}, position at turn t_1+H.\n\nWe want position at some turn to be (0,9), and it says \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nt_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions from t_1 to t_1, one action, then position at turn t_1+1.\n\nBut we want at turn t_1 + H -1 to be at (0,9).\n\nIf H=1, then at turn t_1 +1 -1 = t_1, we are at (0,9), but we start at (0,7), so not already there.\n\nIf H=2, actions at t_1 and t_1+1, position at turn t_1+1 and t_1+2.\n\nWe want at turn t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +1 to be at (0,9).\n\nSimilarly, for H=2, at turn t_1+1, y=9.\n\nIn general, after k actions, position at turn t_1+k.\n\nWe want at turn t_1 + H -1 to be at y=9, so after (H-1) actions, position at turn t_1 + (H-1) = (t_1 + H -1), which is exactly the turn we want to be at y=9.\n\nActions: from t=0 to H-1, a_{t_1 + t}\n\nFor t=0, a_{t_1}, which affects position at t_1+1\n\nFor t=1, a_{t_1+1}, affects position at t_1+2\n\n...\n\nFor t=H-1, a_{t_1+H-1}, affects position at t_1 + H\n\nBut we want position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nTurn t_1 + H -1 is before the last action.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, the position is determined by actions up to a_{t_1 + H -2}, I think.\n\nLet's clarify the timeline.\n\nTurn t: position y_t is given at the start of turn t.\n\nThen we choose action a_t.\n\nThen y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, and we choose a_t, then move to y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\nFor collision: at turn T, we are at y_T, and we collide if on freeway y_T, there is a car with 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nThen we choose a_T, and so on.\n\nWe start at turn t_1=10, y=7.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at some turn, say T.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H-1 actions? The problem says \"minimal number of turns H\" and \"reach at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at (0,9).\n\nAnd we have performed H actions: from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, but these actions affect positions from turn t_1+1 to turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut at turn t_1 + H -1, the position y_{t_1 + H -1} is determined by the actions before it.\n\nSpecifically, y_{t_1 + H -1} is based on a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2} for H>1, or for H=1, it would be the initial position, but we start at y=7, not 9, so H>1.\n\nLet's assume H >=2.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at turn 10 + H -1.\n\nThe actions are a_{10} to a_{10 + H -1}, which determine y_{11} to y_{10 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{10 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo for turn 10 + H -1, it is set by action a_{10 + H -2} for H>1.\n\nBut the action at t_1 + H -1 is chosen, but it affects y at t_1 + H, not at t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y_{t_1 + H -1}, which is already determined by previous actions, and we choose a_{t_1 + H -1} for the next move.\n\nBut for reaching y=9 at that turn, we don't care about the action at that turn for the position; the position is already set.\n\nThe actions sequence includes a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, but for the position at t_1 + H -1, it depends on actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2}.\n\nThe action a_{t_1 + H -1} is for moving to the next position, but since we stop when we reach, we don't need to move further, but the action is part of the sequence up to when we reach.\n\nI think I'm confusing myself.\n\nLet me read the problem again.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at (0,9).\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nFor the position at turn t_1 + H -1, it is affected by the actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2}, because a_{t_1} affects y_{t_1+1}, a_{t_1+1} affects y_{t_1+2}, ..., a_{t_1 + H -2} affects y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y_{t_1 + H -1}, and we also choose action a_{t_1 + H -1}, which affects y_{t_1 + H}, but since we have reached at turn t_1 + H -1, we don't care about y_{t_1 + H}, and the action a_{t_1 + H -1} might not be necessary, but it is part of the sequence for H turns.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at turn 10, we need H such that 10 + H -1 =10, so H=1, but at turn 10, we are at y=7, not 9, so impossible for H=1.\n\nFor H=2, we want at turn 10 +2 -1 =11 to be at y=9.\n\nActions: a_{10} and a_{11}.\n\na_{10} affects y_{11}, a_{11} affects y_{12}.\n\nSo for y_{11} to be 9, it is determined by a_{10}, since y_{11} = y_{10} + Δy_{10} = 7 + Δy_{10}, so to have y_{11}=9, we need Δy_{10} = +2, but actions only change by +1, -1, or 0, so impossible to jump to 9 in one action from 7. We can only change by 1 each action.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with |Δy_t| <=1, so from y=7, to reach y=9, it takes at least two up actions, so minimum two actions to go from 7 to 9.\n\nFor example, at turn 10, y=7, do U, y_{11}=8, then at turn 11, do U, y_{12}=9, so at turn 12, y=9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn T, with T = t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor T=12, t_1=10, so 10 + H -1 =12, thus H=3.\n\nSimilarly, if we can reach earlier.\n\nBut from 7 to 9, minimum two steps, so earliest at turn 12.\n\nAt turn 10: y=7\n\nAfter a10: y11 = 7 + Δy10\n\nAt turn 11: y11\n\nAfter a11: y12 = y11 + Δy11\n\nWe want y at some turn to be 9.\n\nIf at turn 11, y11=9, then we reached at turn 11.\n\nTurn 11 = t_1 + H -1 =10 + H -1, so 9 + H =11, H=2.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 12, y12=9, then 10 + H -1=12, H=3.\n\nWith two actions, we can reach y=9 at turn 11 or turn 12?\n\nAt turn 10, y=7.\n\nAction a10: if U, then y11=8\n\nThen at turn 11, y=8, not 9.\n\nThen action a11: U, y12=9, so at turn 12, y=9.\n\nIf at turn 10, we do S, y11=7, then at turn 11, y=7, not 9.\n\nTo have y11=9, we need y10 + Δy10 =9, but y10=7, Δy10 <=1, so y11 <=8, cannot be 9.\n\nSimilarly, y12 = y11 + Δy11 <=8+1=9 or less.\n\nSo earliest possible to be at y=9 is at turn 12, with y12=9.\n\nThat requires two U actions, for example.\n\nTurn 12 = t_1 + H -1 =10 + H -1, so 10 + H -1 =12, thus H=3.\n\nActions at t=10,11,12? Let's see.\n\nH=3, actions for t from 0 to 2: a_{10+0}=a10, a_{10+1}=a11, a_{10+2}=a12? t from 0 to H-1=2, so a10, a11, a12.\n\nBut a10 affects y11, a11 affects y12, a12 affects y13.\n\nWe want y at turn t_1 + H -1 =10+3-1=12 to be 9, so y12=9.\n\ny12 is affected by a11, since y12 = y11 + Δy11.\n\ny11 is affected by a10.\n\nTo have y12=9, we need to be at y11=8 or 9, then with U or S.\n\nBut since we want to reach 9, probably U from 8.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 12, we are at y12=9, and we choose a12, but it doesn't affect the position at 12.\n\nBut the sequence includes a12.\n\nIn terms of collision, we need to not collide at each turn from 10 to 12, since at turn 12 we are at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no car collision.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is the bottom, but we start at y=7, target y=9.\n\nSo for turns when we are on y=1 to 8, we need to avoid collision.\n\nNow, at turn 10, we are on y=7, need to check if at turn 10, on freeway 7, is there a car at 0.\n\nSimilarly for other turns.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9 at turn 12, so with H=3, actions a10, a11, a12.\n\nBut to have y12=9, we need to be at y11=8 or 9.\n\nIf y11=9, then at turn 11 we are at 9, but we want to reach at turn 12? No, we can reach earlier if possible, but from above, y11 cannot be 9, since from y10=7, we can only go to 6,7,8.\n\ny11 can be 6,7, or 8.\n\nThen to have y12=9, we need y11=8 and a11=U, or y11=9 and a11=S, but y11=9 not possible from y10=7, so only possibility: y11=8 and a11=U.\n\ny11=8 can be from y10=7 with a10=U.\n\nIf a10=S, y11=7, then to y12=9, need a11=U, y12=8, not 9. Or if a11=U from y11=7, y12=8, still not 9. To reach y12=9 from y11, y11 must be 8 or 9, but 9 impossible, so y11 must be 8, then a11=U to y12=9.\n\ny11=8 from y10=7 with a10=U.\n\nIf a10=D, y11=6, then even with U, y12=7, not 9.\n\nSo to reach y12=9, we must have a10=U, so y11=8, then a11=U, so y12=9.\n\nActions must be U at t=10 and U at t=11.\n\nThen a12 can be anything, but since we reached at turn 12, and action at t=12 is part of the sequence, but it doesn't affect position at 12.\n\nBut for collision, we need to check turns 10,11,12.\n\nAt turn 12, y12=9, not on freeway, so no collision possible.\n\nAt turn 10, y10=7, on freeway 7.\n\nAt turn 11, y11=8, on freeway 8.\n\nWe need to ensure that at turn 10, on y=7, no car at 0, and at turn 11, on y=8, no car at 0.\n\nIf that's possible, then we can do it in H=3 with actions U,U, and say S for a12 or something.\n\nBut a12 is needed for the sequence, but since we reached at turn 12, and action at t=12 is for future, we can choose S or U or D, but U would go to 10, but y=10 not exist, y max 9, so if y12=9, a12=U, y13= min(10,9)=9? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t with y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=9, a_t=U, y_{t+1}= min(9,10)=9, I think it stays at 9.\n\nSimilarly for D.\n\nBut for collision, at turn 12, y=9, safe.\n\nBut we need to check if at turn 10 and 11, no collision.\n\nIf not, we might need to wait or go down and up, but that would take more turns, so H larger, but we want minimal H, so we should first check if H=3 is possible.\n\nH=3 means we reach at turn 12.\n\nNow, check for freeway 7 at turn 10 and freeway 8 at turn 11.\n\nFirst, freeway 7 at turn 10: are there cars with 0 in span at T=10.\n\nCars on freeway 7.\n\nFrom the table, freeway 7 has cars: (-8, -19, right, 4)\n\nOnly one car.\n\nDirection right, so at T=10, span is [τ + s(T-10), h + s(T-10)] but T=10, so ΔT=0, span is [τ, h] = [-19, -8] since τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn the state: (-8, -19, right, 4), so head h=-8, tail τ=-19, so for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-19, -8]\n\nAt T=10, same, since T-t1=0.\n\nIs 0 in [-19, -8]? -19 <= 0 <= -8? 0 >= -19 true, 0 <= -8? 0 <= -8 is false, -8 < 0? -8 is less than 0, so -8 <= -8, but 0 > -8, so 0 not <= -8, thus 0 not in [-19, -8], since upper bound -8 <0.\n\n[-19, -8] means from -19 to -8, both inclusive, so positions from -19 to -8, all negative, 0 is not in this interval.\n\nSo no car at 0 on freeway 7 at turn 10. Safe.\n\nNow, at turn 11, we will be on y=8, freeway 8.\n\nCars on freeway 8: (-8, -19, right, 4) same as above? Freeway 8 has the same car? No.\n\nFreeway 8: (-8, -19, right, 4) from table.\n\n| 8 | \\((-8, -19, right, 4)\\) |\n\nSame as freeway 7? Freeway 7 also has (-8,-19,right,4), but different freeway.\n\nAt turn 11, T=11.\n\nFor freeway 8, car at T=11.\n\nt1=10, T=11, ΔT=1.\n\nCar: head h=-8, tail τ=-19, speed s=4, direction right.\n\nSpan at T=11: [τ + s(11-10), h + s(11-10)] = [-19 + 4(1), -8 + 4(1)] = [-15, -4]\n\nNow, is 0 in [-15, -4]? -15 <= 0 <= -4? 0 >= -15 true, 0 <= -4? 0 <= -4 false, -4 <0, so no, 0 not in [-15,-4].\n\nThus, no collision at turn 11 on freeway 8.\n\nTherefore, with actions: at t=10, U, go to y=8 at turn 11.\n\nAt t=11, U, go to y=9 at turn 12.\n\nThen at t=12, we need an action, say S.\n\nAnd we reach at turn 12.\n\nH=3, turn to reach: t_1 + H -1 =10 +3 -1=12.\n\nBut is this minimal? Since we must go from 7 to 9, minimum two moves, so minimum H=3 to reach at turn 12.\n\nCould we reach earlier? At turn 11, y=9? But from y10=7, cannot reach y11=9, so impossible. So minimal H=3.\n\nBut in this case, it seems possible with no issue.\n\nBut let's confirm the car positions.\n\nFreeway 7 at T=10: car span [-19,-8], 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 8 at T=11: car span [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nYes.\n\nBut are there other freeways? We only care when we are on them.\n\nIn this path, we are on y=7 at t=10, y=8 at t=11, y=9 at t=12.\n\nNo other positions.\n\nBut freeway 8 has only one car, same as above.\n\nIn the table, freeway 8 has (-8,-19,right,4), yes.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 2,3,4, there are multiple cars, but we don't care since we not on them.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5 and 6, but not relevant.\n\nSo it seems we can do it directly.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nSo actions: at turn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: S (or U or D, but S is fine)\n\nBut H=3, actions at t=10,11,12.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nt_1=10.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nBut we reach at turn 12, which is t_1 + H -1 =12.\n\nBut let me make sure about the car for freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 at T=11: span [-15,-4], 0 not in, yes.\n\nPerhaps I should check if at other times, but we don't need.\n\nBut the player might go to other y, but in this case, direct up is fine.\n\nBut let me see the cars on other freeways, just to be sure.\n\nFor example, freeway 5: (-6,-17,right,6) at t1=10.\n\nAt T=10, span [-17,-6]? τ=-17, h=-6, [τ,h]=[-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nBut we not on it.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same (-6,-17,right,6)? From table: freeway 6: (-6,-17,right,6), same as freeway 5? Freeway 5: (-6,-17,right,6), freeway 6: (-6,-17,right,6), identical?\n\nBut different freeway, but positions same.\n\nBut not relevant.\n\nFreeway 1: (-33,-44,right,3), at T=10, span [-44,-33], 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 2: multiple cars: (-48,-59,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12), (24,13,right,12)\n\n(24,13,right,12), head=24, tail=13, but 13<24, so [τ,h]=[13,24]?\n\nAt T=10, for this car: [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, (-12,-23,right,12): τ=-23, h=-12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\n(-48,-59,right,12): τ=-59, h=-48, [-59,-48], 0 not in.\n\nAll not at 0.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nBut at turn 10, we on y=7, which is freeway 7, car not at 0.\n\nAt turn 11, y=8, freeway 8, car not at 0.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nBut the car on freeway 8 at T=11: [-15,-4], not at 0.\n\nBut let me see when it will be at 0.\n\nThe car on freeway 8: span at T: [-19 +4(T-10), -8 +4(T-10)]\n\nSet equal to 0: -19 +4(ΔT) =0 or -8 +4(ΔT)=0.\n\n-19 +4ΔT=0, 4ΔT=19, ΔT=19/4=4.75, not integer.\n\n-8 +4ΔT=0, 4ΔT=8, ΔT=2.\n\nAt ΔT=2, T=12, the span at T=12: [-19+4(2), -8+4(2)] = [-19+8, -8+8] = [-11,0]\n\nAt T=12, span is [-11,0], so 0 is included, since right end is 0.\n\nBut at turn 11, T=11, span [-15,-4], not including 0.\n\nAnd we are at y=8 at turn 11, not at turn 12.\n\nAt turn 12, we are at y=9, not on freeway 8, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 7, car at T=10: [-19,-8], at T=11: [-15,-4], at T=12: [-11,0], so at T=12, if we were on y=7, but we not.\n\nSo all fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=3 with actions U at t=10, U at t=11, and say S at t=12.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to specify.\n\nPerhaps we don't need to specify a12, but since H=3, we have three actions.\n\nThe reach is at turn t_1 + H -1 =12, after H actions? With actions a10 and a11, we reach y12=9, and a12 is extra.\n\nBut according to the problem, we must provide the sequence for H turns.\n\nWe can choose a12=S.\n\nTo minimize H, but H=3 is minimal.\n\nBut is there a way with H=2? H=2, then reach at turn t_1 + H -1 =10+2-1=11.\n\nAt turn 11, y11=9.\n\nBut from y10=7, y11 = y10 + Δy10 <=8, cannot be 9. Impossible. So H=2 not possible.\n\nThus H=3 is minimal.\n\nBut in the actions, with a10=U, a11=U, we go to y12=9 at turn 12.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at turn 11 if we start from lower, but we start at 7.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother path: if we go down first, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nSo direct up is best.\n\nBut let me confirm if at turn 10 and 11, all safe, which we did.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8, at turn 11, we have car, but not at 0.\n\nBut freeway 8 has only one car? From table, yes.\n\nBut in the table, for freeway 2,3,4, there are multiple cars, but we not on them.\n\nFor example, freeway 2 at T=10: cars with spans.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12), span at T=10: [-59,-48]? τ=-59, h=-48, [τ,h]=[-59,-48]\n\nSecond car: (-12,-23,right,12), [-23,-12]\n\nThird car: (24,13,right,12), head=24, tail=13, so [τ,h]=[13,24]\n\nNone include 0.\n\nSimilarly for other times.\n\nBut not relevant.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nBut H=3, and we reach at turn 12.\n\nIn the answer, we need to box it.\n\nBut let me see the format.\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nt_1=10.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nBut is S necessary? We can choose U or D, but since y=9, U would stay or go to 10, but clamped to 9, so same as S.\n\nD would go down, but not needed.\n\nS is fine.\n\nPerhaps we can have H=3 with different actions, but this is minimal.\n\nAnother thing: the player might stay or move down to avoid something, but in this case, no need.\n\nBut let me check if at turn 10, if we stay, but then we need more actions to go up later, which increases H, so worse.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down, worse.\n\nSo minimal is direct up.\n\nBut perhaps for freeway 8 at turn 11, if there was a car at 0, but there isn't.\n\nIn this case, it seems clear.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8: (-8,-19,right,4)\n\nAt T=11: ΔT=1, τ + sΔT = -19 +4*1 = -15, h + sΔT = -8 +4*1 = -4, span [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nYes.\n\nAt T=10, freeway 7: same car values? Freeway 7: (-8,-19,right,4), at T=10: [-19,-8], 0 not in.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=3.\n\nSequence: a_{10} = U, a_{11} = U, a_{12} = S\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so a_{10}, a_{11}, a_{12}\n\nAnd reach at turn 12.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", but in the answer, we output the sequence, not H.\n\nThe box should contain the sequence.\n\nPerhaps we need to state H, but the format is the actions.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: S \\end{array} }\n\nBut let me confirm if S is needed; we could do U again, but it stays at 9.\n\nS is fine.\n\nSince we reach at turn 12, and action at 12 is performed, but doesn't change position.\n\nBut it must be included.\n\nPerhaps for H=3, we can have different, but this is fine.\n\nAnother thought: is there a car at position 0 on some freeway at some turn that might affect if we delay?\n\nBut since we don't delay, no issue.\n\nFor example, on freeway 8, at T=12, the car is at [-11,0], so 0 is included, so if we were on y=8 at turn 12, we would collide, but we are at y=9 at turn 12, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nSo I think this is the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 7\\) is 3, as it requires at least two \"U\" (up) actions to increase the y-coordinate by 2, and the position is reached at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 10 + 3 - 1 = 12\\).\n- The action sequence must ensure no collision at each turn where the player is on a freeway (\\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)).\n\n#### Collision Check:\n- **At turn 10 (y = 7):**  \n  Freeway 7 has one car: \\((-8, -19, \\text{right}, 4)\\).  \n  Span at \\(T = 10\\): \\([\\tau, h] = [-19, -8]\\).  \n  \\(0 \\notin [-19, -8]\\) (since \\(-8 < 0\\)), so no collision.  \n  Action: \"U\" moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 11.\n\n- **At turn 11 (y = 8):**  \n  Freeway 8 has one car: \\((-8, -19, \\text{right}, 4)\\).  \n  Span at \\(T = 11\\): \\([\\tau + s(T-10), h + s(T-10)] = [-19 + 4(1), -8 + 4(1)] = [-15, -4]\\).  \n  \\(0 \\notin [-15, -4]\\) (since \\(-4 < 0\\)), so no collision.  \n  Action: \"U\" moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12.\n\n- **At turn 12 (y = 9):**  \n  \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway (freeways are \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)), so no collision possible.  \n  Action: \"S\" (stay) is chosen as the player has reached the target, and no further movement is needed.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe minimal \\(H = 3\\) with actions:\n- Turn 10: \"U\" (to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 11)\n- Turn 11: \"U\" (to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12)\n- Turn 12: \"S\" (player at \\(y = 9\\), no action effect needed)\n\nThis sequence reaches (0, 9) at turn 12 with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: S \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 11 and the player is at (0,8). The goal is to reach (0,9) as quickly as possible (minimizing H) without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has its span covering 0 (the x-coordinate of the player). Note that the player is at x=0 always.\n\nAlso note: When moving vertically, at turn T the player is on freeway y_T. If at turn T the player moves to y_{T+1} (by U or D), then at turn T the player is still on y_T and at turn T+1 on y_{T+1}. Therefore, at turn T, the player is only at risk on freeway y_T.\n\nWe start at turn 11 at y=8. We must end at y=9. Since we are at 8, we can go up to 9 in one move? But we must avoid cars on freeway 8 and also any freeway we might step on in between. However, note that we are starting at 8 and going to 9: that would require an action U at turn 11. Then at turn 12, we would be at 9 and the game ends? But note: the goal is to be at (0,9) and we are required to output the actions until we land at 9.\n\nHowever, we must check the cars on freeway 8 at the time we are on it (which is turn 11) and also if we move to 9 at turn 12, we are on freeway 9 at turn 12? But note freeway 9 is not listed because the freeways are from 1 to 8. So freeway 9 is safe? Actually, the problem states: avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8. So freeway 9 has no cars? Then we are safe at 9.\n\nBut wait: at turn 11 we are at 8. We are going to use action U at turn 11. Then at turn 12 we are at 9. We must check:\n\n- At turn 11: we are at freeway 8. Is there a car on freeway 8 at turn 11 that covers 0?\n- At turn 12: we are at freeway 9, which is not monitored, so safe.\n\nSo the only risk is at turn 11 on freeway 8.\n\nNow, look at freeway 8 at turn 11 (current turn):\nCar: (-4, -15, right, 4)\n\nThis car is right-moving. At turn 11, the car's span is [-4, -15]? But note the representation says (head, tail) and for right-moving it says: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] at turn T.\n\nBut wait, the initial state is given at turn t1 (which is 11). So for a right-moving car, the span at turn t1 is [tau, h]? But the input is given as (h, tau, direction, speed). So for the car on freeway 8: h = -4, tau = -15, direction=right, speed=4.\n\nFor a right-moving car, the head is at the rightmost? Actually, the problem says:\n- Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [tau, h] ... meaning that the car extends from tau to h, and tau <= h.\n\nBut in the input, we have (head, tail). So for right-moving, head is the right end? Then the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [-15, -4]? But the input says: (-4, -15, right, 4). So if we interpret as (head, tail) then head=-4 and tail=-15. Then the car goes from tail to head: [-15, -4]. And since it's right-moving, the movement will be: at time T, the span becomes [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSo at turn 11 (T=t1=11), the car is at [-15, -4]. We need to check if 0 is in [-15, -4]? Since -15 <= 0 <= -4? But 0 is not in [-15, -4] because -4 < 0? Actually, -4 is less than 0? Wait: -15, -14, ..., -4: all negative. So 0 is not in the interval. Therefore, at turn 11, the car on freeway 8 does not cover 0.\n\nThus, we can safely do:\n\nTurn 11: U -> then at turn 12 we are at y=9.\n\nBut wait: is that the minimal? H would be 1? Because we do one action and then at the next turn we are at 9.\n\nBut note: the sequence is from t=0 to H-1. Here we start at t1=11. We do one action at turn 11 (t=0 in the sequence) and then at turn 12 (which is t1+1) we are at 9. So H=1.\n\nBut let me check: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we land at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nAt turn t1 + 0 = 11: we do action a_{11} = U -> then at turn 12 (which is t1+1) we are at 9. But then the turn when we are at 9 is turn 12 = t1 + 1. Therefore, H must be such that t1+H-1 = 12 -> 11+H-1=12 -> H=2? \n\nWait, let me clarify: \n- At the start of turn t1 (11), we are at (0,8). \n- We choose an action a_{t1} (at turn 11). \n- Then the state updates to turn t1+1 (12) with the new y.\n\nSo we are at (0,9) at turn 12. Therefore, we have taken one action (H=1 action) and the turn when we finish is t1+H = 11+1 = 12? \n\nBut the problem says: we want to reach at turn t1+H-1. \n\nSo: we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. We want that turn to be 12: so 11+H-1=12 -> H=2? \n\nBut we only took one action. How do we interpret H?\n\nLooking back: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nSo at the end of the sequence of H actions, we are at turn t1+H-1 and we want that position to be 9.\n\nIf we take one action (H=1), then we are at turn t1+1-1 = t1 = 11? But at turn 11 we started at 8 and then we moved to 9 at turn 12? So at turn 11 we are still at 8? \n\nAh, I see: the action a_{t1} is taken at turn t1, and then the state at turn t1+1 is computed. Therefore, after one action, we are at turn t1+1. So to have the state at turn t1+1 be 9, we set H=1? But then the index in the sequence: t=0 to H-1=0, so one action at t1 (which is t1+0). Then the state at turn t1+1 is 9. But the problem says we want y_{t1+H-1} = y_{t1+1-1}=y_{t1}=8? \n\nThat doesn't match. Therefore, we must set H=2: then the sequence is two actions? But we only need one.\n\nAlternatively, note that the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning that we start at t1 and do H actions at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. Then the next state after the last action is at turn t1+H. But we are required to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9. \n\nWait, that is confusing. Let me read carefully:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) ... such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nSo the position at turn (t1 + H - 1) is 9. \n\nBut note: we start at turn t1 at position (0,8). \n\nIf we do an action at turn t1 (the first action in the sequence, t=0), then at the next turn t1+1 we are at a new position. Therefore, the position at turn t1 (without any action) is 8. After the first action (at turn t1), we are at turn t1+1 with a new y.\n\nSo to have y at turn t1+1 be 9, we set H=1? Then we require y_{t1+1-1}=y_{t1}=8, which is not 9. \n\nAlternatively, if we set H=2, then we have two actions: at turn t1 and t1+1. Then we require y_{t1+2-1}=y_{t1+1}=9. That makes sense: we do an action at turn t1 and then at turn t1+1 we are at 9? But we don't need two actions. \n\nWait, actually, we are at turn t1 at y=8. We do U at turn t1: then at turn t1+1, we are at y=9. So we want y_{t1+1} = 9. Therefore, we need to set H such that t1+H-1 = t1+1 -> H-1=1 -> H=2.\n\nSo H=2: meaning we are going to take 2 actions? But we only need one. However, note that the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence of H actions. But wait, the player must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. Since at the beginning of turn t1 we are at (0,8), then at the beginning of turn t1+1 we are at (0,9) after one action. So the turn when we are at (0,9) is turn t1+1. Therefore, we set H=2 because t1+2-1 = t1+1.\n\nSo the sequence will have two actions? But note: we are required to output the actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1. So for H=2, we output:\nTurn t1: a_{t1}\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n\nBut we only need to do one action (at turn t1: U) and then at turn t1+1 we are at 9. Then what about the second action? We don't need to do anything. But the problem says we must output a sequence of H actions. However, after we reach 9, we don't need to do anything. But the problem doesn't say we stop. Actually, we must stop when we reach 9? The problem says: \"reach (0,9)\", meaning that we require the state at turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9). Then we are done. So the actions after that are not necessary? But we are outputting H actions. \n\nAlternatively, note that we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+1. Then we are done. So we don't need to take an action at turn t1+1? But the problem requires a sequence of H actions until the moment we have reached (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\nSo if we do one action at turn t1 (U) and then at turn t1+1 we are at (0,9), then we have reached at turn t1+1. Therefore, we set H=2? Then we must output two actions? But we only need one. What is the second action? \n\nActually, the problem does not require that we must output actions beyond the point of reaching. But note: we are at (0,9) at turn t1+1, which is after the first action. Then we don't need to do any more actions. However, the sequence must be of length H=2? Then we can do the first action (U) and then the second action can be anything? But that might cause a problem: if we do an action at turn t1+1, then we might leave (0,9) and go to (0,10) which is invalid? Or we might stay? \n\nBut note: the y is bounded in [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and do U, it stays at 9? Because: \n  y_{t+1} = min(9, y_t + 1) if U? But the rule says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and then we require y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if at 9 and we do U, then y_{t+1} = 10 -> then we clamp? Or is it disallowed? The rule says: \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\". So the move is not allowed? Or we assume that the move is adjusted? \n\nActually, the rule says: \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\". So if we are at 9 and do U, then we would try to go to 10, but then it is set to 9? Or the move is invalid? The problem doesn't specify. But note: the update is defined by the equation, and then it says \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\". So if we do U at 9, then y_{t+1}=10, which is not in [0,9]. Therefore, we cannot do U at 9. Similarly, D at 0 is not allowed. \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\". So we assume that the move is only allowed if it stays within bounds? Or does the game clamp? The problem does not specify. However, in the context of avoiding cars, it is critical to stay within the grid. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, and since we are already at 9, we can just do S (stay) for the second action? But note: we are required to output the minimal H. And we can actually stop at the moment we reach 9? \n\nBut the problem says: we must output a sequence of H actions that leads to being at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\nIf we set H=1: then we output one action at turn t1 (11). Then the state at turn t1+1-1 = turn 11 is still 8? Not 9. \n\nTherefore, we must set H=2: so that the state at turn t1+2-1 = t1+1 = 12 is 9. Then we output two actions? \n\nBut the first action (at turn 11) is U, which moves us to 9 at turn 12. Then the second action (at turn 12) is not needed because we are already at 9? However, the problem requires that at the turn t1+H-1 = 12 we are at 9. We are at 9 at the beginning of turn 12. Then we have to take an action at turn 12? But that action won't change the fact that we were at 9 at the beginning of turn 12? \n\nActually, the state at the beginning of turn t is the position at that turn. Then we take an action. So at the beginning of turn 12 we are at (0,9). We have reached the goal. But the problem says we must output the action for turn 12? \n\nWait: the sequence is for turns starting at t1 (11) and going for H actions. The last action is at turn t1+H-1. So for H=2, we output:\nTurn 11: a11\nTurn 12: a12\n\nBut at turn 12, we are already at 9. So we can choose a12 = S (stay). Then we remain at 9. \n\nHowever, note that the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 = 11+2-1=12. At the beginning of turn 12 we are at 9, so we have achieved the goal. Then we output the two actions? But the minimal H is 2? \n\nBut can we achieve the goal at an earlier turn? At turn 11 we are at 8, so we cannot be at 9 at turn 11. Therefore, the earliest we can be at 9 is turn 12. Therefore, H=2 is minimal.\n\nSo the plan: \nTurn 11: U -> moves to 9 at turn 12.\nTurn 12: S -> we stay at 9.\n\nBut we must check that we are safe at every turn we are on freeways 1-8.\n\nWe are at freeway 8 at turn 11: we already checked the car on freeway 8 at turn 11: [-15, -4] does not cover 0 -> safe.\n\nAt turn 12: we are at freeway 9 -> no car -> safe.\n\nSo that's safe.\n\nBut wait: what if we do U at turn 11 and then at turn 12 we are at 9, and then we do S at turn 12: but the problem doesn't require to stay at 9? It only requires to reach at turn 12. So we can do:\n\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n\nBut note: we are at 9 at turn 12 (the beginning of turn 12) and then we do S. That doesn't harm.\n\nHowever, is there a way to achieve being at 9 at turn 11? No, because we start at 8 at turn 11. So we must move up to 9 at turn 12.\n\nBut wait: what if we do nothing? Then we stay at 8. We have to eventually move.\n\nSo the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in one action? The problem says: the state after the action is taken. But the requirement is the state at turn t1+H-1. If H=1, then that state is at turn t1 (11). We are at 8, not 9. So H must be 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n\nBut wait: the problem says the initial state is at turn 11. Then we take an action at turn 11 (U) and we move to 9 at turn 12. Then at turn 12, we take an action (S) and we remain at 9. Then at the beginning of turn 13 we are still at 9? But the goal is to be at 9 at turn 12 (t1+H-1=12). We are at 9 at the beginning of turn 12 and also at the beginning of turn 13? But we only care about turn 12.\n\nAlternatively, we might not need to take an action at turn 12? But the sequence must have H=2 actions. So we have to output two actions.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". We are at 9 at the beginning of turn 12. Then we take an action at turn 12. That action doesn't change the fact that we were at 9 at the beginning of turn 12. So it is acceptable.\n\nBut what if we do D at turn 12? Then we move to 8 at turn 13. But we don't care about turn 13 because the goal is turn 12. So we can do any action at turn 12? But we must avoid collision on freeway 9? There is none. But if we do D, then at turn 12 we are at freeway 9 (so safe) and then we move to 8 at turn 13. But the goal only requires that at turn 12 we are at 9. So we are at 9 at the beginning of turn 12, then we do D and move to 8 at turn 13. But that is after the goal turn. So it is acceptable? However, the problem does not require to stay. But to be safe, we can do S.\n\nSo I will do S at turn 12.\n\nBut let me double-check the car positions at turn 11 and 12 for the player's path.\n\nAt turn 11: \n- Player is at (0,8). Check freeway 8: car is at [-15, -4] at turn 11? As computed: the car is right-moving, so at turn 11 (current turn) the span is [tau, head] = [-15, -4]. 0 is not in this interval -> safe.\n\nAt turn 12: \n- Player is at (0,9). There is no freeway 9 with cars -> safe.\n\nBut note: when we are at turn 12, we are going to take an action. However, the collision at a turn T depends only on the player's y at the beginning of the turn (which is y_T) and the cars on that freeway at that same turn T.\n\nAt the beginning of turn 12, we are at y=9 -> safe.\n\nThen we do an action (S, U, or D). But if we do U, we try to go to 10 -> invalid? So we cannot do U. If we do D, we go to 8 at the next state (turn 13). But that doesn't cause a collision at turn 12 because at turn 12 we are on freeway 9 (safe) and then we move to freeway 8 at turn 13. But we are not required to check beyond the goal turn? However, the problem doesn't specify, but since the goal is achieved at turn 12, we can do any allowed action at turn 12? But note: the action at turn 12 must be valid. Since we are at 9, D is allowed (to 8) and S is allowed. U is not allowed because it would go to 10.\n\nSo we can do D or S. But to be minimal and safe, we can do S.\n\nBut note: the problem says the sequence must avoid collisions. The collision check at turn 12: we are at freeway 9 -> safe. Then the action we take doesn't cause a collision at turn 12? Because the collision is only checked at the beginning of the turn? And then we move? \n\nYes: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". So at turn T, we are at y_T and we check the cars on that freeway at that turn T. Then we take an action and move to y_{T+1} at turn T+1. Therefore, the action we take does not affect the collision at turn T (it's already passed) and at turn T+1 we are on freeway y_{T+1} and will check then? But in this case, we are only required to be safe until we reach the goal? Actually, the problem says: avoiding collisions. So we must avoid collisions at every turn we are on the grid until we reach the goal? But the goal is at turn 12, so we only care about collisions at turn 11 and 12.\n\nAt turn 12: we are at 9 -> safe. Then we take an action. The action might cause a collision at turn 13? But the problem doesn't require to avoid collisions after the goal? Because we have already reached the goal at turn 12. So we don't care about turn 13? \n\nBut the problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\" during the game until we reach the goal. Since we reach the goal at turn 12, we only need to avoid collisions at turn 11 and 12. \n\nTherefore, we can do any action at turn 12? But we must output an action. However, if we do D, then at turn 13 we might collide? But that is after the goal, so it's acceptable? But the problem doesn't specify. To be safe, we can do S and remain at 9.\n\nSo I'll do S.\n\nBut let me check if there is a faster way? H=2 is the minimal because we cannot be at 9 at turn 11.\n\nWhat if we start at 8 and we do nothing at turn 11 (S) and then at turn 12 we do U? Then we would be at 9 at turn 13. Then H would be 3? Because we require the state at turn t1+H-1 = 11+H-1 = 13 -> H=3. That's worse.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n\nBut wait: the problem says the current turn is t1 and the player is at (0,8). Then we do U at turn 11: that moves to 9 at turn 12. Then at turn 12, we are at 9 and we do S: so we remain at 9 for turn 13.\n\nBut the goal is to be at 9 at turn 12. We are at 9 at the beginning of turn 12. Then we do S at turn 12: that doesn't change the fact that at the beginning of turn 12 we were at 9. So it's correct.\n\nBut note: the state at turn 12 is 9, so we have reached. The action at turn 12 is just to fill the sequence of length 2.\n\nAlternatively, we could do:\n\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: D\n\nBut that would move us to 8 at turn 13. But we don't care. However, the problem does not require to remain at 9. It only requires to be at 9 at turn 12. So it's acceptable. But why risk? We can do S.\n\nBut let me check if at turn 12, if we do D, then we are on freeway 9 at turn 12 (safe) and then we move to 8 at turn 13. At turn 13 we are at 8: but we don't care about turn 13 because the goal was at turn 12. So it's acceptable. However, the problem says \"avoid collisions\" during the entire sequence? The sequence of actions we take must avoid collisions at every turn we are on the grid until the goal? The goal is achieved at turn 12, so we only care about collisions at turns 11 and 12. \n\nTherefore, we can do D at turn 12 without causing a collision at turn 12 (because at turn 12 we are at 9) and the move to 8 happens at turn 13, which is beyond the goal. So it's safe. But to be consistent, we can do S.\n\nI think S is the natural choice.\n\nBut note: the problem does not specify what happens after the goal. So we'll do S.\n\nTherefore, the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n}\n\nBut wait: what about the cars on other freeways? We are only on freeway 8 at turn 11 and freeway 9 at turn 12. So we don't need to worry about other freeways.\n\nBut let me double-check the car at freeway 8 at turn 11: is it moving? How do we compute the position at turn 11? The car state is given at turn 11. So we don't need to compute: the state is given.\n\nThe car on freeway 8: (-4, -15, right, 4) -> interpreted as head=-4, tail=-15, so the span is [tail, head] = [-15, -4]. 0 is not in [-15, -4] -> safe.\n\nBut note: the problem says for a right-moving car: \"Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\". At turn 11 (T=t1=11), the span is [tau, head] = [-15, -4]. Then at turn 12 (if we needed) it would be [-15+4, -4+4] = [-11,0]. So at turn 12, the car on freeway 8 would cover 0? But we are not on freeway 8 at turn 12. We are at freeway 9 at turn 12. So we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the plan is safe.\n\nSo final answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n}\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 11\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Current state at turn 11**:\n  - Player is at (0, 8).\n  - Cars on freeway 8 (the only relevant freeway for collision check at turn 11) are given as \\((-4, -15, \\text{right}, 4)\\).\n    - For a right-moving car, the span at turn \\(T\\) is \\([\\tau + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\\).\n    - At turn 11 (\\(T = t_1\\)): span = \\([-15, -4]\\) (since \\(\\tau = -15\\), \\(h = -4\\), \\(s = 4\\)).\n    - 0 is not in the interval \\([-15, -4]\\), so no collision occurs at turn 11.\n\n### Plan to Reach (0, 9):\n- To reach y=9 from y=8, the player must move up (action \\(U\\)).\n- After moving up at turn 11:\n  - At turn 12, the player is at (0, 9).\n- **Collision check at turn 12**:\n  - Player is at freeway 9. Since freeways 1 to 8 are the only ones with cars, freeway 9 has no cars. Thus, no collision occurs.\n- The earliest turn to reach (0, 9) is turn 12, which corresponds to \\(H = 2\\) (since \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{11 + 2 - 1} = y_{12} = 9\\)).\n- At turn 12, the player is already at (0, 9). A stay action (\\(S\\)) is chosen to remain at y=9, as moving up is invalid (y=10 is out of bounds) and moving down is unnecessary.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 11**: Action \\(U\\) (move up to y=9 at turn 12).\n- **Turn 12**: Action \\(S\\) (stay at y=9, as the goal is achieved at turn 12).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H = 2\\) turns, which is minimal, and avoids collisions at all turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: S\n}",
