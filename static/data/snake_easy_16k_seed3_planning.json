        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 0, and the snake is at position (3,3) with head direction left (L). The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,1). Foods are at:\n\n- (3,4) with value 1 and life span 10\n\n- (5,2) with value 1 and life span 10\n\n- (2,5) with value 1 and life span 10\n\nAll foods are positive since value is 1, and no negative food mentioned.\n\nSnake positions: [(3,3)] – this means the snake has only one segment, the head. So length 1.\n\nHead direction is L, which is left. So from (3,3), moving left would be to (2,3).\n\nNow, I need to plan 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nSince the snake is only one segment, there's no body to collide with except walls and obstacles. Also, with one segment, the tail reward danger might not apply yet, but I should keep it in mind for when the snake grows.\n\nPossible actions: U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right). But since head direction is L, I cannot instantly reverse to R on the next turn. So for turn 0, possible moves are U, D, L. R is opposite to L, so not allowed immediately.\n\nHead direction is L, so current direction is left. Cannot move right on next turn because that would be instant reverse.\n\nAllowed moves: Up, Down, Left (since left is current direction, that's fine).\n\nRight is opposite, so not allowed.\n\nSo from (3,3), possible next positions:\n\n- U: (3,4) – but (3,4) has food? Let's see, food is at (3,4), yes.\n\n- D: (3,2) – is this wall? Walls are borders: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. (3,2) is within bounds, not a border. Internal obstacle at (3,1), not (3,2), so (3,2) should be empty.\n\n- L: (2,3) – should be empty, no food or wall mentioned.\n\nFoods are at (3,4), (5,2), (2,5). So (2,3) is empty.\n\nNow, if I move to (3,4), that has food. Since snake is length 1, eating food would increase length to 2. But I need to check if it's safe.\n\n(3,4) is within grid: x=3, y=4, borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so 0-7 inclusive? Probably grid from 0 to 7, so x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. (3,4) is fine.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), not relevant.\n\nIf I eat at (3,4), snake grows to length 2. Positions: head at (3,4), tail at (3,3) for now, but when I move, tail follows.\n\nSequence: if I move head to food, it eats, so new head at (3,4), and tail stays or grows? When snake eats, it grows, so after moving to food, the tail doesn't move that turn, so positions become [(3,4), (3,3)].\n\nThen for next move, when I move from (3,4), the tail moves to the previous position or something. Standard snake: when head moves to a cell, if it's food, length increases, so tail doesn't move; else, tail moves forward.\n\nBut here, since we start with one segment, moving to food: head goes to food cell, and since it eats, a new segment is added at the previous position, so now snake has two segments: head at food, tail at previous head position.\n\nThen for subsequent moves, when head moves to a new cell, if no food, tail moves to the cell that was second segment, etc.\n\nBut for collision, with two segments, if head moves to where tail is, but tail will move, so it might be safe if timed right.\n\nIn this case, with length 2, positions like head and tail adjacent.\n\nNow, back to turn 0 choices.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (3,4) – eat food, get +1, length becomes 2. Snake positions: [(3,4), (3,3)]\n\nHead direction becomes U, since I moved up.\n\nThen for next turn, possible moves: from (3,4), head direction U, so can go U, L, R? Direction: after moving up, new head direction is up, so cannot move down instantly.\n\nMoves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3) but (3,3) is current tail, L to (2,4), R to (4,4)\n\nBut (3,3) is the tail, which will move when I move the head, so if I move down to (3,3), since tail is there, but after head moves to (3,3), tail moves to... let's simulate.\n\nAfter eating at turn 0, snake is at [(3,4), (3,3)]\n\nTurn 1: if I move head to (3,3), which is the current tail position. But when I move head to (3,3), since (3,3) is occupied by tail, but in snake rules, moving to the tail cell is often allowed because the tail moves away at the same time, so no collision.\n\nBut I need to check the rules here.\n\n**Deadly Collisions**: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nYes, so moving to tail is safe because tail moves.\n\nBut only if it's the tail segment, not other body parts.\n\nIn this case, with two segments, tail is at (3,3), head moving to (3,3) is allowed because tail will move away.\n\nAfter moving head to (3,3), what happens? Head moves to (3,3), which was tail. But since it's food? (3,3) has no food, I think. Food was eaten at (3,4), so (3,3) is empty or just snake body.\n\n(3,3) is the tail position, no food there.\n\nWhen head moves to (3,3), since no food, the tail moves to... the tail was at (3,3), but head is moving there, so the snake positions become: head at (3,3), and the tail... since no growth, the tail segment is removed, but only one tail segment? With two segments, when head moves to a new cell, if no food, the tail moves off its current cell.\n\nSo positions: before move, segments: 0: head (3,4), 1: tail (3,3)\n\nMove head to (3,3) – but (3,3) is currently occupied by segment 1. Since it's the tail, and tail will move, but when head moves to (3,3), it's moving to the same cell as tail? That might be a collision or not.\n\nStandard implementation: when head moves to a cell, if that cell is not food, then the tail moves to the next position, so the cell that was tail is vacated.\n\nBut if head moves directly to the tail cell, it should be ok because at the end of the move, head is at the cell, and tail has moved to the previous position or something.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think of the positions after move.\n\nInitial: positions list [head, body..., tail]\n\nWhen head moves to a new cell:\n\n- If the new cell is food, add a new segment at the previous head position, so positions become [new_head, old_head, ..., tail]\n\n- If not food, move head to new cell, and remove the tail, so positions become [new_head, ..., second last segment]\n\nIn the case of moving to tail cell with two segments.\n\nStart: positions [A, B] where A head, B tail.\n\nMove head to B's position.\n\nIf B has no food, which it doesn't, then new head position is B, and since no growth, tail is removed. But tail was B, so after removal, snake should be just [B], but B is the new head? Confusing.\n\nTypically, for a snake of length L, positions are a list of L cells.\n\nWhen head moves to a new cell:\n\n- If food, new positions: [new_cell] + positions (so new head, then old head, etc.), length L+1\n\n- If not food, new positions: [new_cell] + positions[:-1]  (new head, then all except the last one, which was tail)\n\nIn the two-segment case: positions [A, B]\n\nMove head to new cell C.\n\nIf C is food, new positions [C, A, B]? No: [C, A] + [B] but B is tail, so [C, A, B] would be three segments, but we added one, so length 3.\n\nStandard: when eat, new head at food, and old positions remain, so from [A,B], move to food C, new positions [C, A, B] if it was the first move, but B is tail.\n\nAfter eating, positions are [new_head, old_head, tail] so for length 2 to 3.\n\nFrom length 1: positions [A]\n\nMove to food F, new positions [F, A]  (head F, tail A)\n\nThen from [F, A], move head to new cell G.\n\nIf G is not food, new positions [G, F]  (head G, tail F), tail moved from A to F? Positions become [G] + [F] = [G, F], so tail is at F now, A is vacated.\n\nIf G is food, new positions [G, F, A]  (head G, body F, tail A)\n\nNow, back to moving to tail cell.\n\nFrom [F, A], if I move head to A, which is the current tail position.\n\nSo new cell is A.\n\nA has no food (assume), so not food, so new positions [A] + [F] but positions are [A, F]? [new_cell] + positions[:-1] = [A] + [F] since positions[:-1] for [F,A] is [F], so [A, F]\n\nSo now head is at A, which was tail, and tail is at F, which was head.\n\nNo collision because at the time of move, the cell A is occupied, but since it's the tail, and we're moving there, it's allowed, and after move, positions are [A,F], so head at A, tail at F, different cells.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, if there were more segments, it would be ok as long as it's the tail.\n\nBut if you move to a body segment that's not tail, it's collision.\n\nIn this case, with two segments, moving to tail is fine.\n\nBut in our case, for turn 1, if I had moved to (3,4) at turn 0, then at turn 1, moving down to (3,3) is safe.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; first I need to decide turn 0 action.\n\nBack to turn 0.\n\nCurrent position: (3,3), head dir L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (3,4) – has food, so eat, +1 score, length to 2. New head dir U.\n\n- D: to (3,2) – no food, no wall, safe. Length still 1. New head dir D.\n\n- L: to (2,3) – no food, no wall, safe. Length still 1. New head dir L.\n\nR is not allowed because instant reverse.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n\nAlso, foods have life span 10, so they disappear after 10 turns, including current, so after 10 turns from now, they vanish if not eaten.\n\nCurrent turn 0, so food at (3,4) disappears at turn 10 if not eaten, similarly for others.\n\nBut 10 turns is far, so we have time.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options.\n\nFirst, if I move U to (3,4), I eat immediately, get +1, snake grows to length 2 at positions [(3,4), (3,3)]\n\nThen for turn 1, from (3,4), head dir U, possible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3) but (3,3) is tail, L to (2,4), R to (4,4)\n\nAll of these might be safe since no walls or obstacles near.\n\n(3,5): y=5, borders y=7 and y=0, so y=5 is fine, x=3.\n\n(2,4): x=2,y=4, should be fine.\n\n(4,4): similar.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), not relevant.\n\nFrom (3,4), moving U to (3,5) – no food, so snake would move to [(3,5), (3,4)] after turn 1.\n\nOr move D to (3,3), which is tail, as we said, safe, positions become [(3,3), (3,4)]? From [(3,4),(3,3)] move head to (3,3), not food, so new positions [ (3,3) ] + [ (3,4) ] but positions[:-1] is [(3,4)], so [ (3,3), (3,4) ], head at (3,3), tail at (3,4).\n\nThen I can move from there.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nIf I don't eat now, I can eat later, but I need to maximize score, so eating is good, but with risks.\n\nHere, eating at (3,4) seems safe since no immediate danger.\n\nAnother food is at (5,2) and (2,5).\n\n(2,5) might be closer if I move left first.\n\nLet's consider the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and (3,1).\n\nSo cells: let's sketch mentally.\n\nRow y=0: wall, y=1: x=3 is obstacle, so (3,1) blocked, other cells open? The obstacle is at (3,1), so that cell is wall.\n\nBorders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cannot go there.\n\nInternal (3,1) wall.\n\nFoods: (3,4), (5,2), (2,5)\n\nSnake at (3,3)\n\nIf I move L to (2,3), no eat, length 1, head at (2,3), dir L.\n\nThen from (2,3), can go U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3), or R to (3,3) but R is right, which might be opposite to current dir L? Current dir after move L is L, so moving R would be instant reverse? After moving left, new head direction is left, so for next turn, cannot move right.\n\nSimilarly, if I move U from (3,3), new dir U, cannot move D next.\n\nBack to turn 0.\n\nOption U: eat at (3,4), +1, grow to 2.\n\nThen turn 1, from (3,4) dir U.\n\nI need to plan multiple turns.\n\nSince foods have life 10, and I want to eat all if possible, but I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAlso, with snake growing, I need to be careful of body collisions.\n\nBut for now, length 1, no issue.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger. If head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills. But currently no tail, so not an issue.\n\nSo for turn 0, moving U seems good to get first food.\n\nBut let's see other foods. (2,5) is at (2,5), which is left and up from (3,3). (3,3) to (2,5) is not adjacent; (2,5) is two cells away.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) is down-right.\n\nIf I move L to (2,3), I'm closer to (2,5), since from (2,3) to (2,5) is up two, or through (2,4).\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), so from (2,3), I can go U to (2,4), then U to (2,5) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) from (3,3) I can go D to (3,2), then R to (4,2), then R to (5,2)? (5,2) is at (5,2), so from (3,2) to (4,2) to (5,2).\n\nBut (3,2) might be ok.\n\nBut let's think about the internal wall at (3,1), which affects moving down, but (3,2) is above it, so not blocked.\n\nNow, to maximize, I should eat multiple foods.\n\nBut with life span 10, I have time.\n\nPrioritize long-term survival. The grid has obstacles, so I need to not trap myself.\n\nFor example, if I eat at (3,4), I'm at (3,4) with length 2, tail at (3,3).\n\nThen I can go to (3,5) or (2,4) or (4,4).\n\n(2,5) is food at (2,5), so from (3,4), going L to (2,4), then U to (2,5) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,4) to (2,5) is up.\n\n(2,4) to (2,5) is adjacent, yes.\n\nThen after eating at (2,5), I have three foods? No, only three foods listed, but I can eat one by one.\n\nBut let's plan a sequence.\n\nFirst, at turn 0, if I move U to (3,4), eat, score +1, snake at [(3,4),(3,3)], dir U.\n\nTurn 1: from (3,4), I can move L to (2,4) to get closer to (2,5).\n\n(2,4) has no food, so move to (2,4), not eat, so snake positions: head to (2,4), not food, so new positions [ (2,4), (3,4) ] because from [ (3,4), (3,3) ], move head to (2,4), not food, so new positions [ (2,4) ] + [ (3,4) ] = [ (2,4), (3,4) ], tail at (3,4)? Positions: head (2,4), body (3,4), tail was (3,3) but removed, so only two segments: head (2,4), tail (3,4).\n\nThen turn 2: from (2,4), head dir L (since I moved left), so can go U, D, L.\n\n(2,5) is above, U to (2,5), which has food, so eat.\n\nMove U to (2,5), eat, so grow, new positions: head at (2,5), then previous head (2,4), and tail (3,4), so [ (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) ], length 3.\n\nHead dir U.\n\nThen I have eaten two foods, score 2.\n\nNow, next food at (5,2).\n\nFrom (2,5), I need to go to (5,2).\n\nPossible paths: I can go R to (3,5), then down, etc.\n\nBut I need to avoid walls and body.\n\nCurrent positions: head (2,5), body (2,4), tail (3,4)\n\nFrom (2,5), dir U, so can go U to (2,6), D to (2,4) but (2,4) is body, not tail, so collision if move there.\n\nL to (1,5), R to (3,5)\n\n(2,4) is body, not tail, so moving to (2,4) would be collision, deadly.\n\nSimilarly, U to (2,6) or R to (3,5) or L to (1,5)\n\n(3,5) is empty, I think.\n\nFoods are (5,2) left, others eaten or not.\n\n(3,4) has food? No, (3,4) was eaten earlier, but food is consumed, so no.\n\nOnly (5,2) left.\n\nLife span 10, so turn 0 to turn 10, we are at turn 2 after eating second food, so plenty of time.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can go R to (3,5), for example.\n\nMove to (3,5), not food, so new positions: head to (3,5), not eat, so [ (3,5) ] + [ (2,5), (2,4) ] but positions are [ (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) ], positions[:-1] is [ (2,5), (2,4) ], so new positions [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ], tail at (2,4).\n\nHead at (3,5), dir R (since moved right).\n\nThen from (3,5), can go U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5)\n\n(3,4) is tail? Current positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), tail (2,4)\n\n(3,4) is not occupied; it was vacated when we moved from (2,5) to (3,5)? When we moved head to (3,5), tail was removed from (3,4)? In previous state, tail was at (3,4), but after move, tail is at (2,4), since positions are [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ], so cells occupied: (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)\n\n(3,4) is free.\n\nSo from (3,5), moving D to (3,4) is possible, empty.\n\nBut (3,4) has no food.\n\nThen to reach (5,2), I need to go down and right.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) go D to (3,4), then D to (3,3), but (3,3) might be free, then to (4,3), etc., to (5,2).\n\nBut (3,1) is wall, so I can go to (3,2), but not (3,1).\n\ny from 5 to 2, so down.\n\nBut let's not plan all yet.\n\nFirst, back to turn 0, I have other choices.\n\nIf at turn 0 I move D to (3,2), no eat, snake still length 1 at (3,2), dir D.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can go to (5,2) or other.\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), so from (3,2) go R to (4,2), then R to (5,2) to eat.\n\nThen score +1, grow to 2.\n\nThen I can go to other foods.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (2,3) at turn 0, no eat, then to (2,5) or (3,4).\n\n(2,5) is closer.\n\nFrom (2,3) go U to (2,4), then U to (2,5) eat.\n\nThen similar.\n\nBut in all cases, I can eat the foods.\n\nNow, what about the internal wall at (3,1)? It might block some paths, but since y=1, and foods are at higher y, it might not affect directly.\n\nBut for moving down, I need to be careful not to go to (3,1).\n\nAnother thing: the grid has borders, so I need to avoid edges if snake is long, but now short.\n\nNow, tail reward danger: only if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, but since when food is on tail, and I eat it, it might cause collision if head is adjacent, but in this case, with multiple segments.\n\nBut for now, not an issue.\n\nPerhaps moving U at turn 0 is fine, as I can eat (3,4) and then (2,5) quickly.\n\nBut let's see the position of (2,5) and (5,2); (2,5) is at top-left, (5,2) at bottom-right, (3,4) center-up.\n\nFrom (3,3), (3,4) is adjacent, so eating it saves turns.\n\nIf I go to (2,5) first, from (3,3) move L to (2,3) turn 0, then U to (2,4) turn 1, then U to (2,5) turn 2 eat. So at turn 2, I eat first food.\n\nWhereas if I move U at turn 0, I eat at turn 0, then at turn 2 I can eat second food, as in my earlier plan.\n\nIn U move: turn 0 eat (3,4), turn 1 move to (2,4), turn 2 eat (2,5), so at turn 2 eaten two foods.\n\nIf L move: turn 0 move L no eat, turn 1 move U no eat (to (2,4)? From (2,3) move U to (2,4), not food, turn 2 move U to (2,5) eat. So at turn 2 eaten one food.\n\nSimilarly, for (5,2): if I go down, from (3,3) move D to (3,2) turn 0 no eat, turn 1 move R to (4,2) no eat, turn 2 move R to (5,2) eat, so turn 2 one food.\n\nWhereas with U move, I can have two foods by turn 2.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (5,2).\n\nAfter eating (2,5) at turn 2, snake at [(2,5),(2,4),(3,4)] as before.\n\nThen to (5,2), I need to move right and down.\n\nFor example, from (2,5) turn 2, I can go R to (3,5) as I thought, then D to (3,4) but (3,4) is body? At that point, positions: after eating (2,5), positions [ (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) ]\n\nIf I go R to (3,5), positions become [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ]\n\nThen turn 3, from (3,5) dir R, can go D to (3,4), which is now empty? After move to (3,5), (3,4) is free, so D to (3,4) is ok, not food, so positions [ (3,4), (3,5), (2,5) ]? Move head to (3,4), not food, so new positions [ (3,4) ] + [ (3,5), (2,5) ] but positions[:-1] is [ (3,5), (2,5) ], so [ (3,4), (3,5), (2,5) ], tail at (2,5).\n\nThen from (3,4), can go D to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut (3,3) might be free.\n\nThen to (4,3), (5,3), then down to (5,2) or something.\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), so from (3,4) go D to (3,3), then R to (4,3), then R to (5,3), then D to (5,2) to eat.\n\nBut (5,3) to (5,2) is down.\n\nTurns: at turn 3, head at (3,4), move D to (3,3) not food, positions [ (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) ]? From previous: after turn 3 move to (3,4), positions [ (3,4), (3,5), (2,5) ]\n\nTurn 4: from (3,4) dir D (since moved down), move D to (3,3) not food, so new positions [ (3,3) ] + [ (3,4), (3,5) ] = [ (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) ], tail at (3,5)\n\nThen turn 5: from (3,3) dir D, move R to (4,3) not food, positions [ (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) ]\n\nTurn 6: from (4,3) dir R, move R to (5,3) not food, positions [ (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) ]\n\nTurn 7: from (5,3) dir R, move D to (5,2) which has food, eat, so grow, positions [ (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) ]? New head at (5,2), previous head (5,3), then (4,3), (3,3), so length 4.\n\nEaten at turn 7.\n\nBut life span is 10, turn 0 to 10, so eaten at turn 7, fine.\n\nTotal score 3.\n\nNow, if I had moved differently at turn 0, say to (3,2), I might eat (5,2) earlier but later the others.\n\nFor example, turn 0 move D to (3,2), no eat, snake at (3,2) dir D.\n\nTurn 1 move R to (4,2) no eat, dir R.\n\nTurn 2 move R to (5,2) eat, score +1, positions [ (5,2), (4,2) ]? From [ (3,2) ] move to (5,2) via (4,2), but step by step.\n\nAfter turn 0: head at (3,2) dir D.\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,2), not food, so positions [ (4,2) ] since length 1, no tail, so just head at (4,2) dir R.\n\nTurn 2: move R to (5,2), eat, so positions [ (5,2), (4,2) ] head at (5,2) dir R.\n\nThen I need to go to other foods, say (3,4) or (2,5).\n\nFrom (5,2), to (3,4) or (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is farther.\n\nGo to (3,4) first.\n\nFrom (5,2) dir R, can go U to (5,3), L to (4,2) but (4,2) is tail? Positions [ (5,2), (4,2) ], so (4,2) is tail.\n\nMove U to (5,3) not food, positions [ (5,3), (5,2) ] head at (5,3) dir U.\n\nThen move L to (4,3) not food, positions [ (4,3), (5,3) ] dir L.\n\nThen move U to (4,4) not food, positions [ (4,4), (4,3) ] dir U.\n\nThen move L to (3,4) which has food, eat, positions [ (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) ]? Move to (3,4) eat, so new head (3,4), previous head (4,4), tail (4,3), so [ (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) ]\n\nTurns: turn 2 eat at (5,2), turn 3 move to (5,3), turn 4 to (4,3), turn 5 to (4,4), turn 6 to (3,4) eat. So eaten second food at turn 6.\n\nThen to (2,5), from (3,4) dir L (moved left), can go U to (3,5), L to (2,4), D to (3,3) etc.\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), so go U to (3,5) not food, positions [ (3,5), (3,4), (4,4) ]\n\nThen move L to (2,5) eat, but (2,5) to (2,5), from (3,5) move L to (2,5), which is adjacent, eat, positions [ (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4) ]\n\nTurn: turn 7 move to (3,5), turn 8 eat at (2,5).\n\nBut life span 10, turn 8 < 10, fine, score 3.\n\nBut compared to first plan, where I ate first two by turn 2 and third by turn 7, here I ate first at turn 2, second at turn 6, third at turn 8, later.\n\nSimilarly, if I start with L to (2,3), turn 0 no eat, turn 1 to (2,4) no eat, turn 2 to (2,5) eat, then to (3,4) or (5,2).\n\nFrom (2,5) to (3,4) is down-right, but (3,4) might be reachable.\n\nTurn 2: after eat at (2,5), positions [ (2,5), (2,4) ]? From length 1 to 2: [ (2,5), (2,4) ]? When eat, head at (2,5), tail at previous position, which was (2,4), so [ (2,5), (2,4) ] dir U.\n\nThen to (3,4), can go R to (3,5) or D to (2,3) etc.\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), so from (2,5) move R to (3,5) not food, positions [ (3,5), (2,5) ] dir R.\n\nThen move D to (3,4) eat, positions [ (3,4), (3,5), (2,5) ] turn 3 or 4.\n\nTurn 2 eat at (2,5), turn 3 move to (3,5) no eat, turn 4 move to (3,4) eat, so at turn 4 eaten second food.\n\nThen to (5,2), similar path, will take more turns.\n\nSo starting by eating (3,4) first allows faster eating of (2,5).\n\nThus, for turn 0, moving U to eat (3,4) seems optimal.\n\nMoreover, with life span 10, but eating early reduces risk of disappearance, though 10 turns is long.\n\nAlso, in terms of survival, after eating all, I need to survive, but with open space, I can keep moving.\n\nNow, about the internal obstacle: at (3,1), which might affect if I go down, but in the path to (5,2), I can go via (4,2) or (5,3), not necessarily down to y=1.\n\ny=1 is blocked at x=3, but other x are open, so I can go to (5,2) without problem.\n\nSimilarly, no dead ends.\n\nTherefore, at turn 0, I should move U to (3,4) to eat the food.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I need to plan the actions.\n\nThe answer should include actions for turn 0,1,2,3,4,5? Since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", and answer format for multiple turns.\n\nAnswer format: boxed with Turn t: action for each turn.\n\nBut it might not need all turns specified, but since I need to show the plan, I can list for 5 turns or until a point.\n\nIn the state, turn t1=0, so I need to output actions starting from turn 0.\n\nAnd since I have a plan, I can list for several turns.\n\nBut the food life span might affect, but with 10, it should be fine.\n\nIn my initial plan, with move U at turn 0, then turn 1 move L to (2,4), turn 2 move U to (2,5) eat.\n\nThen turn 3, from (2,5) I can move R to (3,5), as before.\n\nThen to (5,2).\n\nBut let's specify the actions.\n\nFirst, at turn 0, action U.\n\nThen turn 1: from (3,4) dir U, I move L to (2,4), action L.\n\nThen turn 2: from (2,4) dir L, I move U to (2,5) to eat, action U.\n\nNow turn 3: from (2,5) dir U, after moving up to (2,5), head dir U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,6), D to (2,4) but (2,4) is body, collision, not allowed; L to (1,5), R to (3,5)\n\n(2,4) is body, not tail, so cannot move there.\n\nU and R and L possible, but L to (1,5) is towards border, x=0 is wall, so (1,5) is ok, but far from (5,2).\n\nBetter to move R to (3,5) to head towards (5,2).\n\nSo move R to (3,5), action R.\n\nThen turn 4: from (3,5) dir R, move D to (3,4)? (3,4) is now empty? Positions: after turn 2, after eating (2,5), positions [ (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) ]\n\nAfter turn 3 move R to (3,5), not food, so new positions [ (3,5) ] + [ (2,5), (2,4) ] = [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ], tail at (2,4)\n\n(3,4) is free.\n\nSo from (3,5), move D to (3,4), not food, action D.\n\nThen turn 5: from (3,4) dir D (moved down), move D to (3,3), not food, action D.\n\n(3,3) should be free.\n\nThen continue to (5,2), but for 5 turns, I have up to turn 5 action.\n\nThe answer should include turn 0 to, say, 5 actions.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, but output the actions for the current and future.\n\nIn the plan, after turn 5, I can go to (4,3) etc., but for the answer, I can list for 5 turns.\n\nPerhaps list the actions for as many as reasonable.\n\nBut let's see the format: it says \"Turn t1: action on turn t1, Turn t1+1: action on turn t1+1, ...\"\n\nSo starting from t1=0.\n\nI can list for 5 turns to show the plan.\n\nNow, in turn 5, at (3,3), which is the start point, but with snake longer.\n\nTo avoid potential issues, but should be fine.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger.\n\nFor example, suppose later, if tail has food and head adjacent, but food is only on cells, and when eaten, it's gone, so unless new food spawns, but here no new food mentioned, only these three.\n\nIn state, foods are given, and no mention of spawning, so I think only these foods exist, and when eaten, gone, or disappear after life span.\n\nBut no spawning, so after eating, no food left, so tail reward danger not applicable.\n\nSo I think U at turn 0 is best.\n\nBut let's confirm if moving U is safe.\n\n(3,4) is not under body, since snake is at (3,3), so moving to (3,4) is fine.\n\nNo risk.\n\nIf I move L or D, I delay eating, which might not be better.\n\nSo I think U is good.\n\nTherefore, for turn 0: U\n\nThen as above, turn 1: L to (2,4)\n\nTurn 2: U to (2,5) eat\n\nTurn 3: R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 4: D to (3,4)\n\nTurn 5: D to (3,3)\n\nBut at turn 4, I move to (3,4), which was previously occupied, but now free.\n\nIn turn 5, move to (3,3), which might be fine.\n\nTo go to (5,2), from (3,3) I can go R to (4,3) on turn 6, etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions.\n\nSince the snake will be at (3,3) on turn 5, and I need to think ahead, but I think this is fine.\n\nTo make it better, from turn 3 at (3,5), instead of moving down, I could move right directly, but (4,5) might be available.\n\n(4,5) no wall, so from (3,5) turn 3, I can move R to (4,5) instead of D to (3,4).\n\nThen from (4,5) go down to (4,4), etc. to (5,2).\n\nBut similar.\n\nIn terms of path, going down first might be shorter to (5,2).\n\nFrom (3,5) to (5,2): delta x +2, delta y -3, so moving down and right.\n\nMoving directly down to (3,4), then (3,3), etc. as before.\n\nMoving right to (4,5), then down to (4,4), (4,3), etc.\n\nSimilar distance.\n\nBut in my initial, moving to (3,4) then (3,3) is fine.\n\nNow for the answer, I'll go with that.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: L\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nBut turn 5 D to (3,3), and from there I can continue.\n\nTo include up to turn 5.\n\nBut let's write the boxed answer.\n\nFirst, current turn t1=0.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: L\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nIn turn 4, move D to (3,4), which is not food, then turn 5 D to (3,3).\n\nAfter that, to reach (5,2), I need to go right, so on turn 6, from (3,3) I can move R to (4,3), and so on.\n\nBut since the food life span is 10, and turn 5, I can eat by turn 7 or 8, fine.\n\nPerhaps I can plan to eat (5,2) earlier, but from the start, it's farther.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 0, move U to eat (3,4), then turn 1, instead of L to (2,4), I could move directly towards (5,2), but (5,2) is down-right, from (3,4) I can move R to (4,4), then D to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut then (2,5) might be left, and I might not eat it before it disappears? Life span 10, from turn 0, turn 10 it disappears.\n\nIf I go to (5,2) first from (3,4), turn 1 move R to (4,4), not food, positions [ (4,4), (3,4) ]? After turn 0 eat, [ (3,4), (3,3) ], move to (4,4) not food, so [ (4,4), (3,4) ] dir R.\n\nThen turn 2 move R to (5,4) not food, positions [ (5,4), (4,4) ]\n\nThen move D to (5,3) not food, positions [ (5,3), (5,4) ]\n\nThen move D to (5,2) eat, turn 4 eat (5,2), score second point.\n\nThen to (2,5), from (5,2) it's far, need to go left and up.\n\nTurn 4 at (5,2), positions after eat [ (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) ]? Move to (5,2) eat, previous head (5,3), tail (5,4)? Positions: before move, [ (5,3), (5,4) ] head (5,3), move to (5,2) eat, so new positions [ (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) ]\n\nThen from (5,2) dir D, move L to (4,2) not food, positions [ (4,2), (5,2), (5,3) ]\n\nThen move U to (4,3) not food, positions [ (4,3), (4,2), (5,2) ]\n\nAnd so on, to (3,3), (2,3), etc. to (2,5), which might take many turns, and (2,5) disappears at turn 10, so I might not reach in time.\n\nFor example, from (4,3) to (2,5): need to go left and up.\n\n(4,3) to (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), 4 moves, but with snake, it takes turns.\n\nTurn 5: from (4,3) move L to (3,3) not food, positions [ (3,3), (4,3), (4,2) ]? Assume previous [ (4,3), (4,2), (5,2) ], move to (3,3), not food, so [ (3,3) ] + [ (4,3), (4,2) ] = [ (3,3), (4,3), (4,2) ]\n\nTurn 6: from (3,3) dir L, move L to (2,3) not food, positions [ (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) ]\n\nTurn 7: from (2,3) dir L, move U to (2,4) not food, positions [ (2,4), (2,3), (3,3) ]\n\nTurn 8: from (2,4) dir U, move U to (2,5) eat, positions [ (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3) ] eat at turn 8, still before turn 10.\n\nSo possible, but later than my first plan where I ate (2,5) at turn 2.\n\nIn first plan, I ate (2,5) at turn 2, then (5,2) at turn 7.\n\nHere, ate (5,2) at turn 4, (2,5) at turn 8, similar, but in first plan I have two foods by turn 2, which might be better for score accumulation.\n\nBut since score is same, survival similar.\n\nBut in first plan, I went to (2,5) directly after (3,4), which is efficient.\n\nTherefore, I think initial plan is better.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll output the actions as I had.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned 5+ turns ahead. The snake starts at position (3,3) with head direction left (L). The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 and an internal obstacle at (3,1). All three food items are positive (value +1) with a life span of 10 turns, meaning they disappear after turn 10 if not eaten.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Immediate Actions**: From (3,3), moving up (U) to (3,4) eats the food immediately, increasing the score by 1 and length to 2. This is safe as (3,4) is not under the snake's body (snake is length 1) and avoids walls.\n- **Avoiding Risks**: \n  - Moving down (D) to (3,2) or left (L) to (2,3) delays eating and may miss opportunities to eat multiple foods efficiently.\n  - After eating (3,4), moving left (L) to (2,4) and then up (U) to (2,5) allows eating the second food quickly by turn 2.\n  - The path to (5,2) is planned via (3,5), (3,4), and (3,3) to avoid body collisions and walls, ensuring the snake can reach it by turn 7 (within the 10-turn life span).\n- **Long-Term Survival**: \n  - Eating (3,4) and (2,5) early maximizes score by turn 2 and keeps the snake in open areas, reducing collision risks.\n  - After turn 5, the snake moves toward (5,2) via safe cells, with no dead ends or trapping scenarios.\n  - Tail reward danger is irrelevant here as no food is on the tail, and the snake avoids positions where this could occur.\n- **Movement Constraints**: \n  - No instant reverse: After moving left, cannot move right next turn, etc.\n  - Wall and obstacle avoidance: All moves steer clear of borders and (3,1).\n\n### Plan for Turns 0 to 5:\n- **Turn 0**: Move U to (3,4) to eat the food (+1 score, length 2). Positions: head (3,4), tail (3,3). Head direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 1**: Move L to (2,4) (no food, safe). Positions: head (2,4), tail (3,4). Head direction becomes L.\n- **Turn 2**: Move U to (2,5) to eat the food (+1 score, length 3). Positions: head (2,5), body (2,4), tail (3,4). Head direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 3**: Move R to (3,5) (no food, safe; avoids moving down to body at (2,4)). Positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), tail (2,4). Head direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 4**: Move D to (3,4) (no food, safe; cell is empty after tail moved). Positions: head (3,4), body (3,5), tail (2,5). Head direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 5**: Move D to (3,3) (no food, safe). Positions: head (3,3), body (3,4), tail (3,5). Head direction becomes D.\n\n### Beyond Turn 5:\n- **Turn 6**: From (3,3), move R to (4,3) to head toward (5,2).\n- **Turn 7**: Move R to (5,3), then D to (5,2) on turn 8 to eat the third food (+1 score) by turn 8, well before it disappears at turn 10.\n\nThis plan eats all three foods by turn 8, maximizing score to 3, and ensures long-term survival by avoiding risks and keeping the snake in open areas.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U \\\\\nTurn 1: L \\\\\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: R \\\\\nTurn 4: D \\\\\nTurn 5: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid because the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6). There's also an internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nCurrent turn is t=1. Snake positions: head at (3,4), body at (3,3), so the snake is only 2 segments long. Head direction is up, which is increasing y.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (5,2) with value 1 and life span 9. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, it will disappear after 9 more turns? Life span is given as 9 at turn 1, so after turn 1, it becomes 8, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears. But at turn 1, it's 9, so it has 9 turns left including this one? Let me read the rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, life_span is the number of turns it will be present, including turn t. So for food at (5,2), life_span=9 at turn 1, meaning it will disappear after turn 9. Similarly for others.\n\n- (2,5) with value 1 and life_span 9\n\n- (3,6) with value 1 and life_span 10\n\nAll food has value +1, so positive food. No negative food here.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nCurrent snake: head (3,4), body (3,3), direction U. So moving up, y increases.\n\nPossible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n\nNo instant reverse: since current direction is U, I cannot move D on the next turn. So from U, possible moves are U, L, R. D is opposite, so not allowed.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid walls and obstacles.\n\nWalls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so I can only be in x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), so I cannot move there.\n\nFood at (5,2), (2,5), (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is directly above the head, since head is at (3,4), moving U would go to (3,5), then (3,6) if I continue U.\n\nBut (3,6) has food with value 1.\n\nIf I move U now, to (3,5), then next turn I could move to (3,6) to eat it.\n\nBut let's see the risks.\n\nFirst, let's list possible actions for turn 1.\n\nCurrent position: head (3,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (3,5)\n\n- D: but D is opposite to current direction U, so not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\" So at turn 1, since direction is U, I cannot choose D.\n\n- L: to (2,4)\n\n- R: to (4,4)\n\nAlso, need to check if these cells are safe: not wall, not body.\n\nBody segments: (3,4) is head, (3,3) is body. So (3,5) is empty, (2,4) empty, (4,4) empty. Walls: (3,5) is y=5, x=3, within 1-6, no wall. Similarly (2,4) and (4,4) are fine. Obstacle at (3,1), not relevant here.\n\nSo possible actions: U, L, R. D not allowed.\n\nNow, if I move U to (3,5), then at turn 2, head at (3,5), body at (3,4) since the tail moves forward? Snake positions: after move, new head position, body follows.\n\nWhen I move, the head moves to new cell, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it. So if I move U to (3,5), new positions: head (3,5), body was (3,4) but since it was the segment behind head, it becomes the new body, and the tail (3,3) might stay or move? Snake has two segments: positions [(3,4), (3,3)] before move. After moving head to (3,5), the body segment that was at (3,4) moves to where? The list: head moves to (3,5), then the first body segment moves to the old head position (3,4), and the tail (3,3) is left, but since snake grows only when eating, if I don't eat, the tail moves off (3,3), so new positions should be [(3,5), (3,4)].\n\nYes, so after moving U without eating, snake is at [(3,5), (3,4)].\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (2,4), new positions [(2,4), (3,4)].\n\nMove R to (4,4), new positions [(4,4), (3,4)].\n\nNow, at (3,5), I can then move to (3,6) to eat the food there.\n\n(3,6) has food with value 1, life_span 10. Since life_span 10 at turn 1, it will be there for 10 turns, so plenty of time.\n\nBut there is a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nIn this case, after moving to (3,5), the snake is at [(3,5), (3,4)], so head at (3,5), tail at (3,4). They are adjacent vertically.\n\nIf at turn 2, I move to (3,6), which has food, I eat it, so snake grows: new head at (3,6), new body segment added, so positions: head (3,6), then the previous head (3,5) becomes body, and previous body (3,4) becomes tail, so [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4)].\n\nNow, the tail is at (3,4). Is there food at (3,4)? No, food is at (3,6), which is eaten, so (3,4) is empty. No issue.\n\nTail Reward Danger only if I eat food that is on the tail cell when head is adjacent to tail.\n\nIn this case, when I move to eat (3,6), the tail is at (3,4), not at (3,6), so no problem.\n\nNow, after eating, snake is longer, and I need to move on.\n\nBut let's think about other options.\n\nFood at (5,2) and (2,5).\n\n(5,2) is at x=5,y=2, which is down-right from head (3,4). Head at (3,4), so to go to (5,2), I need to move right and down.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) is at x=2,y=5, which is left and up.\n\n(3,6) is up.\n\nSince I need to think long-term, I should consider paths to multiple foods.\n\nBut snake is short now, only length 2, so eating is good to grow.\n\nAlso, avoid dying.\n\nNow, the grid: let me sketch a mental grid.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nWalls at borders, obstacle at (3,1).\n\nFood: (5,2), (2,5), (3,6)\n\nSnake: head (3,4), body (3,3)\n\nDirection U.\n\nFor turn 1, actions: U, L, R.\n\nIf I move U to (3,5): then at (3,5), I can next move to (3,6) to eat, or to other directions.\n\nIf I move to (3,6) on turn 2, I eat, grow to length 3.\n\nThen from (3,6), I need to move somewhere. Possible moves from (3,6): U, but y=6, U would be y=7, which is wall, so cannot move U. D to (3,5), but (3,5) is now body? After eating at (3,6), snake is at [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4)], so (3,5) is body, so moving D to (3,5) would collide with body. L to (2,6), or R to (4,6).\n\n(2,6) and (4,6) should be empty.\n\nAlso, (3,6) is top row, y=6.\n\nAfter eating at turn 2, at turn 3, head at (3,6), direction from previous move was U to (3,6), so direction U.\n\nThen possible moves: cannot U (wall), cannot D (opposite? Current direction U, but moving D is opposite, so not allowed? No instant reverse rule.\n\nAfter moving to (3,6) with U, direction is U, so at turn 3, I cannot move D, because D is opposite to U.\n\nSimilarly, I can move L or R.\n\nL to (2,6), R to (4,6).\n\nIf I move L to (2,6), then snake positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), (3,5), etc.\n\nThen from there, I can go to food at (2,5), which is down from (2,6), but (2,5) has food.\n\nBut when I move to (2,5), I eat it, but need to check Tail Reward Danger.\n\nFirst, let's sequence.\n\nIf at turn 1, I move U to (3,5).\n\nTurn 1: move U to (3,5), no eat, so snake: [(3,5), (3,4)]\n\nFood at (3,6) still there.\n\nTurn 2: from (3,5), direction U (since moved U last), I can move U to (3,6) to eat, or L to (2,5)? (2,5) is not adjacent, adjacent cells: from (3,5), U to (3,6), D to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, cannot, L to (2,5), R to (4,5).\n\n(2,5) has food, (4,5) empty.\n\nBut if I move U to (3,6), I eat food there.\n\nAssume I do that.\n\nTurn 2: move U to (3,6), eat food, snake grows to length 3: positions [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 3: at (3,6), possible moves: U not possible (wall), D not possible (opposite to current direction U and also body at (3,5)), L to (2,6), R to (4,6)\n\nBoth possible.\n\nSay I move L to (2,6), no food there, so snake moves to [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] — tail (3,4) is gone? When moving without eating, head to (2,6), body segments: the first body segment (3,6) moves to where head was? No: the segment that was behind head moves to the head's old position.\n\nPositions before move: head (3,6), body1 (3,5), body2 (3,4)\n\nAfter moving head to (2,6), the body1 (3,5) moves to old head position (3,6), and body2 (3,4) moves to old body1 position (3,5). So new positions: head (2,6), body1 (3,6), body2 (3,5)\n\nTail is at (3,5).\n\nNow, food at (2,5) is below (2,6), and (2,5) has food.\n\nTurn 4: from (2,6), direction is L (since I moved L last), so current direction L.\n\nPossible moves: from (2,6), U not possible (y=7 wall), D to (2,5), L to (1,6)? x=1, which is within 1-6, but x=1 is not wall, walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to 6 are playable, y=1 to 6. Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cells like (1,6) are fine.\n\nSimilarly, R to (3,6) but (3,6) is body now, cannot.\n\nSo from (2,6), possible moves: D to (2,5), L to (1,6), R not possible (body), U not possible (wall).\n\nCurrent direction is L, so moving R would be opposite, not allowed anyway.\n\nSo I can move D to (2,5) or L to (1,6).\n\n(2,5) has food, so if I move D to (2,5), I eat it.\n\nNow, head at (2,6), tail at (3,5). Are they adjacent? (2,6) and (3,5) are not adjacent; adjacent means sharing side, so (2,6) neighbors: (2,5), (2,7) invalid, (1,6), (3,6). (3,6) is body, not tail. Tail is (3,5), which is down-right, not adjacent directly. So not adjacent.\n\nWhen I move to (2,5), I eat the food there, so snake grows: new head at (2,5), add body, so positions: head (2,5), then previous head (2,6) becomes body, then (3,6) becomes body, then (3,5) is tail? Let's list: before move, positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), body (3,5)\n\nAfter moving head to (2,5) and eating, new head (2,5), then new body segment at (2,6), so positions: head (2,5), body1 (2,6), body2 (3,6), body3 (3,5)\n\nNow, tail is at (3,5).\n\nNo immediate danger.\n\nBut this is one path.\n\nBack to turn 1 choices.\n\nI could go for (2,5) directly or other food.\n\nAnother food is at (5,2).\n\nBut (5,2) is farther.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, all food has similar value, so I should eat the closest or safest.\n\nBut (3,6) is very close, only one move away after moving up.\n\nIn terms of turns: to eat (3,6), I need to move to (3,5) then (3,6), so eat at turn 2.\n\nTo eat (2,5), from head (3,4), if I move L to (2,4) at turn 1, then at turn 2, I can move U to (2,5) to eat, since (2,5) is above (2,4)? (2,4) to (2,5) is U, yes.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (4,4) at turn 1, then I can go towards (5,2), but that might take more turns.\n\nFirst, let's evaluate options for turn 1.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (3,5) at turn 1. Then at turn 2, I can:\n\n- Move U to (3,6) to eat food. Then as above, I can go to (2,6) or (4,6), etc.\n\n- Or move L to (2,5) to eat food there, but from (3,5), moving L to (2,5) is possible, and (2,5) has food.\n\nIf at turn 1, I move U to (3,5), no eat.\n\nTurn 2: from (3,5), I move L to (2,5) to eat (2,5) food.\n\nAfter move, head to (2,5), eat, grow: positions before move: head (3,5), body (3,4)\n\nAfter moving to (2,5), new head (2,5), new body at (3,5), so positions [(2,5), (3,5)], and the tail (3,4) is gone, but since I ate, I add a segment, so new positions: head (2,5), body (3,5), and since I ate, I keep the tail, so snake grows to length 3: head (2,5), then previous head (3,5) becomes body, and previous body (3,4) becomes tail? Standard: when not eating, tail moves off. When eating, tail stays and new segment added.\n\nBefore move: positions [(3,5), (3,4)] length 2.\n\nMove head to (2,5), which has food, so eat: new head (2,5), then the body segment is added at the position where the tail was? No.\n\nWhen eating, the head moves to the food cell, and a new body segment is added at the previous tail position, so the tail doesn't move, and the snake grows.\n\nSo positions: before move, head (3,5), tail (3,4)\n\nAfter move: head to (2,5), new segment added at old tail position (3,4), so the body is extended. New positions: head (2,5), then the previous head (3,5) is now body, and new segment at (3,4), so [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nTail at (3,4).\n\nNow, from (2,5), I can move to other places.\n\nBut in this case, I ate (2,5) at turn 2.\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved directly to (2,5) earlier.\n\nBut at turn 1, from (3,4), if I move L to (2,4), then at turn 2, I can move U to (2,5) to eat.\n\nLet's compare sequences.\n\nFirst, prioritize (3,6) because it's directly in path when moving up.\n\nBut when I eat (3,6), I'm at top row, which might be limiting.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) is near the top-left.\n\n(5,2) is bottom-right.\n\nSince life spans are long (9,9,10 turns), I have time, but I should eat soon to grow the snake for more flexibility.\n\nAnother thing: the obstacle at (3,1), which might block paths to (5,2) if I go down.\n\nLet's think about the grid layout.\n\nList all cells:\n\nAssume x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to6.\n\nWalls: all cells with x=0,7 or y=0,7 are walls, so not playable. Playable: x=1-6, y=1-6.\n\nInternal obstacle: (3,1), so (3,1) cannot be entered.\n\nFood: (5,2), (2,5), (3,6)\n\nSnake: (3,4), (3,3)\n\nHead direction U.\n\nNow, for turn 1, possible actions and consequences.\n\nAction U: move to (3,5)\n\nThen at (3,5), I have choices.\n\n- Move U to (3,6): eat at turn 2, grow to length 3 at (3,6)\n\n- Move L to (2,5): eat at turn 2, grow at (2,5)\n\n- Move R to (4,5): no eat, then from there.\n\nAction L: move to (2,4)\n\nThen at (2,4), I can move U to (2,5) to eat at turn 2, or D to (2,3), or L to (1,4), etc.\n\nAction R: move to (4,4)\n\nThen can move to (5,4), etc. towards (5,2).\n\nBut (5,2) is at y=2, so I need to go down.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can move D to (4,3), then (4,2) or (5,2), etc.\n\nBut let's think about long-term survival.\n\nAfter eating one food, snake is longer, and I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, if I go to (3,6) and eat, I'm at top row with fewer moves.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) is not corner, but after eating there, I can go down or left.\n\n(5,2) is near obstacle, might be tricky.\n\nAlso, the food at (3,6) has life span 10, others 9, so it lasts longer, but all have many turns.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns, let's plan a sequence.\n\nOption: move U at turn 1 to (3,5)\n\nThen at turn 2, instead of eating (3,6), I could move L to (2,5) to eat that, but (2,5) is available.\n\nAt turn 1, if I move U to (3,5), then at turn 2, moving L to (2,5) eats (2,5), which is fine.\n\nBut (3,6) is still there, I can eat it later.\n\nBut after eating at (2,5), I'm at (2,5), which is closer to other areas.\n\nLet's simulate a few turns.\n\nFirst, let's consider going for (3,6) first.\n\nTurn 1: move U to (3,5)  // no eat\n\nTurn 2: move U to (3,6)  // eat, now length 3, positions [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 3: at (3,6), can move L to (2,6) or R to (4,6)\n\nSay move L to (2,6)  // no eat, positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), body (3,5)\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 4: from (2,6), can move D to (2,5) or L to (1,6)\n\n(2,5) has food, so move D to (2,5) to eat? But (2,5) has food, and I can eat it.\n\nMove D to (2,5): eat, grow to length 4.\n\nPositions before move: head (2,6), body (3,6), body (3,5)\n\nAfter move head to (2,5), eat, new head (2,5), new body at old tail position? When eating, new segment added at tail.\n\nBefore move, tail is at (3,5)\n\nAfter moving head to (2,5) and eating, new head (2,5), then the previous head (2,6) becomes body, previous body (3,6) becomes body, and new segment added at (3,5), so positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nNow, head at (2,5), tail at (3,5)\n\nFrom here, I can move to other places, like to (1,5) or (2,4), etc.\n\nBut (3,5) is body, so from (2,5), possible moves: U to (2,6) but (2,6) is body, cannot; D to (2,4); L to (1,5); R to (3,5) body, cannot.\n\nSo D or L.\n\nDirection last move was D (to (2,5)), so current direction D.\n\nThen can move D or L or R, but R to (3,5) body, not possible, U opposite to D, not allowed. So only D to (2,4) or L to (1,5).\n\n(2,4) is empty, (1,5) empty.\n\nFood at (5,2) still there.\n\nBut I have eaten two foods, score +2, snake length 4.\n\nNow, to get to (5,2), I need to go right and down.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (3,1), which might block the path to (5,2) if I go down.\n\nFrom (2,5), if I move D to (2,4), then to (2,3), etc., but (2,3) is ok, then to (2,2), but (5,2) is at x=5.\n\nSo I need to move right eventually.\n\nOr from (1,5) if I move L.\n\nBut let's not go too deep.\n\nAnother option at turn 1: move L to (2,4)\n\nTurn 1: move L to (2,4)  // no eat, positions [(2,4), (3,4)] , direction L.\n\nTurn 2: from (2,4), can move U to (2,5) to eat (2,5), or D to (2,3), or L to (1,4)\n\nMove U to (2,5): eat, grow to length 3: positions [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4)]\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen from (2,5), similar as before, can move U to (2,6) or D to (2,4) but (2,4) is body, cannot, or L to (1,5), R to (3,5)\n\n(3,5) might be empty or not, in this case, after turn 2, positions [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4)], so (3,5) is empty.\n\nSo can move R to (3,5) or U to (2,6), etc.\n\nThen I can go towards (3,6) or other.\n\nBut (3,6) is still there.\n\nIf I move U to (2,6), then similar.\n\nOr I can go to (3,6) from (2,5) by moving R to (3,5), then U to (3,6).\n\nAt turn 3 from (2,5), move R to (3,5), no eat, positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), body (2,4)? Before move: head (2,5), body (2,4), body (3,4)\n\nAfter move head to (3,5), no eat, so new positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), body (2,4) — the tail (3,4) is gone, so [(3,5), (2,5)]? Let's see: head moves to (3,5), the first body segment moves to old head position (2,5), and the second body segment moves to old first body position (2,4), so positions [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]\n\nThen turn 4, from (3,5), can move U to (3,6) to eat, or other.\n\nMove U to (3,6): eat, grow to length 4, positions [(3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)] or something.\n\nSimilar to before.\n\nBut in this case, I ate (2,5) first at turn 2, then (3,6) at turn 4.\n\nWhereas if I went directly to (3,6), I ate at turn 2.\n\nBut with the first approach, eating (3,6) at turn 2, then (2,5) at turn 4, I have eaten two foods by turn 4.\n\nIn the second, ate (2,5) at turn 2, then (3,6) at turn 4, same.\n\nBut in the first, when I ate (3,6) at turn 2, I was at top row, which might be riskier.\n\nFor example, after being at (3,6), I had only two choices, L or R.\n\nWhereas if I eat (2,5) first, I'm at (2,5) which has more options.\n\n(2,5) has neighbors: U (2,6), D (2,4), L (1,5), R (3,5), all possible unless occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) has only L and R possible, U wall, D body or opposite direction.\n\nSo (2,5) is better position.\n\nMoreover, there is food at (5,2) which is in the bottom-right.\n\nIf I go to (3,6) first, I might be far from (5,2).\n\nWhereas if I go to (2,5) or start by moving left, I might be closer to (5,2) via down.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can go down to (2,4), (2,3), etc.\n\nBut (5,2) is at x=5, so I need to move right.\n\nAlso, the obstacle at (3,1) might affect paths to (5,2).\n\nFor example, from (3,4), if I move R to (4,4), then I can go down to (4,3), (4,2), then to (5,2).\n\n(4,2) to (5,2) is adjacent.\n\nBut (4,2) is at y=2, x=4.\n\nFrom head (3,4), move R to (4,4) at turn 1.\n\nThen turn 2, from (4,4), direction R, can move R to (5,4), or U to (4,5), or D to (4,3), etc.\n\n(5,2) is at y=2, so I need to go down.\n\nMove D to (4,3) at turn 2.\n\nThen turn 3, from (4,3), move D to (4,2), then turn 4, move R to (5,2) to eat.\n\nSo eat at turn 4.\n\nBut (5,2) has life span 9, at turn 1, so at turn 4 it is still there (life span decreases, at turn 1:9, turn2:8, turn3:7, turn4:6, so yes).\n\nNow, compare to going for (3,6): eat at turn 2, or for (2,5) eat at turn 2.\n\nBut when I eat (5,2) at turn 4, I have score +1, whereas if I ate (3,6) at turn 2, I have +1 by turn 2.\n\nBut long-term, I might get all.\n\nBut I need to avoid risks.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (3,1) might create a dead end if I go down to bottom row.\n\nFor example, if I go to (4,2), then to (5,2), after eating, I'm at (5,2), which is near bottom, y=2.\n\nThen from there, I need to move, but (5,2) has neighbors: U (5,3), D (5,1), but y=1 is wall? Walls at y=0, so y=1 is playable? Border walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to 6 are playable.\n\ny=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 is the bottom row, playable.\n\nSimilarly, x=1 left, x=6 right.\n\nSo from (5,2), can move U to (5,3), D to (5,1), L to (4,2), R to (6,2).\n\n(6,2) is x=6, which is playable, x=6 not wall, x=7 wall.\n\nx=6 is ok.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (3,1), but (5,1) is ok.\n\nHowever, if I go down, I might be near the obstacle.\n\nBut since snake is short, it might be ok.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat multiple foods.\n\nNow, all foods are positive, so I should eat them all if possible.\n\nBut with the snake growing, I need to have space.\n\nAlso, the life spans: (3,6) life 10, (2,5) and (5,2) life 9, so (3,6) lasts longer, I can eat it later.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) and (5,2) might disappear earlier if not eaten.\n\nLife span at turn 1: (5,2) life 9, so it disappears after turn 9, meaning on turn 10 it's gone. Similarly for others.\n\nSince current turn 1, I have until turn 9 for (5,2) and (2,5), turn 10 for (3,6).\n\nSo I have time.\n\nBut to be efficient, I should eat the closer one first.\n\n(3,6) is very close: after one move to (3,5), then eat at (3,6).\n\n(2,5) is also close: move L to (2,4), then U to (2,5), eat at turn 2.\n\n(5,2) is farther, eat at turn 4 if I go directly.\n\nSo (3,6) and (2,5) are both good options.\n\nBut (3,6) is directly above, and moving up is consistent with current direction.\n\nMoreover, if I don't move up, I might miss the chance or something.\n\nBut let's think about the Tail Reward Danger for (3,6).\n\nIn the first scenario, when I eat (3,6), it was not on tail, so no danger.\n\nAnother point: food can spawn under body, but here no food under body, all are free.\n\nPositions: snake at (3,4) and (3,3), food at (5,2), (2,5), (3,6), all empty.\n\n(3,6) is not under snake.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should move U to (3,5) at turn 1, then at turn 2, I can choose to eat (3,6) or (2,5), depending on which is better.\n\nBut at (3,5), (2,5) is adjacent left, (3,6) adjacent up.\n\nBoth can be eaten at turn 2.\n\nIf I eat (2,5), I'm at (2,5), which has more freedom.\n\nIf I eat (3,6), I'm at corner.\n\nSo for long-term survival, eating (2,5) might be better.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 1 I move L to (2,4), then at turn 2 I eat (2,5) easily.\n\nBut let's see the direction.\n\nAt turn 1, if I move L to (2,4), direction L.\n\nThen turn 2, move U to (2,5), direction U, not opposite, ok.\n\nThen I'm at (2,5) with length 3.\n\nThen I can go to (3,6) by moving R to (3,5) then U to (3,6), as before.\n\nBut that takes two more turns to eat (3,6).\n\nWhereas if I move U at turn 1 to (3,5), then at turn 2 I can eat either (3,6) or (2,5) directly.\n\nAt (3,5), I can eat (2,5) by moving L, or (3,6) by moving U.\n\nIf I eat (2,5), I leave (3,6) for later.\n\nBut (3,6) is at top, and after eating, I might have to move away.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) is not corner.\n\nMoreover, there is food at (5,2) to consider.\n\nTo reach (5,2) from current position, moving right might be better.\n\nFor example, if I move R at turn 1 to (4,4), then I can go down to (4,3), (4,2), then to (5,2) at turn 4.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other foods.\n\nBut (2,5) and (3,6) are far, so I might not eat them before they disappear if I go for (5,2) first.\n\nLife span 9 and 10, so at turn 4, (2,5) has life 9-3=6 turns left? At turn 1, life 9, turn 2:8, turn3:7, turn4:6, so still 6 turns, plenty.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) has 10-3=7 at turn 4.\n\nSo I can eat (5,2) at turn 4, then go to (2,5) or (3,6).\n\nBut from (5,2) to (2,5) is far, need to go left and up.\n\nGrid size 6x6, so from (5,2) to (2,5) is 3 left, 3 up, but with snake body, it might be blocked.\n\nSince snake is short, it might be ok.\n\nBut let's decide on turn 1 action.\n\nI think moving U to (3,5) is safe and allows flexibility at turn 2.\n\nSimilarly, moving L to (2,4) also good for eating (2,5).\n\nMoving R to (4,4) for (5,2).\n\nBut to prioritize long-term, I should eat one food quickly to grow.\n\nEating (3,6) or (2,5) at turn 2 is faster than eating (5,2) at turn 4.\n\nSo better to go for the closer foods.\n\nBetween (3,6) and (2,5), (2,5) might be better position.\n\nAlso, (3,6) is at y=6, top row, which has fewer escape routes.\n\nFor example, if I eat at (3,6), and then move to (2,6) or (4,6), I'm on the top row, and if the snake is long, it might be risky.\n\nBut now snake is short, so not immediate problem.\n\nBut thinking ahead, it might be better to avoid corners.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) is not corner; it has 4 neighbors.\n\n(2,5) has U (2,6), D (2,4), L (1,5), R (3,5), all playable.\n\nWhereas (3,6) has only L (2,6), R (4,6), U wall, D might be body or not.\n\nSo (2,5) is better.\n\nTherefore, for turn 1, I should move in a way to eat (2,5) at turn 2.\n\nSo either move U to (3,5) then L to (2,5), or move L to (2,4) then U to (2,5).\n\nBoth work.\n\nBut if I move L directly to (2,4) at turn 1, then at turn 2 I move U to (2,5) to eat.\n\nWith one move, I'm closer.\n\nIf I move U to (3,5) at turn 1, then at turn 2 I move L to (2,5) to eat, same number of moves.\n\nBut by moving L at turn 1, I'm at (2,4), which is not eating, then at turn 2 I eat.\n\nSimilarly with U then L.\n\nBut in terms of position, after turn 1, if I move L to (2,4), I'm at left side, which might be ok.\n\nBut let's see the answer format; I need to output multiple turns.\n\nThe answer should be a sequence of actions for the next few turns, but since it's \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I need to plan a sequence, but the output is actions for each turn starting from t1.\n\nThe format is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: action\nTurn 2: action\n...\n}\n\nBut how many turns? It says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions for the turns.\n\nPerhaps I need to output actions for t1, t2, t3, etc., but not necessarily 5, just the immediate actions based on 5+ turns thinking.\n\nSince the state changes, I think I need to output for the current turn and perhaps a few more, but the format shows \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so for multiple turns.\n\nBut in practice, for AI, I output the action for current turn, then for next turns it might change based on new state.\n\nBut here, since it's a simulation, I need to provide a sequence.\n\nThe instruction says: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action on turn t1, Turn t1+1: action on turn t1+1, ... }\"\n\nAnd \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should provide a sequence of at least 5 turns or so.\n\nBut the state will change after each action, so I need to simulate.\n\nPerhaps I can plan a sequence for 5 turns.\n\nLet me plan for 5 turns from turn 1.\n\nTurn 1: possible actions U, L, R.\n\nI think moving L to (2,4) is good to target (2,5).\n\nThen turn 2: from (2,4), move U to (2,5) to eat.\n\nThen turn 3: at (2,5), with length 3, direction U (since moved U), can move U to (2,6) or L to (1,5) or R to (3,5), etc.\n\nSay move R to (3,5) to go towards (3,6).\n\nTurn 4: from (3,5), move U to (3,6) to eat.\n\nThen turn 5: at (3,6), move L to (2,6) or R to (4,6), say L to (2,6).\n\nThen after that, I can go down or something.\n\nBut I have eaten two foods by turn 4.\n\nThen I need to go to (5,2).\n\nFrom (2,6) at turn 5, I can move down to (2,5), but (2,5) is body or not.\n\nAfter turn 4: ate (3,6) at turn 4, so positions after turn 4: head at (3,6), body at (3,5), body at (2,5)? Let's sequence.\n\nTurn 1: move L to (2,4)  // no eat, snake [(2,4), (3,4)] , direction L\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,5)  // eat (2,5), grow to length 3: positions [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4)]  (since new head (2,5), body (2,4), and new segment at old tail (3,4)? When eating, new segment added at tail position.\n\nBefore move: head (2,4), tail (3,4)\n\nMove head to (2,5), eat, so new head (2,5), new body segment added at (3,4), and the previous segment (2,4) is now body, so positions: head (2,5), body (2,4), body (3,4)\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 3: move R to (3,5)  // no eat, positions: head to (3,5), body moves to (2,5), body moves to (2,4), so new positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), body (2,4)\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 4: move U to (3,6)  // eat (3,6), grow to length 4: new head (3,6), new body segment added at old tail (2,4)? Before move, positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), body (2,4), tail at (2,4)\n\nMove head to (3,6), eat, so new head (3,6), the previous head (3,5) becomes body, body (2,5) becomes body, and new segment added at (2,4), so positions: head (3,6), body (3,5), body (2,5), body (2,4)\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 5: at (3,6), can move L to (2,6) or R to (4,6)\n\nSay move L to (2,6)  // no eat, positions: head to (2,6), body to (3,6), body to (3,5), body to (2,5), so [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)] and tail (2,4) gone.\n\nNew positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), body (3,5), body (2,5)\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nNow, I have eaten two foods, score +2, length 4.\n\nFood at (5,2) still there.\n\nFrom here, I need to go to (5,2), which is at (5,2), so from (2,6), I can move down to (2,5) but (2,5) is body, cannot, or to (1,6), or D to (2,5) not possible, only L to (1,6) or from (2,6), moves: U wall, D to (2,5) body, L to (1,6), R to (3,6) body, so only L to (1,6) possible.\n\nThen from (1,6), I can move D to (1,5), etc., but it will take many turns to reach (5,2).\n\nNot efficient.\n\nIf at turn 3, after eating (2,5), I go down instead of right.\n\nTurn 3 from (2,5): instead of moving R to (3,5), I move D to (2,4) or L to (1,5).\n\nBut (2,4) is body? Positions after turn 2: [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4)], so (2,4) is body, so from (2,5), cannot move D to (2,4), can move L to (1,5) or U to (2,6) or R to (3,5).\n\nIf I move U to (2,6), then I can go to (3,6) later, but similar issue.\n\nTo reach (5,2), I should have gone right earlier.\n\nAnother plan: at turn 1, move R to (4,4) to go towards (5,2).\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,4)  // no eat, positions [(4,4), (3,4)] , direction R\n\nTurn 2: from (4,4), can move R to (5,4), or U to (4,5), or D to (4,3), etc.\n\nMove D to (4,3) to go down.\n\nTurn 3: from (4,3), move D to (4,2)  // no eat, positions head (4,2), body (4,3), body (4,4)? Before move: head (4,3), body (4,4), tail (3,4) gone? After turn 2: positions [(4,4), (3,4)] after move to (4,4), then turn 2 move D to (4,3): head to (4,3), body to (4,4), so positions [(4,3), (4,4)]\n\nThen turn 3 move D to (4,2): head to (4,2), body to (4,3), positions [(4,2), (4,3)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 4: move R to (5,2)  // eat (5,2), grow to length 3: new head (5,2), body (4,2), new segment at old tail (4,3)? Before move, tail at (4,3), so new positions: head (5,2), body (4,2), body (4,3)\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen I have eaten (5,2) at turn 4.\n\nThen I can go to other foods.\n\nBut (2,5) and (3,6) are far.\n\nFrom (5,2), I can move U to (5,3), then left, etc.\n\nBut it will take time.\n\nAnd (2,5) might disappear soon if not eaten.\n\nAt turn 4, (2,5) life span: at turn 1:9, turn2:8, turn3:7, turn4:6, so still 6 turns, from (5,2) to (2,5) is distance |5-2| + |2-5| = 3+3=6, so I can reach in 6 moves, but with snake body, it might be tight.\n\nBut possible.\n\nSimilarly for (3,6).\n\nBut to maximize, I should eat the closer ones first.\n\nSo back to the first approach with moving left or up.\n\nPerhaps at turn 1, move U to (3,5), then at turn 2, move L to (2,5) to eat, so I eat at turn 2.\n\nThen at (2,5), I can move R to (3,5) at turn 3, then U to (3,6) at turn 4 to eat.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nOr from (2,5), I can move D to (2,4) if possible, but (2,4) is body after eating, so not possible immediately.\n\nAfter eating at (2,5), positions [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4)] for example, so (2,4) body, so from (2,5), can move U to (2,6), L to (1,5), or R to (3,5).\n\nMoving R to (3,5) is towards center.\n\nThen from there to (3,6) or down.\n\nBut for (5,2), I need to go down and right.\n\nSo at turn 3 from (2,5), move R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 4 from (3,5), instead of moving U to (3,6), I could move D to (3,4) but (3,4) is body or not.\n\nAfter turn 3 move to (3,5), positions [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)] or something.\n\nLet's not complicate.\n\nI think for turn 1, moving U to (3,5) is a good start, then at turn 2, I can decide to eat (2,5) for better position.\n\nSince I need to output a sequence, I'll assume that.\n\nBut let's include the food at (3,6) in the plan.\n\nAnother idea: move U at turn 1 to (3,5)\n\nThen at turn 2, move U to (3,6) to eat quickly.\n\nThen at turn 3, move R to (4,6) for example.\n\nThen turn 4, from (4,6), move D to (4,5), etc.\n\nThen I can go down to (4,2), then to (5,2).\n\nBut from (4,6) to (4,5) to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut (2,5) is left, might not eat it.\n\nLife span 9, at turn 4, it has 6 turns left, from (4,6) to (2,5) is |4-2| + |6-5| =2+1=3, so I can reach in 3 moves, but with snake body, it might be possible.\n\nBut let's choose a sequence.\n\nI think the best is to eat (2,5) first for better mobility.\n\nSo for turn 1, move L to (2,4) or move U then L.\n\nBut to save a move, move directly.\n\nTurn 1: move L to (2,4)\n\nThen turn 2: move U to (2,5) to eat\n\nThen turn 3: move R to (3,5)  // no eat\n\nTurn 4: move U to (3,6) to eat\n\nTurn 5: from (3,6), move R to (4,6)  // no eat\n\nThen at turn 6, I can move D to (4,5), etc. towards (5,2).\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output 5 turns or so.\n\nSince turn 1, output turn 1 to say turn 5.\n\nBut after turn 4, I ate (3,6), so at turn 5, from (3,6), move to (4,6) or (2,6).\n\nSay move to (4,6) to go right.\n\nThen from there, I can go down.\n\nFor (5,2), I can reach it later.\n\nThe sequence seems reasonable.\n\nIf I move U at turn 1, then L at turn 2 to eat (2,5), same thing.\n\nBut in terms of direction, moving L at turn 1 might be fine.\n\nCurrent direction is U, moving L is allowed.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 1):**\n- **Grid**: 7x7 playable area (x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6), with walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (3,1).\n- **Snake**: Head at (3,4), body at (3,3), length 2, direction U (up). Moving up increases y.\n- **Food**:\n  - (5,2): Value +1, life span 9 (disappears after turn 9).\n  - (2,5): Value +1, life span 9 (disappears after turn 9).\n  - (3,6): Value +1, life span 10 (disappears after turn 10).\n- **Constraints**: No instant reverse (cannot move down on turn 1 due to current direction U). Must avoid walls, obstacle, and body collisions.\n\n**Key Considerations for 5+ Turns Ahead:**\n- **Prioritize survival and long-term score**: Eat food to grow the snake, but avoid risky positions like corners or dead ends. Growing early provides more flexibility.\n- **Food accessibility**: \n  - (2,5) is reachable in 2 turns (via left then up) and positions the snake centrally with more movement options.\n  - (3,6) is reachable in 2 turns (up then up) but places the snake on the top row (y=6), reducing escape routes and increasing risk.\n  - (5,2) is farther (4+ turns) and near the obstacle at (3,1), requiring careful pathing. Life spans are long (9-10 turns), so it can be targeted later.\n- **Risk assessment**: \n  - Eating (3,6) first risks confinement on the top row with only left/right moves, potentially leading to traps as the snake grows.\n  - Eating (2,5) first keeps the snake in a more open area (y=5, x=2), with access to up, down, left, or right moves.\n  - No Tail Reward Danger issues here, as no food is under the tail and head-tail adjacency isn't problematic when eating.\n- **Efficiency**: Eating closer food first ( (2,5) or (3,6) ) by turn 2 scores faster than targeting (5,2) by turn 4. After eating one food, the snake grows to length 3, improving reach.\n- **Obstacle awareness**: (3,1) blocks direct paths downward, so moving down early is less efficient. Focus on horizontal or upward moves first.\n- **Sequence goal**: \n  - Turn 1-2: Eat (2,5) for early growth and better positioning.\n  - Turn 3-4: Eat (3,6) while it still has high life span.\n  - Turn 5+: Head toward (5,2) via safe path, avoiding dead ends.\n\n**Planned Sequence (Turns 1-5):**\n1. **Turn 1 (t1=1)**: Move left (L) to (2,4).  \n   - Why: Avoids the top row risk of moving up directly. Positions snake for efficient (2,5) eat on turn 2. Current direction U allows L (not reverse). (2,4) is safe (empty, no walls).\n2. **Turn 2 (t1+1=2)**: Move up (U) to (2,5) and eat food.  \n   - Why: Eats (2,5) for +1 score, grows to length 3. (2,5) is safe and central. Direction from L allows U (not reverse).\n3. **Turn 3 (t1+2=3)**: Move right (R) to (3,5).  \n   - Why: Moves toward (3,6) and avoids body ( (2,4) is now body, so only U, R, or L possible; U to (2,6) or L to (1,5) are less direct). (3,5) is safe and sets up (3,6) eat.\n4. **Turn 4 (t1+3=4)**: Move up (U) to (3,6) and eat food.  \n   - Why: Eats (3,6) for +1 score, grows to length 4. Life span 10 ensures it's available. Direction from R allows U (not reverse).\n5. **Turn 5 (t1+4=5)**: Move right (R) to (4,6).  \n   - Why: After eating (3,6), the snake is on top row; moving right avoids left (which could lead to corner) and starts path toward (5,2). (4,6) is safe (empty, no walls). Direction from U allows R (not reverse).\n\n**Beyond Turn 5**:  \n- Target (5,2) by moving down from (4,6) (e.g., to (4,5), (4,4), etc.), eating by turn 8-9. Life spans allow this ( (5,2) disappears after turn 9).  \n- Monitor food life spans: If new food spawns, adjust path to prioritize high-value/low-risk options.  \n- Avoid reverse moves and always check adjacency before eating to prevent Tail Reward Danger.\n\nThis sequence scores +2 by turn 4, grows the snake to length 4, and maintains high mobility. Moving to (2,5) first instead of (3,6) avoids top-row confinement, aligning with long-term survival.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 1\\text{: L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 2\\text{: U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 3\\text{: R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4\\text{: U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5\\text{: R}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but I need to confirm the coordinates. Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except for internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: there's one at (3,1). So (3,1) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (2,4), and body is at (3,4). Since it's a list with two positions, the snake has a length of 2. Head is at (2,4), tail is at (3,4).\n\nHead direction is L, which means left. So the snake is moving left.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (5,2) with life span 8 and value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (2,5) with life span 8 and value +1\n\n- (3,6) with life span 9 and value +1\n\nAll food is positive; no negative food mentioned. Value is +1 for all, so all are good to eat.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=2.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the accessible cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6. But (3,1) is an obstacle, so it's blocked.\n\nSo playable cells: all except (3,1) and the walls.\n\nNow, snake: head at (2,4), moving left, so it came from the right. Positions: [(2,4), (3,4)], so head is (2,4), tail is (3,4). Since it's moving left, the previous head was at (3,4), and it moved left to (2,4), so tail is at (3,4).\n\nCurrent direction is L, so next move can be U, D, or L, but not R because that would be instant reverse. Head direction L means it's facing left, so it can move left, up, or down, but not right immediately.\n\nPossible moves from (2,4):\n\n- Left (L): to (1,4)\n\n- Up (U): to (2,5)\n\n- Down (D): to (2,3)\n\nCannot go right to (3,4) because that's where the tail is, but moving to tail is allowed only if it doesn't cause collision, but since the tail will move, it might be safe.\n\nCollision rules: if head moves to a body segment, it dies, except for the tail, because the tail moves away. So moving to the current tail position is safe because after the move, the tail will advance, so no collision.\n\nIn this case, from (2,4), moving to (3,4) where the tail is: after move, head is at (3,4), tail was at (3,4) but since the snake moves, the tail will move to where the second segment was, but there is only one body segment, so tail will move to the previous position of the head? Let's think.\n\nSnake positions: before move: head (2,4), body (3,4)\n\nAfter moving head to a new position:\n\n- If head moves to (1,4), then new positions: head (1,4), body (2,4) — tail at (2,4)\n\n- If head moves to (2,5), new positions: head (2,5), body (2,4) — tail at (2,4)\n\n- If head moves to (2,3), new positions: head (2,3), body (2,4) — tail at (2,4)\n\n- If head moves to (3,4), which is current tail: new positions would be head at (3,4), but (3,4) was the tail, so the body should be (2,4), so positions: head (3,4), body (2,4) — tail at (2,4). And since (3,4) is no longer occupied by tail, it's safe. No collision because the tail moved to (2,4).\n\nIn general, moving to the tail cell is safe as long as the tail is the only segment there, which it is, since length is 2.\n\nBut in this case, moving right to (3,4) is possible, but head direction is L, and moving right would be opposite, so instant reverse is not allowed. Head direction is L, so it cannot move right immediately. So R is invalid.\n\nTherefore, possible actions: L (to (1,4)), U (to (2,5)), D (to (2,3))\n\nNow, food locations:\n\n- (5,2) at turn 2, life span 8, so disappears after turn 10? Life span decreases each turn, including current. So at turn t, food has life span L, it disappears after L turns from now? Let's see.\n\nLife span is given at current turn. For example, (5,2) has life span 8 at turn 2. So it will disappear after 8 turns, meaning on turn 10 it will be gone? Countdown decreases every turn.\n\nAt turn t, life span N, then at turn t+1, it becomes N-1, and so on, until N=0, it disappears. So when life span reaches 0, it's gone.\n\nSo for (5,2): life span 8 at turn 2, so at turn 3:7, turn4:6, ..., turn9:1, turn10:0, disappears after turn 10? At turn 10, if life span is 0, it should be gone before or after the turn?\n\nThe rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nLet's read carefully: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at the start of turn t, if food has life span S, after the turn, S decreases by 1. When S reaches 0, after the decrease, it disappears.\n\nStandard way: at the beginning of turn, countdown is S, during the turn it can be eaten, at the end of turn, S decreases by 1. If S was 1, after decrease to 0, it disappears.\n\nBut the rule says \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so for food present at turn t with life span N, after turn t, life span becomes N-1, and so on.\n\nIt can be eaten on any turn as long as life span >0.\n\nFor (5,2) at turn 2, life span 8: it can be eaten from turn 2 to turn 9, since after turn 9, life span becomes 0 and it disappears. At turn 9, life span is 1, can be eaten, then after eaten or not, at end of turn, life span decreases to 0 and disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) life span 8 at turn 2, same.\n\n(3,6) life span 9 at turn 2, so can be eaten up to turn 10.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for multiple turns. The answer should be actions for turn 2, turn 3, etc., but since it's a sequence, I need to decide for turn 2 first, then based on that, for turn 3, and so on.\n\nBut I have to think ahead 5+ turns.\n\nAlso, food can spawn under body, but in this case, no food is under the snake now. Snake is at (2,4) and (3,4), food at (5,2), (2,5), (3,6), none under snake.\n\n(2,5) is above the head, (3,6) is up-right, (5,2) is far.\n\nFirst, from current position (2,4), possible moves: L to (1,4), U to (2,5), D to (2,3)\n\nI need to evaluate each option.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving Up to (2,5). (2,5) has food! (2,5) is a food position with value +1.\n\nIf I move to (2,5), I eat the food. Since it's positive, snake length increases by 1.\n\nCurrent snake length: 2 segments. After eating, length becomes 3.\n\nPositions: before move: head (2,4), body (3,4)\n\nMove head to (2,5): since food is eaten, tail doesn't move, so new positions: head at (2,5), then the body: the segment that was at (2,4) moves to where head was? Standard snake movement: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nBut when eating, head moves to food cell, a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail stays, and a new segment is added.\n\nRule: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n\nSo when you eat food, the snake grows: head moves to the food cell, and the tail remains in place, so a new segment is added at the tail position.\n\nFor example, positions before: [head, segment1, ..., tail]\n\nAfter moving and eating: head moves to new position (food cell), and tail stays, so the new tail is the old tail, and a new segment is added? No.\n\nTypically, in snake, when you eat, the head moves to the food, and the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one cell.\n\nPositions: suppose snake: [A, B] where A is head, B is tail.\n\nMove to new cell C: if no food, new positions [C, A] , so B is removed.\n\nIf C has food, eat it, so new positions [C, A, B], so tail is still B, and length increased.\n\nIn this case, before move: head (2,4), tail (3,4)\n\nMove to (2,5): (2,5) has food, so after move: head at (2,5), then the previous head becomes body, so (2,4) is now body, and tail remains at (3,4), so positions: [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4)] , length 3.\n\nYes.\n\nIf no food, move to (2,5), no eat, so positions: head (2,5), body (2,4), tail at (2,4)? No: from [ (2,4), (3,4) ] move to (2,5), no eat, so head moves to (2,5), body moves to previous head position (2,4), so positions: [ (2,5), (2,4) ], and (3,4) is no longer part of snake. So tail moves.\n\nBut here, since (2,5) has food, we eat, so tail stays, positions: [ (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) ]\n\nNow, after eating, head is at (2,5), and direction was L, but now we moved U, so new head direction is U? Head direction changes based on the move.\n\nThe head direction is given as current, but after move, it depends on the action.\n\nIn this case, if I move U to (2,5), I eat the food, snake grows to length 3.\n\nBut is there any danger? Tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nBut here, the food is at (2,5), which is not the tail; tail is at (3,4). Head at (2,4) is adjacent to (2,5)? (2,5) is above (2,4), so adjacent, but (2,5) is not the tail; tail is at (3,4). The food is at (2,5), which we are moving to, so it's not on the tail.\n\nTail reward danger only if the food is on the tail cell and head is adjacent to it, then moving to eat it would cause collision because after eating, tail grows and head is on the same cell or something.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSo, in this case, tail is at (3,4), and it has food? No, the food is at (2,5), not on the tail. So no issue.\n\nHead is adjacent to tail? Current head (2,4) and tail (3,4) are adjacent horizontally, but tail cell (3,4) does not have food; food is elsewhere. So no problem.\n\nSo moving U to (2,5) is safe and I eat the food.\n\nNow, after that, head at (2,5), and I have to choose next move.\n\nBut let's see other options.\n\nIf I move L to (1,4): no food there, so just move, positions: head (1,4), body (2,4), tail at (2,4)? Before: [ (2,4), (3,4) ] move to (1,4), no food, so new positions: [ (1,4), (2,4) ], length 2.\n\nThen head at (1,4), direction L.\n\nIf move D to (2,3): no food, positions: [ (2,3), (2,4) ], head at (2,3), direction D.\n\nNow, eating the food at (2,5) seems good, but I need to think long-term. There is another food at (3,6) and (5,2).\n\n(3,6) is at (3,6), which is above and right.\n\nAlso, after eating at (2,5), I am at (2,5) with length 3.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nI should map the positions.\n\nLet me sketch a grid:\n\ny=6: ... (3,6) has food\n\ny=5: (2,5) has food\n\ny=4: head (2,4), tail (3,4)\n\ny=3: ...\n\ny=2: (5,2) has food\n\ny=1: but (3,1) is obstacle, so row y=1 has cells (1,1),(2,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1) missing (3,1)\n\nx from 1 to 6.\n\nWalls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so we can be at (1,1) to (6,6), except (3,1) blocked.\n\nNow, from (2,4), if I move U to (2,5), I eat the food, score +1, length 3, head at (2,5).\n\nThen from (2,5), possible moves: U to (2,6), D to (2,4), L to (1,5), R to (3,5)\n\nCurrent head direction after move U is U, so cannot move D immediately (instant reverse).\n\nSo possible: U, L, R.\n\n(2,4) is now body, since positions after eat: [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4)], so body at (2,4) and (3,4).\n\nIf I move D to (2,4), (2,4) is a body segment, so collision, death. Cannot move down.\n\nMove U to (2,6): no food, positions move: head to (2,6), body: (2,5) moves to (2,4)? After move, if no eat, head to (2,6), then the segment at (2,5) moves to where head was, but since we moved, the body follows.\n\nPositions: current [ (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) ]\n\nMove head to (2,6): if no food, new positions: head (2,6), then body: (2,5) becomes second, (2,4) becomes third, so [ (2,6), (2,5), (2,4) ], and (3,4) is removed? No: when moving without eating, the tail moves away.\n\nFrom positions [H, B1, B2] = [ (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) ]\n\nMove head to new cell, say C.\n\nIf C has no food, new positions: [C, H, B1] = [C, (2,5), (2,4)] , so B2 (3,4) is removed.\n\nIf C has food, new positions: [C, H, B1, B2] = [C, (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)] , tail B2 stays.\n\nIn this case, (2,6) has no food, so if move to (2,6), new positions: head (2,6), body (2,5), body (2,4), so tail at (2,4), and (3,4) is free.\n\nSimilarly, move L to (1,5): no food, positions: [ (1,5), (2,5), (2,4) ]\n\nMove R to (3,5): no food, positions: [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ]\n\nNow, from (2,5), moving U to (2,6) is possible, or L to (1,5), or R to (3,5).\n\nBut there is food at (3,6), which is above.\n\n(3,6) is at (3,6), so from (2,5), I can go to (3,5) then to (3,6) to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) is far.\n\nBut food at (2,5) will be eaten if I move there, so it will be gone.\n\nNow, back to turn 2 decision.\n\nIf I don't eat (2,5) now, I could eat it later, but life span is 8, so it will be there for a while.\n\nBut eating it now gives immediate score.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nAnother food is at (3,6), which is close.\n\nIf I move U to (2,5) now, I eat it, but then I am at (2,5) with length 3.\n\nThen I can go to (3,6) from there.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can move R to (3,5), then U to (3,6) to eat (3,6).\n\n(3,6) has food, life span 9, so plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) is at (5,2), which is down-right.\n\nBut with internal obstacle at (3,1), it might be tricky to reach.\n\nNow, what if I don't eat (2,5) now?\n\nFor example, if I move L to (1,4).\n\nThen at (1,4), no food, positions: [ (1,4), (2,4) ]\n\nHead direction L.\n\nThen from (1,4), possible moves: U to (1,5), D to (1,3), L to (0,4) but x=0 is wall, cannot move there. So cannot move L.\n\nx=0 is wall, so from (1,4), can move U to (1,5), D to (1,3), or R to (2,4) but (2,4) is body, so cannot, or if I move R, it would be to (2,4), which is the body segment.\n\nPositions: after move to (1,4), snake is [ (1,4), (2,4) ], so (2,4) is body.\n\nMoving to (2,4) would be collision, since it's a body segment. Cannot move right.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nMove U to (1,5): (1,5) no food, so positions: [ (1,5), (1,4) ]\n\nOr move D to (1,3): no food, positions: [ (1,3), (1,4) ]\n\nThen from there, I might go to (2,5) later, but it's not efficient.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D from (2,4) to (2,3), then at (2,3), no food, positions [ (2,3), (2,4) ], head D.\n\nThen can move L to (1,3), R to (3,3), D to (2,2), or U to (2,4) but (2,4) is body, cannot.\n\nU to (2,4) is body, so only L, R, D.\n\n(2,2) might be near the obstacle, but (3,1) is blocked.\n\nNot much there.\n\nSo moving to (2,5) seems best for immediate gain, and it's safe.\n\nBut let's consider the tail reward danger for other food or future.\n\nNo issue now.\n\nAnother thing: after eating (2,5), I am at (2,5), and I want to go to (3,6).\n\nFrom (2,5), I can move R to (3,5), then U to (3,6) to eat.\n\nBut (3,6) has food, so when I move to (3,6), I eat it, snake grows to length 4.\n\nBut is there danger? Head at (3,6), after eating.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nFirst, turn 2: move U to (2,5), eat food, score +1, positions: [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4)]\n\nHead direction now U.\n\nTurn 3: from (2,5), move R to (3,5). (3,5) no food, so move head to (3,5), no eat, so positions: head (3,5), then body: (2,5) moves to (2,4)? Positions: [ (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) ] move head to (3,5) no food.\n\nNew head (3,5), then the segment that was head becomes body, so (2,5) becomes body, then (2,4) becomes body, and (3,4) is tail, but since no eat, tail moves away, so new positions: [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ], tail at (2,4), (3,4) free.\n\nHead at (3,5), direction R (since moved right).\n\nTurn 4: from (3,5), move U to (3,6). (3,6) has food, so eat, grow. Positions: head to (3,6), then add new segment? When eat, head moves to food, tail stays.\n\nCurrent positions: [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ]\n\nMove head to (3,6): has food, so eat, new positions: head (3,6), body (3,5), body (2,5), body (2,4), so [ (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ], length 4.\n\nScore another +1.\n\nNow, head at (3,6), direction U.\n\nThen from here, I can go to other places.\n\nBut there is also food at (5,2), which is at (5,2), down-left.\n\nBut I need to avoid walls and obstacles.\n\nAlso, after eating (3,6), I am at (3,6), and the grid has walls.\n\nNow, what about the internal obstacle at (3,1), so row y=1 is partially blocked.\n\nBut (5,2) is at y=2, x=5.\n\nFrom (3,6), I can move to (4,6), (2,6), (3,5), etc., but (3,5) is body now, so cannot move there.\n\nPositions: [ (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ], so (3,5) and (2,5) and (2,4) are body.\n\nFrom (3,6), possible moves: U to (3,7) but y=7 is wall, cannot. D to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, collision. L to (2,6), R to (4,6), or down but blocked.\n\nSo only L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n\nSay move R to (4,6), no food, positions: head to (4,6), no eat, so new positions: [ (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5) ], tail at (2,5), (2,4) removed? Since no eat, tail moves.\n\nFrom [ (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ] move head to (4,6) no food, new head (4,6), then body: (3,6) becomes second, (3,5) becomes third, (2,5) becomes fourth, and (2,4) removed. So positions: [ (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5) ], tail at (2,5).\n\nHead at (4,6), direction R.\n\nThen I can go down or left, etc.\n\nBut (5,2) is at (5,2), so I need to go down.\n\nBut with the snake body, it might get in the way.\n\nI should think if there are risks.\n\nAnother thing: food at (2,5) and (3,6) are eaten quickly, but (5,2) has life span 8 at turn 2, so it will be there until turn 9 or 10, plenty of time.\n\nBut after eating (3,6), I am at (3,6) with length 4, and I need to navigate to (5,2).\n\nPath: from (4,6), I can move to (5,6), then (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) but (5,2) is at y=2, so down.\n\nBut (5,6) to (5,5) etc., but there might be body segments.\n\nBut I can go directly down on x=5.\n\nBut let's see the current state.\n\nPerhaps I should consider not eating (2,5) immediately to have more flexibility, but eating it gives score and growth, which might be good for long-term if I can eat more.\n\nBut with growth, the snake is longer, harder to maneuver.\n\nBut at length 4, on a 6x6 grid minus obstacle, it's manageable.\n\nAnother food: (5,2) is the only one left, but there might be new food spawning? The state doesn't say anything about new food; it only gives current food. I think we have to assume that only these foods are present, and no new ones, or do they spawn? The rules don't specify food spawning; only the given foods.\n\nIn the input, it has food positions, so I think for this scenario, only these three foods, and they have life spans.\n\nSo after eating (2,5) and (3,6), only (5,2) left.\n\nLife span: (5,2) life span 8 at turn 2, so at turn 10 it disappears, but we can eat it before.\n\nNow, from turn 2, if I eat (2,5), then (3,6), by turn 4 I have eaten two, score 2, length 4.\n\nThen from (3,6), turn 4, I go to (4,6), as above.\n\nThen turn 5: from (4,6), possible moves: D to (4,5), L to (3,6) but (3,6) is body, cannot, U cannot (wall), R to (5,6), or down to (4,5).\n\nSay move R to (5,6), no food, positions: head to (5,6), new positions: [ (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) ], tail at (3,5).\n\n(2,5) was tail but removed.\n\nHead at (5,6), direction R.\n\nTurn 6: from (5,6), move D to (5,5), no food, positions: [ (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) ], tail at (3,6)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (5,4), no food, positions: [ (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6) ]\n\nTurn 8: move D to (5,3), no food, positions: [ (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6) ]\n\nTurn 9: move D to (5,2), (5,2) has food, eat it, grow to length 5.\n\nPositions: before move: [ (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6) ]\n\nHead to (5,2), eat, so new positions: [ (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6) ]\n\nScore +1, total score 3.\n\nAnd all food eaten.\n\nBut is this safe? When moving to (5,2), no issue.\n\nBut in turn 9, (5,2) has life span: at turn 2, life span 8, so turn 3:7, t4:6, t5:5, t6:4, t7:3, t8:2, t9:1, so at turn 9, it can be eaten, then after, life span decreases to 0, disappears.\n\nSo yes, eaten on turn 9.\n\nBut in this path, I ate all three foods, score 3.\n\nNow, what if I don't go directly? But this seems fine.\n\nBut at the beginning, if I move to (2,5) on turn 2, I eat it, but (2,5) is also adjacent to the future path, but in this case, it worked.\n\nBut let's see if I can eat (3,6) first or something.\n\nAnother option: from (2,4), instead of moving U, I move to (2,3) or (1,4), but that delays eating.\n\nFor example, if I move D to (2,3) on turn 2.\n\nThen at (2,3), no food, positions [ (2,3), (2,4) ]\n\nThen turn 3: from (2,3), can move L to (1,3), R to (3,3), D to (2,2), or U to (2,4) but body, cannot.\n\nSay move R to (3,3), no food, positions [ (3,3), (2,3) ]\n\nThen I can go to (3,6) or (2,5).\n\n(3,6) is above, (2,5) is up-left.\n\nFrom (3,3), move U to (3,4), but (3,4) was tail, but now it's free, no food, positions: head to (3,4), no eat, new [ (3,4), (3,3) ]\n\nThen U to (3,5), no food, positions [ (3,5), (3,4) ]\n\nThen U to (3,6), eat, grow, positions [ (3,6), (3,5), (3,4) ] length 3.\n\nBut I missed (2,5), and it might disappear later, but life span 8, so at turn 2, I can eat it later.\n\nBut on turn 2, if I move D, I don't eat immediately, so I might eat (2,5) on a later turn.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), I can go to (2,5) but (2,5) has food, but at that time, snake might be different.\n\nBut in this path, by turn 5 or so, I eat (3,6), but (2,5) is still there.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move L to (2,5) to eat it.\n\nBut (2,5) is at (2,5), from (3,5) move L to (2,5), eat, grow.\n\nBut it takes more turns.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) is far.\n\nBut with longer snake, it might be harder to reach (5,2) without colliding.\n\nIn the first path, by going directly, I ate all with no problem.\n\nBut in the first path, when I was at (3,6) with length 4, I moved to (4,6), then to (5,6), down to (5,2).\n\nBut when I moved down from (5,6) to (5,5), (5,4), etc., the body was following vertically, so no issue.\n\nBut at (5,6), when I move down, the body is at (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), so when I move to (5,5), body moves to (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), so (3,5) is removed, etc.\n\nNo collision.\n\nSimilarly, eating (5,2) is fine.\n\nBut is there a risk with the obstacle? (3,1) is blocked, but I am at (5,2), which is above it, no issue.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger, but not applicable here.\n\nSo the sequence seems good.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, but since the state might change, I have to specify a sequence based on current knowledge.\n\nThe answer should be a sequence of actions starting from turn 2.\n\nBut after each action, the state changes, so I need to plan a path.\n\nSince no new food and no other changes, I can plan the whole path to eat all food.\n\nIn this case, eating (2,5) first, then (3,6), then to (5,2).\n\nBut to reach (5,2) from (3,6), I went via (4,6), (5,6), then down.\n\nFrom (3,6), I could go down, but (3,5) is body, so only left or right.\n\nI went right to (4,6).\n\nThen to (5,6), then down.\n\nBut from (5,6), I could go directly to (5,5), etc.\n\nNow, for the action sequence.\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 3: from (2,5), move R to (3,5)  // since I want to go to (3,6)\n\nIn turn 3, after turn 2 move U, head at (2,5), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,6), L to (1,5), R to (3,5), cannot D.\n\nI move R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 4: from (3,5), move U to (3,6) to eat.\n\nHead direction after R is R, so moving U is fine.\n\nTurn 5: after eating (3,6), head at (3,6), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: L to (2,6), R to (4,6), cannot U (wall) or D (body).\n\nI move R to (4,6)\n\nTurn 6: head at (4,6), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,7) wall, D to (4,5), L to (3,6) body, R to (5,6)\n\nMove R to (5,6)\n\nTurn 7: head at (5,6), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,7) wall, D to (5,5), L to (4,6) body, R to (6,6)\n\nMove D to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: head at (5,5), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,6) body, D to (5,4), L to (4,5), R to (6,5)\n\nMove D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: head at (5,4), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,5) body, D to (5,3), L to (4,4), R to (6,4)\n\nMove D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 10: head at (5,3), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,4) body, D to (5,2), L to (4,3), R to (6,3)\n\nMove D to (5,2) to eat food.\n\nNow, at turn 10, (5,2) has life span: at turn 2, life span 8, so turn 9:1, turn 10:0? Let's compute life span.\n\nAt turn t=2, (5,2) life span 8.\n\nAfter each turn, life span decreases by 1.\n\nAfter turn 2, life span becomes 7 (for turn 3)\n\nBetter: at the start of turn, life span is given, and decreases after the turn.\n\nBut for eating, during the turn, if life span >0, can be eaten.\n\nAt turn 2: life span 8\n\nAfter turn 2, life span 7\n\nTurn 3: life span 7\n\nAfter turn 3, life span 6\n\n...\n\nTurn 9: life span (8 - (9-2) )? From turn 2 to turn 9, 7 turns passed? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, life span S.\n\nAfter turn t, S decreases to S-1.\n\nSo at turn 2: S=8\n\nAfter turn 2: S=7 (for turn 3)\n\nTurn 3: S=7\n\nAfter turn 3: S=6\n\nTurn 4: S=6\n\n...\n\nTurn 9: at start of turn 9, S = 8 - (9-2) = 8-7=1? From turn 2 to turn 9, inclusive? No.\n\nNumber of decreases: from after turn 2 to after turn 8, 7 decreases, so at turn 9, S=8-7=1.\n\nThen after turn 9, S=0, disappears.\n\nSo at turn 9, S=1, can be eaten.\n\nAt turn 10, if not eaten, S=0, gone.\n\nIn my sequence, I eat at turn 10? Turn 10: at turn 10, if life span was 0, cannot eat.\n\nAt turn 9, S=1, can be eaten on turn 9.\n\nIn my earlier plan, I moved to (5,2) on turn 9? Let's list the turns.\n\nTurn 2: move to (2,5) eat\n\nTurn 3: move to (3,5)\n\nTurn 4: move to (3,6) eat\n\nTurn 5: move to (4,6)\n\nTurn 6: move to (5,6)\n\nTurn 7: move to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: move to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: move to (5,3) // but (5,2) is at (5,2), so I moved to (5,3) on turn 9, not to (5,2)\n\nMistake.\n\nOn turn 9, head at (5,4), move D to (5,3)\n\nThen on turn 10, head at (5,3), move D to (5,2)\n\nBut at turn 10, (5,2) might be gone.\n\nAt turn 10, if life span decreased to 0 after turn 9, so at turn 10, it is gone.\n\nLife span:\n\nAfter turn 2: S=7\n\nTurn 3: S=7\n\nAfter turn 3: S=6\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 8: S=8 - 6 =2? Let's calculate:\n\nStart turn 2: S=8\n\nAfter turn 2: S=7\n\nStart turn 3: S=7\n\nAfter turn 3: S=6\n\nStart turn 4: S=6\n\nAfter turn 4: S=5\n\nStart turn 5: S=5\n\nAfter turn 5: S=4\n\nStart turn 6: S=4\n\nAfter turn 6: S=3\n\nStart turn 7: S=3\n\nAfter turn 7: S=2\n\nStart turn 8: S=2\n\nAfter turn 8: S=1\n\nStart turn 9: S=1\n\nAfter turn 9: S=0, disappears\n\nStart turn 10: S=0, not present.\n\nSo on turn 9, S=1, can be eaten.\n\nOn turn 10, S=0, cannot be eaten.\n\nIn my sequence, on turn 9, I moved to (5,3), not to (5,2).\n\nI need to reach (5,2) by turn 9.\n\nIn the path: on turn 7, I was at (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: from (5,5) move D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: from (5,4) move D to (5,3) — but (5,3) is not food, I should move to (5,2) directly if possible.\n\nFrom (5,4), on turn 9, I can move D to (5,3) or to (5,2)? (5,2) is below (5,3)? y decreases down, I think.\n\nCoordinates: D is (x,y-1), so down decreases y.\n\n(5,4) to D is (5,3), then to (5,2).\n\nBut from (5,4), I can move directly to (5,3), but (5,2) is one step down from (5,3).\n\nI need to be at (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nOn turn 7: at (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: move D to (5,3) — but (5,3) is empty, then turn 10 to (5,2) but gone.\n\nFrom (5,4) on turn 8, I can move D to (5,3) on turn 8? No.\n\nLet's list positions:\n\nTurn 7: head at (5,5) after move from (5,6) to (5,5) on turn 7.\n\nTurn 7 action: move D to (5,5), head now at (5,5)\n\nThen turn 8: from (5,5), move D to (5,4)\n\nHead at (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: from (5,4), move D to (5,3) — but (5,3) is not food, and I need to go to (5,2)\n\nBut (5,2) is adjacent, so on turn 9, I can move directly to (5,2) from (5,4)? No, (5,4) to (5,3) is down, then (5,3) to (5,2) down.\n\nFrom (5,4), moving to (5,3) or to (4,4) etc., but not directly to (5,2).\n\nI need to be at (5,3) on turn 9 to move to (5,2) on turn 10, but on turn 10 it's gone.\n\nTo eat on turn 9, I need to be at (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nSo I need to reach (5,2) by turn 9.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 6: at (5,6)\n\nTurn 7: move to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: move to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: move to (5,3) — but (5,3) is not (5,2)\n\nFrom (5,4) on turn 8, I could move down to (5,3), but on turn 8, head at (5,4) after move from (5,5) to (5,4) on turn 8.\n\nTimeline:\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,5) — head at (2,5)\n\nTurn 3: move R to (3,5) — head at (3,5)\n\nTurn 4: move U to (3,6) — head at (3,6)\n\nTurn 5: move R to (4,6) — head at (4,6)\n\nTurn 6: move R to (5,6) — head at (5,6)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (5,5) — head at (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (5,4) — head at (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: from (5,4), move D to (5,3) — head at (5,3)\n\nBut (5,3) not food, and (5,2) is below, so turn 10 move to (5,2) but gone.\n\nTo eat on turn 9, I need to be at (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nSo from (5,6) on turn 6, I need to get to (5,2) in 3 moves: turn 7,8,9.\n\nFrom (5,6) to (5,2) is 4 steps down: (5,6) to (5,5) to (5,4) to (5,3) to (5,2)\n\nSo in 3 moves, I can only reach (5,3) by turn 8? Let's see:\n\nAfter turn 6: at (5,6)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (5,5) — at (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (5,4) — at (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: move D to (5,3) — at (5,3)\n\nThen turn 10: move D to (5,2) but gone.\n\nTo be at (5,2) on turn 9, I need to start moving down earlier.\n\nFor example, from (4,6) on turn 5, instead of going to (5,6), go down.\n\nOn turn 5: at (4,6) after move from (3,6) to (4,6)\n\nFrom (4,6), possible moves: D to (4,5), or R to (5,6), etc.\n\nIf on turn 5, I move D to (4,5)\n\nThen head at (4,5)\n\nTurn 6: from (4,5), move D to (4,4) or R to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut I need to go to (5,2).\n\n(4,5) to (5,2) is not direct.\n\nPerhaps go to (5,5) first.\n\nTurn 5: from (4,6) move D to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 6: from (4,5) move R to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 7: from (5,5) move D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 8: from (5,4) move D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 9: from (5,3) move D to (5,2) — but on turn 9, at (5,3), move to (5,2), eat on turn 9.\n\nYes.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 5: at (4,6), move D to (4,5)  // instead of R to (5,6)\n\nTurn 6: from (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6) body, D to (4,4), L to (3,5), R to (5,5)\n\nMove R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 7: from (5,5), move D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 8: from (5,4), move D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 9: from (5,3), move D to (5,2) eat\n\nIn this case, on turn 9, I eat (5,2).\n\nNow, back to turn 2.\n\nIn this adjusted path, I still eat (2,5) on turn 2, (3,6) on turn 4, then to (4,5) on turn 5, (5,5) on turn 6, (5,4) on turn 7, (5,3) on turn 8, (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nBut on turn 8, I move to (5,3), which is fine.\n\nIn the first part, same.\n\nNow, to output the actions.\n\nBut the answer should start from turn 2.\n\nI think this is fine.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (3,6) first without eating (2,5), but (2,5) is closer, and I might miss it if not eaten early.\n\nFor example, from (2,4), turn 2 move U to (2,5) eat.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nNow, for the action sequence, I need to specify for several turns.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many, but since I need to think ahead, maybe 5 or more turns.\n\nIn this case, from turn 2 to turn 9, but I can list up to where I eat the last food.\n\nSince the grid is small, I can list the sequence.\n\nBut let's confirm if all moves are valid.\n\nAnother thing: in the path to (5,2), I have to avoid the obstacle at (3,1), but I am on x=5, y from 6 to 2, no issue.\n\nNow, tail reward danger: not applicable.\n\nAlso, when moving, no collisions.\n\nSo this seems good.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: D  // from (4,6) to (4,5)\n\nIn turn 5, after turn 4, head at (3,6), move R to (4,6) on turn 5? Turn 4: move U to (3,6) eat, so after turn 4, head at (3,6)\n\nThen turn 5: from (3,6) move R to (4,6)\n\nThen turn 6: from (4,6) move D to (4,5)  // in the adjusted path for food timing\n\nIn the adjusted path:\n\nTurn 2: U to (2,5) eat\n\nTurn 3: R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 4: U to (3,6) eat\n\nTurn 5: R to (4,6)  // I moved R to (4,6) in both, but in the adjusted, from (4,6) I move D to (4,5) on turn 6? Let's list.\n\nAfter turn 4: head at (3,6)\n\nTurn 5 action: move R to (4,6)  // head to (4,6)\n\nThen turn 6: from (4,6), move D to (4,5)  // to go down\n\nThen turn 7: from (4,5), move R to (5,5)  // since (5,5) not food, but to go to x=5\n\nThen turn 8: from (5,5), move D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: from (5,4), move D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 10: from (5,3), move D to (5,2) but on turn 10, (5,2) gone.\n\nMistake.\n\nIn turn 9, I need to be at (5,2).\n\nFrom (5,5) on turn 8? Let's see positions:\n\nTurn 5: at (4,6)\n\nTurn 6: at (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: at (5,5)  // from (4,5) move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: from (5,5) move D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: from (5,4) move D to (5,3) — still not (5,2)\n\nFrom (5,4) to (5,2) is two moves, so on turn 9 I can only reach (5,3) from (5,4).\n\nTo reach (5,2) on turn 9, I need to be at (5,3) on turn 8.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 7: at (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (5,4) — at (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: move D to (5,3) — at (5,3)\n\nNot (5,2).\n\nTurn 7: at (5,5), move D to (5,4) on turn 8? Actions:\n\nTurn 7 action: from (5,5)? No.\n\nStart turn 7: head at (5,5) after turn 6 or 7 action.\n\nDefine:\n\nAfter turn 6: head position.\n\nTurn 6 action: e.g. from (4,5) move to (5,5), so after turn 6, head at (5,5)\n\nThen turn 7 action: from (5,5) move D to (5,4) — after turn 7, head at (5,4)\n\nTurn 8 action: from (5,4) move D to (5,3) — after turn 8, head at (5,3)\n\nTurn 9 action: from (5,3) move D to (5,2) — but at turn 9, head moves to (5,2), which has food, eat on turn 9.\n\nYes! On turn 9, I move to (5,2) and eat.\n\nBecause at turn 9, life span 1, can be eaten.\n\nIn this case, after turn 8, head at (5,3), then turn 9 move to (5,2) eat.\n\nNow, back to the sequence with the down path.\n\nTo have head at (5,5) on turn 6.\n\nHow to get to (5,5) by turn 6.\n\nFrom turn 4: at (3,6)\n\nTurn 5: move to (4,6) or to (4,5), etc.\n\nIf turn 5: move to (4,6)\n\nThen turn 6: from (4,6) move to (5,6) or to (4,5)\n\nTo reach (5,5) by turn 6, not possible directly.\n\nTurn 5: at (3,6), move to (4,6) — at (4,6)\n\nTurn 6: from (4,6) move to (5,6) — at (5,6) on turn 6\n\nThen turn 7: move to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: move to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: move to (5,3) // then turn 10 to (5,2) gone.\n\nIf on turn 5, from (3,6) move directly down, but cannot, only left or right.\n\nMove to (2,6) or (4,6).\n\nSay move to (4,6) on turn 5.\n\nThen on turn 6, from (4,6) move D to (4,5)\n\nThen on turn 7, from (4,5) move R to (5,5) — at (5,5) on turn 7\n\nThen turn 8: from (5,5) move D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: from (5,4) move D to (5,3) // not (5,2)\n\nThen turn 10: move to (5,2) gone.\n\nTo be at (5,3) on turn 8, then turn 9 to (5,2).\n\nSo from (5,5) on turn 7, move to (5,4) on turn 8, at (5,4) on turn 8, then turn 9 to (5,3), not (5,2).\n\nFrom (5,5) on turn 7, move directly to (5,4) on turn 8, but I need to be at (5,3) on turn 8 to move to (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nSo on turn 7, at (5,5), move D to (5,4) on turn 7 action? Turn 7 action from (5,5) to (5,4), at (5,4) after turn 7.\n\nThen turn 8 action: from (5,4) move D to (5,3) — at (5,3) after turn 8\n\nTurn 9 action: from (5,3) move D to (5,2) eat at turn 9.\n\nPerfect.\n\nAnd at turn 9, (5,2) has life span 1, can be eaten.\n\nNow, how to be at (5,5) on turn 7.\n\nFrom turn 4: at (3,6)\n\nTurn 5: move R to (4,6) — at (4,6)\n\nTurn 6: from (4,6) move R to (5,6) — at (5,6)\n\nTurn 7: from (5,6) move D to (5,5) — at (5,5)\n\nThen turn 8: from (5,5) move D to (5,4) — at (5,4)\n\nIn turn 7, at (5,6) move D to (5,5), at (5,5) after turn 7.\n\nThen turn 8: from (5,5) move D to (5,4) — at (5,4) after turn 8\n\nThen turn 9: from (5,4) move D to (5,3) — at (5,3) after turn 9\n\nThen turn 10: move to (5,2) gone.\n\nNot reaching (5,3) on turn 8.\n\nTo have at (5,4) on turn 8, I need to be at (5,5) on turn 7, which I am.\n\nBut from (5,5) on turn 8, move to (5,4), at (5,4) on turn 8.\n\nThen from (5,4) on turn 9, move to (5,3), at (5,3) on turn 9.\n\nThen from (5,3) on turn 10, move to (5,2) but gone.\n\nI need to be at (5,3) on turn 8 to move to (5,2) on turn 9.\n\nSo on turn 8, head at (5,3).\n\nThen turn 9 move to (5,2).\n\nHow to be at (5,3) on turn 8.\n\nFor example, on turn 7, at (5,5), move D to (5,4) on turn 7 action, at (5,4) after turn 7.\n\nThen turn 8 action: from (5,4) move D to (5,3) — at (5,3) after turn 8.\n\nThen turn 9 action: from (5,3) move D to (5,2) eat.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, to be at (5,4) on turn 7.\n\nFrom turn 6: at (5,6) or at (4,5), etc.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 5: move to (4,6)  // at (4,6)\n\nTurn 6: move to (5,6)  // at (5,6)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (5,5)  // at (5,5) after turn 7\n\nTurn 8: move D to (5,4)  // at (5,4) after turn 8\n\nTurn 9: move D to (5,3)  // at (5,3) after turn 9\n\nTurn 10: move D to (5,2) but gone.\n\nAfter turn 7: at (5,5)\n\nTurn 8 action: move D to (5,4) — after turn 8, at (5,4)\n\nTurn 9 action: move D to (5,3) — after turn 9, at (5,3)\n\nNot at (5,3) on turn 8.\n\nTo be at (5,3) on turn 8, I need to be at (5,4) on turn 7.\n\nSo on turn 7, head at (5,4).\n\nHow to be at (5,4) on turn 7.\n\nFor example, on turn 6, at (5,5) or (4,4), etc.\n\nTurn 5: at (4,6)\n\nTurn 6: from (4,6) move D to (4,5)  // at (4,5) after turn 6\n\nTurn 7: from (4,5) move R to (5,5)  // at (5,5) after turn 7, not (5,4)\n\nMove directly to (5,4)? From (4,5) to (5,4) is diagonal, not adjacent; must move in one direction, so to (5,5) or (4,4) or (3,5), etc.\n\nCannot move directly to (5,4).\n\nSo the only way is to go through (5,5) or other.\n\nSo to reach (5,2) on turn 9, I need to be at (5,3) on turn 8, which requires being at (5,4) on turn 7, which requires being at (5,5) on turn 6 or (4,4) etc.\n\nBut on turn 6, from (4,6), I can move to (4,5) or to (5,6).\n\nIf move to (4,5) on turn 6, at (4,5)\n\nThen turn 7: move to (5,5), at (5,5)\n\nThen turn 8: move to (5,4), at (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: move to (5,3), not (5,2)\n\nIf on turn 7, from (4,5) move D to (4,4), then at (4,4), then turn 8 move R to (5,4), at (5,4), turn 9 move D to (5,3), same.\n\nI can't reach (5,2) by turn 9 from the north.\n\nThe shortest path from (3,6) to (5,2) is 5 moves: (3,6) to (4,6) to (5,6) to (5,5) to (5,4) to (5,3) to (5,2) — 6 moves for 5 steps? Positions: from (3,6) to (5,2), delta x=2, delta y=-4, so Manhattan distance 6, so 6 moves.\n\nFrom turn 4 at (3,6), to (5,2) on turn 10, but turn 10 too late.\n\nTurn 4: at (3,6)\n\nTurn 5: to (4,6)\n\nTurn 6: to (5,6)\n\nTurn 7: to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: to (5,3)\n\nTurn 10: to (5,2) gone.\n\nBut on turn 9, I can only be at (5,3), not (5,2).\n\nUnless I start from earlier.\n\nBut on turn 4, I am at (3,6) after eating (3,6).\n\nTurn 4 action is move to (3,6), so after turn 4, at (3,6).\n\nThen turn 5 to (4,6), etc.\n\nIf I don't eat (3,6) on turn 4, but earlier or later.\n\nAnother idea: from turn 2, instead of eating (2,5), I go directly to (3,6) or to (5,2).\n\nFor example, from (2,4), turn 2 move U to (2,5) but eat, or move to (2,5) without eating? But (2,5) has food, so if I move there, I eat it.\n\nI have to eat it if I move there.\n\nI could go around.\n\nBut (2,5) is close, eating it is good.\n\nPerhaps go to (3,6) first.\n\nFrom (2,4), turn 2 move U to (2,5) eat, then turn 3 move U to (2,6), then turn 4 move R to (3,6) eat.\n\nThen at turn 4 at (3,6), same as before.\n\nThen I have only 5 turns to reach (5,2), from turn 5 to turn 9.\n\nFrom (3,6) to (5,2) in 4 moves: impossible, min 6 moves.\n\n(3,6) to (5,2): dx=2, dy=-4, |dx| + |dy| =6, so 6 moves required.\n\nTurn 4 at (3,6), turn 5 to (4,6), turn 6 to (5,6), turn 7 to (5,5), turn 8 to (5,4), turn 9 to (5,3), turn 10 to (5,2) gone.\n\nI can only reach (5,3) on turn 9.\n\nBut (5,2) can be eaten on turn 9 if I am at (5,3) on turn 8 and move to (5,2) on turn 9, but on turn 9 I am at (5,3), not at (5,2).\n\nThe only way is to be at (5,2) on turn 9, which requires being at (5,3) on turn 8.\n\nBut from turn 4 at (3,6), it takes 4 moves to (5,3): (3,6) to (4,6) to (5,6) to (5,5) to (5,4) to (5,3) — 5 moves to (5,3).\n\nTurn 4: (3,6)\n\nTurn 5: to (4,6)\n\nTurn 6: to (5,6)\n\nTurn 7: to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: to (5,3)\n\nNot (5,3) on turn 8.\n\nTurn 8 at (5,4).\n\nSo I cannot reach (5,2) by turn 9 from (3,6) with the path.\n\nBut I can take a different path, like (3,6) to (4,6) to (4,5) to (5,5) to (5,4) to (5,3) same.\n\nOr (3,6) to (3,5) but (3,5) may be body.\n\nAfter eating (3,6), positions [ (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ], so (3,5) is body, cannot move there.\n\nSo only (2,6) or (4,6).\n\nSo I have to go to (4,6) or (2,6), then down.\n\nBut still, same distance.\n\nSo it seems impossible to eat (5,2) on turn 9 from here.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (5,2) before eating the others.\n\nFor example, from turn 2, at (2,4), instead of going up, go down or left.\n\nGo to (2,3) or (1,4), then to (5,2).\n\nBut (5,2) is far, and (2,5) and (3,6) might disappear if not eaten.\n\n(2,5) life span 8 at turn 2, so can be eaten up to turn 9.\n\nSimilarly (3,6) up to turn 10.\n\nIf I go directly to (5,2), I might miss the others.\n\nFor example, from (2,4), turn 2 move D to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 3 move R to (3,3)\n\nTurn 4 move R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 5 move R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 6 move D to (5,2) eat on turn 6.\n\nThen I have score from (5,2), but (2,5) and (3,6) are still there, I can go back.\n\nBut life span: (2,5) at turn 2 life span 8, so at turn 6, life span 8-4=4, still there.\n\nSimilarly (3,6) life span 9-4=5.\n\nFrom (5,2), I can go to (3,6) or (2,5).\n\nBut snake length now 3 after eating (5,2).\n\nPositions: after eating (5,2) on turn 6, head at (5,2), body (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), etc.\n\nThen to go to (2,5), it's far, and with body, might be risky.\n\nFor example, from (5,2) to (2,5), Manhattan distance |5-2| + |2-5| =3+3=6 moves.\n\nBut with internal obstacle at (3,1), but not in the way directly.\n\nBut the body might block.\n\nIt might be possible, but more risky and may not reach in time.\n\nFor example, (2,5) life span 8 at turn 2, after turn 6, life span 8-4=4, so can be eaten on turn 7,8,9,10? At turn 7: S=8-5=3? After turn 2: S=7, turn 3: S=7, after turn 3: S=6, turn 4: S=6, after turn 4: S=5, turn 5: S=5, after turn 5: S=4, turn 6: S=4, after turn 6: S=3, turn 7: S=3, after turn 7: S=2, turn 8: S=2, after turn 8: S=1, turn 9: S=1, after turn 9: S=0.\n\nSo can be eaten up to turn 9.\n\nSimilarly for (3,6) up to turn 10.\n\nFrom (5,2) on turn 6, I need to go to (2,5) or (3,6).\n\nBut (3,6) is at (3,6), from (5,2) to (3,6): dx=-2, dy=4, distance 6.\n\nTurn 6 at (5,2), turn 7 to (5,3), turn 8 to (5,4), etc., not efficient.\n\nGo left and up.\n\nBut time is short for (2,5).\n\nTurn 6: at (5,2)\n\nTurn 7: move U to (5,3) or L to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut to (2,5), need to go left and up.\n\nFor example, turn 7 move L to (4,2)\n\nTurn 8 move L to (3,2)\n\nBut (3,1) obstacle, so (3,2) is ok.\n\nTurn 9 move U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 10 move U to (3,4) etc., not reaching (2,5) soon.\n\nFrom (4,2) turn 8, move U to (4,3), then U to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut (2,5) is at x=2,y=5, so from (4,2), go to (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) but (2,4) might be occupied or not.\n\nOn turn 6, after eating (5,2), positions: head (5,2), body (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) if I came from there, but in my earlier path to (5,2), I was at (5,3) before, so body includes (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) for example.\n\nIn the path: turn 2 move D to (2,3), positions [ (2,3), (2,4) ]\n\nTurn 3 move R to (3,3), positions [ (3,3), (2,3) ]\n\nTurn 4 move R to (4,3), positions [ (4,3), (3,3) ]\n\nTurn 5 move R to (5,3), positions [ (5,3), (4,3) ]\n\nTurn 6 move D to (5,2) eat, so positions: head (5,2), body (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), so [ (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) ] length 4.\n\nThen from here, to go to (2,5), I need to go left and up.\n\nBut (3,3) is body, so from (5,2), can move L to (4,2), U to (5,3) but body, or D to (5,1) if y=1 not wall, but y=1, x=5 is playable.\n\nMove L to (4,2)\n\nThen to (3,2), (2,2), (2,3) but (2,3) is body, occupied, so cannot.\n\nPositions have (3,3) body, so (2,3) might be free.\n\nIn positions [ (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) ], so (2,3) is free.\n\nFrom (5,2) move L to (4,2) on turn 7\n\nTurn 8 move L to (3,2)\n\nTurn 9 move U to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, collision, cannot.\n\nMove U from (3,2) to (3,3) but occupied.\n\nSo must move to (2,2) or (4,2) etc.\n\nTurn 8 at (3,2), move U to (3,3) not possible, move L to (2,2)\n\nTurn 9 move U to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 10 move U to (2,4)\n\nBut (2,5) is at (2,5), so on turn 10, move U to (2,5) but (2,5) may be gone or not.\n\nLife span of (2,5): at turn 9 S=1, can be eaten on turn 9.\n\nOn turn 9, I am at (2,3), move to (2,4) or something, not to (2,5).\n\nComplicated and risky.\n\nSo better to eat the close food first.\n\nBack to the first plan, I can eat (2,5) and (3,6), and for (5,2), since I can't reach by turn 9, I might not eat it, but that means only score 2.\n\nBut (5,2) can be eaten later if I start earlier.\n\nFrom turn 2, at (2,4), I can move to (2,3) or (1,4), but not towards (5,2).\n\nMove D to (2,3), then R to (3,3), R to (4,3), R to (5,3), D to (5,2) on turn 6, as above.\n\nThen I have (5,2) eaten on turn 6.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,6) or (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is closer but up-left.\n\nFrom (5,2) turn 6, move U to (5,3) but body, cannot.\n\nMove L to (4,2), then to (3,2), then to (2,2), then to (2,3), but (2,3) may be body or not.\n\nIn positions after eating (5,2): [ (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) ]\n\nSo (2,3) is free.\n\nTurn 6 at (5,2)\n\nTurn 7 move L to (4,2)\n\nTurn 8 move L to (3,2)\n\nTurn 9 move U to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nMove U from (3,2) to (3,3) not possible, so move to (2,2) or (4,2), but (4,2) is not towards.\n\nMove to (2,2): turn 8 from (3,2) move L to (2,2)\n\nTurn 9 move U to (2,3)\n\nTurn 10 move U to (2,4)\n\nThen to (2,5) on turn 11, but gone.\n\nSimilarly for (3,6), it has longer life span, but still hard to reach.\n\nSo it's better to eat the two close foods and accept that (5,2) might not be eaten, or eat it if possible but in this case with the timing, it's tight.\n\nBut in the first path, if I go directly down after eating (3,6), I can reach (5,3) on turn 9, and (5,2) is gone, so no eat.\n\nBut score 2 from (2,5) and (3,6).\n\nIf I go to (5,2) first, I can eat it and one other, but not both.\n\nFor example, eat (5,2) on turn 6, then go to (3,6) on turn 10 or something, but (3,6) life span 9 at turn 2, at turn 10 S=0, gone.\n\nAt turn 9 S=1, can be eaten on turn 9.\n\nFrom (5,2) on turn 6, to (3,6) in 3 moves impossible.\n\nMin distance 6, so not possible.\n\nSimilarly for (2,5).\n\nSo the maximum score is 2, by eating (2,5) and (3,6), and (5,2) is too far to eat in time.\n\nIn the sequence, I can eat both (2,5) and (3,6) by turn 4.\n\nThen for the remaining turns, I can survive and not eat (5,2).\n\nSo for the action sequence, I can plan to eat (2,5) and (3,6), then move safely.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 2: U to (2,5) eat\n\nTurn 3: R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 4: U to (3,6) eat\n\nThen from (3,6), I can move to (4,6), then to (4,5), etc., to stay alive.\n\nBut since no more food, I can just move around.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to list actions for several turns.\n\nSo let's list 5 turns: turn 2 to turn 6.\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: R ( to (4,6) )\n\nTurn 6: D ( to (4,5) )\n\n etc.\n\nBut for the box, I think listing from turn 2 to turn 6 or so.\n\nSince the food at (5,2) can't be eaten, ignore it.\n\nSo the initial sequence is fine for the first 5 turns.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nThen for turn 5, from (3,6) move R to (4,6)\n\nTurn 6: from (4,6) move D to (4,5)\n\n etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I think 5 turns are enough.\n\nOr since the question says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions for the current and future turns.\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to specify the sequence.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns: turn 2 to turn 6.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: R\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nBut on turn 4, after U to (3,6), head at (3,6), then turn 5 move R to (4,6), etc.\n\nAnd it's safe.\n\nTo maximize, but I think score 2 is achievable.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (2,5) on a later turn to have shorter snake for maneuvering, but not necessary.\n\nSo I think for the answer, I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating the positive food at (2,5) and (3,6) first, as they are close to the starting position and can be eaten within the first few turns. The food at (5,2) has a lower life span and is farther away; given the grid constraints and the need to avoid collisions, it is not feasible to reach and eat (5,2) before it disappears after turn 9. Therefore, the plan focuses on safely eating (2,5) and (3,6) for a score of +2, then maneuvering to avoid risks.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Current State (Turn 2)**:\n  - Snake head at (2,4) with direction left (L).\n  - Snake length is 2, so eating positive food increases length to 3 and then 4.\n  - Food at (2,5) (value +1, life span 8) and (3,6) (value +1, life span 9) are reachable; (5,2) (value +1, life span 8) is too far to eat in time.\n  - Internal obstacle at (3,1) and walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) must be avoided.\n- **Movement Constraints**: \n  - Cannot reverse direction instantly (e.g., from L to R not allowed).\n  - Moving into the tail cell is safe only if the tail moves away after the turn.\n- **Risk Avoidance**:\n  - No tail reward danger here, as food is not on the tail.\n  - Collision with body or walls must be avoided at all times.\n- **Food Life Span**:\n  - (2,5): Life span 8 at turn 2, disappears after turn 10 (can be eaten up to turn 9).\n  - (3,6): Life span 9 at turn 2, disappears after turn 11 (can be eaten up to turn 10).\n  - (5,2): Life span 8 at turn 2, disappears after turn 10 (cannot be eaten by turn 9 due to distance).\n\n### Plan for 5+ Turns Ahead:\n1. **Turn 2**: Move up (U) to (2,5) to eat the food immediately. This increases length to 3 and scores +1. Head direction becomes U.\n2. **Turn 3**: Move right (R) to (3,5) to position for eating (3,6). No food eaten. Head direction becomes R.\n3. **Turn 4**: Move up (U) to (3,6) to eat the food. Length increases to 4, score +1 (total score 2). Head direction becomes U.\n4. **Turn 5**: Move right (R) to (4,6) to avoid walls and body, heading toward open space. No food eaten.\n5. **Turn 6**: Move down (D) to (4,5) to continue safe navigation. No food eaten.\n6. **Turn 7**: Move down (D) to (4,4) to avoid the top-right corner and stay central.\n7. **Turn 8**: Move right (R) to (5,4) to position for potential movement toward the bottom, but (5,2) is ignored due to life span.\n8. **Beyond**: Continue moving safely (e.g., down or left) to stay away from walls and body. With no more food, prioritize survival by keeping the snake in open areas.\n\n### Why this sequence?\n- **Score Maximization**: Eats two food items for +2 score by turn 4. (5,2) is sacrificed as it cannot be reached before disappearing (minimum 6 moves from (3,6) on turn 4, but (5,2) disappears after turn 9).\n- **Survival Focus**: After turn 4, the snake moves to open areas (e.g., (4,5), (4,4), (5,4)) to minimize collision risk with a length of 4. The path avoids the obstacle at (3,1) and walls.\n- **Efficiency**: Direct path to close food reduces turns and risk. No backtracking or unnecessary moves.\n- **Risk Check**: \n  - Turn 2: Moving U to (2,5) is safe; no body collision or tail reward danger.\n  - Turn 3: Moving R to (3,5) is safe; (3,5) is free.\n  - Turn 4: Moving U to (3,6) is safe; eats food without issues.\n  - Later turns: All moves avoid body segments and walls.\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 2 to 8 for full plan):\nThe actions are based on current knowledge, with no new food spawns. The sequence ensures survival while achieving the maximum possible score of 2.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: R \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: R \\\\\nTurn 6: D \\\\\nTurn 7: D \\\\\nTurn 8: R\n}",
