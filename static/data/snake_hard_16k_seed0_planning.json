        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nThe current state is at turn t1 = 0.\n\n- Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and the borders are walls. Also, internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2). I need to avoid these cells.\n\n- Snake positions: Only [(3,3)]. That means the snake is just the head at (3,3), no body segments yet. So length is 1.\n\n- Snake head direction: L (left). That means it's facing left, so it just moved to (3,3) from the right, I assume. But since it's the only segment, direction might not matter much for movement, but I can't reverse instantly.\n\n- Food: Three positive foods, all with value +1 and life span 10. They are at:\n  - (4,5)\n  - (3,6)\n  - (2,6)\n\nAll foods are positive, so eating any will increase length by 1 and score by 1. Life span 10 means they disappear after 10 turns, including this one, so countdown starts now.\n\nSince the snake has only one segment (just the head), there's no body to collide with, except for walls and obstacles. Also, since it's alone, moving onto food should be safe as long as it's not a wall or obstacle.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for at least 5 turns ahead. But since the snake is short, I should aim to eat food to grow.\n\nPossible moves from (3,3): I can go U, D, L, or R, but can't reverse instantly. Current direction is L, so I can't go R (right) immediately, because that would be reverse.\n\nDirections:\n- U: up, (x, y+1) → (3,4)\n- D: down, (x, y-1) → (3,2)\n- L: left, (x-1,y) → (2,3)\n- R: right, (x+1,y) → (4,3) but reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo allowed moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, check for walls and obstacles.\n\nGrid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Borders are walls, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are out of bounds.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is an obstacle? (3,2) is listed as an internal obstacle. But D move would be to (3,2), which is an obstacle, so I can't go down.\n\nSimilarly, other positions:\n\n- U to (3,4): is (3,4) free? Not a border, not in obstacles. Obstacles are: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2). (3,4) not in list, so should be free.\n\n- D to (3,2): but (3,2) is an obstacle, so invalid.\n\n- L to (2,3): (2,3) not in obstacles, not border, so should be free.\n\n- R is not allowed because reverse.\n\nSo possible actions: U or L. D is blocked by obstacle.\n\nNow, food locations: (4,5), (3,6), (2,6).\n\nI need to think about getting to food while avoiding future risks.\n\nSince snake is length 1, after eating first food, it will have a body segment.\n\nBut for now, I need to choose a move.\n\nAlso, food life span: all have life 10, so they'll disappear after turn 10, but since we start at turn 0, they last until after turn 9? Life span decreases each turn including current, so at turn 0, life span 10, after turn 0 it becomes 9, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns when life span >0.\n\nFor now, all foods are available.\n\nNow, let's evaluate possible moves.\n\nOption 1: Move Up to (3,4)\n\nFrom (3,4), I can then move to other places.\n\nFood at (3,6) is above, so I could go towards it.\n\n(3,4) to (3,5) to (3,6) but (3,6) has food, so if I go to (3,6) on turn 1 or later.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) is left and up.\n\nOption 2: Move Left to (2,3)\n\nFrom (2,3), I can go towards (2,6) or other.\n\n(2,6) is directly above from (2,3), but there might be obstacles.\n\nList the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid 8x8:\n\nRows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cells like (0,y) or (x,0) etc. are invalid.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)\n\n(3,2) is obstacle, so (3,2) is blocked.\n\nSnake at (3,3)\n\nFood at (4,5), (3,6), (2,6)\n\nFrom (3,3):\n\n- U to (3,4): free\n\n- D to (3,2): blocked by obstacle\n\n- L to (2,3): free\n\n- R to (4,3): but reverse not allowed, since current dir L, so R is opposite, invalid.\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nNow, if I go U to (3,4):\n\nAt turn 1, snake head at (3,4), body: since it was alone, after moving, the tail was at (3,3) but since no growth, tail moves away? When snake moves without eating, the tail moves, so positions: head moves to new cell, tail is removed if no food eaten.\n\nSince length 1, moving to (3,4) means new position is [(3,4)], and old (3,3) is empty.\n\nSimilarly for L to (2,3): [(2,3)]\n\nThen, from there, I can move again.\n\nBut I need to think multiple steps.\n\nAlso, after eating food, length increases, so body grows.\n\nNow, let's think about getting to food.\n\nFirst, distance to foods:\n\n- (3,6): from (3,3), Manhattan distance |dy| = 3, |dx|=0, so 3 steps up.\n\nBut obstacles: from (3,3) to (3,4) to (3,5) to (3,6). Now, (3,4) and (3,5) should be free? (3,4) no obstacle, (3,5) not in obstacle list, (3,6) has food.\n\nBut is there any block? (2,4) is obstacle, but that's different x.\n\n(3,4) is clear, (3,5) should be clear, (3,6) has food.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6): from (3,3), if I go left to (2,3), then up to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle! (2,4) is in internal obstacles, so cannot go to (2,4).\n\nFrom (2,3), I can go U, but (2,4) is blocked, so I cannot go up directly.\n\nFrom (2,3), possible moves:\n\nAfter moving L to (2,3) at turn 0.\n\nThen at turn 1, head at (2,3), direction: since I moved left, current dir is L.\n\nCan go U, D, L, but not R (reverse).\n\nU to (2,4): but (2,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\nD to (2,2): is (2,2) free? Not border, not in obstacles, so yes.\n\nL to (1,3): (1,3) free? Not in obstacles, x=1 not border yet.\n\nR to (3,3): but reverse, not allowed since current dir L.\n\nSo from (2,3), can go D or L.\n\nIf go D to (2,2), then from there, I can move to other places, but food is at (2,6) above, which is blocked by (2,4) obstacle.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) is at x=3, y=6.\n\nTo reach (2,6), I might need to go around, but since (2,4) blocked, I have to go via other paths, like left or down then up, but that might take longer.\n\n(4,5): at (4,5), from (3,3), I could go right, but I can't go right now because reverse.\n\nFrom current (3,3), I can only go U or L.\n\nIf I go U to (3,4), then from (3,4), I can go to (3,5) then (3,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,4) I could go to (4,4) but (4,4) is obstacle? (4,4) is in internal obstacles, so cannot go to (4,4).\n\nObstacles: (4,4) is there, so (4,4) blocked.\n\nAlso, (5,6), (1,4), (2,4), (6,3), etc.\n\nBack to paths.\n\nOption A: Move U to (3,4) at turn 0.\n\nThen at turn 1, head at (3,4), body: none, since length 1, so positions [(3,4)].\n\nCurrent direction: since moved U, dir is U.\n\nCan move U, D, L, R, but not D (down) because reverse? Current dir U, so cannot move D (opposite).\n\nSo allowed: U, L, R.\n\nU to (3,5): should be free, not obstacle.\n\nL to (2,4): (2,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\nR to (4,4): (4,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move from (3,4) is U to (3,5).\n\nThen at turn 1, after moving to (3,5), positions [(3,5)].\n\nCurrent dir U.\n\nThen turn 2, from (3,5), can move U, L, R (not D).\n\nU to (3,6): which has food! So if I move to (3,6), I eat the food at (3,6), since head moves onto it.\n\nThen snake grows to length 2, so positions: head at (3,6), body at (3,5).\n\nNow, after eating, I need to move away.\n\nBut food at (3,6) is eaten, so it disappears.\n\nLife span was 10, but eaten so gone.\n\nNow, at turn 2, after eating, snake has head (3,6) and body (3,5).\n\nCurrent direction: since I moved U to (3,6), dir is U.\n\nNow, possible moves: U, L, R (not D, reverse).\n\nU to (3,7): but y=7 is border wall, invalid.\n\nL to (2,6): (2,6) has food? Yes, food at (2,6), and it's free? (2,6) not in obstacles, so I can move there.\n\nBut moving to (2,6) would eat the food, since head moves onto it.\n\nR to (4,6): (4,6) should be free? Not border, not obstacle.\n\n(4,6) not in obstacles, so free.\n\nAlso, (2,6) has food, so moving there eats it.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nIf I go this path:\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 1: move U to (3,5)\n\nTurn 2: move U to (3,6) → eat food, length=2, positions: head (3,6), body (3,5)\n\nNow turn 3: from (3,6), dir U, can go L to (2,6) or R to (4,6) or U invalid.\n\nIf go L to (2,6): eat food at (2,6), since head moves onto it. Then snake grows to length 3, head (2,6), body: (3,6) and (3,5)? When moving, head moves to new cell, body follows.\n\nAfter turn 2: positions head (3,6), body (3,5)\n\nMove to (2,6): head to (2,6), body moves to (3,6), so positions: [(2,6), (3,6)]\n\nBut (3,5) is no longer part of snake, since tail moved.\n\nWhen you eat, the body grows, but when moving without eating, tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, moving to (2,6) and eating, so head to (2,6), body: since eating, the tail doesn't move, so new segment added. So positions: head (2,6), and body (3,6), and the previous body (3,5) remains, so snake is (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)? Let's think carefully.\n\nStandard snake: when moving, head moves to new cell. If no food, tail is removed. If food eaten, tail is not removed, so length increases by one.\n\nIn this case:\n\nBefore move: positions [(3,6), (3,5)] head at (3,6), body segment at (3,5)\n\nMove head to (2,6): new head position (2,6)\n\nSince food at (2,6) is eaten, so tail is not removed. So body: the segment at (3,5) remains, and head is now (2,6), so positions: head (2,6), then (3,6), then (3,5). Order: head first, so [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nBut (3,6) was the previous head, now body.\n\nAnd (3,5) is tail.\n\nNow, from (2,6), I have food at (4,5) left, but I'm at (2,6).\n\nAlso, after eating at (2,6), length=3.\n\nCurrent direction: I moved L from (3,6) to (2,6), so dir is L.\n\nNow, possible moves: U, D, L, R? But not reverse. Reverse of L is R, so cannot go R.\n\nCan go U, D, L.\n\nU to (2,7): y=7 border, invalid.\n\nD to (2,5): (2,5) should be free? Not obstacle.\n\nL to (1,6): (1,6) free? Not obstacle, x=1 not border.\n\nBut no food there.\n\n(4,5) is at (4,5), which is different location.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nFirst, back to the beginning.\n\nIf I go left at turn 0.\n\nMove L to (2,3) at turn 0.\n\nThen at turn 1, head at (2,3), dir L.\n\nAs before, can go D or L (U and R invalid).\n\nIf go D to (2,2), or L to (1,3).\n\nSuppose go D to (2,2).\n\nThen turn 1, head (2,2), dir D (since moved down).\n\nThen can move U, D, L, R, but not U (reverse), so D, L, R.\n\nD to (2,1): free? Not border, not obstacle.\n\nL to (1,2): free.\n\nR to (3,2): but (3,2) obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo D or L.\n\nIf I go D, I'm going further down, away from foods which are at y=5 and 6.\n\nFoods at (4,5), (3,6), (2,6) all high y.\n\n(2,6) is at y=6, but blocked by obstacle at (2,4).\n\nTo reach (2,6) from below, I need to go around, say via x=1 or x=3.\n\nBut (1,4) is obstacle, (2,4) obstacle, (3,4) free, but from (2,2), I can go to (3,2) but (3,2) obstacle, so I have to go left or down.\n\nThis seems inefficient.\n\nFrom (2,3), if I go L to (1,3) instead.\n\nTurn 0: move L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 1: from (2,3), move L to (1,3) (since U blocked, D and L possible, but L to (1,3)).\n\nThen head at (1,3), dir L.\n\nThen can move U, D, L (not R).\n\nU to (1,4): but (1,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\nD to (1,2): free.\n\nL to (0,3): x=0 border, invalid.\n\nSo only D to (1,2).\n\nThen from (1,2), I can move, but still away from food.\n\nNot good for getting food soon.\n\nSo compared to going up, where I can reach (3,6) in 3 turns and eat.\n\nBy going left, I might not reach food quickly, and foods have limited life, but life span 10, so I have time, but still, eating sooner is better to grow and have more options.\n\nAlso, with longer snake, I need to avoid self-collision.\n\nBut now snake is short.\n\nAnother food at (4,5).\n\nFrom current (3,3), I can't go directly to (4,5) because I can't go right now.\n\nIf I go up first, then I can go right later.\n\nIn the up path: if I go U to (3,4), then U to (3,5), then U to (3,6) eat.\n\nThen at (3,6), I can go L to (2,6) to eat another food, as I thought.\n\nThen at (2,6), with length 3, I can go D to (2,5), for example.\n\n(2,5) should be free.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other places.\n\nFood at (4,5) still there.\n\nBut (4,5) is at x=4,y=5.\n\nFrom (2,6) to (4,5), I need to move.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (4,4), (3,2), etc.\n\nAlso, after eating at (2,6), positions [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nHead at (2,6), dir L (since moved left).\n\nCan go D to (2,5), or L to (1,6), U invalid.\n\nSay go D to (2,5).\n\nThen head (2,5), dir D.\n\nThen can move U, D, L, R? Not U (reverse), so D, L, R.\n\nD to (2,4): but (2,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\nL to (1,5): (1,5) obstacle? (1,5) is in internal obstacles, yes, (1,5) blocked.\n\nR to (3,5): (3,5) is where the tail is? Current positions: after moving to (2,5), and not eating, so tail moves.\n\nBefore move: positions [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nMove head to (2,5): no food there, so tail (3,5) is removed. So new positions: head (2,5), body (2,6) and (3,6)? Head moves to (2,5), body: (2,6) becomes segment, and (3,6) becomes next, but (3,5) removed.\n\nOrder: head first, so after move: head (2,5), then the previous head (2,6) now body, and then (3,6), and (3,5) is gone. So positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nTail at (3,6).\n\nCurrent direction: moved D to (2,5), dir D.\n\nNow, from (2,5), can go D, L, R (not U).\n\nD to (2,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\nL to (1,5) obstacle, invalid.\n\nR to (3,5): (3,5) is now free, since tail moved. (3,5) was part of body, but after moving, tail moved to (3,6), so (3,5) is empty.\n\n(3,5) not obstacle, so I can move to (3,5).\n\nIf move R to (3,5), head to (3,5), no food, so tail moves: positions head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,6), tail (3,6) removed? Let's see.\n\nPrevious positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nHead to (3,5): new head (3,5), body: (2,5) and (2,6), and (3,6) removed? When head moves, the body segments follow, so the segment at (2,6) moves to (2,5), and (3,6) moves to (2,6)? Standard: each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nWhen head moves to new cell, the neck moves to where head was, and so on, tail is removed if no growth.\n\nSo from [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6)] head (2,5)\n\nMove head to (3,5): new head (3,5)\n\nThen body: the segment that was at (2,6) moves to where head was, (2,5)? Positions: the first body segment moves to the previous head position, which is (2,5), but (2,5) is now occupied by the new body? I think I'm confusing.\n\nBetter to think: the positions list shifts.\n\nPrevious positions: index 0: head (2,5), index 1: (2,6), index 2: tail (3,6)\n\nAfter moving head to (3,5):\n\nNew head: (3,5)\n\nThen the body segments: segment 1 moves to previous head position (2,5), segment 2 moves to previous segment 1 position (2,6), and tail (3,6) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (3,5), then body (2,5), then body (2,6), and tail was (3,6) gone, so only two body segments? Length 3, so three cells.\n\nHead new: (3,5)\n\nThen the next segment is the previous head (2,5), so at (2,5)\n\nThen the next segment is previous segment 1, which was (2,6), so at (2,6)\n\nAnd the tail (3,6) is removed.\n\nSo positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6)]\n\nTail at (2,6).\n\nNow, (2,6) is where food was, but eaten, so empty.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move to (4,5) to eat the remaining food? (4,5) has food.\n\n(3,5) to (4,5) is right, but current direction: from (2,5) I moved to (3,5), which is right, so dir R.\n\nThen from (3,5), can move U, D, R (not L, reverse).\n\nU to (3,6): (3,6) is free now? Not occupied, not obstacle.\n\nD to (3,4): (3,4) free.\n\nR to (4,5): (4,5) has food.\n\nIf I go R to (4,5), eat food, grow to length 4.\n\nHead to (4,5), body: since eating, tail not removed, so positions: head (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nSo I can eat all three foods in sequence.\n\nNow, sequence:\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4)  // from (3,3) to (3,4)\n\nAt turn 0, move U, head to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: move U to (3,5)  // head to (3,5)\n\nTurn 2: move U to (3,6) eat food at (3,6), length=2, positions: head (3,6), body (3,5)\n\nTurn 3: move L to (2,6) eat food at (2,6), length=3, positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), (3,5)\n\nTurn 4: move D to (2,5) no food, positions: head (2,5), body (2,6), (3,6)  // tail (3,5) removed\n\nIn positions: head (2,5), then body (2,6), then (3,6)\n\nTurn 5: move R to (3,5) no food, positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,6)  // tail (3,6) removed\n\nTurn 6: move R to (4,5) eat food at (4,5), length=4, positions: head (4,5), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nNow, all foods eaten by turn 6.\n\nBut I need to output actions for at least 5 turns, from turn 0 to turn 4 or 5.\n\nIn this, by turn 2 I ate first food, turn 3 second, turn 6 third.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to specify actions for multiple turns starting from turn 0.\n\nSince I have to think 5+ turns ahead, but output the actions for the next turns.\n\nIn this plan, from turn 0 to turn 4: actions U, U, U, L, D\n\nAt turn 3: move L to (2,6)\n\nTurn 4: move D to (2,5)\n\nBut at turn 4, after move, head at (2,5), not eaten yet.\n\nThen turn 5 move R to (3,5), turn 6 to (4,5) eat.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are risks.\n\nFor example, after turn 2, at (3,6), I could have gone R to (4,6) instead of L to (2,6).\n\nBut (2,6) has food, so better to eat it.\n\nAlso, in the path, when I moved to (2,5), it was safe.\n\nNow, what about the other option, moving left first.\n\nIf turn 0 move L to (2,3)\n\nThen I have fewer options, and it might take longer to get to food.\n\nFor example, from (2,3), I can go D to (2,2) or L to (1,3).\n\nSuppose go L to (1,3) then D to (1,2), etc., but food at (2,6) is blocked, so I need to go around, say to (1,5) but (1,5) obstacle, or to (3, something).\n\nFrom (1,3), I can go to (1,2), then to (1,1) or (2,2), but (2,2) might be free.\n\nBut y=1,2 low, while food high y.\n\nThen I might go to (3,2) but (3,2) obstacle, or to (4,3) etc., but no direct path.\n\nFor instance, from (1,2) I can go R to (2,2), then U to (2,3) but (2,3) was previous position, might be body if I ate, but not yet.\n\nBut (2,4) obstacle, so I cannot go up from x=2.\n\nI have to go to x=3 or x=1.\n\nSay from (2,2) go R to (3,2) but (3,2) obstacle, invalid.\n\nFrom (2,2) go U to (2,3) but current position, or D to (2,1).\n\nNot good.\n\nFrom (1,2) go to (1,1), then (1,0) invalid, or (2,1), etc.\n\nThis is messy and takes many turns to reach food, and foods might expire.\n\nLife span 10, from turn 0, so at turn 10 they disappear, but I can reach by turn 6 in the up path.\n\nIn up path, I eat first at turn 2, second at turn 3, third at turn 6, all within 10 turns.\n\nNow, but I need to think about survival after.\n\nAfter eating all, I have a snake of length 4 at (4,5), with body at (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nNow, I need to move without colliding.\n\nPossible moves from (4,5): current dir, I moved R to (4,5), so dir R.\n\nCan go U, D, R (not L).\n\nU to (4,6): should be free.\n\nD to (4,4): but (4,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\nR to (5,5): (5,5) free? Not obstacle.\n\nSo U or R.\n\nIf go U to (4,6), then from there, etc.\n\nBut no immediate danger.\n\nSince I have to output actions for turns, and think ahead.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide actions for turn 0 and subsequent turns.\n\nThe format is to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc., at least 5 turns or as needed.\n\nt1=0, so I should output actions for turn 0,1,2,3,4... up to some point.\n\nSince the snake is short, I can plan the sequence to eat the foods.\n\nIn the up path, by turn 4, I have eaten two foods, and on way to third.\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U (eat first food)\n\nTurn 3: L (eat second food)\n\nTurn 4: D (to (2,5))\n\nThen turn 5: R (to (3,5))\n\nTurn 6: R (to (4,5) eat)\n\nBut for thinking ahead, I have a plan.\n\nBut at turn 4, after move D to (2,5), positions head (2,5), body (2,6), (3,6)\n\nThen to go to (4,5), I need to go right.\n\nFrom (2,5), I moved to (3,5), which is right.\n\nBut (3,5) is adjacent to body? At that time, body is at (2,6) and (3,6), (3,5) is empty, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issues.\n\nNow, is there any risk with the tail or something?\n\nThe special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nBut in this case, when I eat the foods, the tail is not adjacent or with food under it except when eaten.\n\nFor example, when I ate at (3,6), head was at (3,6), tail at (3,5), which is adjacent, but I ate the food at head, not at tail. The food was under head when I moved to it.\n\nThe danger is if I move to a cell where the tail is, but with food under tail, but I think the food under tail can be eaten only if tail moves away and head moves in.\n\nBut in this sequence, no such issue.\n\nFor instance, at turn 3, when I move to (2,6), the tail is at (3,5), which is not adjacent to (2,6)? (2,6) and (3,5) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means same x or y differ by 1.\n\n(2,6) and (3,5): dx=1, dy=1, so not adjacent, diagonal is not adjacent in grid, only up/down/left/right.\n\nSo distance: Manhattan |dx|+|dy|=2, so not adjacent.\n\nThen tail at (3,5), no food there, food was at (2,6) which I eat.\n\nSimilarly, later.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nNow, back to turn 0 decision.\n\nIf I go left, it might be worse.\n\nBut just to confirm, suppose turn 0 move L to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 1: say move D to (2,2) (since U blocked)\n\nThen turn 1 head (2,2), dir D\n\nThen can go D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2) invalid.\n\nSay go to (1,2)\n\nThen from (1,2), etc., but to reach food, say (3,6), I need to go to (3,3) but (3,3) was start, or to (3,4), but from (1,2) I can go to (2,2), then to (3,2) blocked, so go to (1,1) or something, then to (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) blocked, so (4,1), etc., long way.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo going up is better.\n\nTherefore, at turn 0, move U to (3,4)\n\nThen subsequent moves as above.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nSince I have to think 5+ turns ahead, I should output multiple turns.\n\nThe format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nt1=0.\n\nSo for turn 0: U\n\nThen I need to specify future actions, but the snake will react based on state, but since I'm planning, I can output a sequence.\n\nIn the context, I think I need to output a plan for several turns.\n\nThe problem says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"output answer format with actions for turn t1, t1+1, ...\"\n\nSo I should provide, say, 5 or 6 actions.\n\nIn my plan:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U (to (3,5))\n\nTurn 2: U (to (3,6) eat)\n\nNow at turn 2, after eating, state changes.\n\nThen turn 3: L (to (2,6) eat)\n\nTurn 4: D (to (2,5))\n\nTurn 5: R (to (3,5))\n\nBut turn 5 is t1+5.\n\nI could include turn 6.\n\nBut for thinking ahead, I have the plan.\n\nTo be safe, I should consider if there are other options.\n\nFor example, from (3,6) at turn 2, I could go R to (4,6) instead of L to (2,6).\n\nBut (4,6) has no food, while (2,6) has food, so better to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, after that, I need to go to (4,5).\n\nIn the sequence, from (2,5) to (3,5) to (4,5).\n\nFrom (2,5), I could go directly to (3,5), but not diagonal, so must go step by step.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 4, when I move to (2,5), from (2,6), I moved down, so to (2,5).\n\nThen to (3,5), which is right and down? (2,5) to (3,5) is right, same y.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps I can go to (4,5) directly after, but need to go via (3,5).\n\nNow, about the food life span: all life span 10 at turn 0.\n\nTurn 0: life 10\n\nTurn 1: life 9\n\n...\n\nAt turn 6, life span would be 4 for all, since all start at 10.\n\nTurn t, life decreases by t? At turn t, the remaining life is initial life - t.\n\nAt turn 0, life=10\n\nAfter turn 0, before turn 1, life decreases to 9.\n\nSimilarly, at turn k, life = 10 - k.\n\nSo at turn 6, life=4, still >0, so food exists.\n\nNo problem.\n\nIn the sequence, I eat (3,6) at turn 2, (2,6) at turn 3, (4,5) at turn 6.\n\n(4,5) at turn 6.\n\nNow, for the output, I think I should provide actions from turn 0 to at least turn 4 or 5.\n\nSince the snake is short, and I have a clear path, I'll go with this.\n\nBut at turn 0, moving U is the best.\n\nIs there a way to get to (4,5) faster?\n\nFor example, if I could go right, but I can't because reverse.\n\nFrom (3,3), only U or L, L leads to dead end.\n\nSo U is better.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U  (eat first food)\n\nNow, at turn 2, after move, I need to decide turn 3.\n\nIn the plan, turn 3: L to (2,6) eat second food.\n\nBut I should output the action for turn 3 as well.\n\nSimilarly, turn 4: D\n\nAnd so on.\n\nTo have 5 actions: turn 0 to 4.\n\nTurn 4: move D to (2,5)\n\nThen for thinking ahead, I can state the intention.\n\nBut for the box, I need to list the actions.\n\nPerhaps output 5 turns.\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: L\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nAt turn 4, head at (2,5), then next would be R to (3,5), but not in the 5 turns.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns, but output can be fewer, I think.\n\nThe answer format says \"Turn t1: action ... Turn t1+1: action ... \" and so on, without specifying how many, but I think for clarity, I'll provide 5 actions.\n\nAfter turn 4, I can continue.\n\nBut let's see the state after turn 4.\n\nAfter turn 4: head at (2,5), with body at (2,6) and (3,6), length 3? After turn 3, I ate at (2,6), so length 3, positions head (2,6), body (3,6), (3,5)? Earlier.\n\nTurn 3: move L to (2,6) eat, so positions: [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] head (2,6), body (3,6), tail (3,5)\n\nTurn 4: move D to (2,5) no food, so head to (2,5), body: (2,6) moves to where head was? Positions: new head (2,5), then body segment at previous head position (2,6), and body segment at (3,6) moves to (2,6)? \n\nPrevious: index 0: (2,6) head, index 1: (3,6), index 2: (3,5) tail\n\nMove head to (2,5): new head (2,5)\n\nThen index 1 moves to previous head (2,6) → position (2,6)\n\nIndex 2 moves to previous index 1 position (3,6) → position (3,6)\n\nAnd tail (3,5) removed.\n\nSo positions: head (2,5), body (2,6), body (3,6)\n\nTail at (3,6)\n\nNow, from (2,5), as before, can move to (3,5) or other, but (3,5) is free.\n\nIn the plan, turn 5: move R to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 6: move R to (4,5) eat.\n\nBut for output, I think turn 0 to 4 is fine, and I can imply the rest.\n\nTo be complete, I could output 6 actions.\n\nBut let's see the requirement.\n\nThe core rules don't specify how many turns to output, but the answer format shows \"Turn t1: ... Turn t1+1: ...\" so I need to list sequentially.\n\nI think providing 5 actions is sufficient for now.\n\nSince after turn 2, the state changes, but I can plan ahead.\n\nAnother thing: are there any risks I missed?\n\nFor example, when at (3,6) with body at (3,5), if I go down, but I can't because dir U, and reverse not allowed, and down would be to (3,5) which is body, but (3,5) is occupied, so I cannot move there anyway.\n\nIn that case, from (3,6), possible moves: U invalid (wall), L to (2,6), R to (4,6), D to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, so collision if I move there.\n\nBut since dir U, moving D is reverse, not allowed, so I don't consider it.\n\nSimilarly, only L and R possible.\n\nI chose L to eat food.\n\nIf I go R to (4,6), no food, then I might miss the food at (2,6), and later go to (4,5), but (2,6) might expire or something, but life 10, I have time.\n\nBut better to eat it now.\n\nSo my plan is fine.\n\nTherefore, for the answer:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: L\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nNow, I should write it in the box.\n\nBut the head direction: at each turn, direction changes based on move.\n\nBut in output, I just need the action.\n\nAlso, for turn 2, moving U to (3,6) eats food, but action is still U.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves that prioritizes eating all available positive food while avoiding walls, obstacles, and potential collisions. The snake starts at position (3,3) with a length of 1 and direction left (L). The grid has border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2). The foods at (4,5), (3,6), and (2,6) all have a value of +1 and a life span of 10, meaning they disappear after turn 10 (countdown starts at turn 0).\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Immediate Move (Turn 0)**: From (3,3), possible moves are up (U) or left (L), as down (D) is blocked by an obstacle at (3,2), and right (R) is a reverse move (current direction L), which is invalid. Moving U to (3,4) is chosen because it directly enables a path to the food at (3,6) in 3 turns, while moving L to (2,3) leads to dead ends or delays due to obstacles (e.g., (2,4) is blocked).\n- **Food Access**: All foods are positive and should be eaten to increase length and score. The sequence targets (3,6) first (eaten on turn 2), then (2,6) (eaten on turn 3), and finally (4,5) (eaten on turn 6). This is efficient, with all foods consumed by turn 6 (within their 10-turn life span).\n- **Collision Avoidance**: With a short snake initially, self-collision is minimal. After growth, moves are planned to avoid the body (e.g., after eating at (3,6), moving L to (2,6) is safe as the tail is not adjacent). The \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule does not apply here, as food is eaten by the head moving onto it, not from the tail position.\n- **5+ Turn Lookahead**: The plan extends to turn 6 to ensure the third food is secured. By turn 4, the snake has eaten two foods (length 3) and is positioned to reach (4,5) safely. Survival is prioritized—e.g., after turn 4, moving to (3,5) and (4,5) avoids obstacles and walls.\n- **Movement Constraints**: No instant reverse moves are made (e.g., after moving U, D is not allowed next). Directions are updated based on each move.\n\n### Planned Move Sequence (Turns 0 to 6):\n- **Turn 0**: Move U to (3,4) – Positions: [(3,4)]; Direction: U. (Avoids L, which leads to inefficient paths.)\n- **Turn 1**: Move U to (3,5) – Positions: [(3,5)]; Direction: U. (Only U is possible, as L to (2,4) and R to (4,4) are blocked by obstacles.)\n- **Turn 2**: Move U to (3,6) – Eat food at (3,6); length increases to 2; Positions: head (3,6), body (3,5); Direction: U. (Food life span decreases to 8 after this turn.)\n- **Turn 3**: Move L to (2,6) – Eat food at (2,6); length increases to 3; Positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), (3,5); Direction: L. (Food life span decreases to 7. Moving L eats food efficiently; R to (4,6) is possible but misses immediate reward.)\n- **Turn 4**: Move D to (2,5) – Positions: head (2,5), body (2,6), (3,6); Direction: D. (Prepares to approach (4,5). U is invalid (wall), L to (1,5) is blocked, R to (3,5) is safe but not yet optimal for path to (4,5).)\n- **Turn 5**: Move R to (3,5) – Positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,6); Direction: R. (Cell (3,5) is free after tail moved; now aligned to reach (4,5).)\n- **Turn 6**: Move R to (4,5) – Eat food at (4,5); length increases to 4; Positions: head (4,5), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,6); Direction: R. (Food life span decreases to 4, still valid.)\n\n### Why This Plan Maximizes Score and Survival:\n- **Score**: All three foods are eaten by turn 6, increasing length from 1 to 4 and adding +3 to score. No negative foods are present.\n- **Survival**: The path avoids all obstacles and walls. After turn 6, the snake can continue safely (e.g., from (4,5), moves U to (4,6) or R to (5,5) are valid).\n- **Efficiency**: Eating (3,6) and (2,6) early minimizes risk of expiration or missed opportunities. Turn 4 move (D) positions the snake for the final food without detours.\n- **Risk Mitigation**: No head-body collisions occur, as moves are planned with body positions in mind (e.g., at turn 3, moving L to (2,6) is safe with tail at (3,5), not adjacent). The plan uses 5+ turn lookahead to ensure no dead ends.\n\n### Output for Turns 0 to 4 (minimum 5 actions):\nThis sequence ensures the first two foods are eaten and sets up the third, with actions planned through turn 6 for completeness.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U \\\\\nTurn 1: U \\\\\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: L \\\\\nTurn 4: D \\\\\nTurn 5: R \\\\\nTurn 6: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. The current turn is t1 = 1. I need to think at least 5 turns ahead to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nThe grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the edges, meaning I can't move to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there are internal obstacles at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2). I need to avoid these cells.\n\nSnake positions: only one segment? It says [(3,4)], and it's the head. Since it's a list with one element, that means the snake has only the head right now? But in Snake, when you start, you usually have a head and maybe a small tail. Let me read carefully.\n\nSnake Positions: [(3,4)] – that's a single point. So the snake is just the head at (3,4). That means length is 1, I think. When it eats food, it will grow.\n\nSnake Head Direction: U, which is up. So moving upwards.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (4,5) with life_span=9, value=1 (positive)\n\n- (3,6) with life_span=9, value=1\n\n- (2,6) with life_span=9, value=1\n\n- (4,6) with life_span=10, value=1\n\nAll food is positive, value=1, so eating them increases length by 1. No negative food here.\n\nLife span: each has a countdown, decreases each turn, including this one. So after N turns, it disappears. For (4,5), life_span=9, so it will disappear after 9 turns, meaning it will be gone on turn 10 if not eaten. Similarly for others.\n\nSince current turn is 1, it will disappear when life_span reaches 0, I think. Life span decreases by 1 per turn, so on turn 1, it has life_span left, so after turn 1, it becomes 8, and so on, until 0, then it disappears.\n\nBut for decision, I need to consider that food might disappear if I don't eat it soon.\n\nNow, snake is at (3,4), head direction up. Since it's moving up, possible moves are U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Current direction is U, so I cannot move D (down) on the next turn because that would be opposite.\n\nNo instant reverse means that from current direction, I cannot choose the opposite for the immediate next move. So from U, I can go U, L, or R, but not D.\n\nSimilarly for future turns, I need to consider the direction when making moves.\n\nBut the snake has only one segment, so no body to collide with except walls and obstacles. Also, since it's just the head, moving into a cell is fine as long as not wall or obstacle.\n\nNow, let's list possible moves from (3,4):\n\n- Up (U): to (3,5)\n\n- Down (D): but cannot because current direction U, no instant reverse.\n\n- Left (L): to (2,4)\n\n- Right (R): to (4,4)\n\nBut (4,4) is an internal obstacle? Walls include internal obstacles: (4,4) is listed, so (4,4) is blocked.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)\n\n(2,4) is also an obstacle? (2,4) is in the list.\n\nSo from (3,4):\n\n- U to (3,5): is this free? (3,5) not in walls or obstacles? Walls are borders and internal. Borders: x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (3,5) is within, x=3, y=5, not 0 or 7. Internal obstacles: (3,5) not listed, so should be free.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), (3,2), (4,4), (5,1), (5,6), (6,3), (1,5). (1,5) is there.\n\n(3,5) not in list, so free.\n\n- L to (2,4): (2,4) is an internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\n- R to (4,4): (4,4) is internal obstacle, cannot move.\n\n- D: not allowed due to no instant reverse.\n\nSo only possible move is Up to (3,5).\n\nIs that right? Current position (3,4), direction U.\n\nPossible cells:\n\n- (3,5) up: not wall, not obstacle, should be ok.\n\n- (3,3) down: but cannot move down because opposite direction.\n\n- (2,4) left: but (2,4) is obstacle, so blocked.\n\n- (4,4) right: (4,4) obstacle, blocked.\n\nSo indeed, only possible move is Up to (3,5).\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. (0,0) to (7,7), but borders are walls, so cells like (0,y), (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls.\n\nAlso internal: specific points.\n\nSo (3,4) to (3,5): y=5, which is not 0 or 7, so not border wall. And (3,5) not in internal obstacles list.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2). (3,5) not there, so free.\n\nSimilarly, other directions blocked or not allowed.\n\nSo on turn 1, I must move Up to (3,5).\n\nBut the answer should be for multiple turns, I think. I need to plan at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe state says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and answer format is Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\n\nSince on turn 1, I have only one choice, I must move U.\n\nThen on subsequent turns, I can choose.\n\nAlso, after moving, the snake will be at (3,5), and since it ate no food, length still 1, so positions [(3,5)].\n\nDirection: since I moved U, new direction is U.\n\nNow, from there, I can plan.\n\nBut let's list the food positions:\n\n- (4,5) life=9, val=1\n\n- (3,6) life=9, val=1\n\n- (2,6) life=9, val=1\n\n- (4,6) life=10, val=1\n\nAll at y=6 or 5, so above.\n\n(4,5) is at (4,5), which is adjacent to current position (3,4)? After move to (3,5), I will be at (3,5).\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nPossible moves from (3,5), direction U:\n\n- U to (3,6)\n\n- D to (3,4) – but no instant reverse, so if direction is U, cannot move D.\n\n- L to (2,5)\n\n- R to (4,5)\n\nNow, (3,6) has food? Food at (3,6), yes.\n\n(4,5) has food.\n\n(2,6) has food, but not directly adjacent.\n\n(4,6) has food.\n\nNow, cells:\n\n- (3,6): is it free? Not wall, not obstacle? Walls: borders y=0,7, x=0,7. (3,6) y=6<7, so not border. Internal obstacles: (3,6) not listed, so free.\n\n- (2,5): x=2, y=5, not border. Internal: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) not listed, so should be free.\n\n- (4,5): x=4,y=5, not border. Internal: (4,4) obstacle, but (4,5) not listed, so free.\n\nAlso, (4,5) has food.\n\n(3,6) has food.\n\nSince snake is length 1, no body collision possible yet.\n\nI need to think about eating food.\n\nIf I move to (3,6), I eat the food there, since head moves to food cell.\n\nSimilarly for (4,5).\n\nBut I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nAlso, life span: all food has life around 9-10, so plenty of time, since current turn 1, and life decreases each turn.\n\nFor example, (3,6) life=9, after turn 1, on turn 2 it will have life=8, etc. Since I'm at turn 1, moving to (3,5) on turn 1.\n\nTurn 1: move to (3,5)\n\nNow turn 2: I am at (3,5), direction U.\n\nPossible actions:\n\n- U to (3,6): eat food at (3,6)? (3,6) has food, so if I move there, I eat it, snake grows to length 2.\n\n- R to (4,5): eat food at (4,5)\n\n- L to (2,5): no food there\n\n- D to (3,4): not allowed, opposite direction.\n\nCannot move D.\n\nSo choices: U, L, or R.\n\nIf I go U to (3,6), I eat food, grow to length 2. New position: head at (3,6), and tail at (3,5)? When snake eats, it grows, so positions: after eating, head moves to food, and tail stays or grows.\n\nStandard Snake: when you eat food, you grow, so the body extends. But since it was length 1, after eating, it becomes length 2, with head at new position and tail at previous position.\n\nThen when moving, both move.\n\nBut in this case, on turn 2, if I move to (3,6) and eat, snake becomes [(3,6), (3,5)] with head at (3,6), tail at (3,5).\n\nDirection: since I moved U, direction is U.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (4,5), eat food, grow to [(4,5), (3,5)], direction R.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead.\n\nBut there is a danger with tail: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, tail doesn't have food; food is on empty cells.\n\nIn this state, no food under snake.\n\nAlso, food can spawn under body, but here it's not.\n\nFor now, no issue.\n\nNow, let's consider the options.\n\nFirst, on turn 2, if I go U to (3,6):\n\n- Eat food, grow to length 2, positions: head (3,6), tail (3,5)\n\nDirection U.\n\nFood at (3,6) is eaten, removed.\n\nOther food: (4,5), (2,6), (4,6) remain.\n\n(2,6) and (4,6) at y=6.\n\nFrom (3,6), possible moves:\n\nDirection U, so can go U, L, R, not D.\n\n- U to (3,7): but y=7 is border wall, cannot move there.\n\n- L to (2,6): (2,6) has food? Yes, food at (2,6), so can eat it.\n\n- R to (4,6): (4,6) has food, can eat it.\n\n- D to (3,5): but (3,5) is tail, and direction opposite, but also, moving there might cause collision?\n\nNow, collision: head touches body segment.\n\nAfter eating, positions: head (3,6), tail (3,5). So body segment at (3,5).\n\nIf I move D to (3,5), head moves to (3,5), which is where the tail is. But in Snake, when you move, the tail also moves, so if head moves to tail position, and tail moves away, it might be ok or not.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to tail cell is allowed because tail moves.\n\nSo from (3,6), if I move D to (3,5), tail is at (3,5), but after move, head goes to (3,5), and tail moves... where? Since snake moves, the tail moves to the previous position or something.\n\nWhen snake moves, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the next position.\n\nSo if positions are [A, B] with A head, B tail.\n\nAfter move to new cell C, new positions [C, A], so tail was at B, now at A.\n\nIf head moves to the current tail position, say to B, then new positions [B, A], but A was the previous head, so now head at B, tail at A.\n\nBut B was tail, now it's head, and A is now tail.\n\nNo collision because the tail moved from B to A, and head is at B.\n\nBut in this case, when moving to tail cell, it should be fine, as per rule.\n\nMoreover, if I don't eat food, length same.\n\nBut here, if I move D from (3,6) to (3,5), I don't eat food (no food at (3,5)), so length remains 2, positions become head (3,5), tail (3,6)? Let's see:\n\nCurrent positions: head (3,6), tail (3,5)\n\nMove D to (3,5): new head at (3,5), and the tail moves to where the head was, so to (3,6)? No.\n\nStandard movement: the body segments follow. So for a snake of length 2: positions [P_head, P_tail]\n\nAfter moving head to new cell, the tail moves to where the head was? No.\n\nIn grid-based Snake, when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo if positions are [H, B1] for length 2, H is head, B1 is body (tail).\n\nAfter moving head to new cell H', the new positions are [H', H], and B1 is removed? No.\n\nFor length 2: segments: index 0: head, index 1: tail.\n\nAfter move, new head at new position, and tail moves to the old head position.\n\nSo new positions: [new_head, old_head]\n\nSo old tail is gone.\n\nIn this case: current: head at (3,6), tail at (3,5)\n\nMove head to (3,5): new head at (3,5), new tail at (3,6)? Old head was (3,6), so new tail at (3,6).\n\nBut (3,5) is where tail was, but now head is there, and tail is at (3,6).\n\nNo collision because the tail moved.\n\nAnd (3,5) had no food, so no growth.\n\nBut in this case, moving to (3,5) is possible, but (3,5) is empty now, since tail moved.\n\nBack to from (3,6) after eating.\n\nIf I move to (3,5), it's possible, but I might not want to, since no food.\n\nBut from (3,6), U is wall, so cannot.\n\nL to (2,6) or R to (4,6), both have food.\n\n(2,6) has food, (4,6) has food.\n\nIf I go L to (2,6), eat food, grow to length 3: positions [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ]? After eating, head moves to (2,6), and since it ate, a new segment is added, so tail extends.\n\nWhen you eat, the tail doesn't move, so it grows.\n\nSo from current [ (3,6), (3,5) ], move head to (2,6), which has food, so after move, head at (2,6), and since ate, the tail stays, so new segment added at the end.\n\nPositions: new head at (2,6), then the previous head (3,6) becomes body, and tail (3,5) remains, so [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ]\n\nLength 3.\n\nSimilarly, if go to (4,6), [ (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) ]\n\nDirection: if I move L, direction L; move R, direction R.\n\nNow, back to turn 2 decision.\n\nFirst, on turn 1, I must move U to (3,5), as only choice.\n\nThen on turn 2, at (3,5), direction U.\n\nI can:\n\n- Move U to (3,6): eat food, grow to length 2, head (3,6), tail (3,5)\n\n- Move R to (4,5): eat food at (4,5), grow to length 2, head (4,5), tail (3,5)\n\n- Move L to (2,5): no food, so stay length 1, head to (2,5), but (2,5) is free? Internal obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) not, so should be free.\n\nAfter moving to (2,5), positions [(2,5)], length 1, direction L.\n\nBut then I miss the food at (3,6) or (4,5).\n\nSince all food is positive, I should eat one to grow.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nThere is also (2,6) and (4,6) nearby.\n\nAlso, (4,6) life=10, others life=9, but all similar.\n\nNow, if I go to (3,6) on turn 2, I eat that food, then from there, I can go to (2,6) or (4,6) to eat another.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (4,5) on turn 2, eat there, then from (4,5), I can go to (4,6) to eat, or other places.\n\nBut let's see the obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), (3,2), (4,4), (5,1), (5,6), (6,3), (1,5)\n\n(5,6) is obstacle, which is near (4,6) and (5,6) itself is blocked.\n\n(4,6) is food, but (5,6) is obstacle, so cannot go right from (4,6) to (5,6).\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) obstacle, but far.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat as much as possible, but with survival.\n\nSince snake is short, low risk.\n\nBut I need to plan 5 turns.\n\nAlso, after eating, the food disappears, so I need to target other food.\n\nLet's list the grid for clarity.\n\nGrid 8x8, but walls at borders, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Borders are walls, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacles.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since x=0,7 and y=0,7 walls.\n\n(0,y) and (7,y) walls, (x,0) and (x,7) walls.\n\nSo cells (1,1) to (6,6) are possible, except obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), (5,6), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)\n\n(3,2) at (3,2), etc.\n\nCurrent: turn 1, snake at (3,4), move U to (3,5) on turn 1.\n\nTurn 2: at (3,5), direction U.\n\nNow, let's consider two main options: go to (3,6) or go to (4,5).\n\nOption A: Turn 2 move U to (3,6)\n\n- Eat food, grow to length 2, positions [(3,6), (3,5)]\n\nDirection U.\n\nNow turn 3: from (3,6), direction U.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (3,7): y=7 wall, cannot\n\n- D to (3,5): not allowed, opposite direction? Direction is U, so cannot move D.\n\n- L to (2,6): free, has food? (2,6) has food, yes\n\n- R to (4,6): free, has food? (4,6) has food, yes\n\nSo can go L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n\nSay I go L to (2,6): eat food, grow to length 3, positions: head at (2,6), then (3,6), then (3,5) so [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow turn 4: from (2,6), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- L to (1,6): x=1, y=6. Is it free? Not border wall, internal obstacles: (1,4) and (1,5) are obstacles? (1,5) is obstacle, (1,4) obstacle, but (1,6) not listed, so should be free.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,4), (1,5) — (1,5) is listed, so (1,5) blocked. (1,6) not listed, so free.\n\n- R to (3,6): but (3,6) is body? Positions: head (2,6), body at (3,6), tail at (3,5). So (3,6) is occupied by body. If I move R to (3,6), head would touch body segment, collision.\n\n- U to (2,7): y=7 wall, cannot\n\n- D to (2,5): free, no food? (2,5) no food mentioned.\n\nFood positions: we have (4,5) and (4,6) left? (2,6) was eaten, (3,6) eaten, (4,5) and (4,6) still there.\n\n(4,5) life=9, but turns passing.\n\nAfter turn 2, on turn 3, when I move to (2,6), I eat that food.\n\nRemaining food: (4,5) and (4,6)\n\n(4,5) at (4,5), (4,6) at (4,6)\n\nNow from (2,6), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- L to (1,6): free, no food\n\n- D to (2,5): free, no food\n\n- U: cannot, wall\n\n- R to (3,6): body collision, since (3,6) is body segment.\n\nSo only L or D.\n\nIf I go L to (1,6), no food, positions: head to (1,6), tail moves, so since length 3, new positions: head (1,6), then (2,6), then (3,6), tail at (3,5) moves to (3,6)? Movement: head to new, each segment to previous position.\n\nCurrent positions: [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] index 0:head, 1:body, 2:tail\n\nMove head to (1,6), no eat, so no grow, new positions: head (1,6), body at (2,6), tail at (3,6) — since body segments shift: segment 1 moves to where head was, segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was.\n\nSo new: [ (1,6), (2,6), (3,6) ]\n\nTail at (3,6), which was body.\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other places.\n\nBut no food eaten, and (4,5) and (4,6) still there.\n\nIf from (2,6) I go D to (2,5): head to (2,5), no food, new positions: head (2,5), then (2,6), then (3,6), tail at (3,5) moves to (3,6)? Current [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ]\n\nMove head to (2,5), no eat, new positions: [ (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) ]\n\nDirection D (since moved down from (2,6) to (2,5)? From (2,6) to (2,5) is down, y decreases.\n\nDirection was L, but I moved D, so new direction D.\n\nThen at (2,5), I can move to other cells.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach the remaining food.\n\n(4,5) at (4,5), (4,6) at (4,6)\n\nFrom (2,5), I can move to (3,5), but (3,5) is where? In the positions, after move, tail at (3,6), so (3,5) is free now? Positions [ (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) ], so (3,5) free.\n\n(3,5) has no food.\n\nThen to (4,5), but (4,5) has food, but I need to go right.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (4,4), but (4,5) is above.\n\nFrom (2,5), move R to (3,5): (3,5) free, no food, positions become [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) ], direction R.\n\nThen from (3,5), can move to (4,5): (4,5) has food, so eat it.\n\nBut this is taking many turns.\n\nBack to turn 3 after going to (3,6) on turn 2.\n\nFrom (3,6), instead of going L to (2,6), I could go R to (4,6).\n\nTurn 2: move U to (3,6), eat, positions [(3,6),(3,5)] dir U\n\nTurn 3: move R to (4,6), eat food at (4,6), grow to length 3, positions [ (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] dir R\n\nNow turn 4: from (4,6), direction R.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- R to (5,6): but (5,6) is internal obstacle, cannot\n\n- L to (3,6): body, since (3,6) is body segment, collision\n\n- U to (4,7): y=7 wall, cannot\n\n- D to (4,5): (4,5) has food? Yes, (4,5) has food.\n\nSo can go D to (4,5).\n\nMove D to (4,5), eat food, grow to length 4, positions: head to (4,5), so [ (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) ]? After eating, head at (4,5), previous head (4,6) becomes body, so [ (4,5), (4,6), (3,6) ], and tail (3,5) remains, but since ate, new segment, so positions [ (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) ]? Let's sequence.\n\nCurrent before move: [ (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] head (4,6), body (3,6), tail (3,5)\n\nMove head to (4,5), which has food, so after move, head at (4,5), and since ate, a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move, positions: new head (4,5), then the previous segments: (4,6) becomes body, (3,6) body, and (3,5) tail, but new segment added, so it becomes [ (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) ]? No.\n\nStandard: when you eat, the tail stays in place, so the body extends.\n\nSo from positions [A, B, C] with A head, B body, C tail.\n\nMove head to D, eat food: new head at D, then A becomes body, B becomes body, C remains, and new segment added at C, so [D, A, B, C] but C is tail, new segment is after C? I think I'm confusing.\n\nTypically, the snake grows by adding a new segment at the tail position after movement, but since tail moves, it's before movement.\n\nEasier: after moving the head to new cell, if food eaten, a new segment is added at the current tail position, so tail doesn't move.\n\nIf no food, tail moves to the next position.\n\nIn this case: before move, positions [ (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) ]\n\nMove head to (4,5), eat food.\n\nSo new head at (4,5).\n\nThen, since ate, the tail (3,5) does not move; a new segment is added there, but the segments: the body moves: (3,6) moves to where (4,6) was, but (4,6) is the old head.\n\nNew positions: head at (4,5), then the old head (4,6) becomes the first body segment, then (3,6) becomes the second body segment, and since ate, a new tail segment is added at the old tail position (3,5), so positions: [ (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) ]\n\nLength 4.\n\nDirection: moved D, so direction D.\n\nNow at (4,5), direction D.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- D to (4,4): but (4,4) is internal obstacle, cannot\n\n- U to (4,6): (4,6) is body? Positions: head (4,5), body at (4,6), (3,6), tail at (3,5). So (4,6) is occupied, if move U to (4,6), collision.\n\n- L to (3,5): (3,5) is tail, but moving to tail cell is allowed, as per rule, because tail will move.\n\n- R to (5,5): (5,5) free? Not wall, internal obstacles: (5,6) obstacle, (5,1) obstacle, but (5,5) not listed, so free.\n\nAlso no food.\n\nSo possible moves:\n\nL to (3,5) or R to (5,5)\n\nIf move L to (3,5): (3,5) is tail, so allowed. After move, no eat (no food), so tail moves. New head at (3,5), old head (4,5) becomes body, so positions: [ (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6) ] and tail (3,5) moves? Old tail at (3,5), head moves to (3,5), but (3,5) is occupied by tail.\n\nRule: you can move into tail cell because tail moves.\n\nAfter move, new head at (3,5), which was tail, but tail moves to where it was supposed to.\n\nCurrent positions: [ (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] head (4,5), body (4,6), (3,6), tail (3,5)\n\nMove head to (3,5): new head at (3,5), and the body segments move: (4,5) becomes body, (4,6) becomes body, (3,6) becomes tail? Since no eat, the last segment is removed or moves.\n\nWhen no eat, the tail segment is removed.\n\nSo new positions: the head moves to (3,5), then the first body segment moves to old head position (4,5), second body to (4,6), and the tail (3,6) is removed? Let's index.\n\nSegments: 0: (4,5) head, 1: (4,6) body, 2: (3,6) body, 3: (3,5) tail\n\nMove head to (3,5), which is the tail position.\n\nSince no food, after move, new head at (3,5), then segment 1 moves to (4,5), segment 2 moves to (4,6), and segment 3 (tail) is removed, so new positions: [ (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) ]\n\nLength 3, since no grow.\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen from there, I can move to other cells.\n\nBut this is getting messy, and I have the tail danger to consider later.\n\nBut for now, snake is small.\n\nEarlier, on turn 2, I have another choice: instead of going to (3,6), go to (4,5).\n\nLet's go back to turn 2.\n\nAt turn 2, position (3,5), direction U.\n\nOption B: move R to (4,5)\n\nEat food at (4,5), grow to length 2, positions [ (4,5), (3,5) ] direction R.\n\nNow turn 3: from (4,5), direction R.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- R to (5,5): free, no food\n\n- L to (3,5): tail, but can move to tail cell, allowed\n\n- U to (4,6): (4,6) has food\n\n- D to (4,4): (4,4) obstacle, cannot\n\nSo can go U to (4,6), R to (5,5), or L to (3,5)\n\nIf go U to (4,6), eat food, grow to length 3, positions [ (4,6), (4,5), (3,5) ] dir U\n\nThen similar to before.\n\nFrom (4,6), can go D to (4,5) but body, or L to (3,6) which has food but not anymore? (3,6) food was there, but not eaten yet.\n\nIn this path, I didn't eat (3,6), so it's still there.\n\nFood: (3,6) life=9, (2,6) life=9, (4,6) life=10.\n\nAfter turn 2, I ate (4,5), so food left: (3,6), (2,6), (4,6)\n\nOn turn 3, if I go U to (4,6), eat (4,6), so grow.\n\nPositions [ (4,6), (4,5), (3,5) ] dir U\n\nThen turn 4: from (4,6), direction U.\n\nMoves:\n\n- U to (4,7): wall, cannot\n\n- D to (4,5): body, collision if move there\n\n- L to (3,6): has food, free\n\n- R to (5,6): obstacle, cannot\n\nSo only L to (3,6), eat food, grow to length 4, positions [ (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5) ] dir L\n\nThen from (3,6), I can go to (2,6) or other.\n\nBut (2,6) has food.\n\nTurn 5: from (3,6), direction L.\n\nMoves:\n\n- L to (2,6): eat food, grow\n\n- U: wall, cannot\n\n- D to (3,5): body or tail? Positions: head (3,6), body (4,6), (4,5), tail (3,5). (3,5) is tail, so can move to it, no collision.\n\n- R to (4,6): body, collision\n\nSo can go L to (2,6) or D to (3,5)\n\nIf go L to (2,6), eat, grow to length 5, positions [ (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5) ] dir L\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut I need to think about the initial choice.\n\nOn turn 2, if I go to (4,5) and then to (4,6), I eat two food quickly.\n\nIf I go directly to (3,6) on turn 2, I can eat (3,6) and then (2,6) or (4,6).\n\nBut (4,6) is available in both.\n\nAlso, there is (2,6) which I can eat.\n\nBut in the first option, when I went to (3,6) on turn 2, then to (2,6) on turn 3, I was stuck at (2,6) with only L or D, no food nearby, and (4,5) still there but far.\n\nWhereas if I go to (4,5) on turn 2, then to (4,6) on turn 3, I eat both, and then I can go to (3,6) on turn 4.\n\n(3,6) is still there, life span 9, on turn 4 it has life=9-3=6? Let's track turns.\n\nCurrent turn t1=1.\n\nTurn 1: move to (3,5)\n\nFood life: all start with life_span, decrease each turn.\n\nOn turn 1, before move, food has life as given.\n\nAfter turn 1, life decreases.\n\nThe state is at the beginning of turn 1.\n\nOn turn 1, I make a move.\n\nAfter move, turn ends, life decreases.\n\nSimilarly for each turn.\n\nAt turn 1 start: food (4,5) life=9, (3,6) life=9, (2,6) life=9, (4,6) life=10\n\nAfter turn 1 move to (3,5), no eat, so life decrease: all food life decrease by 1, so on turn 2 start: (4,5) life=8, (3,6) life=8, (2,6) life=8, (4,6) life=9\n\nTurn 2: if I move to (3,6), eat it, life=8, so it's eaten.\n\nIf move to (4,5), eat it.\n\nThen on turn 3, remaining food have life decreased again.\n\nBut all have plenty of life, so not urgent.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nTo maximize, I should eat all four food if possible.\n\nBut with obstacles, it might be tight.\n\nAlso, the snake needs to survive.\n\nFor long-term, after eating, I need to find more food, but no other food given, so only these for now.\n\nPerhaps more food spawns later, but not specified, so I assume only these for the near future.\n\nThe state only gives current food, so I think for planning, only these exist.\n\nSo I need to eat as many as possible.\n\nNow, from (3,5), if I go to (3,6) on turn 2, I eat one, then from (3,6), I can go to (4,6) or (2,6).\n\nIf I go to (4,6), I eat another, then from (4,6), I can go down to (4,5) but (4,5) is not eaten yet? In this case, (4,5) is still there.\n\nAfter eating (3,6) on turn 2, positions [(3,6),(3,5)] dir U\n\nTurn 3: move R to (4,6), eat (4,6), positions [ (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] dir R\n\nThen turn 4: from (4,6), can move D to (4,5), eat (4,5), positions grow to [ (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] dir D\n\nThen at (4,5), I have (2,6) still, but it's at (2,6), far.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can move to (3,5) or (5,5), but (3,5) is tail, can move, or (5,5).\n\nThen to reach (2,6), I need to go left, but with body, it might be risky.\n\nFor example, from [ (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) ], if move L to (3,5), tail, no eat, positions become [ (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6) ] dir L\n\nThen from (3,5), can move L to (2,5), no food, positions [ (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) ] dir L\n\nThen from (2,5), move U to (2,6), eat (2,6), grow, positions [ (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) ] dir U\n\nThen I have eaten all four food.\n\nSimilarly, if I start by going to (4,5) on turn 2.\n\nTurn 2: move R to (4,5), eat, positions [ (4,5), (3,5) ] dir R\n\nTurn 3: move U to (4,6), eat (4,6), positions [ (4,6), (4,5), (3,5) ] dir U\n\nTurn 4: move L to (3,6), eat (3,6), positions [ (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5) ] dir L\n\nTurn 5: move L to (2,6), eat (2,6), positions [ (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5) ] dir L\n\nIn both cases, I can eat all four by turn 5.\n\nIn the first sequence, with turn 2 to (3,6), then turn 3 to (4,6), turn 4 to (4,5), then turn 5 to (3,5)? From (4,5) to (3,5) is turn 5, but (2,6) not eaten yet.\n\nIn the sequence above for option A, after turn 4 at (4,5), then turn 5 move to (3,5), no eat, then turn 6 move to (2,5), no eat, turn 7 move to (2,6), eat.\n\nSo slower.\n\nIn option B, I can eat (2,6) on turn 5.\n\nSimilarly, in the second sequence for option B, I eat (2,6) on turn 5.\n\nBut in option B, on turn 4 I move to (3,6), which is eating (3,6), then turn 5 to (2,6).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, on turn 2, if I go to (4,5) first, I can eat (4,6) on turn 3, then (3,6) on turn 4, then (2,6) on turn 5.\n\nIf I go to (3,6) first on turn 2, then to (4,6) on turn 3, then to (4,5) on turn 4, but then (2,6) left, and I need to go to (2,6) via (3,5) and (2,5), which takes extra turns.\n\nFor example, after turn 4 at (4,5), positions [ (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] dir D\n\nTurn 5: move L to (3,5), no eat, positions [ (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6) ] dir L\n\nTurn 6: move L to (2,5), no food, positions [ (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) ] dir L\n\nTurn 7: move U to (2,6), eat, positions [ (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) ] dir U\n\nSo I eat (2,6) on turn 7, whereas in the other sequence, I eat it on turn 5.\n\nSimilarly, food life: on turn 5, (2,6) life was 9, decreased each turn: turn 1:9, turn2:8, turn3:7, turn4:6, turn5:5, so still there.\n\nBut to minimize turns, I should eat sooner.\n\nAlso, for score, eating faster might be better, but since no time penalty, just survival, but to have room for more food later.\n\nBut here, no other food, so eating all is good.\n\nIn the sequence where I go to (4,5) first, I can eat all by turn 5.\n\nOn turn 2, if I go to (4,5), then turn 3 to (4,6), turn 4 to (3,6), turn 5 to (2,6).\n\nYes, and (4,5) eaten on turn 2, (4,6) on turn 3, (3,6) on turn 4, (2,6) on turn 5.\n\nAll eaten.\n\nIf I go to (3,6) on turn 2, (3,6) eaten, turn 3 to (4,6), (4,6) eaten, turn 4 to (4,5), (4,5) eaten, then turn 5 to (3,5) not eat, turn 6 to (2,5) not eat, turn 7 to (2,6) eat. So (2,6) eaten later.\n\nThus, better to go to (4,5) first on turn 2.\n\nBut is there a reason not to? For example, if I go to (4,5) on turn 2, direction R, then turn 3 I can go U to (4,6) or other.\n\nBut in this case, it works.\n\nAnother option on turn 2: go L to (2,5), but no food, then I miss the opportunity to eat immediately, and food might disappear or I have to go back, wasting turns.\n\nFor example, go to (2,5) on turn 2, no eat, positions [(2,5)] dir L.\n\nThen turn 3, from (2,5), can move U to (2,6), eat (2,6), grow to [(2,6),(2,5)] dir U.\n\nThen turn 4, from (2,6), can move to (3,6) or (1,6), etc., but (3,6) has food, so go to (3,6), eat, grow to [(3,6),(2,6),(2,5)] dir R or L? Move to (3,6) from (2,6) is right, so dir R.\n\nThen turn 5, from (3,6), can go to (4,6) or (3,5), etc., go to (4,6) eat, grow.\n\nThen (4,5) left, need to go down, but from (4,6) to (4,5) is down, but direction might be U, so if I moved to (4,6) from (3,6), dir R, then from (4,6) dir R, move D to (4,5) is not opposite? Current dir R, move D is perpendicular, not opposite, so allowed.\n\nOpposite of R is L, U and D are perpendicular.\n\nSo can move D to (4,5) if possible.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (4,5), down, not opposite to R, so allowed.\n\nThen eat (4,5).\n\nBut I ate (2,6) on turn 3, (3,6) on turn 4, (4,6) on turn 5, (4,5) on turn 6, similar to before but later for (4,5).\n\nCompared to going to (4,5) first.\n\nIn terms of turns, eating (4,5) earlier might be better, but all similar.\n\nBut in the first sequence with (4,5) first, I eat three food by turn 4: (4,5) turn2, (4,6) turn3, (3,6) turn4, then (2,6) turn5.\n\nIf I go to (2,5) first, I eat (2,6) turn3, (3,6) turn4, (4,6) turn5, (4,5) turn6.\n\nSo (4,5) eaten later, but life is ok.\n\nBut since no difference, but to have shorter path, better to eat the food that allows chaining.\n\nNow, back to turn 1: I must move U to (3,5).\n\nThen for turn 2, I should move R to (4,5) to eat that food first, then proceed to eat others efficiently.\n\nIn the sequence: turn2 move R to (4,5), eat.\n\nThen turn3, from (4,5) dir R, move U to (4,6), eat (4,6).\n\nThen turn4, from (4,6) dir U, move L to (3,6), eat (3,6).\n\nThen turn5, from (3,6) dir L, move L to (2,6), but (2,6) is adjacent? From (3,6) to (2,6) is left, yes, eat (2,6).\n\nAll eaten by turn 5.\n\nIf on turn4, after (4,6), I go directly to (2,6), but (2,6) not adjacent, I have to go through (3,6).\n\nSo must go to (3,6) first.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn t1=1.\n\nTurn 1: action\n\nTurn 2: action\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 5 or more.\n\nSince I have a plan, I can output for turns 1 to 5.\n\nBut on turn 1, only U possible.\n\nThen turn 2, I choose R to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 3: U to (4,6)\n\nTurn 4: L to (3,6)\n\nTurn 5: L to (2,6)\n\nNow, what about the direction? I need to make sure no instant reverse.\n\nTurn 1: move U, direction U\n\nTurn 2: move R, from U to R, not opposite, ok, new direction R\n\nTurn 3: move U, from R to U, perpendicular, not opposite, ok, new direction U\n\nTurn 4: move L, from U to L, perpendicular, not opposite, ok, new direction L\n\nTurn 5: move L, from L to L, same direction, ok.\n\nAll good.\n\nI could go other ways, but this seems efficient.\n\nNow, about the tail danger: in this sequence, when I eat, the food is not under the body, so no issue.\n\nFor example, when I move to (4,5) on turn 2, it's empty, not under snake.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nAlso, when I have body, like after turn 3, positions [(4,6),(4,5),(3,5)], then move to (3,6), which was free.\n\nNo problem.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: R\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: L\n\nTurn 5: L\n\nBut turn 5 move to (2,6), which is food, eat.\n\nNow, beyond turn 5, I need to think, but the answer can be for 5 turns.\n\nThe state might change, but for now, this plan.\n\nIn the food, there is (4,5), (3,6), (2,6), (4,6), all eaten in this sequence.\n\n(4,6) eaten on turn 3, etc.\n\nIn the sequence: turn 2 eat (4,5), turn 3 eat (4,6), turn 4 eat (3,6), turn 5 eat (2,6).\n\nYes.\n\nIf on turn 2 I go to (3,6), then I eat (3,6) turn 2, then turn 3 to (4,6) eat, turn 4 to (4,5) eat, then to (2,6) later, as before.\n\nBut with extra turns.\n\nSo better to go to (4,5) first.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: R\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: L\n\nTurn 5: L\n\nNow, for the boxed answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan for 5+ Turns Ahead\n\n**Current State (Turn 1):**\n- Snake position: Head at (3,4), length 1 (only head segment).\n- Snake direction: Up (U).\n- Food:\n  - (4,5): value +1, life span 9\n  - (3,6): value +1, life span 9\n  - (2,6): value +1, life span 9\n  - (4,6): value +1, life span 10\n- Walls and obstacles: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2).\n\n**Key Constraints:**\n- No instant reverse: From current direction U, cannot move D on turn 2.\n- Collision risks: Only walls and obstacles matter initially; body collision risk increases as snake grows.\n- Food life spans: All food has high life span (9-10 turns), so no urgency, but eating efficiently maximizes score.\n- Grid boundaries: Playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 (borders are walls).\n\n**Turn 1 (Immediate Move):**\n- Only possible move is U to (3,5), as:\n  - D is opposite direction (not allowed).\n  - L to (2,4) is an internal obstacle.\n  - R to (4,4) is an internal obstacle.\n- After move: Snake at (3,5), direction U, no growth (no food eaten). Food life decreases by 1.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy (5+ Turns):**\n- **Goal**: Maximize score by eating all 4 positive food quickly and safely. Prioritize a path that:\n  - Eats high-value food in sequence to minimize turns and avoid dead ends.\n  - Avoids obstacles and walls.\n  - Maintains flexibility for future moves after eating all food.\n- **Optimal Path Identified**:\n  - **Turn 2**: Move R to (4,5) to eat food. This starts a chain eating the clustered food efficiently.\n  - **Turn 3**: Move U to (4,6) to eat food.\n  - **Turn 4**: Move L to (3,6) to eat food.\n  - **Turn 5**: Move L to (2,6) to eat food.\n- **Why this sequence?**\n  - Eats all food by turn 5, scoring +4 and growing to length 5.\n  - Avoids risks: No body collisions (snake is short during this sequence) and no wall/obstacle issues.\n  - Efficient: Minimizes turns to eat all food compared to alternatives (e.g., moving to (3,6) first would delay eating (2,6)).\n  - Direction changes are valid: No instant reverse (U → R → U → L → L are all perpendicular or same direction).\n- **Post-Turn 5**: After eating all food, the snake can explore safely. For example, from (2,6) on turn 5, possible moves include D to (2,5) or L to (1,6), both safe with no immediate threats.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- **Body Collision**: Not an issue until snake length >2. In this sequence, collision risk starts at turn 4 (length 3), but moves are planned to avoid self-intersection (e.g., moving away from body).\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Not applicable, as no food is under the snake's body.\n- **Food Life Span**: All food has sufficient life (e.g., (2,6) life span 8 on turn 2, eaten on turn 5 with life span 5 left), so no risk of disappearance.\n- **Obstacles/Walls**: Path avoids all obstacles (e.g., (4,4) and (2,4) are blocked, but moves steer clear).\n\n**Alternative Paths Considered:**\n- Moving to (3,6) on turn 2: Eats (3,6) but then requires extra turns to reach (2,6), eating it on turn 7 instead of turn 5.\n- Moving to (2,5) on turn 2: Avoids immediate food but wastes turns and risks missing food if life spans were shorter.\n- This path is superior for both score and survival.\n\n**Planned Actions (Turns 1-5):**\n- Turn 1: U (only choice, move to (3,5))\n- Turn 2: R (eat (4,5), grow to length 2)\n- Turn 3: U (eat (4,6), grow to length 3)\n- Turn 4: L (eat (3,6), grow to length 4)\n- Turn 5: L (eat (2,6), grow to length 5)\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: U \\\\\nTurn 2: R \\\\\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: L \\\\\nTurn 5: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the current turn is t1 = 2. The grid has walls: border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2). I need to avoid these.\n\nThe snake positions are given as [(3,5)], but that's just one position? That can't be right. If it's only one segment, that means the snake is just the head, so length 1. Let me check: \"Snake Positions: [(3,5)]\" – yes, only one coordinate, so the snake has no body yet; it's just the head.\n\nHead direction is Up, so it's moving upwards.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (4,5) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (3,6) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (2,6) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (4,6) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive; no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, and life span decreases each turn.\n\nSince the snake has only one segment, eating food will increase its length. But with length 1, there's no body to collide with yet, except walls and obstacles.\n\nAlso, the tail reward danger isn't an issue because there's no tail yet.\n\nI need to plan 5+ turns ahead, prioritizing long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid. I'll sketch a grid to visualize.\n\nGrid from (0,0) to (7,7). (0,0) is bottom-left, I assume, since y=0 is bottom? Typically in such grids, y increases upwards, but in coordinates, it might vary. Head direction is Up, so y increasing up makes sense. Let's confirm: head at (3,5), moving U, so (3,6) would be up.\n\nSo, (x,y): x from left to right, y from bottom to top? Walls: y=0 bottom, y=7 top, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nInternal obstacles:\n\n- (5,6)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (3,2)\n\nSnake head at (3,5)\n\nFood at:\n\n- (4,5) – right of head\n\n- (3,6) – directly above head\n\n- (2,6) – left and up\n\n- (4,6) – right and up\n\nAll food has high life span, so no immediate disappearance risk.\n\nCurrent head position: (3,5)\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R. But head direction is U, so cannot move down immediately? No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is U, so cannot move D on this turn.\n\nSo possible actions: U, L, R. D is not allowed.\n\nNow, from (3,5):\n\n- U: to (3,6) – there's food at (3,6), so eating it would increase length to 2.\n\n- L: to (2,5) – is this cell free? No walls or obstacles? Walls are borders and internal obstacles. (2,5) is not listed as obstacle, and not wall since x=2, y=5, within 0-7.\n\n- R: to (4,5) – there's food at (4,5), so eating it.\n\n- D: not possible, reverse.\n\nIf I move U to (3,6), I eat the food there. Snake grows to length 2: head at (3,6), tail at (3,5)? After eating, when snake moves, the head moves to new position, and if food eaten, tail doesn't move, so body grows. Since length was 1, after eating, head moves to (3,6), and tail remains at (3,5), so now snake is [(3,6), (3,5)].\n\nSimilarly, if move R to (4,5), eat food, snake becomes [(4,5), (3,5)].\n\nIf move L to (2,5), no food, so snake moves to (2,5), and since no food, tail disappears? But length was 1, no tail. Moving to (2,5) with no food, snake should stay at (2,5) with length 1, I think. When no food eaten, the snake moves, head to new position, tail segment is removed, but since only one segment, after move, head is at new position with no body.\n\nLet's clarify snake movement:\n\n- When moving without eating: head moves to new cell, last segment (tail) is removed.\n\n- When eating: head moves to new cell with food, new segment added at the end, so tail stays, and a new segment is added? No.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, so the tail does not move, thus length increases by one. The body segments remain as they are, head moves to new position.\n\nFor a snake with length L:\n\n- If no eat: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment ahead, so tail cell is vacated.\n\n- If eat: head moves to food cell, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so tail doesn't move, and new segment is added there? I'm confusing myself.\n\nBetter to think: after movement, if food eaten, length increases; the head is at new position, and the body includes the previous positions.\n\nSpecifically for this case:\n\nInitial: snake positions [(3,5)], length 1.\n\nAfter move:\n\n- If move to a cell with food: head moves to that cell, and the previous position becomes the tail, so snake now has two segments: head at new position, tail at (3,5).\n\n- If move to empty cell: head moves to new position, and since no tail, it's just head at new position, still length 1. The old position is vacated.\n\nYes.\n\nSo here, if I move to a food cell, length becomes 2 with head and tail.\n\nIf not, length remains 1.\n\nNow, back to possible moves at turn 2:\n\n- U to (3,6): eat food, grow to length 2, head at (3,6), body at (3,5)\n\n- R to (4,5): eat food, grow to length 2, head at (4,5), body at (3,5)\n\n- L to (2,5): no food, so move to (2,5), length still 1.\n\nD not possible.\n\nNow, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, check if cells are free.\n\nFirst, (3,6): has food, but is it accessible? No walls or obstacles? (3,6) is not an obstacle, and not wall. y=6 is not y=7, so should be fine.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5): food, no obstacle.\n\n(2,5): empty, no obstacle.\n\nNow, after this move, turn 3, and so on.\n\nI need to maximize score, so eating food is good, but avoid risks.\n\nWith length 1, no body collision risk, only walls and obstacles.\n\nBut after eating, body exists, so collision possible.\n\nAlso, food can be under body, but here no body yet.\n\nNow, let's consider each option for turn 2.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (3,6) at turn 2.\n\n- Eat food at (3,6), snake now: head at (3,6), body at (3,5), so positions [(3,6), (3,5)], length 2. Head direction now U? After moving U, direction is U.\n\nAt turn 3, head at (3,6), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R (not D, since current direction U).\n\n- U to (3,7): but y=7 is wall, so collision, die. Invalid.\n\n- L to (2,6): there is food at (2,6), so eat it.\n\n- R to (4,6): there is food at (4,6), eat it.\n\nAlso, D to (3,5): but (3,5) is the tail. Since body is at (3,5), moving to (3,5) would collide with body? But rule says: can move into tail cell because tail will move.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo if I move D to (3,5), which is the tail, after move, head moves to (3,5), and tail moves away? Let's see.\n\nCurrent positions: head (3,6), tail (3,5).\n\nIf I move D to (3,5):\n\n- Head moves to (3,5), but (3,5) is occupied by tail.\n\nAfter movement: head goes to new cell, then body segments follow.\n\nIf head moves to the current tail position, and since tail will move to where the next segment was, but there is no next segment, only two segments.\n\nSequence:\n\n- Head moves to (3,5)\n\n- Then the body segment (which was tail at (3,5)) needs to move to the previous head position? No.\n\nIn snake movement:\n\n- The head moves to the new cell.\n\n- Then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n\nFor two segments:\n\n- Head at A, tail at B.\n\n- Move head to new cell C.\n\n- If C is not B, then tail moves to A.\n\n- If C is B, then head moves to B, and tail would move to A, but A is now empty? Let's think.\n\nStandard: when head moves to a cell, if that cell was the tail, it's okay because the tail moves away simultaneously.\n\nIn this case, with only two segments:\n\n- Head at (3,6), tail at (3,5)\n\n- Move head to (3,5) (down)\n\n- Head now at (3,5)\n\n- Tail needs to move: since head was at (3,6), tail moves to (3,6)\n\nSo after move, head at (3,5), tail at (3,6), so positions [(3,5), (3,6)]\n\nNo food eaten, so length same, but positions swapped.\n\nAnd no collision because tail moved away.\n\nSimilarly, if there was food, but here no food at (3,5), so just movement.\n\nBack to turn 3 options after moving U at turn 2.\n\nAt turn 3, head at (3,6), direction U (since last move U).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (3,7) - wall, die\n\n- D: (3,5) - can move, as above, to tail position, which is safe.\n\n- L: (2,6) - food there\n\n- R: (4,6) - food there\n\nAlso, (3,6) has no food now, since eaten at turn 2.\n\nNow, if I move L to (2,6), eat food, so snake grows: head to (2,6), and new tail added? After eating, head moves to (2,6), tail remains at (3,5)? No.\n\nCurrent: head (3,6), tail (3,5)\n\nMove head to (2,6) which has food.\n\nEat food, so head at (2,6), and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the end, so tail stays at (3,5), and a new segment is added where? The body grows by adding a segment at the tail position before movement? I need to clarify.\n\nStandard snake growth: when food is eaten, the tail does not move, so the segment that was the tail remains, and the head moves to the new cell, thus increasing length.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Before move: segments [H, T] at positions (3,6) and (3,5)\n\n- Move head to (2,6) which has food.\n\n- After move: head at (2,6), and since food eaten, the tail does not move, so now segments are [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ]? No.\n\nThe body: the segment that was at (3,6) becomes the neck, and tail at (3,5) stays.\n\nMovement:\n\n- Head moves to new position (2,6)\n\n- The body segment that was behind head moves to where head was, so (3,6) moves to (2,6)? No.\n\nChain: positions are updated sequentially.\n\nTypically: the head moves to new cell. Then, for the body, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\nSo for snake with segments [S0=head, S1, S2, ..., Sk=tail]\n\nAfter move: new head position, then S1 moves to old S0 position, S2 to old S1, etc.\n\nThen, if food eaten, a new segment is added at the old tail position, so tail doesn't move.\n\nIn this case with two segments:\n\n- Current: S0 = head at (3,6), S1 = tail at (3,5)\n\n- Move head to (2,6)\n\n- New head: (2,6)\n\n- S1 (tail) moves to old S0 position: (3,6)\n\n- Since food eaten at (2,6), a new segment is added at the old tail position before move, which was (3,5), so now segments: head (2,6), then S1 at (3,6), and new tail at (3,5)\n\nSo snake: [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] length 3.\n\nSimilarly, if no food eaten, no new segment, S1 moves to (3,6), and old S1 position (3,5) is vacated.\n\nBut in this case, with food, it grows.\n\nBack to turn 3 options.\n\nIf at turn 3, from (3,6), move L to (2,6):\n\n- Eat food at (2,6), snake now: head (2,6), body (3,6), tail (3,5)  so positions [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]? After move, head at (2,6), the segment that was at (3,6) is now at (3,6) but moved to where head was? From above: head to (2,6), S1 (which was at (3,5)? No.\n\nList positions before move: index 0: (3,6), index 1: (3,5)\n\nAfter move head to (2,6):\n\n- New head: (2,6)\n\n- S1 (index 1) moves to old position of S0, which is (3,6)\n\n- Since food eaten, new segment added at old position of S1, which was (3,5)\n\nSo segments: [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ]\n\nYes, length 3.\n\nSimilarly, if move R to (4,6): eat food at (4,6), snake becomes [ (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) ]\n\nIf move D to (3,5): no food, head moves to (3,5), S1 moves to (3,6), so snake [ (3,5), (3,6) ], length 2, no growth.\n\nNow, (3,5) was tail, but after move, head at (3,5), body at (3,6).\n\nAnd no food eaten.\n\nBut in this case, moving D is safe but no gain.\n\nNow, back to turn 2 decision.\n\nAlso, I have to think about other food and future moves.\n\nAnother option at turn 2: move R to (4,5)\n\nAt turn 2: move R to (4,5), eat food, snake now: head at (4,5), tail at (3,5), so [(4,5), (3,5)], length 2, direction R (since moved right).\n\nAt turn 3, head at (4,5), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, R (not L, reverse).\n\n- U to (4,6): food there, eat it\n\n- D to (4,4): but (4,4) is an internal obstacle! (4,4) is in obstacles list.\n\nObstacles: (4,4) is listed, so cannot move there, collision.\n\n- R to (5,5): no food, but let's see if free. (5,5) not obstacle, not wall.\n\n- L: not possible, reverse.\n\nSo options:\n\n- U to (4,6): eat food\n\n- R to (5,5): no food\n\nU to (4,6) has food.\n\nIf move U, eat, snake grows.\n\nSimilarly, move L at turn 2: to (2,5), no food, snake moves to (2,5), length 1.\n\nThen at turn 3, head at (2,5), direction L (since moved left).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L (not R, reverse).\n\n- U to (2,6): food there\n\n- D to (2,4): but (2,4) is obstacle! (2,4) in list.\n\n- L to (1,5): (1,5) is obstacle! (1,5) in list.\n\nSo only possible move: U to (2,6), which has food.\n\nIf move U to (2,6), eat food, snake grows to length 2: head at (2,6), tail at (2,5)? Before move, head at (2,5), no body.\n\nAfter move to (2,6) with food, head to (2,6), tail at (2,5), so [(2,6), (2,5)]\n\nThen direction U.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat food, but also avoid dead ends.\n\nLet's think long-term.\n\nThe grid has obstacles, so I need to navigate carefully.\n\nList all free cells.\n\nGrid 8x8, borders walls, so cells (1,1) to (6,6) are inner? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so accessible cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No.\n\nWalls: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so snake can only be on x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Let's see: head at (3,5), y=5, which is not 0 or 7, so y from 1 to 6 are safe? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to 6 are accessible, similarly x=1 to 6.\n\nx=0 and x=7 walls, y=0 and y=7 walls.\n\nSo cells with x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are playable, except internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)\n\nSo let's list all obstacles:\n\n- (5,6)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (3,2)\n\nAnd borders.\n\nFood at: (4,5), (3,6), (2,6), (4,6)\n\nAll at y=5 or 6.\n\n(4,5) at x=4,y=5; (3,6) x=3,y=6; (2,6) x=2,y=6; (4,6) x=4,y=6.\n\ny=6 is top, since y=7 wall.\n\nNow, back to turn 2 decisions.\n\nI need to plan 5 turns, so from turn 2 to turn 7 or so.\n\nAlso, life span: all food has life span 8 or 9, current turn 2, so they disappear at turn 10 or 11, far away, so no issue for now.\n\nBut I should eat them before they expire.\n\nNow, let's evaluate options.\n\nFirst, if I move U at turn 2 to (3,6): eat food, snake now [(3,6), (3,5)] dir U.\n\nThen turn 3: from (3,6), I can move L to (2,6) or R to (4,6) or D to (3,5).\n\nIf move L to (2,6): eat food, snake becomes [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] dir L.\n\nThen turn 4: head at (2,6), dir L (since moved left).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L (not R reverse).\n\nU to (2,7): but y=7 wall, die.\n\nD to (2,5): no obstacle? (2,5) not obstacle, and not wall. y=5>0, x=2 between 1-6.\n\nL to (1,6): (1,6) not obstacle? Obstacles include (1,5), but (1,6) is not listed, so should be free.\n\nBut (1,6) is x=1,y=6, which is not border wall, since x=1 not 0 or 7, y=6 not 0 or 7. Borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are free except obstacles.\n\n(1,6) not in obstacles, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) is obstacle, so cannot go there.\n\nFrom (2,6), move D to (2,5): free, no food.\n\nMove L to (1,6): free, no food.\n\nBut U to (2,7) wall, invalid.\n\nSo at turn 4, after moving L at turn 3, head at (2,6) dir L, options:\n\n- D to (2,5)\n\n- L to (1,6)\n\nIf move D to (2,5): no food, snake moves: head to (2,5), body segments move: the segment that was at (2,6) moves to where head was? Current snake before move: [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nAfter move head to (2,5):\n\n- Head to (2,5)\n\n- Then S1 (at (3,6)) moves to old head position (2,6)\n\n- S2 (at (3,5)) moves to old S1 position (3,6)\n\nSo snake now: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6)] since no food, length 3.\n\nThen direction D.\n\nSimilarly, if move L to (1,6): head to (1,6), no food, so S1 to (2,6), S2 to (3,6), snake [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6)]\n\nDir L.\n\nNow, from here, the snake is at top-left, and there are obstacles below, like (1,5) obstacle, so moving down from (1,6) to (1,5) is blocked.\n\nBut let's not get too deep yet.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 3, instead of moving L, I could move R to (4,6) from (3,6).\n\nIf at turn 3 move R to (4,6): eat food at (4,6), snake becomes: head to (4,6), S1 (was at (3,6)) moves to (3,6)? Before move: head (3,6), S1 (3,5)\n\nMove head to (4,6) with food.\n\nNew head: (4,6)\n\nS1 moves to old head position (3,6)\n\nNew segment added at old S1 position (3,5)\n\nSo snake: [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5)] length 3, dir R.\n\nThen turn 4, head at (4,6), dir R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, R (not L).\n\nU to (4,7) wall, die.\n\nD to (4,5): (4,5) has food? Food at (4,5) was there, but not eaten yet? At turn 2, I didn't eat (4,5) because I moved U instead of R.\n\nIn this branch, at turn 2 I moved U to (3,6), so (4,5) still there with life span decreasing.\n\nLife span: all food life span given at turn 2, so (4,5) life span 8, so at turn 2, it has 8 turns left, including turn 2? \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn 2, food has life_span, say for (4,5) life_span=8, so it will disappear after turn 2 + 8 - 1? Let's see.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at the turn it is spawned, countdown is N, decreases each turn.\n\nWhen countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the turn or after?\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" – after N turns from now.\n\nFor example, at turn t, food with life_span L, it will disappear after L turns, so it is present for turns t to t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n\nCountdown starts at L, decreases by 1 each turn, when 0, disappears.\n\nAt turn t, countdown = L, after turn t, countdown L-1, and so on, until countdown 0 at turn t+L-1, then after that turn, it disappears, so not available at turn t+L.\n\nStandard: if countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t, countdown = L, after turn t, it becomes L-1, ..., at turn t + k, countdown = L - k.\n\nWhen countdown = 0, after that turn it disappears, so it is available until turn t + L - 1.\n\nFor (4,5) at turn 2, life_span=8, so available from turn 2 to turn 9 (since 2 to 9 is 8 turns: turn 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9; at turn 10 it disappears).\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) life_span=8, turn 2 to 9.\n\n(2,6) life_span=8, turn 2 to 9.\n\n(4,6) life_span=9, turn 2 to 10.\n\nBut in this branch, at turn 2 I ate (3,6), so it's gone.\n\n(4,5) is still there at turn 3.\n\nBack to turn 3, from (3,6), after moving U at turn 2.\n\nIf I move R to (4,6) at turn 3, eat (4,6), snake as above.\n\nThen at turn 4, head at (4,6), dir R, can move D to (4,5) which has food, or R to (5,6).\n\nU to (4,7) wall, invalid.\n\nD to (4,5): has food, eat it.\n\nR to (5,6): but (5,6) is obstacle! (5,6) in internal obstacles list.\n\nSo cannot move R.\n\nOnly D to (4,5) is possible, since (4,5) is free and has food.\n\nMove D to (4,5): head to (4,5), eat food.\n\nCurrent snake before move: [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nMove head to (4,5) with food.\n\nNew head: (4,5)\n\nS1 (at (3,6)) moves to old head position (4,6)\n\nS2 (at (3,5)) moves to old S1 position (3,6)\n\nNew segment added at old S2 position (3,5)\n\nSo snake: [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5)] length 4.\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 5, etc.\n\nBut now the snake is around (4,5), with body at (4,6), (3,6), (3,5).\n\nPossible moves from (4,5) dir D: can move L, R, D (not U reverse).\n\nL to (3,5): but (3,5) is the tail? Current positions: head (4,5), then (4,6), (3,6), (3,5)\n\nSo (3,5) is tail.\n\nMove to (3,5): head to tail position, which is safe because tail moves.\n\nBut let's see later.\n\nI should consider the other initial choice.\n\nAt turn 2, if I move R to (4,5).\n\nTurn 2: move R to (4,5), eat food, snake [(4,5), (3,5)] dir R.\n\nThen turn 3, head at (4,5), dir R, can move U to (4,6) or R to (5,5) (since D to (4,4) obstacle).\n\nU to (4,6): eat food there.\n\nR to (5,5): no food.\n\nIf move U to (4,6), eat, snake: head to (4,6), S1 moves to (4,5), new segment at (3,5), so [(4,6), (4,5), (3,5)] length 3, dir U.\n\nThen turn 4, head at (4,6), dir U, can move L, R, D (not U, but U is up, current dir U, so not D? Current direction U, so cannot move D, reverse.\n\nPossible: U to (4,7) wall, invalid.\n\nL to (3,6): food there? (3,6) was food, but not eaten yet.\n\n(3,6) is still there.\n\nL to (3,6): has food, eat.\n\nR to (5,6): obstacle, cannot.\n\nD: not possible, reverse.\n\nSo only L to (3,6) possible.\n\nMove L to (3,6), eat, snake: before move [(4,6), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nMove head to (3,6) with food.\n\nNew head: (3,6)\n\nS1 (at (4,5)) moves to old head (4,6)\n\nS2 (at (3,5)) moves to old S1 (4,5)\n\nNew segment at old S2 (3,5)\n\nSo snake: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5)] length 4.\n\nDir L.\n\nThen similar to before.\n\nIf at turn 3 I moved R to (5,5) instead of U.\n\nFrom turn 3, head at (4,5) dir R, move R to (5,5), no food.\n\nSnake: head to (5,5), S1 moves to (4,5), so [(5,5), (4,5)] length 2, dir R.\n\nThen turn 4, head at (5,5), dir R, can move U, D, R (not L).\n\nU to (5,6): obstacle (5,6), cannot.\n\nD to (5,4): let's see, (5,4) not obstacle? Obstacles: (5,6) is obstacle, (5,1), but (5,4) not listed, so free.\n\nR to (6,5): (6,5) not obstacle, free.\n\nBut (6,3) is obstacle, but (6,5) is different.\n\nSo can move D to (5,4) or R to (6,5).\n\nNo food nearby, so no eating.\n\nBut this might not be good for scoring.\n\nNow, the third option at turn 2: move L to (2,5), no eat, snake at (2,5) length 1, dir L.\n\nThen turn 3, only possible move U to (2,6), eat food, snake [(2,6), (2,5)] dir U.\n\nThen turn 4, head at (2,6), dir U, can move L to (1,6) or D to (2,5) (since U to (2,7) wall, R not possible? Current dir U, so cannot D? Reverse not allowed.\n\nCurrent direction U, so cannot move D (down).\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R.\n\nU to (2,7) wall, invalid.\n\nL to (1,6): free, no food\n\nR to (3,6): but (3,6) has food? (3,6) is food, still there.\n\nR to (3,6): has food.\n\nSo can move L to (1,6) or R to (3,6).\n\nIf move R to (3,6), eat, snake: before move [(2,6), (2,5)]\n\nMove head to (3,6) with food.\n\nNew head: (3,6)\n\nS1 moves to old head (2,6)\n\nNew segment at old S1 (2,5)\n\nSo snake: [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5)] length 3, dir R.\n\nThen turn 5, etc.\n\nBut at (3,6), with body at (2,6), (2,5), and (3,5) was not eaten, but (3,5) is not food, empty.\n\nNow, to compare, all paths seem to allow eating multiple food, but I need to see which one avoids dead ends.\n\nAlso, there is food at (4,5) which might be eaten later.\n\nBut let's think about the area.\n\nNotice that there is an obstacle at (3,2), (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), etc., so the bottom part has many obstacles.\n\ny=4 has obstacles at (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), so only (3,4) and (5,4), (6,4) free? (5,4) not listed, (6,4) not, but (6,3) obstacle.\n\nAlso y=3: (6,3) obstacle, (3,2) obstacle but y=2.\n\nPerhaps the top is safer for now.\n\nBut y=6 is top, and obstacles at (5,6), (1,5), etc.\n\nList free cells around.\n\nSince I need to plan 5 turns, I should simulate a few steps for each choice.\n\nFirst choice: move U at turn 2 to (3,6), eat, snake [(3,6), (3,5)] dir U\n\nThen at turn 3, I have three options: L to (2,6), R to (4,6), or D to (3,5)\n\nIf I move L to (2,6) at turn 3: eat, snake [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] dir L\n\nThen turn 4, from (2,6) dir L, can move D to (2,5) or L to (1,6)\n\nIf move D to (2,5): no food, snake moves to [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6)] dir D\n\nThen turn 5, head at (2,5) dir D, can move L, R, D (not U reverse)\n\nL to (1,5): obstacle, cannot\n\nR to (3,5): (3,5) is not food, and not occupied? Current positions: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), so (3,5) is free.\n\nMove to (3,5): no food, so head to (3,5), S1 to (2,5), S2 to (2,6), snake [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6)] dir L? Moved to (3,5) from (2,5), so direction R? From (2,5) to (3,5) is right, so dir R.\n\nThen turn 6, head at (3,5) dir R, can move U, D, R (not L)\n\nU to (3,6): but (3,6) is occupied by body? Current positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,6), so (3,6) is free? (2,6) is at y=6, x=2, (3,6) is different cell.\n\n(3,6) was food but eaten earlier, now free.\n\nMove U to (3,6): free, no food.\n\nD to (3,4): but (3,4) not obstacle, free.\n\nR to (4,5): has food, if still there.\n\n(4,5) food life span 8, at turn 6, countdown from turn 2: at turn 2 countdown 8, turn 3:7, turn4:6, turn5:5, turn6:4, so still there.\n\nSo can eat at (4,5).\n\nBut let's not go too far.\n\nFrom turn 4, if at (2,6) I moved L to (1,6) instead.\n\nTurn 4: move L to (1,6), no food, snake [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6)] dir L\n\nThen turn 5, head at (1,6) dir L, can move U, D, L (not R)\n\nU to (1,7) wall, invalid\n\nD to (1,5): obstacle, cannot\n\nL to (0,6): x=0 wall, invalid\n\nAll moves invalid? U wall, D obstacle, L wall, R reverse not allowed.\n\nDead end! Snake dies.\n\nIf at turn 4 from (2,6) I move L to (1,6), I have no valid moves at turn 5, so collision or no move, die.\n\nTherefore, this path is bad.\n\nAt turn 4, from (2,6), moving L to (1,6) leads to death at turn 5.\n\nInstead, moving D to (2,5) is better, as above.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 3, if from (3,6) I move R to (4,6) instead of L.\n\nTurn 3: move R to (4,6), eat, snake [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5)] dir R\n\nThen turn 4, head at (4,6) dir R, can only move D to (4,5) as U and R invalid.\n\nMove D to (4,5), eat food, snake [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5)] length 4, dir D\n\nThen turn 5, head at (4,5) dir D, can move L, R, D (not U)\n\nL to (3,5): (3,5) is tail? Current positions: head (4,5), then (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) so (3,5) is tail.\n\nMove to (3,5): head to tail position, safe, no food, so head to (3,5), S1 to (4,5), S2 to (4,6), S3 to (3,6), snake [(3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6)] dir L? From (4,5) to (3,5) is left, dir L.\n\nThen turn 6, head at (3,5) dir L, can move U, D, L (not R)\n\nU to (3,6): but (3,6) is occupied by body? Current positions: (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6) so (3,6) is the last segment, but when moving, head to (3,6), which is the position of the tail.\n\nAfter move: head to (3,6), then S1 moves to old head (3,5), S2 to old S1 (4,5), S3 to old S2 (4,6), so snake [(3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)] dir U? Moved up from (3,5) to (3,6), but (3,5) to (3,6) is up, so dir U.\n\nBut (3,6) has no food now.\n\nD to (3,4): free, no obstacle.\n\nL to (2,5): free, no food.\n\nEtc.\n\nNow, back to turn 2, if I move R to (4,5) first.\n\nTurn 2: move R to (4,5), eat, snake [(4,5), (3,5)] dir R\n\nTurn 3: move U to (4,6), eat, snake [(4,6), (4,5), (3,5)] dir U\n\nThen turn 4: from (4,6), only move L to (3,6), eat, snake [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5)] dir L\n\nThen similar to above.\n\nIf at turn 3 I moved R to (5,5) instead, no eat, then at (5,5), with few options.\n\nBut (5,6) obstacle, so from (5,5) dir R, can move D to (5,4) or R to (6,5).\n\nSay move D to (5,4), no food, snake [(5,4), (5,5)] dir D\n\nThen turn 5, head at (5,4) dir D, can move L, R, D (not U)\n\nL to (4,4): obstacle, cannot\n\nR to (6,4): (6,4) not obstacle, free\n\nD to (5,3): not obstacle, free\n\nBut no food, and area has obstacles.\n\nNot good for scoring.\n\nSimilarly, the move L at turn 2 leads to eating at (2,6) later, but with risk of dead end if not careful.\n\nBut in the first path, when I moved U then L, I could have moved D at turn 4 to avoid (1,6).\n\nTo maximize score, I should eat the food quickly since they are close.\n\nAt turn 2, moving U to (3,6) or R to (4,5) both allow eating two food in two turns.\n\nIf move U at turn 2, eat (3,6), then at turn 3 I can eat (2,6) or (4,6).\n\nSimilarly, if move R at turn 2, eat (4,5), then at turn 3 eat (4,6) or other.\n\nBut (3,6) is only adjacent if I am at (3,6) or (4,6), etc.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (4,5) is at y=5, which is closer to the obstacles below.\n\nBut since life span is long, it can be eaten later.\n\nBut to think 5 turns, I should choose a path that keeps options open.\n\nNotice that there is an obstacle at (1,5) and (2,4), so the left side is blocked.\n\nSimilarly, right has (5,6) and (6,3).\n\nThe center is relatively open.\n\nAt turn 2, moving U to (3,6) seems good because I eat immediately, and then I can go left or right.\n\nBut if I go left, I might get stuck if I go to (1,6).\n\nBut I can avoid that by going down later.\n\nSimilarly, moving R to (4,5) then U to (4,6) is also good.\n\nBut let's see the initial move.\n\nPerhaps I should consider not eating immediately to have more flexibility, but with length 1, no risk, so eating is good.\n\nAt turn 2, moving L to (2,5) doesn't eat, but then I have to move U to (2,6) at turn 3 to eat, so I eat at turn 3 instead of turn 2, so I get the same food but one turn later, and I have a body now.\n\nIn terms of score, eating at turn 2 or 3 is similar, but with delay.\n\nBut since all food is +1, eating sooner is better for score, but not critical.\n\nFor survival, with body, I have collision risk.\n\nFor example, if I move L at turn 2 to (2,5), no eat, then at turn 3 move U to (2,6), eat, now snake [(2,6), (2,5)] dir U.\n\nThen at turn 4, I can move R to (3,6) to eat the food there.\n\nIf I move R to (3,6), from (2,6) to (3,6) is right, so dir R.\n\nEat food at (3,6), snake: before move [(2,6), (2,5)]\n\nMove head to (3,6) with food.\n\nNew head: (3,6)\n\nS1 moves to old head (2,6)\n\nNew segment at old S1 (2,5)\n\nSo [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5)] length 3, dir R.\n\nThen turn 5, head at (3,6) dir R, can move U, D, R (not L)\n\nU to (3,7) wall, invalid\n\nD to (3,5): free, no food\n\nR to (4,6): but (4,6) has food? (4,6) is food, still there.\n\nR to (4,6): eat, snake: before move [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5)]\n\nMove head to (4,6) with food.\n\nNew head: (4,6)\n\nS1 moves to old head (3,6)\n\nS2 moves to old S1 (2,6)\n\nNew segment at old S2 (2,5)\n\nSo [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)] length 4.\n\nDir R.\n\nThen similar.\n\nBut at (4,6), with body, and below obstacles.\n\nNow, comparing to moving U first at turn 2.\n\nIn both cases, I can eat multiple food.\n\nBut let's count how many I can eat in 5 turns.\n\nFrom turn 2 to turn 6, for example.\n\nIf move U at turn 2: eat (3,6) at t2\n\nThen at t3, move L to (2,6): eat (2,6) at t3\n\nThen at t4, move D to (2,5): no eat\n\nThen at t5, move R to (3,5): no eat\n\nThen at t6, move R to (4,5) or U to (3,6) but (3,6) eaten, so to (4,5) eat if possible.\n\nAt t6, from (3,5), can move to (4,5) eat.\n\nSo eaten at t2, t3, t6: three food.\n\nIf at t4 from (2,6) I move L to (1,6), I die at t5, so only two food.\n\nWorse.\n\nIf at t3 I move R to (4,6) instead: eat (4,6) at t3\n\nThen t4 move D to (4,5): eat (4,5) at t4\n\nThen t5 from (4,5) dir D, can move to (3,5) or other, no eat.\n\nSo eaten at t2, t3, t4: three food.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R first at t2: eat (4,5) at t2\n\nThen t3 move U to (4,6): eat (4,6) at t3\n\nThen t4 move L to (3,6): eat (3,6) at t4\n\nThen t5 from (3,6) can move D to (3,5) or other, no eat.\n\nEaten t2, t3, t4: three food.\n\nSame as above.\n\nIf I move L at t2: no eat at t2\n\nt3 move U to (2,6): eat (2,6) at t3\n\nt4 move R to (3,6): eat (3,6) at t4\n\nt5 from (3,6) move R to (4,6): eat (4,6) at t5\n\nThen eaten at t3, t4, t5: three food, but later.\n\nAlso, at t2 I didn't eat, so score less by one at that point, but by t5 I have three, same as others.\n\nBut in this case, at t2 no eat, so length 1, then at t3 eat, length 2, etc.\n\nWhereas in other cases, I have length 2 or 3 earlier.\n\nBut score is the number of food eaten, so by turn 6, all have eaten three food if possible.\n\nNow, the food at (4,5) might be eaten in some paths.\n\nBut in the move U first path, when I eat at (4,5) at t6, it might be close to expiration, but life span 8, at t6 countdown 8-4=4, still ok.\n\nBut to prioritize long-term survival, I need to avoid areas with dead ends.\n\nFor example, the top-left corner (1,6) is dangerous because only one exit.\n\nSimilarly, bottom has many obstacles.\n\nSo perhaps staying central is better.\n\nAt turn 2, moving U or R are both fine.\n\nBut moving U to (3,6) might be better because (3,6) is at top, and I can then go to (2,6) or (4,6), both with food.\n\nWhereas moving R to (4,5) is at y=5, which is closer to obstacles like (4,4).\n\nBut (4,4) is obstacle, but I can go up.\n\nAlso, there is no negative food, so no penalty.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger, but with short snake, not issue.\n\nSo I think moving U at turn 2 is a good start.\n\nThen at turn 3, I can choose to go left or right.\n\nSince (2,6) and (4,6) both food, but if I go left, I need to be careful not to go to (1,6).\n\nBut I can go to (2,6) then down to (2,5), then right.\n\nSimilarly, if go right to (4,6), then down to (4,5).\n\nBut (4,5) is food, so eating it.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe format is to output from turn t1 to some turns, at least 5 turns ahead? \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but not specified how many.\n\nProbably I need to output for the current turn and a few future turns.\n\nSince it's a sequence, I should output for turn 2,3,4,5,6 or so.\n\nBut the snake might die or something.\n\nPrioritize survival.\n\nLet's decide on a safe sequence.\n\nStart with move U at turn 2 to (3,6), eat food.\n\nThen at turn 3, move L to (2,6), eat food. (since (2,6) is food)\n\nThen at turn 4, from (2,6), move D to (2,5), no food, but to avoid going left.\n\nThen at turn 5, from (2,5), move R to (3,5), no food.\n\nThen at turn 6, from (3,5), move R to (4,5), eat food.\n\nAll these moves are valid.\n\nIf at turn 3 I move R to (4,6), then turn 4 move D to (4,5), eat, then turn 5 from (4,5) move to (3,5) or other.\n\nBut in the first sequence, I eat three food by turn 6.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in the sequence above, at turn 4, moving D to (2,5) from (2,6), direction was L at turn 3, so from (2,6) dir L, moving D is not reverse? Reverse would be U, but U is up, D is down, not opposite to L (left).\n\nCurrent direction is L, moving D is perpendicular, so allowed.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nTo have more options, I could not eat at turn 3 and move down, but that might not be better.\n\nFor example, at turn 3 from (3,6), move D to (3,5), no eat, then snake [(3,5), (3,6)] dir D.\n\nThen turn 4 from (3,5) dir D, can move L to (2,5), R to (4,5), or D to (3,4).\n\nIf move R to (4,5), eat food, etc.\n\nBut I miss eating (2,6) or (4,6), which might expire, but life span long.\n\nBut (2,6) and (4,6) are at y=6, and if I don't eat them, they disappear later, but I can eat them if I go back, but with body, it might be risky.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) to (4,5) eat, then to (4,6) but (4,6) might be eaten or not.\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nSo better to eat the available food.\n\nTherefore, I think moving U at turn 2, then L at turn 3 to eat (2,6), then D at turn 4 to (2,5), then R at turn 5 to (3,5), then R at turn 6 to (4,5) to eat.\n\nAt turn 5, from (2,5) to (3,5) is right, so dir R.\n\nThen turn 6 from (3,5) to (4,5) right, eat.\n\nIn this, I eat at t2, t3, t6.\n\nAt t4 and t5 no eat.\n\nIf I go to (4,6) first, I can eat at t2, t3, t4.\n\nFor example: t2 U to (3,6) eat\n\nt3 R to (4,6) eat\n\nt4 D to (4,5) eat\n\nt5 from (4,5) move to (3,5) or (5,5), etc.\n\nEat at t2,t3,t4.\n\nBetter to eat earlier.\n\nThen at t5, from (4,5) dir D (since moved down), can move L to (3,5), R to (5,5), or D to (4,4) but (4,4) obstacle, cannot.\n\nMove L to (3,5): no food, safe.\n\nOr R to (5,5): no food.\n\nSay move L to (3,5).\n\nThen snake moves.\n\nBut in this case, I have eaten three food by t4.\n\nWhereas in the first sequence, I eat at t2,t3,t6.\n\nSo eating at t4 is better than t6 for score accumulation.\n\nSimilarly, in the move R first: t2 R to (4,5) eat, t3 U to (4,6) eat, t4 L to (3,6) eat, same three by t4.\n\nSo I should aim for that.\n\nNow for the sequence, I need to output actions.\n\nAlso, the head direction must be consistent for no reverse.\n\nIn the sequence: start at t2, head dir U.\n\nAction U to (3,6), now dir U.\n\nt3: from (3,6) dir U, move R to (4,6), now dir R.\n\nt4: from (4,6) dir R, move D to (4,5), now dir D.\n\nThen t5: from (4,5) dir D, can move L to (3,5), which is not reverse, perpendicular.\n\nThen t6: from (3,5) if moved there, dir L (since left), then can move U, D, L.\n\nBut I don't need to specify beyond, but for 5 turns, from t2 to t6.\n\nt2, t3, t4, t5, t6: five actions.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo be safe, at t5 I can move to (3,5) or (5,5), but (3,5) is fine.\n\n(3,5) might have been tail, but after move, it's fine.\n\nIn this position, before t5, snake after t4: after eating at (4,5), snake is [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5)] or something, depending on history.\n\nIn this sequence: t2 move U to (3,6): snake [(3,6), (3,5)]\n\nt3 move R to (4,6): eat, snake [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nt4 move D to (4,5): eat, snake [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nAt t5, head at (4,5) dir D, move L to (3,5): (3,5) is the tail.\n\nMove head to (3,5), which is current tail position.\n\nAfter move: head to (3,5), then S1 (at (4,6)) moves to old head (4,5)? Positions before move: head (4,5), S1 (4,6), S2 (3,6), S3 (3,5)\n\nMove head to (3,5)\n\nNew head: (3,5)\n\nS1 moves to old head position (4,5)\n\nS2 moves to old S1 position (4,6)\n\nS3 moves to old S2 position (3,6)\n\nSince no food, no new segment, so snake [(3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6)]\n\nDir L.\n\nThen t6, from (3,5) dir L, can move U to (3,6), but (3,6) is occupied by body? Current positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), (4,6), (3,6) so (3,6) is last segment.\n\nMove U to (3,6): head to (3,6), which is tail position, so after move, head to (3,6), S1 to (3,5), S2 to (4,5), S3 to (4,6), so snake [(3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)] dir U.\n\nSafe.\n\nBut no food.\n\nI could move D to (3,4) or L to (2,5).\n\nBut since no more food nearby, it's fine.\n\nNow for the output, I think the sequence t2 U, t3 R, t4 D, t5 L, t6 U or something.\n\nBut in t6, moving U to (3,6) is possible, but (3,6) was food but eaten, now empty.\n\nSo in the action sequence for 5 turns: t2 to t6.\n\nActions: t2 U, t3 R, t4 D, then for t5, from (4,5) dir D, I can choose to move L to (3,5).\n\nThen t6 from (3,5) dir L, I can move D to (3,4) for example.\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nSince the food at (2,6) is not eaten in this path, but it will expire later, but I can ignore for now.\n\nIn the other choice, if I go left, I eat (2,6).\n\nBut in terms of immediate, eating three food by t4 is good.\n\nNow, to confirm the grid.\n\nAnother point: internal obstacle at (3,2), but far away.\n\nAlso, (1,4), (2,4), (4,4) obstacles, so row y=4 has obstacles, so moving down might be limited.\n\nBut y=5 and y=6 are mostly free except (5,6) and (1,5).\n\n(1,5) obstacle, so (1,4) etc.\n\nBut I think the sequence is fine.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll go with:\n\nTurn 2: U (to eat (3,6))\n\nTurn 3: R (to eat (4,6))\n\nTurn 4: D (to eat (4,5))\n\nThen for turn 5, from (4,5) dir D, move L to (3,5)\n\nFor turn 6, from (3,5) dir L, move D to (3,4) or something, but to be consistent.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions starting from current turn.\n\nIn the format, it should be a sequence of actions for consecutive turns.\n\nSo for example, 5 actions: t2, t3, t4, t5, t6.\n\nActions: U, R, D, L, and then say D for t6.\n\nBut at t6, moving D to (3,4) is fine.\n\nTo avoid potential issues, but it should be ok.\n\nI think this is acceptable.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must plan at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing eating positive food and avoiding collisions with walls, obstacles, or the snake's body. The current state (turn \\(t_1 = 2\\)) shows a snake of length 1 at position (3,5) with direction Up. The grid is 8x8 with border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2). Available positive food (all value +1) is at (4,5) with life span 8, (3,6) with life span 8, (2,6) with life span 8, and (4,6) with life span 9. Since the snake has no body initially, body collision risks are minimal, but eating food will increase length, introducing future collision risks.\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Immediate Food Access**: Food at (3,6) is directly above the head and can be eaten on turn 2 by moving Up, increasing length to 2. This is efficient for scoring and positions the snake near other food.\n- **Avoiding Dead Ends**: The top-left area (e.g., (1,6)) is risky due to obstacles and walls; moving there can lead to a dead end. Similarly, the bottom has multiple obstacles (e.g., at y=4), so staying in the central/top area (y=5-6) is safer initially.\n- **Sequence for Multiple Eats**: By moving Up on turn 2 to eat (3,6), then Right on turn 3 to eat (4,6), then Down on turn 4 to eat (4,5), the snake eats three food items by turn 4, maximizing early score. This path avoids obstacles and minimizes risk.\n- **Future Moves (Turns 5-6)**: After eating (4,5) on turn 4, the snake has a body, so moves must avoid self-collision. On turn 5, moving Left to (3,5) is safe as it targets the tail cell (which moves away). On turn 6, moving Down to (3,4) keeps the snake away from walls and obstacles, maintaining flexibility.\n- **Life Span Management**: All food has sufficient life span (disappearing at turns 9-11), so no urgency to eat (2,6) immediately. It can be targeted later if possible, but the chosen path focuses on accessible food.\n- **No Reverse Constraint**: Direction changes respect the \"no instant reverse\" rule (e.g., after moving Up, Down is forbidden; after moving Down, Up is forbidden).\n- **Collision Checks**: All moves are validated against walls, obstacles, and body positions at each step. For example:\n  - Moving to (3,5) on turn 5 is safe as it is the tail cell, and the tail moves.\n  - (3,4) on turn 6 is free and not near immediate threats.\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 2 to 6):\n1. **Turn 2 (current turn)**: Move Up (U) to (3,6) to eat the food there. This increases length to 2, with new positions [(3,6), (3,5)] and direction Up. Score: +1.\n2. **Turn 3**: Move Right (R) to (4,6) to eat the food. Snake grows to length 3, positions [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5)], direction Right. Score: +1 (total +2).\n3. **Turn 4**: Move Down (D) to (4,5) to eat the food. Snake grows to length 4, positions [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5)], direction Down. Score: +1 (total +3).\n4. **Turn 5**: Move Left (L) to (3,5). This is safe as (3,5) is the tail position; after moving, the tail shifts. No food eaten, positions [(3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6)], direction Left. Score: unchanged.\n5. **Turn 6**: Move Down (D) to (3,4). This cell is free (no walls, obstacles, or body), and no food. Positions [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)], direction Down. Score: unchanged.\n\n### Why This Plan?\n- **Score Maximized**: Eats three food items by turn 4, with a total score increase of +3 by turn 6.\n- **Survival Focused**: Avoids dead ends (e.g., no move to (1,6)) and high-risk areas. The path keeps the snake in open spaces, with options to navigate toward remaining food (e.g., (2,6)) or safer regions in later turns.\n- **5+ Turn Horizon**: The plan considers turns 2-6 explicitly and implies further strategy: from (3,4), the snake can move to adjacent cells like (2,4) (obstacle, avoid), (4,4) (obstacle, avoid), (3,3), or (3,5) (body, but safe if tail moves). Food at (2,6) can be targeted later if life span permits.\n- **Risk Mitigation**: No body collisions occur (e.g., turn 5 move to tail is valid). Wall and obstacle collisions are checked at each step.\n\nThis sequence ensures efficient scoring while maintaining flexibility for long-term play.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: R\nTurn 4: D\nTurn 5: L\nTurn 6: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 3, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), I assume, with walls on the borders.\n\nInternal obstacles are at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2). I should note these down to avoid them.\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,6), body at (3,5). So the snake is only two segments long right now. Head direction is Up, meaning it was moving upwards last turn.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (4,5) with value 1 and life span 7\n\n- (2,6) with value 1 and life span 7\n\n- (4,6) with value 1 and life span 8\n\nAll food is positive since value is +1. No negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span decreases each turn, including the current one. So for (4,5), life span 7 means it will disappear after 7 more turns? Life span is given as the remaining turns until it disappears. The state says \"life_span\" for each food, and it decreases every turn. So at turn 3, for (4,5), life_span=7, so it will disappear after turn 3 + 7 = turn 10? Let me clarify.\n\nThe input says: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (4, 5, 7, 1)\" so it's (x,y, life_span, value). And life_span is the number of turns it remains, including the current turn. So for (4,5), at turn 3, life_span=7, so it will be there until turn 3 + 6 = turn 9? Since it disappears after N turns, meaning after N turns from now, it's gone.\n\nThe core rules say: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo if life_span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. For example, at turn t, life_span=N, then at turn t+1, life_span=N-1, ..., at turn t+N-1, life_span=1, and at turn t+N, it disappears. So it exists for N turns starting from now.\n\nFor (4,5): at turn 3, life_span=7, so it exists from turn 3 to turn 9 (since turn 3+6=9, and on turn 10 it's gone? Let's think carefully.\n\nIf at turn t, life_span=N, it means that after N turns, it will be gone. So:\n\n- Turn t: life_span = N\n\n- Turn t+1: life_span = N-1\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn t + N-1: life_span = 1\n\n- Turn t + N: life_span = 0, but it disappears, so not present.\n\nIn the state, life_span is given as the current remaining life, so at turn t, if life_span=N, it can be eaten until turn t + N - 1, and on turn t + N, it's gone.\n\nFor (4,5) at turn 3, life_span=7, so it can be eaten from turn 3 to turn 9, and disappears on turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) life_span=7, same as above.\n\n(4,6) life_span=8, so from turn 3 to turn 10, disappears on turn 11.\n\nNow, snake head at (3,6), direction Up. Since it's moving Up, last turn it was at (3,5) or something? Positions are [(3,6), (3,5)], so head is at (3,6), body at (3,5). Since direction is Up, it moved from (3,5) to (3,6) between turn 2 and turn 3, I assume. Turn 3 is current, so positions are at the start of turn 3, before movement.\n\nI need to make a move for turn 3, then turn 4, etc., up to at least 5 turns ahead as per instruction.\n\nThe answer should be actions for multiple turns: turn t1=3, then t1+1=4, t1+2=5, etc.\n\nI should think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so borders are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)\n\nSnake: head (3,6), body (3,5). So the snake is vertical, head up at (3,6), tail down at (3,5).\n\nHead direction Up, so it can move Up, Left, or Right, but not Down because no instant reverse. Since it was moving Up, it cannot move Down next, so possible moves from (3,6) are: Up (to (3,7)), but y=7 is wall, so Up is invalid because (3,7) is border wall.\n\ny=7 is wall, so moving Up to (3,7) is wall collision, deadly.\n\nLeft: to (2,6)\n\nRight: to (4,6)\n\nDown: to (3,5), but (3,5) is currently occupied by the body. However, since it's the tail, and when the snake moves, the tail will also move, so moving to (3,5) might be possible if the tail moves away.\n\nCore rules: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nBut in this case, the tail is at (3,5), and if head moves to (3,5), since the snake is only two segments, after moving, the head would be at (3,5), and the tail would move to where? Let's see how snake movement works.\n\nStandard snake: when the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and each body segment follows, so the tail segment leaves its current position.\n\nSo for a two-segment snake: positions [head, tail]\n\nAfter moving in a direction:\n\n- If head moves to a new cell, say new_head, then the new positions are [new_head, old_head]\n\n- The tail segment (old tail) is removed, so the cell is freed.\n\nIn this case, current: head (3,6), tail (3,5)\n\nIf I move Up, to (3,7), but (3,7) is wall, invalid.\n\nIf I move Left to (2,6), then new head (2,6), and new tail at old head (3,6). So positions become [(2,6), (3,6)]\n\nSimilarly, move Right to (4,6), new positions [(4,6), (3,6)]\n\nMove Down to (3,5): now (3,5) is currently the tail. If I move Down to (3,5), new head would be (3,5), but (3,5) is occupied by tail. However, since the tail will move, after movement, the tail moves to old head? Let's think.\n\nWhen moving, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail is removed from its cell. So if head moves to the tail's current cell, it should be possible because the tail is leaving that cell.\n\nSpecifically: if head moves to tail cell, then after move, the head is now at that cell, and the tail segment is gone, but since we eat food or not, the snake grows only if it eats food.\n\nIn this case, moving to (3,5): (3,5) is the tail cell. But is there food there? Currently, food is at (4,5), (2,6), (4,6), not at (3,5), so no food. So if I move Down to (3,5), since no food, the snake does not grow, so after move, head is at (3,5), and the tail was at (3,5) but moves to where? In snake movement, when no food eaten, the tail moves off its position.\n\nStandard: when head moves to a new cell:\n\n- If the cell has food, snake grows: new head at food cell, tail stays, so length increases.\n\n- If no food, snake moves: head to new cell, tail removed, so the cell behind is freed.\n\nBut if head moves to the tail cell, and no food there, then after move, the head is at that cell, and since no growth, the tail is removed, but the tail was at that cell, so effectively, the snake shortens? No.\n\nFor a two-segment snake:\n\nPositions: [A, B] where A head, B tail.\n\nMove head to a new cell C.\n\nIf C is empty, then new positions: [C, A], and B is removed, so now snake is at [C, A], and B cell is free.\n\nIf C has food, then new positions: [C, A, B]? No, when eating food, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows: head moves to C, and the body segments stay, so new segments: [C, A], and B remains, so [C, A, B] if it was two segments before? Let's clarify.\n\nInitial: two segments, positions [P_head, P_tail]\n\nAfter moving to a cell with no food: head moves to new position, say P_new, then the new head is P_new, and the tail is removed, so the new snake has one segment? No, that can't be right.\n\nI think I'm confusing myself.\n\nStandard snake mechanics:\n\n- The snake always moves forward one cell in the chosen direction.\n\n- If the new head cell does not contain food, the snake does not grow; the head moves to the new cell, and the tail is removed (i.e., the last segment is deleted).\n\n- If the new head cell contains food, the snake grows; the head moves to the new cell, the food is eaten, and the tail remains, so the snake gains one segment.\n\nFor a snake with multiple segments, say segments S0 (head), S1, S2, ..., Sk (tail).\n\nAfter move:\n\n- New head position based on direction.\n\n- If no food eaten, new segments: [new_head, S0, S1, ..., S_{k-1}]  // tail S_k is removed\n\n- If food eaten, new segments: [new_head, S0, S1, ..., Sk]  // tail stays, so length increases by one.\n\nIn this case, with two segments: [head, tail] = [ (3,6), (3,5) ]\n\nIf I move to a cell with no food, new segments: [new_head, (3,6)] and the tail (3,5) is removed.\n\nIf I move to a cell with food, new segments: [new_head, (3,6), (3,5)] so three segments.\n\nNow, if I move to the tail cell, which is (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is currently occupied by the tail. But when I move, if I choose to move down to (3,5), that is the tail cell.\n\nNow, is there food at (3,5)? Currently, no food at (3,5), so if I move to (3,5), and no food there, then new head would be at (3,5), and the old head (3,6) becomes the new tail, and the old tail (3,5) is removed. But since I moved to (3,5), which was the tail, and no food, the new positions are [ (3,5), (3,6) ]? Let's see:\n\nAfter moving down to (3,5):\n\n- New head position: (3,5)\n\n- Since no food, the tail is removed. Old tail was at (3,5), but now new head is at (3,5), so the cell (3,5) has the head, and the old head (3,6) becomes the only body segment. So new positions: [ (3,5), (3,6) ]\n\nBut (3,5) was the tail, now it's the head, and (3,6) is the new tail. So effectively, the snake has moved down, and the tail cell is freed, but since we moved to it, it's now head.\n\nNo collision because the tail moved away.\n\nIf there was food at (3,5), then moving to it would eat the food, and new positions [ (3,5), (3,6), (3,5) ]? That would be collision, but let's not worry.\n\nIn this case, no food at (3,5), so moving down to (3,5) is possible, and new snake at [ (3,5), (3,6) ] with head at (3,5).\n\nBut direction would be down.\n\nBack to possible moves from (3,6) at turn 3:\n\n- Up: to (3,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid. Deadly, cannot.\n\n- Down: to (3,5), which is the tail cell. Since no food there, it should be safe. After move, head at (3,5), body at (3,6), direction Down.\n\n- Left: to (2,6), which is empty? Need to check if it's free.\n\n- Right: to (4,6), which has food? (4,6) is a food position.\n\nFood at (4,6), value 1, life span 8.\n\nAlso, (2,6) is food? (2,6) is also food position.\n\nFood: (4,5), (2,6), (4,6)\n\n(2,6) is food with value 1, life span 7.\n\n(4,6) is food with value 1, life span 8.\n\n(4,5) is food, but not adjacent directly.\n\nFrom (3,6), possible moves:\n\n- Left to (2,6): (2,6) has food? Yes, (2,6) is a food cell.\n\n- Right to (4,6): (4,6) has food.\n\n- Down to (3,5): no food, but safe.\n\nUp is invalid.\n\nAlso, need to check if (2,6) or (4,6) are accessible, not walls or obstacles.\n\n(2,6): x=2, y=6. Is it wall? Borders: x=0 and x=7 walls, y=0 and y=7 walls, so (2,6) is within, not border wall.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)\n\n(2,6) not in obstacles, so free except for the food.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6): not border, internal obstacles include (5,6) but not (4,6), so (4,6) is free with food.\n\n(3,5): no food, and not wall or obstacle.\n\nNow, if I move left to (2,6), since it has food, I eat it, snake grows to three segments: new head at (2,6), then old head (3,6) becomes body, and tail (3,5) stays, so positions: [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nSimilarly, if move right to (4,6), eat food, new positions: [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nIf move down to (3,5), no food, so new positions: [(3,5), (3,6)] with head at (3,5), direction down.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there's a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, at turn 3, head at (3,6), tail at (3,5). Are they adjacent? Yes, vertically adjacent.\n\nBut the food is not on the tail cell; tail cell is (3,5), and there's no food there. Food is at (4,5), (2,6), (4,6), not at (3,5). So no issue.\n\nThe danger is only if the tail cell itself has food and head is adjacent, then eating it causes collision.\n\nHere, no food on tail, so safe.\n\nNow, I need to choose a move for turn 3.\n\nBut I have to plan for multiple turns.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid y from 0 to 7, x from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 and y=0,7.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)\n\nSnake: head (3,6), body (3,5)\n\nFood: (4,5), (2,6), (4,6)\n\n(2,6) is at left, (4,6) at right, both at y=6, x=2 and x=4.\n\n(4,5) is below at y=5.\n\nSince head at (3,6), I can go left to (2,6) or right to (4,6) to eat food immediately, or down to (3,5) to avoid eating for now.\n\nBut eating food increases length, which might be good for score, but I need to survive long-term.\n\nAlso, with longer snake, it's harder to maneuver, but now it's short.\n\nLife span of food: (2,6) life span 7, so it will disappear after turn 3+6=9? Let's calculate.\n\nAt turn 3, life_span=7 for (2,6), so:\n\n- Turn 3: life_span=7 (present)\n\n- Turn 4: life_span=6\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn 9: life_span=1\n\n- Turn 10: disappears\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) life_span=8, so from turn 3 to turn 10 (since turn 3+7=10, life_span decreases to 0 on turn 10, gone on turn 11?).\n\nAt turn t, life_span=N, it exists until the end of turn t + N - 1.\n\nFor example, at turn t, it can be eaten on turn t if head moves to it.\n\nThen at turn t+1, life_span = N-1, etc.\n\nWhen life_span=1, it can be eaten on that turn, and on the next turn, if life_span was 1, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n\nSo for (2,6): life_span=7 at turn 3, so it can be eaten from turn 3 to turn 9 (since on turn 9, life_span=1, can be eaten; on turn 10, gone).\n\nSimilarly, (4,6): life_span=8 at turn 3, can be eaten turn 3 to turn 10.\n\n(4,5): life_span=7, turn 3 to turn 9.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for turn 3,4,5,etc.\n\nFirst, let's list possible actions for turn 3:\n\n1. Left (L) to (2,6): eat food, grow to length 3, positions [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)], head at (2,6), direction Left (since moved left).\n\n2. Right (R) to (4,6): eat food, grow to length 3, positions [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5)], head at (4,6), direction Right.\n\n3. Down (D) to (3,5): no eat, positions [(3,5), (3,6)], head at (3,5), direction Down.\n\nNow, after each, I need to think future turns.\n\nAlso, the food at (4,5) is at (4,5), which is below (4,6), but not directly adjacent to current head.\n\nAnd (2,6) and (4,6) are adjacent.\n\nIf I eat one of them, snake becomes longer.\n\nBut let's consider risks.\n\nFirst, if I go left to (2,6), then head at (2,6), body at (3,6), tail at (3,5).\n\nFrom (2,6), possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right, but no instant reverse. Direction is Left, so cannot move Right immediately.\n\nCurrent direction after move: since I moved Left, new direction is Left.\n\nSo from (2,6), cannot move Right (opposite to Left).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up to (2,7): but y=7 wall, invalid.\n\n- Down to (2,5)\n\n- Left to (1,6)\n\n- Right: invalid, reverse.\n\n(2,5): is it free? y=5, x=2. Not border, internal obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), (1,5), but (2,5) not listed, so free? Obstacles are (1,4), (2,4), (1,5), so (2,5) is not an obstacle, so free.\n\n(1,6): x=1,y=6, not border, obstacles include (1,4), (1,5), but not (1,6), so free.\n\nFood: (4,5) at (4,5), (2,6) eaten, (4,6) still there.\n\n(4,6) is still there.\n\nSimilarly, if I go right to (4,6), similar situation.\n\nOr if I go down to (3,5), no eat, head at (3,5), body at (3,6).\n\nDirection Down.\n\nFrom (3,5), possible moves: Left, Right, Down, but not Up (reverse).\n\n- Left to (2,5)\n\n- Right to (4,5) — (4,5) has food!\n\n- Down to (3,4)\n\n- Up: invalid.\n\n(3,4): not border, obstacles: (3,2) but not (3,4), so free.\n\n(2,5): free as above.\n\n(4,5): has food.\n\nSo if I go down to (3,5) on turn 3, then on turn 4 I can go right to (4,5) to eat food.\n\nOr other moves.\n\nBut let's think strategically.\n\nThe grid has obstacles, so I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAlso, with internal obstacles, the space might be limited.\n\nLet me list all cells that are walls or obstacles.\n\nBorder walls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)\n\nSo forbidden cells: borders and these points.\n\nNow, snake is at (3,6) and (3,5), so (3,6) and (3,5) are occupied by snake.\n\nFood at (4,5), (2,6), (4,6)\n\n(2,6) and (4,6) are food, so if I don't eat them, they are occupied.\n\nBut when snake moves, cells are freed if not eaten.\n\nFor long-term survival, since all food is positive, eating is good for score, but I need to avoid getting trapped.\n\nAlso, the snake is short now, so eating to grow is fine.\n\nBut let's see the area.\n\nFor example, around (3,6), moving left to (2,6) eats food, then from there, I can go down to (2,5) or left to (1,6).\n\n(1,6) is near top-left.\n\nFrom (1,6), possible moves: down to (1,5), but (1,5) is obstacle! Internal obstacle at (1,5), so cannot go to (1,5).\n\nLeft to (0,6), but x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nRight to (2,6), but that's where I came from, and after moving, body is there, so if I go back, collision.\n\nAfter moving to (2,6), positions [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)], so (3,6) is body, (2,6) head.\n\nFrom (2,6), if I go right to (3,6), but (3,6) is body, so collision, deadly.\n\nSimilarly, up to (2,7) wall.\n\nDown to (2,5): (2,5) is free, as no obstacle.\n\nLeft to (1,6): (1,6) is free, no obstacle.\n\nBut if I go left to (1,6), then from (1,6), what can I do?\n\n(1,6): moves: down to (1,5), but (1,5) obstacle, cannot.\n\nLeft to (0,6) wall.\n\nRight to (2,6), but body there, collision if I go.\n\nUp to (1,7) wall.\n\nSo from (1,6), only possible move is down, but (1,5) is obstacle, so no move! Dead end.\n\nIf I go to (1,6), I die because no valid moves.\n\nTherefore, from (2,6), I cannot go left to (1,6); it's a trap.\n\nSimilarly, only down to (2,5) is possible from (2,6).\n\n(2,5): y=5,x=2.\n\nFrom (2,5), possible moves: up, down, left, right.\n\nBut direction: if I moved down to (2,5), direction down.\n\nThen cannot move up (reverse).\n\nSo:\n\n- Down to (2,4): but (2,4) is internal obstacle! (2,4) is in the list, so wall/obstacle, cannot move there.\n\n- Left to (1,5): (1,5) obstacle, cannot.\n\n- Right to (3,5): but at that time, (3,5) may be occupied or not.\n\nLet's sequence.\n\nAt turn 3, if I move left to (2,6), eat food, snake at [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nTurn 4, from (2,6), I can only move down to (2,5), since other moves invalid or deadly.\n\nMove down to (2,5): (2,5) no food, so no eat, new positions: head at (2,5), then body at (2,6), and tail removed? No.\n\nAfter move to (2,5), no food, so new segments: [ (2,5), (2,6) ] and the tail (3,5) is removed. Old positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), tail (3,5)\n\nMove down to (2,5): new head (2,5), since no food, the tail is removed, so new body is old head (2,6), and (3,6) is removed? Let's see:\n\nWhen moving, the head moves to new cell, if no food, the tail is removed, and segments shift.\n\nSo from positions [S0, S1, S2] = [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] with S0 head.\n\nMove to new position P.\n\nIf no food at P, new positions: [P, S0, S1] but S2 is removed, so [P, S0, S1] for three segments? No.\n\nGeneral: segments [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter move to new cell N:\n\n- If no food, new segments: [N, H, B1, B2, ..., ] but without the last one, so [N, H, B1, ..., B_{k-1}] for k body segments.\n\nFor three segments: [H, B, T]\n\nAfter move to N, no food: new head N, then H becomes body, B becomes tail? The new segments are [N, H] and B is removed? No.\n\nStandard: the snake moves, so the head goes to N, each segment moves to the previous position.\n\nSo after move, positions: [N, H, B] if no growth, but since tail is removed, it should be [N, H] for two segments.\n\nI think I have a confusion.\n\nLet's think of the snake as a list of coordinates.\n\nAt turn 3 after move to (2,6) with eat: positions [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nNow at turn 4, I move from (2,6) to (2,5).\n\nNew head position: (2,5)\n\nSince no food at (2,5), the snake does not grow, so the tail is removed.\n\nThe new positions: the head is now at (2,5), and the body segments are the old head and body except the tail is removed. So from [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ], after moving head to (2,5) no food, the new snake is [ (2,5), (2,6) ] and (3,6) and (3,5) are removed? No.\n\nThe segments: old head (2,6) becomes body, old body (3,6) becomes the new tail? But when no growth, the last segment is removed.\n\nPositions: let's index them.\n\nAt start of turn 4, positions: S0 = (2,6) head, S1 = (3,6) body, S2 = (3,5) tail.\n\nMove head to new cell N = (2,5)\n\nIf no food, new head at N, and the tail S2 is removed, so the new snake has segments: [N, S0, S1] but S1 was body, now it is the new tail, and S2 is gone.\n\nSo new positions: [ (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) ]? But that can't be because (3,6) is still there, but the tail was removed.\n\nI think I'm messing up.\n\nStandard way: when the snake moves to a new cell without eating, the head moves to the new cell, and the tail cell is vacated. So the new positions are the new head followed by all but the last segment of the old positions.\n\nOld segments: [H, B, T]\n\nAfter move to N no food: new segments [N, H, B] but without T, so it's [N, H] for two segments? Let's clarify with coordinates.\n\nOld: H = (2,6), B = (3,6), T = (3,5)\n\nMove to N = (2,5) no food.\n\nNew head: (2,5)\n\nThen the body: the first body segment is the old head (2,6), and the old body (3,6) is not included because the tail is removed, so only two segments: head at (2,5), body at (2,6), and the tail (3,5) is removed, so positions [(2,5), (2,6)]\n\nSimilarly, if there was food, it would be [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6)] or something.\n\nFor three segments, after move no eat, it becomes two segments? That doesn't make sense for growth.\n\nI think I have a fundamental mistake.\n\nIn snake, when you eat food, you grow, so length increases. When you don't eat, length stays the same.\n\nFor a snake of length L, after moving without eating, length is still L, but the head has moved, so the tail has moved from its position.\n\nFor example, initial length 2: positions [H, T]\n\nMove to N no food: new positions [N, H] and T is removed, so still length 2, with new head N, new tail H.\n\nIf move to N with food, new positions [N, H, T] length 3.\n\nSimilarly for longer snakes.\n\nIn this case, after turn 3 move to (2,6) with eat, length 3: positions [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nTurn 4, move down to (2,5) no food (assume no food at (2,5)), then new positions: head at (2,5), then old head (2,6) becomes body, and the tail (3,5) is removed, so new positions [(2,5), (2,6)] and (3,6) is gone? No.\n\nSegments: after move, the new head is at (2,5), the first body segment is at the old head position (2,6), and the second body segment is at the old first body position (3,6), but since no growth, the last segment (tail) is not included, so the new tail is at (3,6).\n\nOld positions: index 0: (2,6), index 1: (3,6), index 2: (3,5)\n\nMove to N=(2,5) no food.\n\nNew positions: new head at N, then for i from 0 to len-2, the position of segment i+1 is old segment i.\n\nSo new segment 0: N = (2,5)\n\nNew segment 1: old segment 0 = (2,6)\n\nNew segment 2: old segment 1 = (3,6)\n\nBut since no growth, we do not include old segment 2, so new segments are only up to new segment 1, but that would be two segments: [(2,5), (2,6)]\n\nAnd the old tail (3,5) is removed.\n\nSimilarly, the old body at (3,6) is not part of the new snake; only the head and the first body are kept, with the head moving and the body becoming the new tail.\n\nFor a snake of length L, after moving without eating, the new snake has the same length, with the head at the new position, and each body segment moving to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nSo for L=3: positions P0, P1, P2\n\nAfter move to N no food: new P0' = N, new P1' = P0, new P2' = P1, and P2 is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [N, P0, P1]\n\nLength still 3? No, P2 is removed, so only [N, P0, P1] but P1 was not the tail; P2 was tail.\n\nIn terms of positions: new head at N, new body at old head position, and new tail at old body position, so for L=3, it becomes length 2 if no eat, but that can't be.\n\nI think I need to look for a reliable source, but since it's a game, let's assume the standard.\n\nIn most snake games, when no food is eaten, the snake moves forward, so the head goes to a new cell, and the tail leaves its cell, so the length remains the same.\n\nFor example, with segments [A, B, C] where A head, C tail.\n\nMove head to D no food: new segments [D, A, B] and C is removed, so new positions [D, A, B], with D head, B tail, length 3? But B was body, now tail, and C gone.\n\nBut the cell C is freed.\n\nIn this case, from [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ], move to (2,5) no food, new positions [ (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) ] and (3,5) is removed.\n\nYes, that makes sense; the snake has moved, length same, head at (2,5), tail at (3,6).\n\nOld tail (3,5) is gone.\n\nSimilarly, if food, new positions [ (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] length 4.\n\nBut in this case, for turn 4, moving to (2,5) no food, so new snake at [ (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) ] with head at (2,5), direction Down.\n\nThen from there, I can move, etc.\n\nBut back to the point.\n\nFrom (2,6), after eating at turn 3, at turn 4, I can only move down to (2,5) because other moves are invalid.\n\nThen at (2,5), head, with body at (2,6) and (3,6)? After move to (2,5), positions [ (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) ]\n\nHead at (2,5), direction Down.\n\nThen from (2,5), possible moves: since direction Down, cannot move Up.\n\n- Down to (2,4): but (2,4) is obstacle, invalid.\n\n- Left to (1,5): (1,5) obstacle, invalid.\n\n- Right to (3,5): (3,5) is now free, since tail moved.\n\n(3,5) was tail at turn 3, but after turn 4 move, it's free.\n\nSo (3,5) is free cell.\n\nMove right to (3,5): no food, so new positions: head to (3,5), then body at (2,5), tail at (2,6), so [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) ] and (3,6) removed? After move to (3,5) no food, new positions [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) ] with head (3,5), tail (2,6).\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,4) or (4,5) etc.\n\nBut at (2,5), moving right to (3,5) is possible.\n\nBut from (2,5), only right is possible, since down and left are obstacles, up is reverse and invalid.\n\nSo from (2,5), I must move right to (3,5).\n\nThen at (3,5), head, with body at (2,5) and (2,6)? Positions [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) ]\n\nHead at (3,5), direction Right (since moved right from (2,5)).\n\nThen from (3,5), possible moves: not Left (reverse), so Up, Down, Right.\n\n- Up to (3,6): but (3,6) may be occupied? At this point, (3,6) is free, since it was left when snake moved.\n\nAfter move to (3,5), the body is at (2,5) and (2,6), so (3,6) is free.\n\nMove up to (3,6): no food, new positions [ (3,6), (3,5), (2,5) ] etc.\n\nBut (3,6) has no food.\n\n- Down to (3,4)\n\n- Right to (4,5): (4,5) has food.\n\n Etc.\n\nBut this is getting messy, and I see that going left to (2,6) leads to a path where I might be forced into moves, but not necessarily dead end yet.\n\nFrom (2,6), if I go down to (2,5), then must go right to (3,5), then from (3,5) I can go to (4,5) to eat food or other.\n\nBut let's consider the other options.\n\nIf at turn 3 I move right to (4,6), eat food, positions [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nHead at (4,6), direction Right.\n\nFrom (4,6), possible moves: not Left (reverse), so Up, Down, Right.\n\n- Up to (4,7): y=7 wall, invalid.\n\n- Down to (4,5): (4,5) has food!\n\n- Right to (5,6): but (5,6) is internal obstacle! (5,6) is in the list, so invalid.\n\nSo from (4,6), I can only move down to (4,5), since up and right invalid, and left is reverse.\n\nMove down to (4,5): (4,5) has food, so eat it, grow to length 4? Current length 3, eat food, so grow to 4.\n\nPositions: new head at (4,5), then old head (4,6) becomes body, and the tail (3,5) stays, so new positions [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nHead at (4,5), direction Down.\n\nThen from there, I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nBut let's see if there are risks.\n\nAlso, the food at (4,5) is eaten, so gone.\n\nNow, if at turn 3 I move down to (3,5), no eat, positions [(3,5), (3,6)] head at (3,5), direction Down.\n\nThen at turn 4, from (3,5), I can move right to (4,5) to eat food, or left to (2,5), or down to (3,4), or up to (3,6) but (3,6) is body, so collision if I move up.\n\nDirection is Down, so cannot move Up (reverse).\n\nSo possible:\n\n- Left to (2,5)\n\n- Right to (4,5) eat food\n\n- Down to (3,4)\n\n(2,5) and (3,4) no food, (4,5) has food.\n\nIf I move right to (4,5), eat, grow to length 3: positions [(4,5), (3,5), (3,6)]\n\nHead at (4,5), direction Right.\n\nThen from there, I can move, etc.\n\nNow, to maximize score and survival, eating food is good, but I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAlso, the food at (2,6) and (4,6) have limited life, but I can eat them later if possible.\n\nFor example, (2,6) can be eaten until turn 9, (4,6) until turn 10.\n\nSince the snake is short, I can afford to eat now.\n\nBut let's consider the map with obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)\n\n(3,2) is obstacle, so at y=2, x=3 blocked.\n\nAlso, (4,4) and (2,4) blocked, so row y=4 has obstacles at x=1,2,4.\n\ny=4, x=1,2,4 obstacles, so at y=4, only x=3,5,6,7 but x=7 wall, x=5,6 possible but (5,6) obstacle at y=6, not y=4.\n\nAt y=4, cells: x=0 wall, x=1 obstacle, x=2 obstacle, x=3 free, x=4 obstacle, x=5 free, x=6 free, x=7 wall.\n\nSo (3,4), (5,4), (6,4) free.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nTo plan ahead, I should avoid going towards dead ends.\n\nFor example, the left side: at (2,6), if I go there, I can only go down to (2,5), then right to (3,5), etc., but (2,4) is obstacle, so from (2,5) I cannot go down, only right or left, but left to (1,5) obstacle, so only right to (3,5).\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) is a dead end as I thought earlier.\n\nOn the right, (4,6) has food, but (5,6) is obstacle, so from (4,6) I can only go down to (4,5).\n\nThen from (4,5), after eating, I can go to other places.\n\nBut let's compare the choices for turn 3.\n\nOption 1: Move Left to (2,6) at turn 3, eat food, length 3, positions [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nThen turn 4, move Down to (2,5) no food, positions [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6)] head (2,5), direction Down.\n\nTurn 5, from (2,5), only possible move Right to (3,5) no food, positions [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6)] head (3,5), direction Right.\n\nThen turn 6, from (3,5), I can move Up to (3,6) but (3,6) is body? Positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), tail (2,6), so (3,6) is free.\n\nMove Up to (3,6): no food, new positions [(3,6), (3,5), (2,5)] head (3,6), direction Up.\n\nOr move Down to (3,4), or Right to (4,5) but (4,5) has food, but may be eaten or not.\n\nAt turn 6, (4,5) food may still be there, life span 7 at turn 3, so at turn 6, life_span=4, still there.\n\nBut let's not go too deep.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move to (4,5) to eat food.\n\nBut in this path, I ate one food at (2,6), and later I can eat (4,5).\n\nOption 2: Move Right to (4,6) at turn 3, eat food, positions [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nTurn 4, move Down to (4,5) eat food (since (4,5) has food), so grow to length 4, positions [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5)] head (4,5), direction Down.\n\nThen I ate two foods quickly.\n\nOption 3: Move Down to (3,5) at turn 3, no eat, positions [(3,5), (3,6)] head (3,5), direction Down.\n\nTurn 4, move Right to (4,5) eat food, grow to length 3, positions [(4,5), (3,5), (3,6)] head (4,5), direction Right.\n\nThen I ate one food later.\n\nIn terms of score, option 2 gets two foods by turn 4, score +2, length 4.\n\nOption 1 gets one food by turn 3, and potentially another later.\n\nOption 3 gets one food by turn 4.\n\nBut for survival, option 2 might be riskier because the snake is longer earlier, but in this case, the grid is not too crowded.\n\nAlso, in option 2, after eating at (4,5), head at (4,5), I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nFrom (4,5), direction Down, but I moved down to (4,5), so direction Down.\n\nThen possible moves: not Up (reverse), so Left, Right, Down.\n\n- Left to (3,5): but (3,5) is body? Positions: after turn 4, positions [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5)] so (3,5) is tail, (3,6) is body, (4,6) body.\n\n(3,5) is occupied, so moving left to (3,5) would be moving to tail cell.\n\nSince no food there (food at (4,5) eaten), moving to (3,5) is possible, but it's the tail.\n\nMove to (3,5): new head at (3,5), and since no food, the tail is removed, so new positions: [ (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) ] and (3,6) removed? Old positions: P0=(4,5), P1=(4,6), P2=(3,6), P3=(3,5)\n\nMove to (3,5): new head (3,5), but (3,5) is currently occupied by tail P3.\n\nSince no food at (3,5), moving to it, new head at (3,5), then the body segments: new P1 = old P0 = (4,5), new P2 = old P1 = (4,6), and old P2 and P3 are removed, so new positions [ (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) ] with head (3,5), tail (4,6).\n\nThen I can move from there.\n\nMove right to (5,5): (5,5) is free? x=5,y=5, not border, obstacles: (5,6), (5,1), not (5,5), so free.\n\nMove down to (4,4): but (4,4) is obstacle, invalid.\n\n Etc.\n\nBut the point is, all options are possible.\n\nHowever, for long-term, I should consider the available space.\n\nNotice that there is food at (4,6) which is not eaten in some options.\n\nIn option 1, when I went left, (4,6) is still there, and I can go to it later.\n\nSimilarly, in option 3, (2,6) and (4,6) are there.\n\nBut (2,6) is at (2,6), which is near the left edge with obstacles below.\n\nPerhaps the right side has more space.\n\nFor example, from (4,5), I can move to (5,5), then to (6,5), etc., but there are obstacles.\n\nObstacles at (6,3), (5,1), but at y=5, (5,5) free, (6,5) free, etc.\n\nAlso, (4,6) is food that can be eaten, but in option 2, I ate it at turn 3.\n\nIn option 2, I ate (4,6) at turn 3 and (4,5) at turn 4, so both are eaten.\n\nIn option 1, I ate (2,6) at turn 3, and (4,5) can be eaten later.\n\nIn option 3, I can eat (4,5) at turn 4, and (2,6) or (4,6) later.\n\n(4,6) has longer life span, until turn 10.\n\nBut to maximize score, eating sooner might be better to free space, but all food is positive.\n\nAnother thing: the \"Tail Reward Danger\" but not applicable now.\n\nAlso, food under body: currently no food under snake.\n\nBut for example, if I move down to (3,5) at turn 3, no eat, then positions [(3,5), (3,6)], so the cell (3,5) is head, (3,6) is tail.\n\nThen at turn 4, if I move right to (4,5) to eat food, etc.\n\nBut let's think 5 turns ahead as instructed.\n\nPerhaps I should choose to move down at turn 3 to avoid eating immediately, so that I can eat both foods later without growing too fast.\n\nBut with length 2, I have more mobility.\n\nFor example, at turn 3, move down to (3,5), positions [(3,5), (3,6)] head down.\n\nThen turn 4, I can move right to (4,5) to eat food, positions [(4,5), (3,5), (3,6)] head at (4,5), direction right.\n\nThen turn 5, from (4,5), I can move up to (4,6) to eat the food there, since (4,6) has food.\n\nMove up to (4,6): (4,6) has food, so eat, grow to length 4, positions [(4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6)]\n\nHead at (4,6), direction Up.\n\nThen I have eaten both (4,5) and (4,6), and (2,6) is still there, I can go left to eat it later.\n\nFrom (4,6), direction Up, but I moved up, so direction Up.\n\nThen possible moves: not Down (reverse), so Left, Right, Up.\n\nUp to (4,7) wall invalid.\n\nRight to (5,6) obstacle invalid.\n\nLeft to (3,6): (3,6) is body, so collision, deadly.\n\nSo from (4,6), after eating, I can only move left to (3,6), but it's occupied, so no valid moves! Dead end.\n\nOh, important! If I go to (4,6) after eating (4,5), and then to (4,6), I am trapped because from (4,6), I can only move left to (3,6) which is body, or other directions invalid.\n\nSo in this path, at turn 5, if I move up to (4,6), I die immediately because no valid moves.\n\nTherefore, in option 3, if I move down at turn 3, then right at turn 4 to (4,5), then at turn 5 I cannot move to (4,6) because it would trap me.\n\nInstead, at turn 5 from (4,5), I can move left to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, or down to (4,4) obstacle, or right to (5,5).\n\nSo move right to (5,5) no food, positions [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] and (3,6) removed, so head at (5,5), etc.\n\nThen I can leave (4,6) for later, but it has food.\n\nBut from (5,5), I can go to (5,6) but (5,6) obstacle, or (6,5), etc.\n\nBut (4,6) food is there, I can circle back.\n\nBut it might be risky.\n\nIn option 2, when I moved right at turn 3 to (4,6), then down to (4,5) at turn 4, I am at (4,5) with direction down, and positions [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nThen from (4,5), I can move left to (3,5) or right to (5,5) or down to (4,4) invalid.\n\nMove left to (3,5): as before, new positions [ (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) ] etc.\n\nOr move right to (5,5) no food, positions [ (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6) ] with head (5,5), tail (3,6).\n\nThen from (5,5), I can move.\n\nBut (4,6) is already eaten in this case.\n\nNow for the left option, in option 1, at turn 3 move left to (2,6), then turn 4 move down to (2,5), turn 5 move right to (3,5), then from (3,5) I can move up to (3,6) or down to (3,4) or right to (4,5) to eat food.\n\nMove to (4,5) eat, grow, etc.\n\nBut (4,6) is still there to eat.\n\nTo avoid the trap at (4,6), I should not eat both (4,5) and (4,6) consecutively if I am at (4,5) with (4,6) above, because then from (4,6) I can't move.\n\nSimilarly, for (2,6), if I eat it, and then go down, I can still move right.\n\nBut in the right side, after eating (4,6) and (4,5), I am at (4,5) and can move left or right.\n\nPerhaps the safest is to move down at turn 3 to (3,5), then at turn 4 move to (4,5) to eat food, but at turn 5, instead of going to (4,6), I go to (5,5) or something.\n\nThen (4,6) can be eaten later from a different approach.\n\nFor example, from (4,5) after eating, head at (4,5), direction right (if I moved right to it).\n\nFrom (4,5), move right to (5,5) no food, positions [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] etc.\n\nThen from (5,5), move up to (5,6) but (5,6) obstacle, or right to (6,5), or down to (5,4), etc.\n\nThen I can come back to (4,6) later.\n\n(4,6) has life span 8, so until turn 10, plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) has life span 7, until turn 9.\n\nSo I can eat them later.\n\nFor turn 3, moving down to (3,5) might be a good choice to keep options open.\n\nThen at turn 4, I can move to (4,5) to eat food or to (2,5) or (3,4).\n\nBut (2,5) is near obstacles, so perhaps better to eat (4,5) or go down.\n\nLet's decide on a plan.\n\nSince the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize survival.\n\nAlso, to maximize score, eating food is good, but with care.\n\nIn the current position, moving to (2,6) or (4,6) both have risks if I follow certain paths, but I can choose not to.\n\nFor example, if I move to (4,6) at turn 3, then at turn 4 I must move down to (4,5), then at turn 5, I can move left to (3,5) or right to (5,5), both possible.\n\nIf I move to (2,6) at turn 3, then turn 4 down to (2,5), turn 5 right to (3,5), then turn 6 I can move to (4,5) to eat or other.\n\nBoth are viable.\n\nBut moving to (4,6) allows me to eat two foods quickly, score +2 by turn 4.\n\nMoving to (2,6) scores +1 by turn 3, and another later.\n\nMoving down scores later.\n\nSince all food is positive, eating sooner is better for score, as I can eat more later.\n\nBut with longer snake, it might be harder, but at length 4, it's still manageable.\n\nThe grid has obstacles, so I need to be careful of enclosed areas.\n\nFor example, the area around (3,6) has obstacles at (3,2), (4,4), etc., but not immediately.\n\nAnother idea: move down at turn 3 to (3,5), then at turn 4 move down to (3,4), then I can go to other areas.\n\nBut (3,4) is free.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go to (4,4) but (4,4) obstacle, or (2,4) obstacle, or (3,3), or (3,5) but body.\n\n Etc.\n\nBut I might miss the food.\n\nPerhaps the best is to eat one food now to grow slightly.\n\nLet's choose to move right at turn 3 to (4,6) to eat food, then turn 4 move down to (4,5) to eat another food, so by turn 4, length 4, score +2.\n\nThen from (4,5), at turn 5, move right to (5,5) no food, positions [ (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6) ] head (5,5), direction Right.\n\nThen turn 6, from (5,5), possible moves: not Left (reverse), so Up, Down, Right.\n\n- Up to (5,6): (5,6) obstacle, invalid.\n\n- Down to (5,4)\n\n- Right to (6,5)\n\n(5,4) and (6,5) free.\n\nSay move down to (5,4) no food, positions [ (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6) ] head (5,4), direction Down.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nAnd (2,6) food is still there, I can go left later to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, I have options.\n\nIf I move left at turn 3, I can do similar things.\n\nBut on the left, with obstacles, it might be tighter.\n\nFor example, after eating at (2,6), and moving to (2,5), (3,5), then I can go to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut (2,4) and (1,4) obstacles, so the bottom-left is blocked.\n\nBut I can go up or right.\n\nAt (3,5), I can move up to (3,6) or down to (3,4), etc.\n\nSo both sides are ok.\n\nBut to start, I'll go with moving right at turn 3 to eat (4,6), then down to (4,5) for turn 4.\n\nThen for turn 5, from (4,5), move right to (5,5).\n\nThen for later turns, I can decide.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5+ turns ahead.\n\nThe answer should be like:\n\nTurn 3: action\n\nTurn 4: action\n\nTurn 5: action\n\netc.\n\nSince the state is turn 3, I need to provide actions for turn 3,4,5,6,7 at least.\n\nBut I have to choose based on the state.\n\nPerhaps I can plan a sequence.\n\nAnother thought: the food at (4,5) and (4,6) are close, so eating them both is efficient.\n\nFor turn 3, move R to (4,6) eat.\n\nTurn 4, move D to (4,5) eat.\n\nThen turn 5, from (4,5), I need to move away, say to (5,5) R.\n\nThen from (5,5), turn 6, I can move D to (5,4) or R to (6,5), etc.\n\nBut let's see the direction.\n\nAfter turn 4, head at (4,5), direction D (down).\n\nTurn 5, move R to (5,5), so direction R.\n\nThen turn 6, from (5,5), direction R, can move U, D, R (not L).\n\nMove D to (5,4): (5,4) free, no food.\n\nOr move R to (6,5): (6,5) free.\n\nSay move D to (5,4).\n\nThen turn 7, from (5,4), direction D, can move L, R, D (not U).\n\nMove L to (4,4) but (4,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\nMove R to (6,4)\n\nMove D to (5,3)\n\n(6,4) and (5,3) free.\n\nObstacles at (6,3), but (6,4) free.\n\nMove to (5,3) or (6,4).\n\nBut I also have (2,6) food to eat, but it's far, life span until turn 9, so I can go left later.\n\nFor now, this sequence works.\n\nIf I move down at turn 3, then turn 4 move R to (4,5) eat, then turn 5 move R to (5,5), similar.\n\nBut I miss eating (4,6) immediately, but I can eat it later from (5,5) or something.\n\nBut from (5,5), I can move to (5,6) but obstacle, so cannot eat (4,6) directly; I need to go back to (4,6), but from (5,5), move left to (4,5) but (4,5) may be occupied.\n\nIt might be messy.\n\nSo better to eat (4,6) now.\n\nSimilarly, for (2,6), I can eat it later if possible.\n\nSo for turn 3, I think move Right to (4,6) to eat food.\n\nThen turn 4, move Down to (4,5) to eat food.\n\nThen turn 5, move Right to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 6, from (5,5), move Down to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 7, from (5,4), I can move Down to (5,3) or Right to (6,4), etc.\n\nBut to complete 5 turns, up to turn 7.\n\nTurn 3,4,5,6,7.\n\nAlso, after turn 5, the snake is at (5,5), with body (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), etc.\n\nPositions after each turn.\n\nTurn 3 action: R to (4,6), eat, positions: [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5)] length 3.\n\nTurn 4 action: D to (4,5), eat, positions: [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5)] length 4.\n\nTurn 5 action: R to (5,5), no food (assume), so no eat, new positions: head to (5,5), then body at (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), and tail (3,5) removed, so [(5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6)] length 4, head (5,5), direction R.\n\nTurn 6 action: from (5,5), move D to (5,4), no food, new positions: head (5,4), then body (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), and (3,6) removed, so [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6)] head (5,4), direction D.\n\nTurn 7 action: from (5,4), move D to (5,3) or R to (6,4), etc. But I need to specify.\n\nSince (6,3) is obstacle, (5,3) might be ok.\n\nBut I don't have to specify beyond, but for the answer, I need to provide a sequence.\n\nThe instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the answer format is to provide actions for multiple turns, but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"...\" I can provide for as many as I can plan.\n\nBut in the box, I should put the actions.\n\nPerhaps for this case, moving right at turn 3 is good.\n\nTo include the left food, but it's risky.\n\nI think I'll go with that.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nTurn 5: R\n\nThen for turn 6, from (5,5), I can move D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 7, from (5,4), say move R to (6,4)\n\nBut (6,4) is free.\n\nThen turn 8, etc.\n\nBut I can stop at turn 7 or so.\n\nSince the food (2,6) is there, I might want to eat it later, but not in this sequence.\n\nBut for now, this is fine.\n\nAnother option: at turn 3 move down to (3,5), then turn 4 move right to (4,5) eat, then turn 5 move up to (4,6) eat, but as before, from (4,6) I am trapped.\n\nSo not good.\n\nMove down at turn 3, turn 4 move down to (3,4), then turn 5 move right to (4,4) but (4,4) obstacle, invalid, so from (3,4) can move to (3,3), (2,4) invalid, (4,4) invalid, so only down to (3,3) or up to (3,5) but body.\n\nDirection from (3,4) would be down if moved down.\n\nSo move down to (3,3) or right to (4,4) invalid, left to (2,4) invalid, up reverse invalid, so only down to (3,3).\n\nThen I am going down, might be away from food.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nTherefore, the best is to eat the food on the right.\n\nSo I think for turn 3, move R to (4,6)\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves for turns 3 to 7, thinking 5+ turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n- **Immediate Actions**: At turn 3, moving right to (4,6) eats the positive food there, increasing the score by +1 and snake length to 3. This is safe and avoids the dead end on the left side (e.g., moving left to (2,6) could lead to a trap near (1,6)).\n- **Subsequent Moves**: On turn 4, moving down to (4,5) eats another positive food, increasing the score by another +1 and length to 4. This is efficient as both foods are close, and the path is open for future movement.\n- **Long-term Survival**: After eating, the snake moves away from the crowded area to avoid potential traps. Moving right to (5,5) on turn 5 and down to (5,4) on turn 6 positions the snake in a more open area (e.g., near (5,4) and (6,4)), with fewer obstacles. This allows flexibility to access remaining food (e.g., (2,6) can be eaten later, as it has a life span until turn 9) or new food spawns.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: The sequence avoids collisions, walls, and obstacles. For example:\n  - Moving up from (4,6) is invalid (wall at y=7), and moving right to (5,6) is invalid (obstacle), so down to (4,5) is the only safe move on turn 4.\n  - The \"Tail Reward Danger\" is not triggered, as no food is under the tail.\n- **Food Life Spans**: (2,6) (life span 7, disappears after turn 9) and (4,6) (life span 8, disappears after turn 10) are prioritized based on proximity; (4,6) is eaten immediately, while (2,6) is left for later consumption when the snake can safely navigate left.\n\n### Action Sequence\n- **Turn 3**: Move right (R) to (4,6) to eat the positive food. New snake positions: [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5)], length 3, score +1.\n- **Turn 4**: Move down (D) to (4,5) to eat the positive food. New snake positions: [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5)], length 4, score +2 total.\n- **Turn 5**: Move right (R) to (5,5). No food eaten. New snake positions: [(5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6)] (tail at (3,6) removed), length 4.\n- **Turn 6**: Move down (D) to (5,4). No food eaten. New snake positions: [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6)] (tail at (3,6) removed), length 4.\n- **Turn 7**: Move right (R) to (6,4). No food eaten. New snake positions: [(6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)] (tail at (4,6) removed), length 4.\n\n### Reasoning for 5+ Turns Ahead\n- **Turn 3-4**: Eating both (4,6) and (4,5) quickly maximizes early score gain with minimal risk, as the snake is short and the area is navigable.\n- **Turn 5-7**: Moving right and down opens space toward the bottom-right (e.g., (6,4) is safe), avoiding obstacles like (5,6) and (6,3). From (6,4), future moves (e.g., down to (6,3) is invalid due to obstacle, so options include left to (5,4), down to (6,3) invalid, right to (7,4) wall invalid, or up to (6,5)) can be planned based on new food or hazards.\n- **Beyond Turn 7**: The snake can head toward (2,6) to eat the remaining food (life span allows until turn 9) by moving left through safe cells like (5,4) → (4,4) invalid (obstacle), so alternative paths (e.g., via (3,4)) can be used. Survival is prioritized; if risks arise, the snake can avoid food to stay alive.\n- **Contingencies**: If new food spawns or life spans deplete, the snake can adapt—e.g., if (2,6) disappears, focus on central areas. The sequence avoids dead ends (e.g., not moving left initially prevents the (1,6) trap).\n\nThis plan scores +2 by turn 4 and positions the snake for sustained growth with a low-risk path.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: R (right)\nTurn 4: D (down)\nTurn 5: R (right)\nTurn 6: D (down)\nTurn 7: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 4, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7).\n\nWalls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, internal obstacles at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2). So I must avoid these cells.\n\nSnake positions: Head at (4,6), then body at (3,6), and tail at (3,5). So the snake has 3 segments. Head direction is right, so it's moving towards increasing x.\n\nFood:\n\n- (4,5) with value 1 and life span 6\n\n- (2,6) with value 1 and life span 6\n\n- (1,1) with value 1 and life span 10\n\nAll food has value +1, so they're all positive food. No negative food here.\n\nLife span: For (4,5), it disappears after 6 turns, including current turn, so it has 6 turns left starting from turn 4. Similarly for others.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns. The answer should be in a boxed format with actions from turn 4 onwards.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls on borders and internal obstacles.\n\nList all obstacles:\n\n- Borders: all cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n\n- Internal: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)\n\nSnake: head (4,6), body (3,6), tail (3,5). Head direction right.\n\nCurrent turn: 4.\n\nFood: (4,5), (2,6), (1,1)\n\n(4,5) is directly below the head? Head is at (4,6), so (4,5) is one cell down, but since head is moving right, it's not adjacent directly.\n\nPossible moves from current position: head at (4,6), moving right.\n\nSince head direction is right, I can move up (U), down (D), or right (R), but not left (L) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: no instant reverse, so from right, I can't go left immediately.\n\nSo available moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's see what each move does.\n\nIf I move right (R): to (5,6). Is (5,6) safe? (5,6) is an internal obstacle! (5,6) is in the list: (5,6) is an obstacle, so I cannot move there. It's a wall.\n\n(5,6) is an internal obstacle, so moving right to (5,6) is impossible. That cell is blocked.\n\nSo R is not possible.\n\nAvailable moves: U and D.\n\nUp (U): to (4,7). But y=7 is a border wall, so (4,7) is a wall cell. Cannot move there.\n\ny=7 is the top border, so (4,7) is out of bounds or wall, so cannot move up.\n\nDown (D): to (4,5). (4,5) is a food position? (4,5) has food, but let's see if I can move there.\n\nFirst, is (4,5) occupied? Snake body: positions are (4,6), (3,6), (3,5). (3,5) is tail, but (4,5) is not occupied by snake. Food is at (4,5), but the snake isn't on it yet.\n\nMoving to (4,5): is it a wall? No, (4,5) is not listed as wall. Borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (4,5) is within bounds. Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), etc., not (4,5), so (4,5) is free, except for the food.\n\nBut when I move to (4,5), I eat the food since head moves onto it.\n\nNow, special case: food under body? Currently, (4,5) is not under snake body; snake is at (4,6), (3,6), (3,5). (3,5) is tail at y=5 x=3, (4,5) is x=4 y=5, so not the same cell. So no issue.\n\nBut after moving, if I go down to (4,5), I eat the food, snake grows to length 4.\n\nBut there's a danger: tail reward danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nHere, tail is at (3,5). After moving head to (4,5), the tail is still at (3,5), but head is now at (4,5), which is adjacent? Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (4,5) and (3,5) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nAfter moving to (4,5), the snake positions would be: head at (4,5), then body segments: the previous head (4,6) becomes body, and (3,6) becomes body, and tail (3,5) remains tail? No.\n\nWhen snake moves, the head moves to new position, and the tail moves forward only if no food eaten. If food eaten, tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n\nCurrent snake: positions [ (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] head to tail.\n\nIf I move down to (4,5), and eat food, then new head is (4,5), and the body becomes [ (4,5) , (4,6) , (3,6) ], and since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so we add a new segment? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, if it eats food, the tail stays, so snake grows by one segment. If no food, tail moves off the last position.\n\nSo here: move to (4,5), which has food, so head moves to (4,5), the previous head (4,6) becomes body, (3,6) becomes body, and (3,5) remains tail? No, since food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the snake becomes [ (4,5) , (4,6) , (3,6) , (3,5) ]? Let's think.\n\nPositions: after move, head is at new position, then the rest of the body follows. So from [head, body1, tail] = [A,B,C]\n\nAfter moving to new head position H, if no food, body becomes [H, A, B] and C is removed. If food, body becomes [H, A, B, C], so C remains and snake grows.\n\nIn this case, from [ (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) ], move to (4,5) with food.\n\nNew head: (4,5)\n\nThen the body: previous head (4,6) becomes segment after head, then (3,6) becomes next, and since food eaten, tail (3,5) is not removed, so new positions: [ (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) ]\n\nSo snake now has segments at (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5)\n\nNow, tail is at (3,5), and head is at (4,5), which are adjacent. But tail has no food; the food was at (4,5), which is now head, so it's eaten.\n\nTail reward danger is when the tail cell has food, and head is adjacent, then eating it causes collision because after eating, the tail doesn't move, so head and new tail position might collide.\n\nIn this case, after eating, tail is at (3,5), which did not have food; the food was at (4,5), not at tail.\n\nSo no issue here.\n\nBut is head adjacent to tail? Head at (4,5), tail at (3,5), they are adjacent, but tail does not have food, so no danger.\n\nTail reward danger only if the tail cell itself has food.\n\nHere, tail is at (3,5), no food there, food was at (4,5).\n\nSo moving to (4,5) should be fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\n(4,5) is not a wall, not occupied by snake body except now head moves there.\n\nBut in the move, I'm moving to it, so it's free.\n\nEarlier I thought U and R are not possible, only D.\n\nU: to (4,7) which is y=7, wall, invalid.\n\nR: to (5,6) which is obstacle, invalid.\n\nL: but left is opposite to current direction right, so instant reverse not allowed. Also, (3,6) is body, so if I go left to (3,6), that would be body collision immediately.\n\nCurrent direction is right, so moving left is reverse, not allowed, and (3,6) is occupied by body, so definitely cannot.\n\nSo only possible move is down to (4,5).\n\nBut is that safe?\n\nAfter moving, snake is at [ (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) ]\n\nNow, for the next turn, I need to think ahead.\n\nBut I have to plan multiple turns.\n\nFirst, on turn 4, I must move down to (4,5), since it's the only choice? Let me double-check.\n\nAvailable cells: from (4,6), neighbors:\n\n- Up: (4,7) y=7, wall, invalid\n\n- Down: (4,5) free, has food\n\n- Left: (3,6) occupied by body, and reverse direction, invalid\n\n- Right: (5,6) obstacle, invalid\n\nSo indeed, only down is possible. I have to move down to (4,5) and eat the food.\n\nSo for turn 4, action must be D.\n\nNow, after that, on turn 5, snake positions: head at (4,5), body at (4,6), (3,6), tail at (3,5). Direction: since I moved down, new head direction is down.\n\nNow, I need to choose action for turn 5 and beyond.\n\nFood still: (2,6) with life span 6, but life span decreases each turn, so on turn 4, it had 6, turn 5 it will have 5 left, and so on. Similarly, (1,1) has life span 10, so plenty.\n\n(4,5) was eaten, so it's gone.\n\nCurrent food after turn 4: (2,6) and (1,1)\n\n(2,6) life span: started at turn 4 with 6, after turn 4, it decreases, so on turn 5, it has 5 turns left? Let's clarify life span.\n\nRule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at turn t with life_span L, it disappears after turn t + L - 1? Or at the end of turn t + L?\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nExample: if life_span is 6 at turn 4, countdown starts at 6, decreases by 1 each turn, including turn 4, so after turn 4, countdown 5, after turn 5, countdown 4, ..., after turn 9, countdown 0, disappears before turn 10? Let's read.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current) | Disappears after N turns\"\n\nI think it means that at the start, countdown is N, and each turn it decreases by 1, when it reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or before next turn.\n\nBut for simplicity, since we plan actions per turn, we can think of the remaining life.\n\nAt turn 4, for (2,6), life_span 6, so it has 6 turns including turn 4, so it will disappear after turn 9 (since 4+5=9?).\n\nTurn 4: countdown 6\n\nAfter turn 4, countdown 5\n\nAfter turn 5, countdown 4\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 9, countdown 0, so it disappears before turn 10, meaning on turn 10 it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) life_span 10 at turn 4, disappears after turn 13.\n\nNow back to turn 5.\n\nAfter turn 4 action D, snake: head (4,5), body (4,6), (3,6), tail (3,5). Direction down.\n\nNow possible moves from (4,5): since direction down, cannot move up (reverse), so can move down, left, or right.\n\nAvailable cells:\n\n- Down (D): to (4,4). But (4,4) is an internal obstacle! (4,4) is in the list: internal obstacles include (4,4), so wall, cannot move there.\n\n- Left (L): to (3,5). (3,5) is currently the tail position. But when I move, the tail will move if no food, but there is no food at (3,5), so if I move to (3,5), since no food, tail moves away.\n\nCurrent positions: head (4,5), body (4,6), body (3,6), tail (3,5)\n\nIf I move left to (3,5), what happens?\n\n(3,5) is currently occupied by the tail. But in snake, moving to the tail cell is allowed because when the head moves there, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nRule: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo yes, moving to tail cell is safe if no food eaten.\n\nHere, (3,5) has no food, so if I move left to (3,5), head moves to (3,5), which was tail, then since no food, the tail moves off, so new positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), body (4,6), and tail was (3,6)? Let's see.\n\nPrevious positions: [H: (4,5), B1: (4,6), B2: (3,6), T: (3,5)]\n\nAfter moving head to (3,5): new head (3,5), then the body: B1 (4,6) becomes next, but the segments shift.\n\nStandard: after move, new head at new position, then the first body segment moves to previous head position, and so on, tail moves off if no food.\n\nSo if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the last segment (tail) is removed from the grid.\n\nSo here: head moves to (3,5), which was tail, so now (3,5) is head.\n\nThen B1: (4,6) should move to previous head position (4,5), but (4,5) is now occupied? No, the positions are updated simultaneously.\n\nTypically, the body segments follow the path.\n\nPrevious positions: head (4,5), then body at (4,6), then (3,6), then tail at (3,5).\n\nAfter head moves to (3,5), the new body starts from where the head was, so segment after head is (4,5), then next is (4,6), and the last segment (3,6) becomes the new tail, since no food, tail is removed? No.\n\nThe tail segment (3,5) is left, and since head moved to it, the new tail is the one before.\n\nAfter moving to a cell:\n\n- The head is now at the new position.\n\n- The segment that was behind the head is now at the head's previous position.\n\n- And so on, down to the tail.\n\n- If no food eaten, the tail segment is removed, meaning the last position is vacated.\n\nIn terms of positions list: from [P0(head), P1, P2, ..., Pk(tail)]\n\nAfter move to new position N:\n\nIf no food, new positions: [N, P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1}]  so Pk is removed.\n\nIf food, new positions: [N, P0, P1, ..., Pk] so length increases.\n\nIn this case, no food at (3,5), so if move to (3,5), new head at (3,5), then previous head (4,5) becomes body, then (4,6) becomes body, and (3,6) becomes tail, and (3,5) was tail but now head, so the position (3,5) is occupied by head, and (3,6) is the new tail.\n\nPositions: new snake: head (3,5), body (4,5), body (4,6), tail (3,6)\n\nYes.\n\nNow, (3,5) had no food, so no issue.\n\nNow, right (R): to (5,5). (5,5) is not wall, not occupied? Let's see.\n\n(5,5): x=5,y=5, not border, not in internal obstacles: internal obstacles are (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2). (5,5) not listed, so free.\n\nBut no food there.\n\nNow, down is not possible, as (4,4) is obstacle.\n\nUp: but up is reverse? Current direction is down (since last move was down), so moving up would be reverse, not allowed.\n\nCurrent head direction is down, so I cannot move up (opposite).\n\nSo possible moves from (4,5) on turn 5: left to (3,5) or right to (5,5).\n\nDown is blocked by obstacle, up is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo actions: L or R.\n\nNow, I need to think about food and long-term.\n\nFood available: (2,6) at (2,6), which is left and up from current head (4,5)? From (4,5), (2,6) is at x=2,y=6.\n\nAlso (1,1) far away.\n\n(2,6) has only 5 turns left after turn 4, so from turn 5, it has 4 turns left? Let's calculate remaining life.\n\nAt turn 4, food (2,6) life_span 6, meaning it will disappear after 6 turns from now, including this turn.\n\nTurn 4: present, life_span 6, so it exists for turns 4,5,6,7,8,9? Countdown: at turn 4, countdown=6, after turn 4, countdown=5, ..., after turn 9, countdown=0, disappears before turn 10. So available until turn 9 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) life_span 10, available until turn 13 inclusive.\n\nNow, head at (4,5), (2,6) at (2,6).\n\nTo reach (2,6) from (4,5), I need to go left to x=2 and up to y=6.\n\ny=6 is the same row as before, but head is at y=5.\n\nFrom (4,5), to (2,6): I can go left to (3,5), then from there to (2,5) or (3,6), etc., but need to go up.\n\n(3,6) is currently part of snake? After turn 4 move, snake has (3,6) as body, but on turn 5, if I move, it might change.\n\nLet's plan.\n\nFirst, on turn 5, I can move L to (3,5) or R to (5,5).\n\nIf I move L to (3,5), as above, new head (3,5), body (4,5), (4,6), tail (3,6). Direction left.\n\nThen from (3,5), possible moves: since direction left, cannot move right (reverse). Can move up, down, left.\n\n- Up (U): to (3,6). But (3,6) is currently tail, and after move, if I go to (3,6), what happens.\n\nAfter moving to (3,5) on turn 5, positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), body (4,6), tail (3,6)\n\nIf I move up to (3,6) on turn 6, (3,6) is tail position. But when I move to it, since it's tail, and if no food, tail moves away.\n\nIs there food at (3,6)? No, food is at (2,6) and (1,1).\n\nSo moving to (3,6) is safe.\n\nNew head (3,6), then body: (3,5), (4,5), and tail (4,6)? Previous positions: head (3,5), B1 (4,5), B2 (4,6), T (3,6)\n\nAfter move to (3,6): new head (3,6), which was tail, so no food, new positions: head (3,6), body (3,5), body (4,5), tail (4,6)\n\nAnd (3,6) had no food.\n\nNow (3,6) is at y=6, x=3.\n\n(2,6) is at (2,6), which is left of (3,6).\n\nFrom (3,6), I can move left to (2,6) to eat the food.\n\n(2,6) has food, value +1.\n\nBut is it safe? Head at (3,6), move left to (2,6).\n\nIf I do that on turn 6, after moving to (3,6) on turn 6? Let's sequence.\n\nTurn 5: move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 6: from (3,5), move U to (3,6)\n\nThen positions: head (3,6), body (3,5), (4,5), tail (4,6)\n\nDirection up (since moved up).\n\nThen turn 7: from (3,6), move left to (2,6) to eat food.\n\n(2,6) is not wall, not occupied? Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,6) not listed, borders y=0,7 x=0,7, so (2,6) is within bounds.\n\nMoving to (2,6): eat food, snake grows.\n\nNew positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), body (3,5), body (4,5), tail (4,6) since food eaten, tail doesn't move.\n\nSnake length 5.\n\nNow, is there tail reward danger? Tail is at (4,6), head at (2,6), not adjacent.\n\nSo safe.\n\nBut we need to think about the path.\n\nAfter eating (2,6), snake at [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) ]\n\nNow, from (2,6), possible moves: direction left (since moved left), so cannot move right. Can move up, down, left.\n\nBut up: (2,7) y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nDown: (2,5) , which is free? Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, (2,5) not listed, so free.\n\nLeft: (1,6) , x=1,y=6, not border, not obstacle? Internal obstacles: (1,4), (1,5), but (1,6) not listed, so free.\n\n(1,5) is obstacle, but (1,6) is different.\n\ny=6, x=1.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,4), (1,5), so (1,6) is free.\n\nAlso, (1,1) has food, but far.\n\nNow, back to turn 5 choice.\n\nIf on turn 5 I move right to (5,5) instead.\n\nFrom head (4,5), move R to (5,5).\n\nNew head (5,5), body (4,5), (4,6), tail (3,6) since no food.\n\nPositions: head (5,5), body (4,5), body (4,6), tail (3,6)\n\nDirection right.\n\nThen from (5,5), possible moves: since direction right, cannot move left. Can move up, down, right.\n\n- Up (U): to (5,6). But (5,6) is internal obstacle! Cannot.\n\n- Down (D): to (5,4). (5,4) not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (5,1), (5,6), but (5,4) free? Internal: (5,1) and (5,6), so (5,4) should be free.\n\n- Right (R): to (6,5). (6,5) not border, not obstacle? Internal: (6,3), but (6,5) not listed, so free.\n\nBut no food nearby except (1,1) far.\n\n(2,6) is at (2,6), which from (5,5) is left and up, but snake is at (5,5), so I need to go back, but with body, it might be tight.\n\nAlso, (2,6) has limited time.\n\nIf I go to (5,5), I might not reach (2,6) in time.\n\nDistance: from (5,5) to (2,6) is |5-2|=3 in x, |5-6|=1 in y, so Manhattan distance 4, but with body, I need to navigate.\n\nBut (2,6) has, from turn 5, 4 turns left? Turn 5: food available until turn 9.\n\nTurn 5,6,7,8,9: 5 turns available.\n\nFrom turn 5, head at (4,5), if I go right to (5,5) on turn 5.\n\nThen on turn 6, from (5,5), I can go down to (5,4) or right to (6,5), say to (5,4).\n\nThen turn 6: move D to (5,4)\n\nPositions: head (5,4), body (5,5), (4,5), tail (4,6)  (since no food, tail (3,6) removed? Previous: head (5,5), B1 (4,5), B2 (4,6), T (3,6)\n\nAfter move to (5,4): new head (5,4), body (5,5), body (4,5), tail (4,6)\n\nThen from (5,4), direction down, can move down, left, right.\n\n- Down (D): (5,3) , free?\n\n- Left (L): (4,4) , but (4,4) is obstacle! Cannot.\n\n- Right (R): (6,4) , free? (6,3) obstacle, (6,4) not, so free.\n\nSay move down to (5,3) on turn 7.\n\nBut (2,6) is at top left, while I'm going down right, so I'm moving away from (2,6), and with only 2-3 turns, I might not reach it.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (2,6): Δx=3, Δy=2, min moves 5, but with obstacles and body, it could take more turns.\n\nFor example, from (5,4), to go to (2,6), I need to go left and up.\n\nBut from (5,4), if I move left to (4,4), but (4,4) obstacle, cannot. So I must move down or right.\n\nIf move down to (5,3), then from (5,3), can move left to (4,3) or down to (5,2), etc., but (2,6) is up, so I'm going further down, harder to reach (2,6) in time.\n\nSimilarly, if move right to (6,4), then (6,4) to (2,6) even farther.\n\nSo probably, if I go right on turn 5, I miss the (2,6) food.\n\nWhereas if I go left on turn 5 to (3,5), then I can reach (2,6) by turn 7 as I thought earlier.\n\nTurn 5: move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 6: move U to (3,6)\n\nTurn 7: move L to (2,6) eat food.\n\nAnd (2,6) is still available, since turn 7 <= turn 9.\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nAfter that, I have (1,1) to consider, but it's far and has more time.\n\nNow, what about the other food (1,1), but I need to survive long term.\n\nAlso, after eating (2,6), snake is at (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)\n\nFrom (2,6), as before, can move down to (2,5) or left to (1,6), or up but up is wall.\n\n(2,7) invalid.\n\nNow, moving down to (2,5): (2,5) is free? Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) not, so should be free.\n\nMove left to (1,6): (1,6) free, as earlier.\n\nBut (1,1) is at bottom left, so I need to go down.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nBut let's see the obstacles around.\n\nFor example, from (2,6), if I move down to (2,5), then head (2,5), body (2,6), (3,6), etc.\n\nThen from (2,5), can move down to (2,4), but (2,4) is obstacle! Cannot.\n\nSo from (2,5), cannot move down.\n\nCan move left to (1,5), but (1,5) is internal obstacle! Cannot.\n\nCan move right to (3,5), but (3,5) is body? After positions, when at (2,5), body at (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), so (3,5) is occupied, cannot move there.\n\nLet's list positions after eating (2,6) on turn 7.\n\nAssume turn 7: head moves to (2,6), eat, positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), body (3,5), body (4,5), tail (4,6)  (since food eaten, tail stays)\n\nAfter move to (2,6) with food: new head (2,6), then body: previous head (3,6), then (3,5), then (4,5), then (4,6) as tail.\n\nSnake: [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) ]\n\nNow, from head (2,6), direction left (since moved left to get there).\n\nCan move: U, D, L (since direction left, cannot move R reverse).\n\nU: (2,7) wall, invalid.\n\nD: (2,5) - is it free? No snake body there, not wall: (2,5) not border, not obstacle (obstacles: (2,4) is, but (2,5) not), so free.\n\nL: (1,6) - free, as earlier.\n\nNow, if move D to (2,5), then new head (2,5), no food, so tail moves: previous tail (4,6) removed, new positions: head (2,5), body (2,6), body (3,6), body (3,5), tail (4,5)\n\nDirection down.\n\nThen from (2,5), can move: since direction down, cannot move up. Can move down, left, right.\n\nBut down to (2,4) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nLeft to (1,5) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nRight to (3,5) - but (3,5) is body segment, occupied, cannot move there.\n\n(3,5) is part of body, so moving to it causes collision.\n\nTherefore, from (2,5), no possible moves! All directions blocked or occupied.\n\n- Down: (2,4) wall\n\n- Left: (1,5) wall\n\n- Right: (3,5) body\n\n- Up: but up is reverse, not allowed, and (2,6) is body, occupied.\n\nSo indeed, if I move down to (2,5) on turn 8, I die immediately on the next turn.\n\nTherefore, I must not move down from (2,6); instead, I should move left to (1,6).\n\nOn turn 8, from (2,6), move L to (1,6).\n\n(1,6) free, no food.\n\nNew head (1,6), no food, so tail (4,6) removed? Positions: previous [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) ]\n\nAfter move to (1,6): new head (1,6), body (2,6), body (3,6), body (3,5), tail (4,5)\n\nDirection left.\n\nNow, from (1,6), can move: direction left, so cannot move right. Can move up, down, left.\n\nU: (1,7) y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD: (1,5) but (1,5) is internal obstacle! Cannot.\n\nL: (0,6) x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nAll directions invalid? Up wall, down obstacle, left wall, right reverse not allowed.\n\nSo also dead end!\n\n(1,6) has no moves.\n\nUp to (1,7) wall, down to (1,5) obstacle, left to (0,6) wall, right to (2,6) which is body and reverse direction.\n\nSo impossible to move from (1,6).\n\nTherefore, going to (1,6) is also dead.\n\nBut earlier moving to (2,5) is dead too.\n\nSo after eating (2,6) at (2,6), I am stuck; I have no safe move from there?\n\nThat can't be right.\n\nLet's see the positions: snake [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) ]\n\nFrom (2,6), the only possible moves were D to (2,5) or L to (1,6), but both lead to dead ends immediately after.\n\n(2,5) and (1,6) are free, but after moving there, the next move is impossible.\n\nFor example, if I move to (2,5), then from (2,5), as above, no moves.\n\nSimilarly for (1,6).\n\nBut is there another way from (2,6)?\n\nI have to move, but both options lead to death on the next turn.\n\nTherefore, eating (2,6) might be dangerous because it leaves me in a position where I have no escape.\n\nPerhaps I should not go for (2,6) at all.\n\nBut on turn 5, if I don't go left, I go right to (5,5), but then I miss the food and might have other issues.\n\nAnother option: on turn 5, from (4,5), instead of moving directly, I could have other plans.\n\nBut only L or R possible.\n\nPerhaps after moving to (3,5) on turn 5, on turn 6, instead of moving up to (3,6), I move down or something.\n\nLet's see.\n\nTurn 5: from (4,5) move L to (3,5), positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), (4,6), tail (3,6)\n\nDirection left.\n\nNow on turn 6, from (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5), or R but R is reverse, not allowed.\n\n- U to (3,6): as before\n\n- D to (3,4): (3,4) free? Obstacles: (3,2) is obstacle, but (3,4) not listed, so free.\n\n- L to (2,5): (2,5) free, as before.\n\nIf I move D to (3,4) on turn 6.\n\nNew head (3,4), no food, so tail moves: previous tail (3,6) removed, new positions: head (3,4), body (3,5), body (4,5), tail (4,6)\n\nDirection down.\n\nThen from (3,4), can move U, D, L, R but direction down, so cannot move U reverse.\n\nCan move D, L, R.\n\n- D to (3,3): free? (3,3) not wall, not obstacle.\n\n- L to (2,4): but (2,4) is obstacle! Cannot.\n\n- R to (4,4): (4,4) obstacle, cannot.\n\nSo only possible move D to (3,3).\n\nThen move D to (3,3), and so on.\n\nBut (2,6) food is not eaten, and I'm moving down, away from it.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (2,5) from (3,5) on turn 6.\n\nTurn 6: move L to (2,5), positions: head (2,5), body (3,5), body (4,5), tail (4,6)  (no food, tail (3,6) removed)\n\nDirection left.\n\nFrom (2,5), as before, can move D to (2,4) but obstacle, L to (1,5) obstacle, R to (3,5) body, U to (2,6) which might be free but U is reverse? Direction left, so moving up is not reverse, reverse is right.\n\nDirections: from left direction, can move U, D, L; cannot move R.\n\nU: (2,6) - is it free? (2,6) has food, but not occupied now.\n\n(2,6) is food position, not occupied by snake.\n\nSo move U to (2,6) is possible.\n\nOn turn 7, from (2,5), move U to (2,6) to eat food.\n\nThen positions: head (2,6), body (2,5), body (3,5), body (4,5), tail (4,6)  (food eaten, tail stays)\n\nSame as before when I ate from (3,6), but now snake is [ (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) ]\n\nPreviously it was [ (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) ], so the body is different.\n\nNow head at (2,6), body at (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), tail at (4,6)\n\nFrom (2,6), direction up (since moved up).\n\nCan move U, D, L, R but direction up, so cannot move D reverse.\n\nCan move U, L, R.\n\nU: (2,7) wall, invalid.\n\nL: (1,6) free.\n\nR: (3,6) free? (3,6) not occupied, not wall.\n\n(3,6) is free now.\n\nAlso, down is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: L to (1,6) or R to (3,6).\n\nIf move L to (1,6), same problem as before, dead end.\n\nIf move R to (3,6), then new head (3,6), no food, so tail moves: previous tail (4,6) removed, new positions: head (3,6), body (2,6), body (2,5), body (3,5), tail (4,5)\n\nDirection right.\n\nThen from (3,6), can move U, D, R; cannot move L reverse.\n\nU: (3,7) wall, invalid.\n\nD: (3,5) but (3,5) is body segment, occupied.\n\nR: (4,6) but (4,6) is also body? Positions: body at (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), tail (4,5), so (4,6) is free now.\n\nAfter moving to (3,6), positions: head (3,6), body (2,6), body (2,5), body (3,5), tail (4,5)\n\nSo (4,6) is vacant.\n\nMove R to (4,6): new head (4,6), no food, so tail (4,5) removed? New positions: head (4,6), body (3,6), body (2,6), body (2,5), tail (3,5)\n\nDirection right.\n\nThen from (4,6), can move to (5,6) but obstacle, or down to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut at least I can move.\n\nFor example, move down to (4,5), and so on.\n\nSo in this case, by moving to (2,5) first then up to (2,6), I can avoid the immediate dead end after eating at (2,6).\n\nIn the first approach, when I went directly to (3,6) then to (2,6), the body was blocking the way down, but by going to (2,5) first, I have a path to (3,6) or elsewhere.\n\nBut in this case, for the food at (2,6), I can still eat it by turn 7.\n\nBack to turn 5 decision.\n\nOn turn 5, from (4,5), I should move left to (3,5) to go towards the food.\n\nThen on turn 6, I can choose to move to (2,5) or (3,4) or (3,6).\n\nIf I move to (2,5) on turn 6, as above, then turn 7 move U to (2,6) to eat.\n\nThen from there, I can move R to (3,6) to escape.\n\nIf I move to (3,6) on turn 6, then turn 7 move L to (2,6) eat, but then from (2,6), I can only move to (1,6) or (2,5), both dangerous, but (2,5) might be ok if I then move, but earlier from (2,5) after eating, it was bad, but in this sequence, when I move to (2,6) from (3,6), positions are different.\n\nI think moving to (2,5) first is better to have an escape route.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nFirst, for turn 4, I must move D to (4,5), as only choice.\n\nTurn 4: action D\n\nThen turn 5: head at (4,5), direction down, so move L to (3,5) or R to (5,5).\n\nSince (2,6) food is time-sensitive, I should go left.\n\nSo turn 5: move L to (3,5)\n\nNow turn 6: head at (3,5), direction left, so can move U, D, L.\n\nOptions: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5)\n\nIf I move L to (2,5), as above.\n\nThen turn 6: move L to (2,5)\n\nPositions: head (2,5), body (3,5), body (4,5), tail (4,6)  (since no food, tail (3,6) removed)\n\nDirection left.\n\nThen turn 7: from (2,5), direction left, can move U to (2,6), D to (2,4) but obstacle, L to (1,5) obstacle, R to (3,5) body, so only U possible.\n\nMove U to (2,6) to eat food.\n\nNow, (2,6) has food, so eat, new positions: head (2,6), body (2,5), body (3,5), body (4,5), tail (4,6)  (food eaten, tail stays)\n\nDirection up.\n\nNow turn 8: from (2,6), direction up, can move U, L, R; cannot D reverse.\n\nU: (2,7) wall, invalid.\n\nL: (1,6) free.\n\nR: (3,6) free.\n\nMove R to (3,6), as safer.\n\nNew head (3,6), no food, so tail moves: previous tail (4,6) removed, new positions: head (3,6), body (2,6), body (2,5), body (3,5), tail (4,5)\n\nDirection right.\n\nThen from (3,6), turn 9: can move U, D, R; cannot L reverse.\n\nU: (3,7) wall, invalid.\n\nD: (3,5) but (3,5) is body, occupied.\n\nR: (4,6) free, as (4,6) is not occupied now.\n\nMove R to (4,6)\n\nNew head (4,6), no food, tail (4,5) removed? New positions: head (4,6), body (3,6), body (2,6), body (2,5), tail (3,5)\n\nDirection right.\n\nThen from (4,6), turn 10: can move to (5,6) but obstacle, down to (4,5), or left to (3,6) body, or up to (4,7) wall. So only down to (4,5) possible? Down to (4,5), but (4,5) is not occupied? Positions: body at (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), tail (3,5), so (4,5) is free.\n\nMove D to (4,5)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, about the other food (1,1), but it's at (1,1), and I'm at (4,5) or something, but I can go there later since it has life span 10, so until turn 13.\n\nBut for now, I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn is 4, so I need actions for turn 4,5,6,7,8,... but since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"answer format\" with actions from turn 4 onwards, I should provide a sequence.\n\nSince the state might change, I can plan for 5 turns or so.\n\nAlso, maximize score, so eating (2,6) is good.\n\nIn the right move option, I might not eat it.\n\nSo better to go left.\n\nNow for turn 4, action is D.\n\nTurn 5: L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 6: L to (2,5)  // to set up for eating\n\nTurn 7: U to (2,6) eat\n\nThen turn 8: R to (3,6)\n\nAs above.\n\nBut on turn 8, after moving to (3,6), I have options.\n\nPerhaps I can include that.\n\nSince the food (1,1) is available, I can head towards it after.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nAfter turn 8, head at (3,6), I move to (4,6) on turn 9? From above.\n\nIn turn 8, I move to (3,6), then turn 9 to (4,6), turn 10 to (4,5), etc.\n\n(4,5) was food but eaten earlier.\n\nNow, (1,1) is at bottom left.\n\nFrom current position, after eating (2,6), I can try to go down.\n\nFor example, from (3,6), after moving to (4,6) on turn 9, then to (4,5) on turn 10, but (4,5) might be empty.\n\nThen from (4,5), can move down to (4,4) but obstacle, or left to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut (3,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nI think for the answer, I can provide actions for the next few turns to handle the immediate situation.\n\nSince on turn 4, I must move D, and then on turn 5, move L, then turn 6 move L to (2,5), turn 7 move U to (2,6) eat, turn 8 move R to (3,6).\n\nThat's 5 actions: turn 4 to turn 8.\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nTurn 5: L\n\nTurn 6: L\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: R\n\nThen after that, depending on state.\n\nBut in the sequence, on turn 6, when I move to (2,5), it should be fine.\n\nAnother thing: internal obstacles, like (1,5) and (2,4), which are near, but I avoid them.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger not an issue here.\n\nSo I think this is a plan.\n\nIf I go right on turn 5, I miss the food and might wander, but since (2,6) disappears soon, better to eat it.\n\n(1,1) has more time, so I can go later.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll go with this sequence.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan for Snake Game\n\n**Current State (Turn 4):**\n- **Snake Position**: Head at (4,6), body at (3,6), tail at (3,5). Snake length is 3.\n- **Head Direction**: Right (R).\n- **Food**:\n  - (4,5): Value +1, life span 6 (disappears after turn 9).\n  - (2,6): Value +1, life span 6 (disappears after turn 9).\n  - (1,1): Value +1, life span 10 (disappears after turn 13).\n- **Walls and Obstacles**: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2).\n- **Constraints**: \n  - From current head position (4,6) and direction R, possible moves are U (up), D (down), R (right), but L (left) is reverse and not allowed.\n  - R to (5,6) is blocked by an internal obstacle.\n  - U to (4,7) is blocked by the border wall (y=7).\n  - Only D to (4,5) is possible on turn 4, and it has food (+1 score, snake grows to length 4).\n\n**Turn 4 Action (Forced Move):**  \nMove down (D) to (4,5) to eat the positive food. This is the only safe move, as other directions are blocked or invalid.\n\n**Post-Turn 4 State (Turn 5):**  \n- Snake positions: Head at (4,5), body at (4,6), (3,6), tail at (3,5). Length 4.  \n- Head direction: Down (from moving D).  \n- Food remaining: (2,6) and (1,1); (4,5) eaten and removed.  \n- (2,6) has 5 turns left (life span decreases to 5 on turn 5, disappears after turn 9).  \n- Possible moves from (4,5): D (down), L (left), R (right); U (up) is reverse and not allowed.  \n  - D to (4,4) is blocked by internal obstacle.  \n  - R to (5,5) is safe but moves away from (2,6).  \n  - L to (3,5) is safe and moves toward (2,6).  \n- **Decision**: Move L to (3,5) to position for eating (2,6) before it expires. Avoid R to (5,5) as it risks missing (2,6) and may lead to dead ends.\n\n**Post-Turn 5 State (Turn 6):**  \n- Snake positions: Head at (3,5), body at (4,5), (4,6), tail at (3,6). Length 4.  \n- Head direction: Left (from moving L).  \n- Food: (2,6) has 4 turns left.  \n- Possible moves from (3,5): U (up), D (down), L (left); R (right) is reverse and not allowed.  \n  - U to (3,6) is safe but delays eating (2,6).  \n  - D to (3,4) is safe but moves away from food.  \n  - L to (2,5) is safe and prepares for eating (2,6) on next turn.  \n- **Decision**: Move L to (2,5) to set up eating (2,6) on turn 7. This avoids the dead end that would occur if moving directly to (3,6) first.\n\n**Post-Turn 6 State (Turn 7):**  \n- Snake positions: Head at (2,5), body at (3,5), (4,5), tail at (4,6). Length 4.  \n- Head direction: Left (from moving L).  \n- Food: (2,6) has 3 turns left.  \n- Possible moves from (2,5): U (up), D (down), L (left); R (right) is reverse and not allowed.  \n  - D to (2,4) is blocked by internal obstacle.  \n  - L to (1,5) is blocked by internal obstacle.  \n  - R to (3,5) is body collision.  \n  - U to (2,6) is safe and eats the food.  \n- **Decision**: Move U to (2,6) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake grows to length 5).\n\n**Post-Turn 7 State (Turn 8):**  \n- Snake positions: Head at (2,6), body at (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), tail at (4,6). Length 5.  \n- Head direction: Up (from moving U).  \n- Food: (1,1) remains with 6 turns left (plenty of time).  \n- Possible moves from (2,6): U (up), L (left), R (right); D (down) is reverse and not allowed.  \n  - U to (2,7) is blocked by border wall (y=7).  \n  - L to (1,6) leads to dead end (no safe moves next turn).  \n  - R to (3,6) is safe and opens escape path.  \n- **Decision**: Move R to (3,6) to avoid dead end and start navigating toward (1,1) or safer areas.\n\n**Long-Term Considerations:**  \n- **Survival**: After turn 8, the snake can head toward (1,1) by moving down or right, avoiding obstacles. For example:  \n  - Turn 9: From (3,6), move R to (4,6) (safe, no food).  \n  - Turn 10: From (4,6), move D to (4,5) (safe, no food).  \n  - Then continue toward (1,1) via safe paths, e.g., moving left and down.  \n- **Risk Avoidance**: The plan eats both nearby foods by turn 7, maximizing early score. Moving to (1,6) or (2,5) after eating (2,6) would cause death, so R to (3,6) on turn 8 is critical for survival.  \n- **Food Timing**: (2,6) is eaten on turn 7 before expiration (turn 9). (1,1) can be targeted later (e.g., around turns 9-13) with a safe route.  \n- **5+ Turn Lookahead**: The sequence prioritizes eating time-sensitive food while avoiding dead ends, ensuring long-term survival to reach (1,1).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: D (down)  \nTurn 5: L (left)  \nTurn 6: L (left)  \nTurn 7: U (up)  \nTurn 8: R (right)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 5. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2). Snake positions: head at (4,5), then body at (4,6), (3,6), (3,5). So the snake is in a sort of U-shape or something. Head is at (4,5) facing down.\n\nHead direction is D, which is down. So from (4,5), moving down would go to (4,4), but (4,4) is an obstacle, so I can't go down. Also, walls are at y=0 and y=7, but since head is at y=5, moving down decreases y, so to (4,4), but (4,4) is an internal obstacle, so it's blocked.\n\nList all obstacles:\n\n- Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x.\n\n- Internal: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)\n\nSo from head position (4,5), possible moves:\n\n- Up (U): (x,y+1) = (4,6). But (4,6) is the second segment of the snake? Snake positions: head (4,5), then (4,6), (3,6), (3,5). So (4,6) is the body, so moving up to (4,6) would cause collision with body.\n\n- Down (D): (x,y-1) = (4,4). But (4,4) is an internal obstacle, so blocked.\n\n- Left (L): (x-1,y) = (3,5). (3,5) is the last segment, the tail. Now, according to rules, moving into the tail is allowed because the tail will move forward when the snake moves, so it should be safe unless something else.\n\n- Right (R): (x+1,y) = (5,5). What is at (5,5)? Not listed as obstacle or snake, so should be free.\n\nSnake positions: (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5). So (5,5) is not occupied.\n\nAlso, walls: x=5,y=6 is obstacle? (5,6) is an internal obstacle, but that's not where we're moving.\n\nFor (5,5), let's see: x=5, y=5. Not a border wall (borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7), and not in internal obstacles: internal are (5,6), (1,4), etc., (5,6) is one, but (5,5) is not listed, so it should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) is the tail.\n\nNow, food: there are two food items.\n\n- (2,6) with value 1, life span 5. Life span decreases each turn, including current, so at turn 5, life span 5, meaning it will disappear after 5 more turns? Let me read.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at (2,6), life_span=5 at turn t=5. So countdown starts at 5, decreases each turn, so it will be there for turns 5,6,7,8,9, and disappear after turn 9? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 5, countdown=5, then turn 6, countdown=4, ..., turn 9, countdown=1, and after turn 9, it disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, other food (1,1) with value 1, life span 9. At turn 5, life span 9, so disappears after turn 13 or something.\n\nBoth are positive food, value 1 each.\n\nNow, head direction is D (down). But I can't move down because (4,4) is obstacle.\n\nPossible actions from (4,5):\n\n- U: to (4,6) - but (4,6) is the second segment of snake, so body collision. Snake positions: index 0 head (4,5), index 1 (4,6), index 2 (3,6), index 3 (3,5) tail. So (4,6) is directly above head and is body, so moving up to (4,6) would kill the snake.\n\n- D: to (4,4) - but (4,4) is internal obstacle, so wall collision, death.\n\n- L: to (3,5) - which is the tail. Now, when snake moves, if I move left to (3,5), the head moves there, and since it's the tail, the tail will move away. But let's see the positions.\n\nCurrent snake: [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n\nIf I move left to (3,5), new head is (3,5), but (3,5) was tail, and since we're moving, the tail should move forward only if we eat food, but we're not eating food here.\n\nMovement: when snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to previous position of the segment ahead, and if no food eaten, tail is removed.\n\nSo if I move to (3,5), which is currently tail position, but after move: head is now at (3,5), then the body segments: segment 1 was at (4,6), now moves to where head was, (4,5)? Let's simulate.\n\nAfter move L:\n\n- New head: (3,5)  // since moving left from (4,5) to (3,5)\n\nThen body segments: the segment that was at index 1, (4,6), moves to where head was, (4,5)\n\nThe segment that was at index 2, (3,6), moves to where index 1 was, (4,6)? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: after head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\nSo positions: before move: [head: (4,5), seg1: (4,6), seg2: (3,6), tail: (3,5)]\n\nAfter move left to (3,5):\n\n- Head is now at (3,5)\n\n- Seg1 moves to where head was: (4,5)\n\n- Seg2 moves to where seg1 was: (4,6)\n\n- Tail moves to where seg2 was: (3,6)\n\nAnd since no food eaten, the tail is removed? No, in snake, when no food, the tail segment is removed, meaning the last position is vacated.\n\nAfter move:\n\n- New positions: head at (3,5), then seg1 at (4,5), seg2 at (4,6), and the tail was at (3,5) but now head is there, so the tail position (3,5) is occupied by head, and since no food, we don't add a segment, so the snake shortens? No.\n\nI think I'm confusing.\n\nStandard: snake has positions list. When moving without eating, head moves to new position, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the last position (tail) is removed from the list, so the snake moves forward, tail disappears from old position.\n\nSo in this case:\n\nBefore move: positions: index 0: (4,5), index 1: (4,6), index 2: (3,6), index 3: (3,5)\n\nMove head to (3,5) (left).\n\nThen:\n\n- New head position: (3,5)\n\n- Index 1 (was body) moves to previous position of index 0, which is (4,5)\n\n- Index 2 moves to previous position of index 1, which is (4,6)\n\n- Index 3 (tail) moves to previous position of index 2, which is (3,6)\n\nBut the new head is at (3,5), which was the old tail position, and index 3 moves to (3,6), so the snake positions become: [(3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6)]? Let's list:\n\n- New index 0 (head): (3,5)\n\n- New index 1: position from old index 0, which is (4,5)\n\n- New index 2: position from old index 1, which is (4,6)\n\n- New index 3: position from old index 2, which is (3,6)\n\nOld index 3 is gone, since no food, so the tail was removed.\n\nSo new snake: head (3,5), body (4,5), (4,6), tail (3,6)\n\nNow, (3,5) was previously occupied by tail, but since tail moves, it's fine, no collision because the cell is vacated when tail moves.\n\nIn terms of collision, when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by any body segment at that time, it dies. But when moving to tail, at the time of move, the tail is still there, but after move, the tail moves, so it's okay.\n\nThe rules say: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to tail is safe.\n\nSimilarly, in this case, moving to (3,5) should be safe.\n\nNow, back to possible moves from (4,5):\n\n- U: to (4,6) - occupied by seg1, body collision, death.\n\n- D: to (4,4) - obstacle, wall collision, death.\n\n- L: to (3,5) - tail, safe.\n\n- R: to (5,5) - free, I think. (5,5) not wall, not snake. Snake is at (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), so (5,5) free. Obstacles: (5,6) is obstacle, but (5,5) not, so free.\n\nSo possible moves: L or R. U and D are death.\n\nNow, head direction is D (down). But I can't move down, so for next move, since I can't move opposite? \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is D, down. Opposite is U, up.\n\nBut I can't move up anyway, because it's body.\n\nPossible moves: L or R, neither is opposite to D. Opposite to down is up, left and right are perpendicular.\n\nSo no issue with reverse.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFood: (2,6) with life span 5 at turn 5, so it will disappear after turn 9, meaning it can be eaten on turns 5 to 9.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) with life span 9 at turn 5, disappears after turn 13? Countdown: at turn 5, life span 9, so decreases each turn: turn 5:9, turn6:8, ..., turn13:1, turn14:0, disappears, so can be eaten up to turn 13.\n\nNow, (2,6) is at (2,6), which is close to the snake.\n\nCurrent head (4,5), food at (2,6).\n\nAlso, obstacles: let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid 8x8, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7; y=0,7.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)\n\nSnake: (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5)\n\nFood: (2,6) and (1,1)\n\n(2,6) is at x=2,y=6.\n\nFrom head (4,5), to get to (2,6), it's left and up, but up is blocked by body at (4,6).\n\nI need to move away first.\n\nPossible actions now: L or R.\n\nIf I move L to (3,5), which is tail, as we saw, new snake: head (3,5), body (4,5), (4,6), tail (3,6)\n\nThen head direction: since I moved left, new direction is L.\n\nFrom (3,5), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (3,6) - but (3,6) is the tail? New positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), (4,6), tail (3,6). So (3,6) is tail, so moving up to (3,6) should be safe, tail will move.\n\n- D: to (3,4) - what is (3,4)? Not border, not in obstacles: obstacles include (3,2) but not (3,4), so should be free.\n\n- L: to (2,5) - free? (2,5) not listed.\n\n- R: to (4,5) - but (4,5) is now body segment, so collision.\n\nAfter move to (3,5), the body is at (4,5), so moving right to (4,5) would be body collision.\n\nSimilarly, up to (3,6) is tail, down to (3,4) free, left to (2,5) free.\n\nNow, food at (2,6), which is above (2,5).\n\nIf I move left from (4,5) to (3,5), then from (3,5) I can move up to (3,6) or down to (3,4) or left to (2,5).\n\nIf I move up to (3,6), which is tail, after move, tail moves to (4,6) or something.\n\nLet's simulate turn by turn.\n\nFirst, turn 5: I need to choose action for turn 5.\n\nOptions: L or R.\n\nIf I go L to (3,5):\n\n- New snake: head (3,5), body (4,5), (4,6), tail (3,6)  // as above\n\n- Head direction now L.\n\nNow turn 6: from (3,5), I can go U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5), or R to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, so only U, D, L possible.\n\nIf I go U to (3,6): (3,6) is tail, so moving there is safe.\n\nAfter move: head to (3,6), which was tail, so new positions: head (3,6), then body moves: seg1 to (3,5), seg2 to (4,5), tail to (4,6)? Positions before move: [ (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6) ]\n\nAfter move up to (3,6):\n\n- Head at (3,6)\n\n- Seg1 moves to old head (3,5)\n\n- Seg2 moves to old seg1 (4,5)\n\n- Tail moves to old seg2 (4,6)\n\nBut old seg2 was (4,6), so new tail at (4,6)\n\nNew snake: head (3,6), body (3,5), (4,5), tail (4,6)\n\nNow, food at (2,6) is adjacent to head? Head at (3,6), food at (2,6), so left from head.\n\nBut I need to eat it, so on next turn, I could move left to (2,6) if possible.\n\nFrom (3,6), possible moves:\n\n- U: (3,7) - but y=7 is border wall, so death.\n\n- D: (3,5) - (3,5) is now body segment, so collision.\n\n- L: (2,6) - free? (2,6) is food position, not occupied by snake or wall? Snake has head (3,6), body (3,5), (4,5), tail (4,6), so (2,6) free. Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,6) not listed, so free.\n\n- R: (4,6) - (4,6) is tail, so safe.\n\nSo from (3,6), I can move L to (2,6) to eat the food.\n\nFood at (2,6) with value 1, so eating it would increase length.\n\nIf I move to (2,6) on turn 6 or later.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nIf on turn 5, I move L to (3,5).\n\nThen on turn 6, move U to (3,6).\n\nThen on turn 7, move L to (2,6) to eat food.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so new tail added.\n\nBut when eating, head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail, so length increases.\n\nIn this case, on turn 7, move to (2,6), eat food, so new positions: head at (2,6), body: previous head (3,6) becomes seg1, then (3,5), (4,5), and tail (4,6), but since ate food, add new segment at tail, so positions: head (2,6), seg1 (3,6), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (4,5), tail (4,6)\n\nBefore move: snake at [ (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) ] // from above after turn 6\n\nAfter move left to (2,6):\n\n- Head to (2,6)\n\n- Seg1 to old head (3,6)\n\n- Seg2 to old seg1 (3,5)\n\n- Seg3 to old seg2 (4,5)\n\n- And since ate food, add new segment at old tail position (4,6), so tail at (4,6)\n\nNew snake: head (2,6), body (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), tail (4,6)\n\nLength increased to 5.\n\nNow, food eaten, so it disappears.\n\nBut we have another food at (1,1).\n\nNow, back to turn 5, I could go right instead.\n\nFrom (4,5), move R to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is free, as we said.\n\nThen new head at (5,5), body: seg1 to (4,5), seg2 to (4,6), tail to (3,6)? Positions before: [ (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) ]\n\nAfter move right to (5,5):\n\n- Head (5,5)\n\n- Seg1 to (4,5)\n\n- Seg2 to (4,6)\n\n- Tail to (3,6)  // old seg2 position\n\nOld tail (3,5) removed.\n\nNew snake: head (5,5), body (4,5), (4,6), tail (3,6)\n\nHead direction now R.\n\nFrom (5,5), possible moves:\n\n- U: (5,6) - but (5,6) is internal obstacle, so death.\n\n- D: (5,4) - free? (5,4) not wall, not snake. Obstacles: (5,1) but not (5,4), so free.\n\n- L: (4,5) - (4,5) is body, collision.\n\n- R: (6,5) - free? (6,5) not listed, but internal obstacles have (6,3), not (6,5), so free.\n\nSo can go D or R.\n\nIf I go D to (5,4), or R to (6,5).\n\nBut food at (2,6) is now farther, and life span 5, so I have a few turns.\n\nBut going right might take me away from food.\n\nNow, I need to think about survival and long-term.\n\nAlso, there is a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nIn this case, for (2,6) food, is it under tail or something? Currently, at turn 5, food at (2,6) is not under snake. Snake is at (4,5),(4,6),(3,6),(3,5), so (2,6) is free.\n\nAfter I move, if I go to (3,5) then to (3,6), at (3,6), tail is at (4,6), not adjacent to (2,6), so no issue.\n\nIf food was under tail, but here it's not.\n\nAnother thing: internal obstacles.\n\nFor example, (3,2) is obstacle, which might block paths.\n\nNow, back to turn 5 choice.\n\nIf I go left to (3,5), I can potentially eat food at (2,6) in two moves: turn 5 L to (3,5), turn 6 U to (3,6), turn 7 L to (2,6) eat.\n\nBut on turn 6, after moving to (3,5), I have options: U, D, or L.\n\nIf I go U to (3,6), then turn 7 eat.\n\nBut from (3,5), I could go directly to (2,5) by moving left on turn 6.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can go up to (2,6) to eat on turn 7.\n\nLet's see.\n\nTurn 5: move L to (3,5)\n\nNow snake: head (3,5), body (4,5), (4,6), tail (3,6)\n\nTurn 6: move L to (2,5)  // (2,5) should be free.\n\nThen new head (2,5), body: seg1 to (3,5), seg2 to (4,5), tail to (4,6)? Positions before: [ (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6) ]\n\nAfter move left to (2,5):\n\n- Head (2,5)\n\n- Seg1 to (3,5)\n\n- Seg2 to (4,5)\n\n- Tail to (4,6)  // old seg2 position\n\nNew snake: head (2,5), body (3,5), (4,5), tail (4,6)\n\nNow from (2,5), I can move U to (2,6) to eat food.\n\n(2,6) is adjacent, move up.\n\nThen on turn 7, move U to (2,6), eat food.\n\nNew head (2,6), body: seg1 to (2,5), seg2 to (3,5), seg3 to (4,5), and add new tail at (4,6), so positions: head (2,6), seg1 (2,5), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (4,5), tail (4,6)\n\nLength 5.\n\nSame as before, but I reached in two moves: turn 5 L, turn 6 L to (2,5), turn 7 U to (2,6) eat.\n\nIf I go U first on turn 6, I go to (3,6), then turn 7 L to (2,6).\n\nBut going directly left to (2,5) might be better because (2,5) is closer to other areas.\n\nBut now, after eating, I need to survive and go to other food or avoid dead ends.\n\nThe other food is at (1,1), which is far.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nAfter eating at (2,6), snake is at (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)\n\nNow, possible moves from (2,6):\n\n- U: (2,7) but y=7 border, death.\n\n- D: (2,5) but (2,5) is body, collision.\n\n- L: (1,6) - free? (1,6) not obstacle, not snake.\n\n- R: (3,6) - (3,6) is not occupied? Current snake: head (2,6), seg1 (2,5), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (4,5), tail (4,6), so (3,6) free? (3,6) is not in positions, and not obstacle, so free.\n\nBut (1,6) and (3,6) both possible.\n\n(1,6) might be risky because of obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,4), (1,5), etc.\n\n(1,5) is obstacle, so (1,6) is above it, might be okay.\n\nBut let's not go too far.\n\nIf on turn 5 I go right to (5,5), then I might not reach the food in time.\n\nFor example, from (5,5), if I go down to (5,4), then I can go left or down, but (2,6) is up and left, might take more turns.\n\nLife span of food at (2,6) is 5 at turn 5, so it can be eaten until turn 9.\n\nBut if I go right, I might not get back in time.\n\nFor instance, from (5,5) to (2,6): need to go left to (4,5) but (4,5) might be occupied, or down then left, etc.\n\nBut with obstacles, it might be tight.\n\nTo save time, going left to eat the food seems better.\n\nMoreover, there is another food at (1,1), but it has longer life, so I can get it later.\n\nBut I need to survive, so after eating, I should find a path to (1,1) or other areas.\n\nBut the grid has obstacles.\n\nList all obstacles again: internal: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)\n\n(1,5) is obstacle, which is below (1,6).\n\nIf I go to (1,6), I might get stuck.\n\nFor example, from (1,6), possible moves: U (1,7) border death, D (1,5) obstacle, L (0,6) border death, R (2,6) which might be body if I just left.\n\nSo (1,6) is a dead end if I go there.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) from (2,6), if I go R to (3,6), then from there U (3,7) death, D (3,5) which is body, L (2,6) body, R (4,6) which is tail or something.\n\nLet's see after eating at (2,6), snake at (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)\n\nFrom head (2,6), L to (1,6): but (1,6) is free, but then from (1,6), only possible move is... U, D, L all death or obstacle, R to (2,6) body, so indeed, (1,6) is a dead end, cannot go there.\n\nSimilarly, R to (3,6): (3,6) free, move to (3,6).\n\nThen new head (3,6), body: seg1 to (2,6), seg2 to (2,5), seg3 to (3,5), tail to (4,5)? Positions before: [ (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) ]\n\nAfter move R to (3,6):\n\n- Head (3,6)\n\n- Seg1 to (2,6)\n\n- Seg2 to (2,5)\n\n- Seg3 to (3,5)\n\n- Tail to (4,5)  // old seg3 position\n\nNew snake: head (3,6), body (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), tail (4,5)\n\nNow from (3,6), possible moves:\n\nU: (3,7) death\n\nD: (3,5) but (3,5) is body, collision\n\nL: (2,6) body, collision\n\nR: (4,6) - (4,6) is not occupied? Current positions: (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), so (4,6) free? And not obstacle.\n\n(4,6) is free? But (4,6) was part of snake before, but now not, and obstacles have (5,6) but not (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is free.\n\nMove to (4,6).\n\nThen similar.\n\nBut point is, after eating at (2,6), I need to go right or down, but down is blocked.\n\nFrom (2,6), after eating, I can only go to (3,6) or (1,6), but (1,6) dead end, so must go to (3,6).\n\nThen from (3,6) to (4,6), and so on.\n\nBut then I can go down or something.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (3,2), etc.\n\nNow, back to turn 5, if I go right to (5,5), I might avoid this area but miss the food.\n\nBut the food is positive, so I should eat it if possible.\n\nSince I can eat it safely by going left, I think I should do that.\n\nMoreover, for long-term, after eating, I have more space to move.\n\nIf I go right, I might get stuck or something.\n\nFor example, from (5,5), if I go D to (5,4), then from (5,4), I can go D to (5,3), or L to (4,4) but (4,4) obstacle, R to (6,4), etc.\n\n(5,4) to (5,3): (5,3) free? Obstacles: (5,1) but not (5,3), (6,3) obstacle, but (5,3) free.\n\nThen (5,3) to (5,2) or (6,3) obstacle, (4,3), etc.\n\nBut (1,1) is far, I need to go left and down.\n\nBut with obstacles, it might be possible.\n\nBut the food at (2,6) might expire if I don't eat it, and it's easy to get now.\n\nMoreover, by going right, I might encounter risks.\n\nFor example, from (5,5), if I go R to (6,5), then to (6,6) but (6,6) might be free, but (5,6) is obstacle, so (6,6) free? y=6, x=6.\n\nBut borders, and internal (6,3) obstacle, not (6,6).\n\nBut from (6,5), U to (6,6), D to (6,4), L to (5,5) body, R to (7,5) border death.\n\n(6,4): free? Then to (6,3) but (6,3) obstacle, so dead end or something.\n\n(6,4) to (6,3) obstacle, to (5,4) or (7,4) border.\n\nBut (5,4) free, etc.\n\nBut it seems messy.\n\nTo maximize score, eating the food is good.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the tail reward danger, but here not applicable.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (1,1) with life span 9, so I have time.\n\nBut I should plan to eat both if possible.\n\nBut for now, on turn 5, moving left to (3,5) seems better to approach the food.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (2,5) or (3,6) to set up for eating.\n\nIn terms of direction: current head direction D, moving L is perpendicular, no reverse.\n\nIf I move R to (5,5), also perpendicular.\n\nBut moving L is towards food.\n\nMoreover, after moving to (3,5), I have more flexibility.\n\nFor example, if I go to (3,5) on turn 5, then on turn 6, I could go down to (3,4) instead of towards food, but that might delay eating.\n\nSince life span is 5, I have until turn 9, so I could go down to (3,4) to explore or something.\n\nBut (3,4) might be near obstacles.\n\n(3,4) free, but below (3,5), and obstacle at (3,2), so I can go to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut I think it's better to eat the food first.\n\nTo avoid the dead end issue after eating at (2,6), when I eat on turn 7, I should be able to move to (3,6) safely.\n\nIn the sequence: if turn 5 L to (3,5), turn 6 L to (2,5), turn 7 U to (2,6) eat.\n\nThen from (2,6), I can only go to (3,6) or (1,6), but (1,6) dead end, so must go to (3,6).\n\nThen from (3,6), I can go to (4,6) or other.\n\n(4,6) might be free, as before.\n\nThen from (4,6), I can go down to (4,5) or right to (5,6) but (5,6) obstacle, so down to (4,5) or left to (3,6) body.\n\n(4,6) to (4,5): (4,5) might be body.\n\nAfter moving to (3,6) from (2,6), snake is as above: head (3,6), body (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), tail (4,5)\n\nThen move to (4,6): (4,6) free, move.\n\nNew head (4,6), body: seg1 to (3,6), seg2 to (2,6), seg3 to (2,5), tail to (3,5)? Positions before: [ (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) ]\n\nAfter move to (4,6):\n\n- Head (4,6)\n\n- Seg1 to (3,6)\n\n- Seg2 to (2,6)\n\n- Seg3 to (2,5)\n\n- Tail to (3,5)  // old seg3 position\n\nNew snake: head (4,6), body (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), tail (3,5)\n\nNow from (4,6), possible moves:\n\nU: (4,7) border death\n\nD: (4,5) - but (4,5) is tail? In new snake, tail is at (3,5), so (4,5) free? Positions: head (4,6), seg1 (3,6), seg2 (2,6), seg3 (2,5), tail (3,5), so (4,5) not occupied.\n\n(4,5) free.\n\nL: (3,6) body, collision\n\nR: (5,6) obstacle, death\n\nSo only down to (4,5) or up but up death, so only D to (4,5)\n\nMove to (4,5).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut I need to go towards (1,1).\n\n(1,1) is at bottom left.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can go down or left, but with obstacles.\n\nFor example, (4,4) is obstacle, so I cannot go down from (4,5) to (4,4).\n\nFrom (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6) body, D to (4,4) obstacle, L to (3,5) body, R to (5,5) free.\n\nSo only R to (5,5).\n\nThen from (5,5), etc.\n\nIt might take time to get to (1,1).\n\nBut since life span is long, it might be ok.\n\nNow, for the immediate action, I think on turn 5, moving left to (3,5) is best to set up for eating the food.\n\nIf I move right, I might not get the food and could be stuck in the right area with obstacles.\n\nFor example, from (5,5), if I go down to (5,4), then to (5,3), but (5,3) to (5,2), (5,1) obstacle, so I have to go left or right.\n\n(5,3) to (4,3) or (6,3) obstacle, so to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut (1,1) is far.\n\nWhereas if I eat the food, I have more length, which might help in surviving, but also makes it harder to maneuver in tight spaces.\n\nCurrently snake length 4, after eating 5.\n\nThe grid has obstacles, so longer snake might be riskier.\n\nBut I think eating food is primary goal.\n\nMoreover, the food at (2,6) will disappear soon, so I should eat it.\n\nTherefore, for turn 5, I should move left to (3,5).\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I can plan to eat the food.\n\nIn the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead, but the state might change, so I should plan a sequence.\n\nThe instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, but output the actions for the next few turns based on that.\n\nAnswer format: boxed with actions from turn t1 onwards.\n\nt1=5, so output actions for turn 5,6,7,... but since state changes, I need to specify a sequence, but it might not be fixed.\n\nI should output a plan for several turns.\n\nBut the food might be eaten, etc.\n\nFor now, let's plan to eat the food.\n\nSo turn 5: move L to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 6: from (3,5), I can move L to (2,5) to be closer to food.\n\nThen turn 7: move U to (2,6) to eat food.\n\nAfter that, from (2,6), move R to (3,6) to avoid dead end.\n\nThen turn 8: from (3,6), move to (4,6)\n\nThen turn 9: from (4,6), move D to (4,5) as before.\n\nBut (4,5) might be free at that time.\n\nAfter turn 7, snake is at (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)\n\nAfter moving to (3,6) on turn 8: head to (3,6), body to (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), tail to (4,5)? Earlier calculation.\n\nTurn 7: after eating, snake at (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)\n\nTurn 8: move R to (3,6)\n\n- Head to (3,6)\n\n- Seg1 to (2,6)\n\n- Seg2 to (2,5)\n\n- Seg3 to (3,5)\n\n- Tail to (4,5)  // since no food, tail moves to old seg3 position? When no food, tail is removed.\n\nAfter move without eating:\n\nPositions before move: [ (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) ]  // head, seg1, seg2, seg3, tail\n\nMove head to (3,6)\n\nNew head: (3,6)\n\nThen seg1 moves to old head position (2,6)\n\nSeg2 moves to old seg1 position (2,5)\n\nSeg3 moves to old seg2 position (3,5)\n\nTail moves to old seg3 position (4,5)\n\nAnd since no food eaten, the last segment is removed? No, the tail position is vacated, but in the list, the tail moves to (4,5), and the old tail (4,6) is removed.\n\nNew positions: head (3,6), seg1 (2,6), seg2 (2,5), seg3 (3,5), and tail at (4,5)? Indices: index 0 (3,6), index 1 (2,6), index 2 (2,5), index 3 (3,5), and index 4 (4,5) but since no food, the snake should have 5 segments? Length is 5, so after move without eating, the length remains the same, tail moves to new position.\n\nStandard: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment before it, and the last position is vacated, so the snake occupies one less cell temporarily? No.\n\nPositions list: initially, 5 cells.\n\nAfter move: head to new position, then the first body segment to the old head position, second body to old first body position, ..., and the last body segment to the old second last position, and the old tail position is abandoned.\n\nBut the number of segments remains the same.\n\nIn this case, with 5 segments:\n\nOld positions: P0=head (2,6), P1= (2,5), P2= (3,5), P3= (4,5), P4=tail (4,6)\n\nAfter move head to new position N=(3,6)\n\nThen new head: N\n\nNew seg1: old P0 = (2,6)\n\nNew seg2: old P1 = (2,5)\n\nNew seg3: old P2 = (3,5)\n\nNew tail: old P3 = (4,5)\n\nAnd old P4 (4,6) is no longer occupied.\n\nSo new snake: [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)]  // head, seg1, seg2, seg3, tail\n\nTail at (4,5)\n\nFrom (3,6), move to (4,6) on turn 8: (4,6) is free, move.\n\nHead to (4,6)\n\nThen new positions: head (4,6), seg1 to (3,6), seg2 to (2,6), seg3 to (2,5), tail to (3,5)\n\nNew snake: [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5)]\n\nThen from (4,6), move down to (4,5) on turn 9: (4,5) is free? Current positions: (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), so (4,5) free.\n\nMove D to (4,5)\n\nHead to (4,5)\n\nSeg1 to (4,6)\n\nSeg2 to (3,6)\n\nSeg3 to (2,6)\n\nTail to (2,5)\n\nNew snake: [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)]\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut for the plan, I think for turns 5,6,7 I can specify: turn 5 L, turn 6 L, turn 7 U to eat.\n\nThen beyond, it depends.\n\nSince I need to output for multiple turns, let's say for 5 turns: t5 to t9.\n\nt5: L\n\nt6: L to (2,5)\n\nt7: U to (2,6) eat\n\nt8: from (2,6), move R to (3,6)\n\nt9: from (3,6), move to (4,6)\n\nBut on t8, from (2,6), after eating, move to (3,6)\n\nThen t9 to (4,6)\n\nBut (4,6) might have issues, but it should be ok.\n\nTo avoid outputting too many, I can do up to t7 or t8.\n\nThe answer should start from t5 action.\n\nSince t1=5, output actions for t5, t6, t7, etc.\n\nI think 3 or 4 actions are fine, as the state changes.\n\nBut to think ahead, I have a plan.\n\nAnother option: on turn 6, from (3,5), instead of going to (2,5), I could go down to (3,4) to have more space, but then I might eat the food later, but with life span, it's ok, but (3,4) to (3,3), but obstacle at (3,2), so I can go to (3,3), but (3,2) obstacle, so (3,3) to (2,3) or (4,3), etc., but it might delay eating.\n\nI think going directly to food is better.\n\nMoreover, for the other food, I can plan after.\n\nSo for turn 5, action L.\n\nThen turn 6, action L to (2,5)\n\nTurn 7, action U to (2,6) to eat.\n\nThen for turn 8, I need to move from (2,6) to (3,6)\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the output, I can list actions for t5 to t7 or t8.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions for the turns.\n\nI think I'll go with that.\n\nBut let's confirm the initial move.\n\nCurrent head direction D, moving L is allowed since not reverse.\n\nMoving to (3,5) tail, safe.\n\nThen to (2,5) free.\n\nThen to (2,6) eat.\n\nNow, for the sequence.\n\nIn the food, both are value 1, so eating one is +1.\n\nIf I don't eat, I miss the point.\n\nBut I could avoid if risky, but here it seems safe.\n\nMoreover, after eating, I can go to (1,1) later.\n\nFor example, from after eating, I can go down through (3,5) or something, but with obstacles.\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, so from (2,5), I cannot go down to (2,4) obstacle.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,6), I can only go left or right, but left dead end, so right to (3,6), then to (4,6), then down to (4,5), then right to (5,5), etc., and down to (5,4), (5,3), but (5,1) obstacle, so to (4,3), (3,3), etc., to (1,1).\n\nBut (3,2) obstacle, so I need to go around.\n\nFor instance, from (4,5) to (5,5), to (5,4), to (5,3), to (4,3), to (3,3), to (3,4) or (2,3), but (2,4) obstacle, so to (2,3), then to (1,3), then down to (1,2), to (1,1), but (1,4) and (1,5) obstacles, so (1,3) to (1,2) should be free, to (1,1).\n\n(1,4) obstacle, but (1,3) and (1,2) should be free if not obstacles.\n\nObstacles: (1,4), (1,5), so (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) might be free.\n\n(1,1) is food, so free.\n\nBut (1,1) is at bottom, y=1.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) obstacle, so from (3,3) to (2,3), to (1,3), to (1,2), to (1,1).\n\nPossible.\n\nBut it takes many turns.\n\nSince life span of (1,1) is 9 at turn 5, so at turn 10, it might be 4 or something, but I have time.\n\nBut for now, on turn 5, I think moving left is best.\n\nSo action for turn 5: L\n\nThen for the sequence, I'll output up to turn 7 or 8.\n\nSince the answer format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I can list a few.\n\nPerhaps 5 actions.\n\nt5 to t9.\n\nBut after eating, it depends.\n\nI think for simplicity, I'll do t5, t6, t7 actions to eat the food.\n\nThen for t8 and t9, I can plan to move away.\n\nBut in output, I need to specify.\n\nSince thinking ahead, I can output the actions.\n\nAnother idea: if on turn 6, from (3,5), I go to (3,6) instead of (2,5), then on turn 7 to (2,6) eat.\n\nSimilar.\n\nBut going to (2,5) first might be better for future movement to (1,1), but (2,5) is above (2,4) obstacle, so I need to go left or right.\n\n(2,5) to (1,5) but (1,5) obstacle, so cannot go left, only right to (3,5) or down to (2,4) obstacle, up to (2,6), so from (2,5), only up to (2,6) or right to (3,5), but (3,5) might be body.\n\nIn the sequence after eating, (2,5) is body, so from head (2,6), down to (2,5) body, left to (1,6) dead end, right to (3,6) free.\n\nSo I have to go to (3,6).\n\nSimilarly, if at (2,5) before eating, from (2,5), I can go up to (2,6) to eat.\n\nNo other choices.\n\nSo both ways are fine.\n\nI think for turn 5: L\n\nTurn 6: L to (2,5)\n\nTurn 7: U to (2,6) eat\n\nThen for turn 8: from (2,6), move R to (3,6)\n\nTurn 9: from (3,6), move to (4,6)\n\nBut on turn 9, from (3,6), moving to (4,6) as before.\n\n(4,6) should be free.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nTo complete 5 turns: t5 to t9.\n\nt8 and t9 actions.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 5: L\n\nTurn 6: L\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: R  // to (3,6)\n\nTurn 9: R  // to (4,6), but from (3,6) to (4,6) is right, yes R.\n\nIn coordinates, from (3,6) to (4,6) is increasing x, so R.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,6) to (3,6) is also R.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd head direction changes accordingly.\n\nNow, about the food life span: at turn 5, food at (2,6) life span 5, eaten on turn 7, which is before turn 9, so fine.\n\nOther food at (1,1) life span 9, so I can plan to eat it later.\n\nBut for the output, I think this is good.\n\nSo the actions:\n\nTurn 5: L\n\nTurn 6: L\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: R\n\nTurn 9: R\n\nIn the sequence, after turn 7 eat, on turn 8 move R to (3,6), turn 9 move R to (4,6).\n\nBut on turn 9, from (4,6), I can move down to (4,5), but in the plan, I didn't specify, but for output, I can stop at turn 9 or so.\n\nSince the snake is alive, it's fine.\n\nTo be precise, I should output the actions.\n\nNow, for the boxed answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating the positive food at (2,6) while avoiding collisions and considering the 5+ turn horizon. The food at (2,6) has a life span of 5 at turn 5, meaning it disappears after turn 9, so it must be eaten by turn 9. The food at (1,1) has a longer life span (9 at turn 5, disappearing after turn 13), allowing time to reach it later. \n\nThe current snake head position is (4,5) with direction down (D). Possible moves from (4,5) are:\n- Up (U) to (4,6): occupied by the snake's body segment, leading to collision and death.\n- Down (D) to (4,4): occupied by an internal obstacle, leading to collision and death.\n- Left (L) to (3,5): occupied by the tail, which is safe as the tail will move.\n- Right (R) to (5,5): free, no collision risk.\n\nThus, only L or R are viable. Moving left (L) to (3,5) positions the snake closer to the food at (2,6) and sets up a safe eating sequence. Moving right (R) takes the snake away from the food, risking that it may not be eaten before it expires due to obstacles and grid constraints.\n\n### Plan for Turns 5 to 9 (5+ Turns Ahead)\nThe plan focuses on:\n1. **Eating (2,6) safely by turn 7**: This captures the +1 reward before it expires.\n2. **Avoiding dead ends and collisions**: After eating, move to open areas to survive and later reach (1,1).\n3. **Long-term survival**: After eating, the snake moves right to avoid the dead end at (1,6) and navigates toward the center for flexibility.\n\n**Sequence Details:**\n- **Turn 5 (t=5)**: Move L to (3,5). \n  - New head: (3,5), direction L.  \n  - Snake becomes: [(3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6)] (tail at (3,6)).\n- **Turn 6 (t=6)**: Move L to (2,5). \n  - New head: (2,5), direction L.  \n  - Snake becomes: [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)] (tail at (4,6)).  \n  - (2,5) is free and positions for eating (2,6) next turn.\n- **Turn 7 (t=7)**: Move U to (2,6) to eat the food. \n  - New head: (2,6), direction U.  \n  - Food eaten: +1 reward, length increases to 5.  \n  - Snake becomes: [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)] (tail at (4,6)).  \n  - Food (2,6) consumed before expiration.\n- **Turn 8 (t=8)**: Move R to (3,6) to avoid the dead end at (1,6). \n  - New head: (3,6), direction R.  \n  - Snake becomes: [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)] (tail at (4,5)).  \n  - (3,6) is free; moving right escapes the risky left side.\n- **Turn 9 (t=9)**: Move R to (4,6). \n  - New head: (4,6), direction R.  \n  - Snake becomes: [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5)] (tail at (3,5)).  \n  - (4,6) is free; this continues movement to open areas for future turns.\n\n### Why This Plan?\n- **Risk Minimization**: Moving left on turn 5 avoids immediate death and leverages the tail movement for safety. The sequence to (2,6) is direct and minimizes turns, reducing exposure to risks.\n- **Food Capture**: Eating on turn 7 ensures the food is secured with 2 turns to spare (life span ends after turn 9).\n- **Post-Eating Survival**: After eating, moving right to (3,6) and (4,6) avoids the dead end at (1,6) and obstacles. From (4,6), the snake can later move down to (4,5) or explore toward (1,1), using the grid's right side which has fewer obstacles.\n- **Long-Term (Beyond Turn 9)**: The snake should head toward (1,1) by navigating down and left (e.g., via (4,5) → (5,5) → (5,4) → etc.), but this depends on future states. The life span of (1,1) allows until turn 13, so it can be prioritized after securing the immediate reward.\n\n**Constraints Handled:**\n- **No instant reverse**: Moves respect the head direction changes (L on t5, L on t6, U on t7, R on t8, R on t9—no opposites).\n- **Collision avoidance**: All moves are to free cells or safe tail positions.\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Not applicable here, as (2,6) is not under the tail when eaten.\n\nThis plan maximizes the score by eating the high-priority food and ensures survival for at least 5 turns, with a path to the second food.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 6: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 7: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 8: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 9: R (right)\n}",

        "step": 6,
        "score": 3,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 6, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there are internal obstacles at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2). So I must avoid those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (3,5), then body segments at (4,5), (4,6), (3,6). So the snake is in a sort of square: from (3,5) to right to (4,5), then down to (4,6), then left to (3,6). But head is at (3,5) and tail is at (3,6). Head direction is L, which is left, so it was moving left to (3,5) from... let's see the positions: from (4,5) to (3,5), so yes, moving left.\n\nFood: there are two food items:\n\n- At (2,6) with life span 4 and value 1 (positive)\n\n- At (1,1) with life span 8 and value 1 (positive)\n\nBoth are positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span: for (2,6), life span 4 means it will disappear after 4 turns, including this turn? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns (N = life_span), countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn 6, life span 4, it will disappear after turn 9? Let's clarify.\n\nIf life span is N at turn t, it disappears at the end of turn t + N - 1? Or after N turns from now?\n\nIt says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo for food at turn t with life span L, after L turns, it's gone. Meaning it exists for L turns starting from now.\n\nFor example, at turn 6, life span 4, it will be available on turns 6,7,8,9, and disappear at the start of turn 10? But the countdown decreases each turn, including current.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think: at the beginning of turn t, the food has life span L. After the turn, life span decreases by 1. So after turn t, it becomes L-1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or something.\n\nThe rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". And \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nI think it means: if at turn t, life span is N, then during turn t, it can be eaten, and after turn t, life span becomes N-1. If life span becomes 0 after a turn, it disappears before the next turn.\n\nBut for eating, it can be eaten on any turn as long as life span >0.\n\nIn this case, for (2,6), life span 4 at turn 6, so it can be eaten on turns 6,7,8,9. After turn 9, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) life span 8, so it can be eaten from turn 6 to turn 13.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead. The answer format says to output actions starting from turn t1, which is 6, for several turns, but it doesn't specify how many. It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should plan at least 5 moves, but I need to output the actions for each turn starting from t1.\n\nThe answer format is: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc. But it doesn't say for how many turns. I think I need to simulate multiple steps, but since the state changes, I might need to re-evaluate after each action, but for the response, I should provide a sequence for, say, 5 turns or more.\n\nBut the user might expect a sequence for the immediate future based on current knowledge.\n\nI should think about the path to the food while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No, walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except for internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)\n\nSo let's list all obstacles:\n\n- Border walls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\n- Internal: (1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (3,2), (4,4), (5,1), (5,6), (6,3)\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,5), body: (4,5), (4,6), (3,6)\n\nSo the snake occupies: (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6)\n\nFood at (2,6) and (1,1)\n\n(2,6) is right next to the snake. (2,6) is adjacent to (3,6) and (2,5), but (2,5) might be free.\n\nLet's find free cells.\n\nFirst, head at (3,5), direction L, so it was moving left to (3,5) from (4,5). Current direction is L, so I cannot move right (opposite) on the next turn. Movement constraints: no instant reverse, so since current head direction is L, I cannot move R on turn 6.\n\nPossible moves from (3,5): U (up to (3,6)), D (down to (3,4)), L (left to (2,5)), R (right to (4,5)) but R is opposite to current direction L, so not allowed. Also, R to (4,5) is occupied by body, so it would be collision anyway.\n\nLet's list possible actions for turn 6.\n\nFrom head (3,5):\n\n- U: to (3,6) - but (3,6) is occupied by the tail segment. Now, collision rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to a cell that is currently the tail is allowed because when the head moves there, the tail moves away, so no collision. Only if it's not the tail, it would be collision.\n\nIn this case, (3,6) is the tail. So if I move U to (3,6), since it's the tail, and tail will move, it should be safe, as long as after moving, the head is not colliding with body.\n\nWhen head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it collides. If it is the tail, and tail moves away, it's ok.\n\nAlso, for food, if food is under tail, it can be eaten only if head moves to it after tail moves away.\n\nBut in this case, for movement to (3,6), which is tail.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (3,6) - currently tail, so possible. After move, head at (3,6), tail moves to? Snake was [(3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6)], after move U, head moves to (3,6), but (3,6) was tail, so the body segments shift: new head at (3,6), then the first body segment was (3,5), then (4,5), then (4,6), and tail was (3,6) which is now head, so the new tail is (4,6)? Let's think.\n\nSnake positions before move: head (3,5), body [ (4,5), (4,6), (3,6) ] so segments: index 0: (3,5), 1: (4,5), 2: (4,6), 3: (3,6)\n\nAfter moving head to a new position, the snake grows only if it eats food; otherwise, the tail moves off.\n\nNo food eaten yet, so if head moves to a new cell, the tail is removed, so the snake moves forward.\n\nSo after move, if no food, new positions: head at new position, then the old head becomes first body, and so on, but tail is removed.\n\nSpecifically: if head moves to cell C, and C is not food, then new head at C, the body segments are the previous positions except the tail is removed. So from [H, B1, B2, ..., T], after moving to C (no food), new positions: [C, H, B1, B2, ...] without T.\n\nIn this case, moving U to (3,6): C = (3,6)\n\nPrevious positions: H = (3,5), B1 = (4,5), B2 = (4,6), T = (3,6)\n\nAfter moving to (3,6): new head at (3,6), then new body: previous H (3,5), then B1 (4,5), then B2 (4,6). But B2 was (4,6), which is fine. The tail T (3,6) is no longer there; head is now at (3,6), so it's like the snake moved up, and tail was at (3,6), but head moved there, so effectively, the tail is gone, and head is at (3,6), body: (3,5), (4,5), (4,6).\n\nBut (3,6) was the tail, now it's head, and the new tail is (4,6).\n\nPositions: new head: (3,6), then body segments: the first body is the old head (3,5), then (4,5), then (4,6) as tail.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, is (3,6) a valid move? It was occupied by tail, but since tail moves away, it's ok.\n\nAlso, check if (3,6) is wall or obstacle: walls are at borders, (3,6) is x=3,y=6, not border (border y=7 or y=0, etc.), and not in internal obstacles: obstacles are (5,6), etc., (3,6) not listed, so free? But it was occupied by tail, but moving there is allowed.\n\nNow, other moves from (3,5):\n\n- D: down to (3,4) - is this free? (3,4) not in snake positions: snake has (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), so (3,4) should be free. Also not wall or obstacle: obstacles, (3,2) is obstacle, but (3,4) not listed, so free.\n\n- L: left to (2,5) - (2,5) not in snake, not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) not listed, so should be free.\n\n- R: right to (4,5) - but (4,5) is body segment, not tail. Specifically, it's the first body segment after head. So if I move R to (4,5), it would collide with body, since it's not the tail. Also, current direction is L, moving R is opposite, so not allowed anyway.\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nU: to (3,6), which is current tail position.\n\nD: to (3,4)\n\nL: to (2,5)\n\nNow, I need to think about food. Food at (2,6) and (1,1).\n\n(2,6) is close, at (2,6), which is adjacent to current head (3,5)? (3,5) to (2,6) is not adjacent; adjacent cells share an edge, so (3,5) adjacent are (3,6), (3,4), (2,5), (4,5).\n\n(2,6) is adjacent to (2,5), (3,6), (1,6), etc.\n\nCurrently, (2,6) has food with life span 4.\n\nIf I want to eat it, I need to move head to (2,6) when it's free.\n\nBut currently, (2,6) is not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6). (2,6) not listed, so it should be free, with food.\n\nBut to eat it, head must move to (2,6).\n\nNow, from current position (3,5), I can go to (2,5) or (3,6), then from there to (2,6).\n\nFor example:\n\n- If I move L to (2,5) on turn 6, then head at (2,5). Then from (2,5), I can move U to (2,6) to eat the food on turn 7.\n\nBut life span of (2,6) is 4 at turn 6, so it will be there until turn 9, so I have time.\n\n(1,1) is far away, life span 8, so plenty of time.\n\nBut I should prioritize which food to go for.\n\nAlso, need to avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving towards (2,6).\n\nFrom (3,5), to reach (2,6), I need to go left and up.\n\nOption: move L to (2,5) on turn 6.\n\nThen on turn 7, from (2,5), I can move U to (2,6) to eat food.\n\nBut when I eat food, the snake grows, so after eating, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nBut there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nIn this case, when I move to (2,6), what is the tail at that time?\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nCurrent turn 6: snake positions: H=(3,5), B1=(4,5), B2=(4,6), T=(3,6)\n\nAfter turn 6, if I move L to (2,5):\n\n- Head moves to (2,5), no food there, so no grow, tail moves off. New positions: H=(2,5), B1=(3,5), B2=(4,5), T=(4,6)  [since tail was (3,6), but removed, so new tail is (4,6)?]\n\nPrevious positions: index 0: (3,5) head, 1: (4,5), 2: (4,6), 3: (3,6) tail\n\nAfter moving head to (2,5) (no food), new head: (2,5)\n\nThen body: previous head (3,5), then previous B1 (4,5), then previous B2 (4,6) as tail. Previous tail (3,6) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)] with head at (2,5), tail at (4,6)\n\nDirection: I moved L, so new head direction is L? I need to track direction for no reverse.\n\nBut for now, positions.\n\nNow turn 7: head at (2,5), I want to move U to (2,6) to eat food.\n\n(2,6) has food, positive.\n\nNow, when I move U to (2,6), head at (2,6), and since food, the snake grows: so new head at (2,6), and the tail does not move, so body segments include the previous tail.\n\nNew positions: head (2,6), then previous head (2,5), then previous B1 (3,5), then previous B2 (4,5), and previous tail (4,6) remains? Let's see.\n\nBefore move: positions [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)] head (2,5)\n\nAfter moving to (2,6) which has food: head moves to (2,6), and since food, the tail is not removed, so new positions: [ (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) ] so length 5, tail at (4,6)\n\nNow, check for Tail Reward Danger: when eating, is head adjacent to tail?\n\nHead at (2,6), tail at (4,6). Are they adjacent? (2,6) and (4,6) are not adjacent; they are two cells apart. Adjacent means sharing edge, so (2,6) adjacent cells are (1,6), (3,6), (2,5), (2,7) but y=7 wall, so not.\n\nTail is at (4,6), not adjacent to (2,6). So no danger.\n\nBut (3,6) might be a cell, but not occupied now.\n\nIn this case, eating at (2,6) should be fine.\n\nBut is (2,6) free now? In turn 7, before move, positions are (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), so (2,6) is not occupied, yes, food is there.\n\nAlso, no wall or obstacle; (2,6) not border, not internal obstacle listed.\n\nSo moving U on turn 7 to eat is fine.\n\nBut I need to think about the direction.\n\nAfter turn 6 move L to (2,5), head direction is L.\n\nThen on turn 7, move U to (2,6), which is up, not opposite to L (left), so allowed.\n\nThen after that, head direction is U.\n\nNow, another option: I could move U on turn 6 to (3,6).\n\nIf I move U to (3,6) on turn 6.\n\nAs before, new positions: head (3,6), body (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) tail.\n\nThen from (3,6), I can move L to (2,6) to eat food on turn 7.\n\nMove L to (2,6): from (3,6) to (2,6) left.\n\nCurrent direction after move U is U, so moving L is allowed.\n\nThen on turn 7, move to (2,6) to eat.\n\nSimilar to above.\n\nBut in this case, when I eat at (2,6), what is the tail?\n\nBefore turn 7 move: positions after turn 6: H=(3,6), B1=(3,5), B2=(4,5), T=(4,6)\n\nMove to (2,6) which has food: new head (2,6), then body: previous head (3,6), then (3,5), (4,5), and previous tail (4,6) remains, so positions: [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)]\n\nHead at (2,6), tail at (4,6), not adjacent, so fine.\n\nNow, compare the two options:\n\n- Move L on turn 6, then U on turn 7 to eat: after eating, positions: head (2,6), body (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), tail (4,6)\n\n- Move U on turn 6, then L on turn 7 to eat: positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), tail (4,6)\n\nSlightly different body, but both ok.\n\nNow, which one is better? In terms of path, similar, but I need to think about future moves.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,1) which is bottom left.\n\nBut (2,6) is about to disappear in 4 turns, but since I can eat it by turn 7 or 8, it's fine.\n\nLife span 4 at turn 6, so I have until turn 9 to eat it.\n\nBut I can eat it early.\n\nNow, another thing: after eating (2,6), the snake is longer, and I need to go to (1,1) or other food, but there might be more food later, but currently only two.\n\nThe state has only these two foods.\n\nBut food can spawn, but in this input, only these are given, so I think for now, these are the only ones.\n\nI should plan to eat (2,6) first since it's close and will disappear soon.\n\n(1,1) has longer life span.\n\nBut (2,6) is very close, so easy to get +1.\n\nNow, back to moves on turn 6.\n\nI have three options: U, D, L.\n\nIf I move D to (3,4), that might be away from food, but perhaps to explore or something.\n\nBut (3,4) is down, then I can go left or down, but (2,6) might expire.\n\nSince life span is 4, I have time, but moving down might not be efficient.\n\nI should think about the grid and obstacles.\n\nLet me sketch a grid.\n\nGrid rows y from 0 to 7, columns x from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cells (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (3,2), (4,4), (5,1), (5,6), (6,3)\n\nList:\n\n- (1,4): obstacle\n\n- (1,5): obstacle\n\n- (2,4): obstacle\n\n- (3,2): obstacle\n\n- (4,4): obstacle\n\n- (5,1): obstacle\n\n- (5,6): obstacle\n\n- (6,3): obstacle\n\nSnake: (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6)\n\nFood: (2,6), (1,1)\n\n(2,6) is at row 6, column 2? (x,y) so (2,6) means x=2, y=6.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) x=1,y=1.\n\nNow, (2,6) is at (2,6), which is not obstacle, and not snake, so free with food.\n\nTo reach (2,6) from (3,5): directly, not adjacent, but through (2,5) or (3,6).\n\n(2,5) is free? Let's see: not wall, not obstacle, not snake. Snake has (3,5), (4,5), etc., not (2,5). Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) is snake tail, but can be moved to.\n\nNow, if I move to (2,5) or to (3,6), both can lead to (2,6).\n\nBut moving to (3,6) might be better if I can go directly to (2,6) next.\n\nBut (3,6) is current tail, moving there is safe.\n\nMoving to (2,5) is also safe.\n\nBut let's see the direction.\n\nCurrent head direction L.\n\nIf I move U to (3,6), new direction U.\n\nThen from (3,6), I can move L to (2,6) to eat, direction L.\n\nIf I move L to (2,5), new direction L, then U to (2,6), direction U.\n\nAfter eating, I need to go to (1,1).\n\n(1,1) is at bottom left.\n\nNow, after eating at (2,6), positions as above.\n\nFor example, if I did move L then U: after turn 7, head at (2,6), body (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), tail (4,6)\n\nHead direction U.\n\nNow, to go to (1,1), I need to go left and down.\n\nFrom (2,6), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nU: to (2,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\nD: to (2,5) but (2,5) is body segment. In positions, (2,5) is the first body segment, not tail. So if I move to (2,5), it would collide with body.\n\nR: to (3,6) but (3,6) is not in positions? Positions: head (2,6), body (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), tail (4,6). So (3,6) is free? Not occupied.\n\n(3,6) not in positions, not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (3,2) but not (3,6), so free.\n\nBut to move to (3,6) from (2,6), that's right, which is opposite to current direction? Current direction is U (since I moved up to (2,6)), so moving R to (3,6) is right, not opposite to up, so allowed.\n\nOpposite to U is D, etc.\n\nDirections: U and D opposite, L and R opposite.\n\nSo from direction U, I can move U, L, R, not D.\n\nSimilarly here.\n\nSo from (2,6) direction U:\n\n- U: to (2,7) wall, invalid\n\n- D: to (2,5) but occupied by body, collision\n\n- L: to (1,6) - is this free? (1,6) x=1,y=6, not border (border x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so x=1 is not wall), internal obstacles: (1,4) and (1,5) are obstacles, but (1,6) not listed, so should be free.\n\n- R: to (3,6) - free as above.\n\nSo possible moves: L to (1,6) or R to (3,6)\n\nNow, to go to (1,1), I should go left to (1,6) then down.\n\n(1,6) is free, so I can move L to (1,6).\n\nThen from there, down to (1,5), but (1,5) is obstacle! Internal obstacle (1,5), so cannot go there.\n\n(1,5) is obstacle, so from (1,6), I cannot go to (1,5) because it's blocked.\n\nAlso, (1,4) is obstacle, so the column x=1 has obstacles at y=4 and y=5, so y=6 is free, but to go down, I need to go to y=5, but blocked.\n\nSo from (1,6), I can only go right or up or down, but down to (1,5) obstacle, up to (1,7) wall, so only right to (2,6) or... but (2,6) is where I came from, or to (1,6) itself, but only adjacent.\n\nAdjacent cells: (1,6) adjacent: (1,5) down - obstacle, (1,7) up - wall, (0,6) left - x=0 wall, (2,6) right - which is previous position.\n\n(2,6) is body now? After moving to (1,6), (2,6) would be behind.\n\nBut from (1,6), the only possible move is right to (2,6), but (2,6) is occupied by body? After I move to (1,6), let's see positions.\n\nSuppose after eating at (2,6) on turn 7, positions: [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)]\n\nHead at (2,6), direction U.\n\nThen if I move L to (1,6) on turn 8: head to (1,6), no food, so tail moves off.\n\nNew positions: head (1,6), body (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), tail (4,5)? Previous tail (4,6) removed.\n\nBefore move: positions [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)] head (2,6)\n\nAfter move to (1,6) no food: new head (1,6), body: previous head (2,6), then (2,5), (3,5), and previous B2 (4,5) as tail? Let's index.\n\nPositions: index 0: (2,6) head, 1: (2,5), 2: (3,5), 3: (4,5), 4: (4,6) tail? Length 5, so segments: 0 head, 1,2,3 body, 4 tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (1,6) no food: new head (1,6), then body: old head (2,6), then old body1 (2,5), then old body2 (3,5), then old body3 (4,5) as tail. Old tail (4,6) removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)] tail at (4,5)\n\nNow, head at (1,6), direction L (since moved left).\n\nNow, from (1,6), possible moves:\n\n- U: (1,7) wall, invalid\n\n- D: (1,5) obstacle, invalid\n\n- L: (0,6) wall, invalid\n\n- R: (2,6) - but (2,6) is now the first body segment! So occupied, collision if I move there.\n\nTherefore, from (1,6), no possible moves! Dead end.\n\nThis is a problem.\n\nIf I go to (1,6) after eating at (2,6), I get stuck and die on the next turn.\n\nTherefore, moving directly to (1,6) is bad.\n\nIn this path, after eating at (2,6), I should not go left to (1,6), but instead go right to (3,6) or something.\n\nBack to turn 7 after eating.\n\nHead at (2,6), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: L to (1,6) or R to (3,6)\n\nL to (1,6) leads to death, as above.\n\nR to (3,6): (3,6) is free, as before.\n\nMove R to (3,6): from (2,6) to (3,6) right.\n\nCurrent direction U, moving R is allowed.\n\nAfter move, no food at (3,6), so tail moves off.\n\nPrevious positions: head (2,6), body (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), tail (4,6)\n\nMove to (3,6): new head (3,6), body: old head (2,6), old body1 (2,5), old body2 (3,5), and old body3 (4,5) as tail? Old tail (4,6) removed.\n\nPositions: index 0: (2,6), 1: (2,5), 2: (3,5), 3: (4,5), 4: (4,6) tail\n\nAfter move to (3,6) no food: new head (3,6), body: old head (2,6), old body1 (2,5), old body2 (3,5), old body3 (4,5) as tail. Old tail (4,6) removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)] tail at (4,5)\n\nHead at (3,6), direction R (since moved right).\n\nNow, from here, I can go to (1,1).\n\n(1,1) is at (1,1), so I need to go left and down.\n\nBut from (3,6), I can move D to (3,5) or L to (2,6), etc.\n\n(3,5) is now occupied by body? Positions: (3,6) head, (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) tail.\n\n(3,5) is the fourth segment, not tail, so occupied.\n\nMoves from (3,6):\n\n- U: (3,7) wall, invalid\n\n- D: (3,5) but (3,5) is body, occupied, collision\n\n- L: (2,6) but (2,6) is body, occupied\n\n- R: (4,6) but (4,6) is not in positions? Positions have (4,5) tail, not (4,6). (4,6) was removed earlier.\n\nIs (4,6) free? Not occupied, not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (5,6) is obstacle, but (4,6) not listed, so free.\n\nBut to move to (4,6) from (3,6), that's right.\n\nCurrent direction R, moving R is same, allowed.\n\nMove R to (4,6): (4,6) is free? But (5,6) is obstacle, (4,6) should be free.\n\nBut (4,6) might be under food or something, but no food there.\n\nSo move R to (4,6): no food, so new head (4,6), body: old head (3,6), old body1 (2,6), old body2 (2,5), old body3 (3,5), and tail old body4 (4,5)? \n\nPositions before: [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)] \n\nAfter move to (4,6) no food: new head (4,6), body: (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), tail (4,5)? Old tail (4,5) removed? \n\nSegments: old 0: (3,6) head, 1: (2,6), 2: (2,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (4,5) tail\n\nMove to (4,6): new head (4,6), then body: old head (3,6), old body1 (2,6), old body2 (2,5), old body3 (3,5) as tail. Old tail (4,5) removed.\n\nSo positions: [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5)] tail at (3,5)\n\nNow head at (4,6), direction R.\n\nBut (4,6) is near (5,6) which is obstacle, so limited moves.\n\nFrom (4,6), moves:\n\n- U: (4,7) wall\n\n- D: (4,5) but (4,5) is body? Positions have (4,5)? New positions: head (4,6), body (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5) tail. So (4,5) not occupied, but (3,5) is tail.\n\n(4,5) is free? Not in positions, not wall, not obstacle, so free.\n\nMove D to (4,5): from (4,6) to (4,5) down.\n\nCurrent direction R, moving D is not opposite, allowed.\n\nThen to (4,5), which is free, no food.\n\nBut this is getting messy, and I'm not closer to (1,1).\n\nTo go to (1,1), from the position after eating at (2,6), it might be better to have the snake oriented differently.\n\nEarlier, when I ate by moving U then L, positions were head (2,6), body (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), tail (4,6)\n\nHead at (2,6), direction L (since moved left to it).\n\nThen from (2,6), I can move D to (2,5) or L to (1,6) or R to (3,6)\n\nL to (1,6) as before, leads to death.\n\nD to (2,5): but (2,5) is body? Positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), tail (4,6). So (2,5) not occupied, free.\n\nMove D to (2,5): down, from direction L, moving D allowed.\n\nThen to (2,5), no food, so new head (2,5), body: old head (2,6), old body1 (3,6), old body2 (3,5), old body3 (4,5), tail (4,6)? Old tail (4,6) removed.\n\nPositions: new head (2,5), body (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5) tail.\n\nThen from there, I can move L to (1,5) but (1,5) is obstacle, or D to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, or R to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, or U to (2,6) body. So stuck again.\n\nR to (3,5) is occupied.\n\nOnly possible move might be U to (2,6) but occupied.\n\nFrom (2,5), adjacent cells: (2,6) body, (2,4) obstacle, (1,5) obstacle, (3,5) body. All occupied or blocked, so no move, death.\n\nSo both ways, after eating at (2,6), going to (1,6) or to (2,5) leads to problems because of obstacles.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I should not eat the food at (2,6) immediately, or find a different path.\n\nMaybe I can eat it later or not at all.\n\nBut it's positive food, so I should eat it if possible.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps I can move away first to create space.\n\nFor example, on turn 6, instead of going towards (2,6), I move D to (3,4).\n\nLet's try that.\n\nTurn 6: move D to (3,4)\n\nFrom (3,5) down to (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is free? Not snake, not wall, not obstacle. Obstacles: (3,2) but (3,4) free.\n\nNew positions: head (3,4), body (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) tail. (Old tail (3,6) removed)\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow, food at (2,6) still there.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, so cannot.\n\nMoves from (3,4):\n\n- U: to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, occupied, collision\n\n- D: to (3,3) - free? (3,3) not occupied, not wall, not obstacle (obstacle (3,2), but (3,3) free)\n\n- L: to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, invalid\n\n- R: to (4,4) but (4,4) obstacle, invalid\n\nSo only possible move is D to (3,3)\n\nMove D to (3,3), no food.\n\nNew positions: head (3,3), body (3,4), (3,5), (4,5) tail? Old tail (4,6) removed.\n\nPositions: after turn 6: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)] tail (4,6)? After move to (3,4), positions: head (3,4), body (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) tail.\n\nThen move D to (3,3): new head (3,3), body (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), tail (4,6) removed, so new tail (4,5)? Positions: new head (3,3), body old head (3,4), old body1 (3,5), old body2 (4,5) as tail.\n\nNow head at (3,3), direction D.\n\nFrom here, I can go to (3,2) but (3,2) is obstacle, or to (2,3) or (4,3), etc.\n\nBut (2,6) food is still there, but I'm far away, and life span decreases.\n\nTurn 6, life span 4, so at turn 7, life span 3, etc.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move L to (2,3) or R to (4,3) or U to (3,4) body or D to (3,2) obstacle.\n\nSo move L to (2,3) or R to (4,3).\n\nBut to reach (2,6), I need to go up and right, but there are obstacles.\n\nFor example, to go to (2,6) from (3,3), path might be (3,3) to (2,3), then to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, blocked. Or to (3,4) but occupied.\n\nFrom (3,3), move L to (2,3): free? (2,3) not occupied, not wall, not obstacle.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can move U to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, or D to (2,2), or L to (1,3), or R to (3,3) body.\n\nD to (2,2) or L to (1,3).\n\nBut (2,6) is at y=6, so I need to go up, but at x=2, y=4 is obstacle, so I cannot go directly up from x=2.\n\nI have to go around, but it's complicated, and food might expire.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is there.\n\nBut let's go back to the first approach.\n\nPerhaps when I eat at (2,6), I should not be at a position where I have to go to (1,6).\n\nIn the first move sequence, if I move U on turn 6 to (3,6), then on turn 7 move L to (2,6) to eat.\n\nAfter that, positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), tail (4,6)\n\nHead direction L.\n\nNow from (2,6), moves:\n\n- U: (2,7) wall\n\n- D: (2,5) - free? Not occupied, not obstacle.\n\n- L: (1,6) - free, but as before, leads to dead end\n\n- R: (3,6) - occupied by body\n\nSo possible: D to (2,5) or L to (1,6)\n\nL to (1,6) is bad, as before.\n\nD to (2,5): move down to (2,5)\n\nNo food, so new head (2,5), body: old head (2,6), old body1 (3,6), old body2 (3,5), old body3 (4,5), tail (4,6) removed, so new tail (4,5)? Positions: new head (2,5), body (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5) tail.\n\nThen from (2,5), moves:\n- U: (2,6) body\n- D: (2,4) obstacle\n- L: (1,5) obstacle\n- R: (3,5) body\n\nAll invalid, death.\n\nSo same problem.\n\nTherefore, eating the food at (2,6) might lead to a trap because of the obstacles at (1,5) and (2,4).\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating it, or find a way to eat it when the tail is not there, but it's there now.\n\nAnother idea: move away first to create space, then come back.\n\nFor example, on turn 6, move D to (3,4), then to (3,3), etc., but as before, it's hard to reach (2,6) in time.\n\nTurn 6, life span 4, so I have until turn 9 to eat it.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move L to (2,5) on turn 6, then from (2,5), instead of going to (2,6) immediately, I can go down to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, cannot.\n\nFrom (2,5), moves:\n- U: to (2,6) food\n- D: to (2,4) obstacle, invalid\n- L: to (1,5) obstacle, invalid\n- R: to (3,5) body, invalid\n\nSo only possible move is U to (2,6), or if I don't move there, but on turn 7 I have to move U.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nTherefore, if I go to (2,5), I must go to (2,6) next turn.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (3,6), I must go to (2,6) next turn or elsewhere, but other moves from (3,6) might be possible.\n\nFrom (3,6) after move U on turn 6, head at (3,6), I can move D to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, occupied, collision.\n\nMove U to (3,7) wall.\n\nMove L to (2,6) or R to (4,6)\n\nR to (4,6): (4,6) is free, as before.\n\nSo I could move R to (4,6) instead of to (2,6).\n\nThen no food eaten.\n\nBut then (2,6) food is still there.\n\nBut I can come back later.\n\nFor example, on turn 6, move U to (3,6)\n\nNew positions: head (3,6), body (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) tail.\n\nThen on turn 7, move R to (4,6) but (4,6) is tail? Currently tail is at (4,6), so moving to (4,6) is allowed, since it's tail.\n\nMove to (4,6): new head (4,6), body (3,6), (3,5), (4,5) tail? Old tail (4,6) removed, so new positions: head (4,6), body (3,6), (3,5), (4,5) tail.\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen from (4,6), I can move U wall, D to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, occupied, or L to (3,6) body, or R to (5,6) but (5,6) is obstacle.\n\n(5,6) is internal obstacle, so invalid.\n\nSo from (4,6), no possible moves, death.\n\nMove to (4,6) is bad.\n\nFrom (3,6), only possible moves are L to (2,6) or R to (4,6), but R to (4,6) leads to death, so only L to (2,6) is possible.\n\nTherefore, for (2,6) food, if I am adjacent, I have to eat it or risk not eating it, but not eating it might be better for survival.\n\nBut it's positive food, so I should eat it if possible, but in this case, after eating, I might die soon because of the obstacles.\n\nPerhaps I can eat it and then have a way out.\n\nAfter eating at (2,6), with positions head (2,6), body (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), tail (4,6)\n\nIf I can move to a cell that is not blocked.\n\nFrom (2,6), I can only move D to (2,5) or L to (1,6), both of which are problematic.\n\nL to (1,6) is dead end, D to (2,5) then stuck.\n\nUnless there is a way to move to (2,5) and then to (2,4), but (2,4) obstacle, so no.\n\nSo it seems impossible to escape after eating (2,6) with the current snake position.\n\nTherefore, it might be better to avoid this food and go for the other one at (1,1).\n\nBut (1,1) has obstacles nearby.\n\n(1,1) is at (1,1), and obstacles at (1,4), (1,5), so (1,2) and (1,3) might be free.\n\nFrom current position, I can move D to (3,4) on turn 6, then to (3,3), then to (2,3), etc., to go to (1,1).\n\nBut let's see if I can reach (1,1).\n\nFirst, on turn 6, move D to (3,4)\n\nPositions: head (3,4), body (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) tail.\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen on turn 7, only move D to (3,3) as before.\n\nMove to (3,3), no food.\n\nPositions: head (3,3), body (3,4), (3,5), (4,5) tail.\n\nDirection D.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move L to (2,3) or R to (4,3) or D to (3,2) obstacle or U to (3,4) body.\n\nSo move L to (2,3) or R to (4,3).\n\nSay move L to (2,3)\n\nNew positions: head (2,3), body (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) tail? Old tail (4,5) removed.\n\nPositions: new head (2,3), body (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) tail.\n\nDirection L.\n\nFrom (2,3), moves:\n- U: to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, invalid\n- D: to (2,2) - free? not occupied, not wall, not obstacle (obstacles at (2,4), (3,2), etc., (2,2) free)\n- L: to (1,3) - free? (1,3) not obstacle, not wall\n- R: to (3,3) body, invalid\n\nSo possible D to (2,2) or L to (1,3)\n\nTo go to (1,1), I can go to (1,3) then down.\n\nMove L to (1,3)\n\nNew positions: head (1,3), body (2,3), (3,3), (3,4) tail? Old tail (3,5) removed.\n\nPositions: new head (1,3), body (2,3), (3,3), (3,4) tail.\n\nDirection L.\n\nFrom (1,3), moves:\n- U: to (1,4) but (1,4) obstacle, invalid\n- D: to (1,2) - free? not occupied, not wall, not obstacle\n- L: to (0,3) wall, invalid\n- R: to (2,3) body, invalid\n\nSo only move D to (1,2)\n\nMove to (1,2), no food.\n\nNew positions: head (1,2), body (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) tail.\n\nDirection D? Moved down, so direction D.\n\nFrom (1,2), moves:\n- U: to (1,3) body, invalid\n- D: to (1,1) food! (1,1) has food, value 1, life span 8, so can eat.\n- L: to (0,2) wall\n- R: to (2,2) - free? not occupied\n\nSo move D to (1,1) to eat food.\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nPositions before move: head (1,2), body (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) tail.\n\nMove to (1,1) with food: new head (1,1), then body: old head (1,2), old body1 (1,3), old body2 (2,3), and old tail (3,3) remains, so positions: [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)] tail at (3,3)\n\nHead at (1,1), direction D.\n\nNow, from here, I need to find a way out, but there are obstacles at (1,4) and (1,5), so from (1,1), I can move R to (2,1) or U to (1,2) body, etc.\n\nMoves:\n- U: to (1,2) body, invalid\n- D: to (1,0) wall, invalid\n- L: to (0,1) wall, invalid\n- R: to (2,1) - free? not occupied, not wall, not obstacle (obstacles at (2,4), (3,2), etc., (2,1) free)\n\nSo only move R to (2,1)\n\nMove to (2,1), no food.\n\nNew positions: head (2,1), body (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) tail? Old tail (3,3) removed.\n\nPositions: new head (2,1), body (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) tail.\n\nDirection R.\n\nFrom (2,1), I can move U to (2,2), D to (2,0) wall, L to (1,1) body, R to (3,1)\n\nU to (2,2) or R to (3,1)\n\n(3,1) might be free, etc.\n\nBut at least I survived and ate one food.\n\nMeanwhile, the food at (2,6) might expire, but I ate (1,1) instead.\n\nIn this sequence, I avoided (2,6) and went for (1,1).\n\nBut on turn 6, when I moved D, I didn't eat (2,6), but it was possible to eat it earlier, but I chose not to for survival.\n\nIn the path to (1,1), I started from turn 6 move D.\n\nBut at turn 6, I have the option to go for (2,6) or not.\n\nSince going for (2,6) seems to lead to death, it's better to avoid it and go for (1,1).\n\nMoreover, (1,1) has longer life span.\n\nSo for turn 6, move D to (3,4)\n\nThen for turn 7, move D to (3,3)\n\nTurn 8, move L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 9, move L to (1,3)\n\nTurn 10, move D to (1,2)\n\nTurn 11, move D to (1,1) to eat.\n\nBut the food at (2,6) disappears after turn 9? Life span 4 at turn 6, so after turn 9 it disappears, so on turn 9 it can still be eaten if I go there, but in this path I'm at (1,3) on turn 9, not near (2,6).\n\nBut I can eat (1,1) on turn 11.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nThe answer format is to output from turn t1=6 for some turns.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I can output 5 moves or so.\n\nIn this case, for turn 6: D\n\nThen turn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: L (to (2,3))\n\nTurn 9: L (to (1,3))\n\nTurn 10: D (to (1,2))\n\nBut on turn 10, I move to (1,2), then on turn 11 to (1,1) to eat.\n\nBut I can include up to turn 10 or so.\n\nPerhaps I can have a shorter path to (1,1).\n\nFrom current position (3,5), instead of going down, I could go left to (2,5), but then I am forced to go to (2,6) and eat, which is bad.\n\nIf I go to (2,5) on turn 6, then on turn 7 I must go U to (2,6) to eat, then I am stuck.\n\nSo better not to go there.\n\nMove U to (3,6) on turn 6, then I must go L to (2,6) to eat on turn 7, then stuck.\n\nSo both ways to (2,6) lead to death after eating.\n\nTherefore, the safest is to go down to (3,4) and then to (1,1).\n\nTo save turns, from (3,5), move D to (3,4) on turn 6.\n\nThen from (3,4), only D to (3,3) on turn 7.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can move L to (2,3) on turn 8.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can move D to (2,2) or L to (1,3).\n\nIn the earlier path, I went L to (1,3), but from (2,3), move D to (2,2) on turn 9.\n\nThen from (2,2), move L to (1,2) or D to (2,1), etc.\n\nBut (1,1) is at (1,1), so from (2,2), move L to (1,2), then D to (1,1).\n\nOr directly if possible.\n\nFrom (2,3), move D to (2,2) on turn 9.\n\nThen turn 10, from (2,2), moves: U to (2,3) body, D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2) but (3,2) obstacle, so move D to (2,1) or L to (1,2).\n\nSay move L to (1,2) on turn 10.\n\nThen turn 11, move D to (1,1) to eat.\n\nSame as before.\n\nFrom (2,2), move D to (2,1) on turn 10, then turn 11 move L to (1,1), but (1,1) is not adjacent to (2,1)? (2,1) to (1,1) is left, adjacent.\n\n(2,1) to (1,1) is left.\n\nThen eat on turn 11.\n\nBut in terms of turns, similar.\n\nFor the response, I can output from turn 6 to turn 10 or 11.\n\nBut let's see the initial state.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,6) might be eaten if I can, but I think it's too risky.\n\nPerhaps there is a way to eat it and survive, but with the obstacles, it seems difficult.\n\nMaybe I can move in a way that after eating, the tail is not blocking.\n\nBut in this case, the area is tight.\n\nFor example, if before eating, I move the tail away, but the tail is at (3,6), and to move away, I need to go down or something, but from current position, I can only go U, D, L, and going U or L brings me closer to eating.\n\nI think it's not worth the risk.\n\nSo I'll go for the (1,1) food.\n\nThus, for turn 6, move D to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 7, move D to (3,3) (only choice)\n\nTurn 8, from (3,3), I can move L to (2,3) or R to (4,3)\n\nTo go to (1,1), better to move L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 9, from (2,3), move L to (1,3) or D to (2,2)\n\nMove L to (1,3) to get closer to x=1.\n\nTurn 10, from (1,3), move D to (1,2)\n\nThen turn 11, move D to (1,1) to eat.\n\nBut I need to output actions for turns.\n\nThe answer should start from turn 6 for multiple turns.\n\nSince \"think 5+ turns ahead\", output 5 moves: turn 6 to turn 10.\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: L (to (2,3))\n\nIn turn 8, from (3,3) to (2,3), direction L.\n\nThen turn 9: from (2,3) to (1,3), move L\n\nTurn 10: from (1,3) to (1,2), move D\n\nThen on turn 11, eat.\n\nBut for turn 9 and 10, it's fine.\n\nTo make it 5 turns, output turn 6 to 10.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: L\n\nTurn 9: L (to (1,3))\n\nTurn 10: D (to (1,2))\n\nThen implicitly, on turn 11, move D to (1,1) to eat.\n\nBut in the sequence, on turn 9, I move to (1,3), which is free.\n\nIn the state, (1,3) is not occupied, not wall, not obstacle, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) free.\n\nNow, about the food at (2,6): by turn 10, it has life span decreased to 0? Turn 6: life 4, turn 7:3, turn 8:2, turn 9:1, turn 10:0, so on turn 10, if life span 0, it might be gone, but countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 6, life 4, after turn 6, life 3, and so on, after turn 9, life 0, so on turn 10, it is not there.\n\nBut I didn't go for it anyway.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the actions should be to move down and left towards (1,1).\n\nFor the answer format.\n\nAlso, I need to specify the action for each turn.\n\nSo for turn 6: D (down)\n\nTurn 7: D (down)\n\nTurn 8: L (left)\n\nTurn 9: L (left to (1,3))\n\nTurn 10: D (down to (1,2))\n\nThen the snake can eat on turn 11.\n\nBut since the question is to output for multiple turns, this should be fine.\n\nTo think ahead, after eating (1,1), I need to find a way out, but that's beyond the 5 turns.\n\nFor now, this maximizes score by eating one food and surviving.\n\nIf I can eat both, but (2,6) is too risky, so better to avoid.\n\nSo I think this is the plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and simulated multiple turns ahead (5+ turns). The key considerations are:\n\n- **Food at (2,6)**: Positive food with life span 4 (available until turn 9). However, eating it immediately leads to a dead end due to obstacles at (1,5), (2,4), and the border, trapping the snake after eating. Thus, avoiding this food is safer.\n- **Food at (1,1)**: Positive food with life span 8 (available until turn 13), providing ample time. Moving toward it avoids immediate risks and allows eating it around turn 11.\n- **Snake movement constraints**: Current head direction is left (L), so reverse move (R) is not allowed on turn 6. The snake must avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions (except the tail cell, which is safe if the tail moves away).\n- **Grid analysis**: The playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6. Obstacles at (1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (3,2), (4,4), (5,1), (5,6), (6,3) block key paths. After evaluating paths, moving down (D) initially creates space and aligns with reaching (1,1) safely.\n- **Risk avoidance**: Eating (2,6) causes the snake to get stuck against obstacles or walls after 1-2 moves, leading to death. Prioritizing (1,1) ensures survival and a +1 score by turn 11. The sequence below navigates around obstacles and maintains safe distances from hazards.\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 6 to 10)\n- **Turn 6**: Move D (down) to (3,4). This avoids the risky (2,6) food and heads toward open space. Direction becomes D.  \n- **Turn 7**: Move D (down) to (3,3). Only safe move; avoids body and obstacles. Direction remains D.  \n- **Turn 8**: Move L (left) to (2,3). Progress toward (1,1) while evading obstacles. Direction becomes L.  \n- **Turn 9**: Move L (left) to (1,3). Positions snake for direct approach to (1,1). Direction remains L.  \n- **Turn 10**: Move D (down) to (1,2). Sets up eating (1,1) on turn 11. Direction becomes D.  \n\n**Outcome by turn 10**: Snake reaches (1,2) safely. On turn 11, moving D to (1,1) eats the positive food (+1 score, length increases to 5) with no immediate risks. The food at (2,6) expires after turn 9 (life span 4 at turn 6), so it is gone by turn 10. Survival is prioritized, and this path avoids all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 7: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 8: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 9: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 10: D (down)\n}",

        "step": 7,
        "score": 2,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. The current turn is t=7. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and walls are on the borders. Also, there are internal obstacles at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2). I should list all these to avoid moving into them.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (3,4), then body segments at (3,5), (4,5), (4,6). So the snake is 4 segments long. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning it's moving towards decreasing y, so from (3,5) to (3,4) since (3,5) to (3,4) is down.\n\nHead direction is given as D, and positions are head first: (3,4) is head, then (3,5), (4,5), (4,6). If head is at (3,4) and moving down, that means it came from above, so from (3,5) to (3,4) is down, yes. So current head is at (3,4), and it's moving down, so next move could be L, R, or D, but not U because of no instant reverse. Since it's moving down, it can't go up immediately, so possible moves are down, left, or right.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (2,6) with value 1, life span 3\n\n- (1,1) with value 1, life span 7\n\n- (1,3) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food has value +1, so all are positive food, no negative food here.\n\nLife span: for (2,6), life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns including current turn, so at turn 10 it might be gone? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 7, life span 3, so it will disappear after 3 more turns, meaning it lasts until turn 9, and gone at turn 10? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it is present for turns t to t+L-1, and gone at turn t+L. For example, at turn 7, life span 3 for (2,6), so it exists on turn 7, 8, 9, and disappears at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) life span 7, so exists until turn 7+7-1=13, gone at 14.\n\n(1,3) life span 10, exists until turn 7+10-1=16, gone at 17.\n\nBut we need to think only a few turns ahead for now.\n\nNow, I need to choose actions for multiple turns, starting from turn 7, and think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls on borders, so cells (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x. Also internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2).\n\nSnake: head (3,4), body (3,5), (4,5), (4,6). Tail is at (4,6).\n\nFood: (2,6), (1,1), (1,3)\n\n(2,6) is at x=2,y=6.\n\nNow, possible moves from current position (3,4) with direction D (down).\n\nSince moving down, cannot go up (U), so can go down (D), left (L), or right (R).\n\nDown to (3,3)\n\nLeft to (2,4)\n\nRight to (4,4)\n\nBut (4,4) is an internal obstacle! So cannot move right to (4,4), it's a wall.\n\nAlso, (2,4) is an internal obstacle, so cannot move left to (2,4).\n\n(2,4) is in the obstacles list: (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), etc. Yes, (2,4) is an obstacle.\n\nSo from (3,4), moving to:\n\n- Down: (3,3) - is this free? Let's check.\n\n(3,3) - not a border wall, since borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7. y=3 is not border. Not in obstacles: obstacles are (5,6),(1,4),(4,4),(2,4),(6,3),(5,1),(1,5),(3,2). (3,3) not listed, so should be free.\n\n- Left: (2,4) - but (2,4) is in obstacles, so cannot move there.\n\n- Right: (4,4) - (4,4) is in obstacles, cannot move.\n\n- Up: (3,5) - but (3,5) is the body segment, and since head direction is down, moving up is reverse, which is not allowed anyway, but even if, it's occupied by body.\n\nSo only possible move is down to (3,3)? Is that right?\n\n(3,5) is the second segment, so moving to (3,5) would be into the body, which is deadly.\n\nBut in terms of movement options, from (3,4), with head direction D, possible actions are D, L, R.\n\nL to (2,4) is obstacle, R to (4,4) is obstacle, so only D to (3,3) is possible? But (3,3) might be free.\n\nIs (3,3) occupied? Snake positions are (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), so (3,3) is not occupied, and not wall, so should be safe to move to.\n\nBut let's confirm the obstacles: internal obstacles include (3,2), but not (3,3), so (3,3) should be empty.\n\nAlso, walls: borders, but (3,3) is not border.\n\nSo at turn 7, only possible move is down to (3,3).\n\nIs that correct? Let's list all possible cells.\n\nCurrent head at (3,4).\n\nNeighbors:\n\n- Up: (3,5) - occupied by body, and also reverse direction, not allowed.\n\n- Down: (3,3) - not occupied, not wall, so free.\n\n- Left: (2,4) - obstacle, cannot move.\n\n- Right: (4,4) - obstacle, cannot move.\n\nSo indeed, only possible move is down to (3,3).\n\nBut that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check the obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)\n\nYes, (2,4) and (4,4) are obstacles.\n\nSnake: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) – so (3,5) and (4,5) are body, (4,6) is tail.\n\nFood at (2,6), which is near the tail (4,6), but not adjacent directly.\n\n(2,6) and (4,6) are not adjacent; (3,6) might be free or not.\n\nBut for now, at turn 7, only move is down to (3,3).\n\nThen, after moving down, snake will be at (3,3), then body follows: head to (3,3), so new positions: head (3,3), then previous head (3,4) becomes body, so (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), and tail (4,6) moves? When snake moves, the tail moves forward, so segments shift.\n\nWhen snake moves without eating, the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail is removed.\n\nStandard snake movement: if not eating, head moves to new cell, body segments follow, tail is left.\n\nSo from positions [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)], if head moves to (3,3), new positions: head (3,3), then (3,4) which was head now body, then (3,5) which was second now third, and (4,5) which was third now tail, so [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]. The (4,6) is no longer part of snake, it becomes empty.\n\n(4,6) is freed up.\n\nNow, food at (2,6) is still there, but not eaten.\n\nNow, turn 7 action: must be D.\n\nBut the answer should include multiple turns, starting from turn 7.\n\nThe prompt says: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"Answer Format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nSo for turn 7, action is D.\n\nThen for turn 8, we need to decide.\n\nBut let's think ahead.\n\nAfter move to (3,3), head at (3,3), direction is now down, since we moved down.\n\nHead direction: after moving, the direction is the direction we moved, I assume.\n\nIn the state, it's given, but after move, we set it.\n\nSo at turn 8, head at (3,3), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: cannot go up (reverse), so can go D, L, R.\n\nDown to (3,2) – but (3,2) is an internal obstacle! (3,2) is in the list.\n\nObstacles include (3,2), so cannot go down to (3,2).\n\nLeft to (2,3) – is this free? (2,3) not border, not in obstacles list. Obstacles: (5,6),(1,4),(4,4),(2,4),(6,3),(5,1),(1,5),(3,2). (2,3) not listed, so should be free.\n\nRight to (4,3) – not border, not in obstacles. (6,3) is obstacle, but (4,3) not listed, so free.\n\nUp to (3,4) – but (3,4) is now a body segment, and it would be reverse direction, not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: left to (2,3) or right to (4,3).\n\nNow, need to choose.\n\nAlso, food positions: (2,6) with life span 3 at turn 7, so at turn 8, life span 2? Life span decreases every turn.\n\nAt turn 7, life span for (2,6) is 3, so after turn 7, it decreases to 2 at turn 8? The countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nAt turn t, life span L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1.\n\nBut it exists as long as life span >0.\n\nAt turn 7, life span 3, so it exists.\n\nAfter turn 7, at turn 8, life span is 2, still exists.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) life span 7 at turn 7, at turn 8 life span 6.\n\n(1,3) life span 10 at turn 7, at turn 8 life span 9.\n\nNow, food at (2,6) is at y=6, x=2.\n\nSnake is now at positions: after turn 7 move, snake is at (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)\n\nHead at (3,3).\n\nTo reach (2,6), it's at (2,6), which is left and up, but we are at (3,3), so we need to go left and up.\n\nBut (2,6) might be eaten if we can get there.\n\nAlso, there is a danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills because of collision.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (4,5), and food is at (2,6), not on tail, so no issue.\n\n(2,6) is not adjacent to head or tail directly.\n\nHead at (3,3), tail at (4,5), distance.\n\nNow for turn 8, from (3,3), we can go left to (2,3) or right to (4,3).\n\nWe need to think which is better.\n\nAlso, the grid has obstacles, so we must avoid dead ends.\n\nLet's sketch a small grid.\n\nI'll make a text grid for reference.\n\nGrid rows y from 0 to 7, columns x from 0 to 7.\n\ny=0 bottom, y=7 top? In coordinates, (x,y), but in the problem, it doesn't specify, but typically in such games, (0,0) bottom left, but here walls y=0 and y=7, so y=0 and y=7 are walls.\n\nSimilarly x=0 and x=7 walls.\n\nBut for simplicity, I'll assume y increases up or down? In the snake positions, head at (3,4) to (3,5) is moving up? Positions: (3,4) head, then (3,5), which is same x, y+1, so if y increases up, then (3,5) is above (3,4), but head direction is D, down, which is decreasing y, so from (3,5) to (3,4) is down, meaning y decreases as we go down. So let's define: y=0 bottom, y=7 top, so moving up increases y, down decreases y.\n\nSimilarly, x from 0 left to 7 right.\n\nSo walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), (1,5), (3,2), (5,6), (6,3), (5,1)\n\n(1,4), (2,4), (4,4) are at y=4, x=1,2,4\n\n(1,5) at x=1,y=5\n\n(3,2) at x=3,y=2\n\n(5,6) x=5,y=6\n\n(6,3) x=6,y=3\n\n(5,1) x=5,y=1\n\nSnake at turn 7: head (3,4), body (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)\n\nAfter move D to (3,3), snake: head (3,3), body (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)  // tail at (4,5)\n\n(4,6) is gone.\n\nFood: (2,6), (1,1), (1,3)\n\n(2,6) at x=2,y=6\n\n(1,1) at x=1,y=1\n\n(1,3) at x=1,y=3\n\nAt turn 8, head at (3,3), direction D (since we moved down).\n\nPossible moves: L to (2,3), R to (4,3), or U to (3,4), but (3,4) is body, and reverse, not allowed. D to (3,2) is obstacle, not possible. So only L or R.\n\nNow, which one to choose.\n\nWe need to get to food or safe areas.\n\nAlso, (1,3) is food at y=3, x=1. But (1,3) is at x=1,y=3.\n\nFrom (3,3), if we go left to (2,3), then we are closer to (1,3).\n\nIf we go right to (4,3), we might go towards other areas.\n\nBut there is also (2,6) food with short life span.\n\nLife span of (2,6): at turn 8, life span 2 (since decreased from 3 at turn 7, to 2 at turn 8? Let's clarify life span decrease.\n\nAt turn t, food has life span L, it means it will disappear after L turns, so it exists for L more turns including current.\n\nAt turn 7, L=3, so exists at turn 7,8,9; gone at turn 10.\n\nAt turn 8, L=2, exists at turn 8,9; gone at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 9, L=1, exists only at turn 9; gone at turn 10.\n\nFor (2,6), we have until turn 9 to eat it.\n\nCurrently turn 8, we can eat it on turn 8 or 9.\n\nBut we are at (3,3), and (2,6) is at (2,6), which is 3 steps away: one left, then up, but up might not be direct.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (2,6): we need to go to x=2, y=6.\n\nCurrent y=3, need to increase y by 3, x decrease by 1.\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), if we go left to (2,3), then from (2,3), we can go up to (2,4), but (2,4) is obstacle! (2,4) is internal obstacle, so cannot go to (2,4).\n\nFrom (2,3), possible moves: up to (2,4) obstacle, down to (2,2) — is (2,2) free? Not border, not in obstacles, so free. Left to (1,3) — (1,3) is food, and free? (1,3) not obstacle, and not occupied by snake currently. Right to (3,3) but that's where we came from, and occupied now or later.\n\nAt turn 8, if we move to (2,3), head at (2,3), snake positions: head (2,3), then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), tail (4,5) removed? After move to (2,3), new positions: head (2,3), then previous head (3,3) becomes body, then (3,4), (3,5), and (4,5) is tail? Let's trace.\n\nBefore move at turn 8 start: snake positions [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]\n\nHead at (3,3).\n\nIf move left to (2,3), new head (2,3), then body segments: (3,3) becomes first body, (3,4) second body, (3,5) third body, and (4,5) is removed, so new snake: [(2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]\n\nTail at (3,5).\n\nNow, at (2,3), we can move to adjacent cells.\n\nPossible moves from (2,3): up to (2,4) obstacle, down to (2,2), left to (1,3), right to (3,3) but (3,3) is now body, so occupied, cannot move there.\n\nAlso, direction: we moved left, so head direction is L, so cannot move right (reverse).\n\nSo from (2,3), direction L, possible moves: left (L), down (D), up (U) but up to (2,4) obstacle, so only left to (1,3) or down to (2,2).\n\n(1,3) is food, so we can eat it if we move there.\n\nBut (1,3) has value +1, so we can eat it.\n\nIf we go to (1,3), we eat the food, snake grows.\n\nBut let's see if it's safe.\n\nFirst, from turn 8, if we go left to (2,3), then from there, we can go to (1,3) on next turn.\n\nBut we need to think multiple turns.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 8 we go right to (4,3) instead.\n\nFirst, let's consider the path to (2,6) food.\n\n(2,6) is at y=6, and we are at y=3, need to go up.\n\nBut at (2,4) is obstacle, so we cannot go directly up from (2,3) because (2,4) blocked.\n\nFrom (2,3), we can only go down to (2,2) or left to (1,3).\n\n(1,3) is food, so if we go to (1,3), we eat it.\n\nThen after eating, snake grows.\n\nBut let's see the life span of (2,6): it disappears after turn 9, so we need to eat it by turn 9.\n\nIf we go to (1,3) on turn 9, for example, we might not reach (2,6) in time.\n\nLet's plan.\n\nAt turn 8, from (3,3), choices: L to (2,3) or R to (4,3).\n\nIf L to (2,3), then at turn 9, from (2,3) we can go to (1,3) to eat food, or to (2,2).\n\nIf we go to (1,3) on turn 9, we eat (1,3), snake grows to length 5, new head (1,3), then body (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5).\n\nThen from (1,3), we can move to adjacent cells.\n\nBut (1,3) is at x=1,y=3, which is near border.\n\nx=1, y=3, walls at x=0, so left to (0,3) is wall, cannot move.\n\nUp to (1,4) but (1,4) is internal obstacle! (1,4) in obstacles, so cannot.\n\nDown to (1,2) — is (1,2) free? Not obstacle, not wall? y=2 not border, x=1 not border, not in obstacles list, so free.\n\nRight to (2,3) but (2,3) is body, occupied.\n\nAlso, direction: after moving to (1,3) from (2,3), we moved left, so direction L, so cannot move right.\n\nSo from (1,3), possible moves: down to (1,2) or up to (1,4) but (1,4) obstacle, so only down to (1,2).\n\nThen at (1,2), we can move down or left or right, but left to (0,2) wall, up to (1,3) body, so only down to (1,1) or right to (2,2)? (2,2) might be free.\n\n(1,1) is also food, with life span 7 at turn 7, so at turn 9, life span 5, still there.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nIf we eat (1,3) at turn 9, we are at (1,3), then only can go down to (1,2) on turn 10, then from (1,2) to (1,1) to eat another food, or to (2,2).\n\nBut (1,1) is food, so we can eat it.\n\nBut then we might be stuck in the bottom-left corner.\n\nMoreover, (2,6) food will be gone by turn 10, so we cannot reach it from there in time.\n\nFrom (3,3) at turn 8, if we go left to (2,3), and then to (1,3) on turn 9, we eat (1,3), but then we are far from (2,6) and cannot reach it by turn 9.\n\n(2,6) must be eaten by turn 9.\n\nAt turn 8, we are at (2,3) if we move left, then to (2,6) we need to go up, but (2,4) blocked, so no direct path.\n\nFrom (2,3), we can go down to (2,2), but that's away from (2,6).\n\nSo it seems impossible to reach (2,6) from left path in time.\n\nNow, the other option: at turn 8, from (3,3) go right to (4,3).\n\nThen head at (4,3), direction R (since we moved right).\n\nSnake positions: head (4,3), then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nNow, from (4,3), possible moves: since direction R, cannot move left (reverse), so can move R, U, D.\n\nRight to (5,3) — (5,3) is free? Not border, not in obstacles. Obstacles have (5,1), (5,6), (6,3), but (5,3) not listed, so free.\n\nUp to (4,4) — but (4,4) is obstacle, cannot.\n\nDown to (4,2) — (4,2) free? Not border, not obstacle, yes.\n\nSo possible: right to (5,3) or down to (4,2).\n\nNow, (2,6) is at top-left, we are at bottom-right? (4,3) is x=4,y=3.\n\nTo reach (2,6), we need to go left and up, but there are obstacles in between.\n\nFor example, from (4,3) to (4,4) blocked, (3,4) is body, not free.\n\nWe can go to (5,3) then to (5,4) or something.\n\nBut (5,4) is free? Let's see.\n\nFirst, at turn 8, if we go to (4,3), then at turn 9, from (4,3) we can go to (5,3) or (4,2).\n\n(2,6) must be eaten by turn 9.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (2,6): distance in x: 2 left, y: 3 up, but with obstacles, it's at least 3 or 4 moves, but we have only 2 turns: turn 8 and turn 9 to act, but eating on turn 9.\n\nAt turn 8, we are at (4,3), (2,6) is at (2,6), we need to be at (2,6) on turn 9 to eat it.\n\nBut from (4,3) to (2,6) in one move? Not possible, not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent cells: (2,6) neighbors are (2,5), (2,7), (1,6), (3,6).\n\n(2,7) is y=7 wall, cannot.\n\n(1,6) is free? x=1,y=6, not border, not in obstacles? Obstacles have (1,4),(1,5), but not (1,6), so (1,6) should be free.\n\n(3,6) free? Not listed.\n\n(2,5) free? Not listed.\n\nBut to be at (2,6) on turn 9, we need to be at a neighbor on turn 8.\n\nBut on turn 8, we are at (4,3) or (2,3) depending on choice, both not adjacent to (2,6).\n\nFrom (4,3), the closest we can be is, say, (3,6) or something, but not in one move.\n\nFor example, from (4,3) to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, occupied.\n\nTo (4,4) obstacle.\n\nTo (3,4) body.\n\nNo way to get closer in one move from (4,3).\n\nSimilarly, from (2,3), as before, to (2,4) obstacle, to (1,3) not adjacent to (2,6), etc.\n\n(2,6) neighbors: (2,5), (1,6), (3,6), (2,7 wall)\n\n(2,5) is free? Not obstacle, not wall.\n\n(1,6) free.\n\n(3,6) free.\n\nBut on turn 8, we are at (3,3) or (4,3), not adjacent to these.\n\nSo it is impossible to reach (2,6) by turn 9 to eat it, because we are too far and paths are blocked.\n\nFor example, from (3,3) at turn 8, if we could go to (3,4), but it's body and reverse, not possible.\n\nOr from (2,3) to (2,4) obstacle.\n\nNo short path.\n\nTherefore, we cannot eat (2,6) food; it will disappear without being eaten.\n\nSo we should ignore (2,6) and focus on other food and survival.\n\nNow, other food: (1,1) and (1,3), both with longer life span.\n\n(1,3) is closer.\n\nAt turn 8, from (3,3), we have two choices: left to (2,3) or right to (4,3).\n\nIf we go left to (2,3), then at turn 9, we can go to (1,3) to eat it, since (1,3) is adjacent and food.\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nIf we go right to (4,3), we might not get to food immediately.\n\nBut we need to think long-term survival.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nFirst, let's consider going left.\n\nTurn 7: move D to (3,3)  // we have to, as only choice\n\nThen turn 8: move L to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 9: from (2,3), move L to (1,3) to eat food.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so positions: before move, snake at [(2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)] for turn 9 start.\n\nMove to (1,3), eat food, so new head (1,3), and tail does not move, so new body: (1,3) head, then (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)  // length 5\n\nTail at (3,5)\n\nNow head at (1,3), direction L (since moved left from (2,3))\n\nPossible moves: cannot move right (reverse), so can move L, U, D.\n\nLeft to (0,3) - x=0 wall, cannot.\n\nUp to (1,4) - but (1,4) is internal obstacle, cannot.\n\nDown to (1,2) - free, as we thought.\n\nSo only possible move is down to (1,2).\n\nThen at turn 10, move to (1,2).\n\nNew positions: head (1,2), then (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), and tail (3,5) removed? After move without eating, tail moves.\n\nAt turn 10, move to (1,2), not eating food, so head to (1,2), body: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), and (3,5) removed, so snake: [(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4)]\n\nLength 5, same as before.\n\nHead at (1,2), direction D (down).\n\nNow possible moves: from (1,2), direction D, cannot move up (reverse), so can move D, L, R.\n\nLeft to (0,2) wall, cannot.\n\nRight to (2,2) - free? (2,2) not obstacle, yes.\n\nDown to (1,1) - (1,1) is food, and free.\n\nUp to (1,3) but (1,3) is body, occupied, and reverse not allowed.\n\nSo possible: down to (1,1) or right to (2,2).\n\n(1,1) is food, so we can eat it.\n\nIf we move down to (1,1), eat food, then snake grows to length 6.\n\nNew positions: head (1,1), then (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nNow at (1,1), direction D (down).\n\nPossible moves: cannot move up (reverse), so can move D, L, R.\n\nBut (1,1) is corner, x=1,y=1.\n\nLeft to (0,1) wall, cannot.\n\nDown to (1,0) y=0 wall, cannot.\n\nRight to (2,1) - free? Not obstacle, not wall, yes.\n\nUp to (1,2) body, occupied, not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move is right to (2,1).\n\nThen move to (2,1), not eating, so snake shifts: head (2,1), then (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), tail (3,4) removed? After move to (2,1), new positions: head (2,1), body (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), and (3,3) becomes body, (3,4) removed? Positions: before move, [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4)] length 6.\n\nMove to (2,1), not eating, so head to (2,1), then body segments: (1,1) becomes first body, (1,2) second, (1,3) third, (2,3) fourth, (3,3) fifth, and tail (3,4) removed, so snake: [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)]\n\nNow head at (2,1), direction R (right, since moved right from (1,1)).\n\nPossible moves: cannot move left (reverse), so can move R, U, D.\n\nRight to (3,1) - (3,1) free? Not obstacle, but (3,2) is obstacle? Obstacles have (3,2), but (3,1) not listed, so should be free.\n\nUp to (2,2) - free.\n\nDown to (2,0) y=0 wall, cannot.\n\nSo possible: right to (3,1) or up to (2,2).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut we are in a better position now, with two food eaten.\n\nHowever, we have internal obstacles, and we might get stuck later, but for now it seems ok.\n\nBut let's see the other choice: at turn 8, if we go right to (4,3) instead of left.\n\nThen at turn 8: move R to (4,3)\n\nSnake: head (4,3), then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 9: from (4,3), possible moves: R to (5,3), D to (4,2), U to (4,4) obstacle, so R or D.\n\nSay, go R to (5,3)\n\nThen head (5,3), snake: [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)]\n\nThen from (5,3), direction R, can move R, U, D.\n\nRight to (6,3) but (6,3) is obstacle! Internal obstacle (6,3), so cannot.\n\nUp to (5,4) - free? Not obstacle, yes.\n\nDown to (5,2) - free? (5,1) obstacle, but (5,2) not, so free.\n\nLeft to (4,3) body, not allowed.\n\nSo move U to (5,4) or D to (5,2).\n\nBut no food nearby except (1,3) which is far.\n\n(1,1) also far.\n\nSo we might not get food soon, and snake might starve or something, but since no negative food, only risk is collision.\n\nBut with no food, snake doesn't grow, but we need to eat to score.\n\nIn this case, by going right, we miss the opportunity to eat (1,3) quickly.\n\nWhereas by going left, we can eat (1,3) and then (1,1) soon.\n\nMoreover, (1,3) has life span 10, at turn 7, so plenty of time, but we can eat it early.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) life span 7, at turn 7, so at turn 10, life span 4, still there.\n\nIn the left path, we eat (1,3) on turn 9 and (1,1) on turn 10 or 11.\n\nIn the right path, we might not reach them soon.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nThere is also the issue of the tail reward danger, but here no food on tail.\n\nAnother thing: food can spawn under body, but in this case, no food under snake.\n\nNow, back to turn 8 decision.\n\nIf we go left, we can eat (1,3) on turn 9.\n\nIf we go right, we might go to areas with no food, and (1,3) might be eaten later, but we can still get it, but it takes more turns.\n\nSince we need to maximize score, eating sooner is better, and we have two food in the left area.\n\nMoreover, going right might lead to dead ends.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), if we go up to (5,4), then we can move around, but there is obstacle at (5,6), etc.\n\nBut it might be possible to survive longer, but with no immediate food, score doesn't increase.\n\nWhereas left path, we get +1 soon.\n\nAlso, thinking 5 turns ahead: from turn 7 to turn 12.\n\nTurn 7: move D to (3,3)\n\nTurn 8: if L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 9: L to (1,3) eat food, grow to length 5\n\nThen turn 10: only D to (1,2) as above\n\nTurn 11: from (1,2), we can go to (1,1) to eat or to (2,2)\n\nIf we go to (1,1) to eat on turn 11.\n\nAt turn 10, after moving to (1,2), snake: [(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4)]  // since after turn 9, we had [(1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)? Earlier I think I confused.\n\nAfter turn 9: snake after eating (1,3): positions [(1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]? No.\n\nAt turn 9 start: before move, snake at [(2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]  // since after turn 8 move to (2,3), positions: head (2,3), body (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nThen move to (1,3), eat food, so new head (1,3), and since eating, tail does not move, so body: (1,3) head, (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)  // length 5, tail (3,5)\n\nThen turn 10: move to (1,2), not eating, so head to (1,2), body: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), and tail (3,5) removed, so positions: [(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4)]\n\nTurn 11: head at (1,2), direction D (down from (1,3) to (1,2))\n\nPossible moves: as before, down to (1,1) or right to (2,2)\n\n(1,1) is food, so move down to (1,1) to eat.\n\nThen grow to length 6: head (1,1), body (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nThen turn 12: from (1,1), only move right to (2,1), as before.\n\nThen continue.\n\nIf at turn 11 from (1,2) we go right to (2,2) instead, then not eat, but we can eat (1,1) later, but it's better to eat now to score.\n\nBut (1,1) will be there for a while.\n\nBut since it's positive, eat when possible.\n\nNow, if at turn 8 we went right to (4,3), then:\n\nTurn 8: R to (4,3), snake: [(4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]\n\nTurn 9: from (4,3), go R to (5,3), for example, snake: [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)]\n\nThen turn 10: from (5,3), go U to (5,4) or D to (5,2)\n\nSay U to (5,4), snake: [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)]\n\nThen turn 11: from (5,4), possible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3) body, not allowed, L to (4,4) obstacle, cannot, R to (6,4) but (6,4) free? Not border, not obstacle, obstacles have (6,3), but (6,4) not listed, so free.\n\nDirection from moving to (5,4) from (5,3), we moved up, so direction U.\n\nCannot move D (reverse), so can move U, L, R.\n\nU to (5,5), free.\n\nL to (4,4) obstacle, cannot.\n\nR to (6,4), free.\n\nSo move U to (5,5) or R to (6,4).\n\nBut no food nearby, so no score increase.\n\nWhereas in left path, we get two food by turn 11.\n\nAlso, in left path, after eating (1,1), we can move to (2,1), then to (3,1), etc., and the grid has space.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), we can go to (3,1) or (2,2), and so on.\n\nThere is also (1,3) but we already ate it.\n\nOther food might spawn later, but not in this state.\n\nIn this state, only three food given, and (2,6) will disappear.\n\nSo to maximize score, we should go for the food we can eat.\n\nTherefore, better to go left at turn 8.\n\nMoreover, for survival, going left might be safer in short term, as we are moving to open area.\n\nIn the right path, we might hit obstacles, like (6,3) or (5,6).\n\nFor example, if we go to (5,4), then (5,5), then (5,6) is obstacle, so cannot go up further.\n\nThen need to go left or right.\n\nBut it could be ok, but slower scoring.\n\nTherefore, I think going left at turn 8 is better.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe prompt says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"prioritize long-term survival\", but in this case, both paths might survive, but left path scores earlier.\n\nAlso, we need to output actions starting from turn 7.\n\nTurn 7: D (only choice)\n\nThen turn 8: L (to go towards food)\n\nTurn 9: L to (1,3) to eat\n\nThen turn 10: D to (1,2)\n\nThen turn 11: D to (1,1) to eat\n\nThen turn 12: R to (2,1)\n\nBut we need to specify only actions, not positions.\n\nAnd for 5+ turns, so from turn 7 to turn 12 is 6 turns.\n\nBut we can do more if needed, but I think 5 turns from now.\n\nTurn 7 to turn 11 is 5 turns: t7, t8, t9, t10, t11.\n\nt7 to t11 inclusive is 5 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, we can list for as many as we think.\n\nBut since the state might change, but here no new food, so we can plan.\n\nIn turn 11, we eat (1,1), but at that point, we might have other options.\n\nBut for now, let's outline.\n\nAlso, at turn 10, from (1,2), we have choice to go to (1,1) or (2,2), but (1,1) is food, so we should go there to eat.\n\nSimilarly, earlier.\n\nNow, another thing: when we eat (1,3) at turn 9, we are at (1,3), and only can go down to (1,2), which is fine.\n\nThen to (1,1).\n\nNow, after that, at (1,1), we go to (2,1), then from (2,1), as before.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: L\n\nTurn 9: L (to eat (1,3))\n\nTurn 10: D (to (1,2))\n\nNow at turn 11, from (1,2), direction D, we can go D to (1,1) or R to (2,2)\n\n(1,1) is food, so go D to eat.\n\nTurn 11: D to (1,1)\n\nThen at turn 12, from (1,1), direction D, only possible move R to (2,1), since left and down walls, up body.\n\nTurn 12: R\n\nThen turn 13, from (2,1), direction R, can go R to (3,1), U to (2,2), D to (2,0) wall cannot, so R or U.\n\nWe can go to (3,1) or (2,2).\n\nBut not critical.\n\nFor the answer, since we need to think ahead, but output actions for current and future turns.\n\nBut the state might change, but here no new information, so we can plan multiple turns.\n\nTo be precise, let's output for turns 7 to 11, for example.\n\nBut turn 11 we eat (1,1), which is good.\n\nNow, what about the tail reward danger? In this case, no issue.\n\nAnother point: when we move to (1,2) at turn 10, (1,1) is food, and head is adjacent to (1,1), but we move to it to eat, so it should be fine, as long as after eating, the new tail doesn't cause collision.\n\nWhen we eat at (1,1), head moves to (1,1), and since we eat, tail doesn't move, so the segment that was tail stays, but in this case, when we eat at (1,1), the snake grows, so the new tail is the one that was second last or something.\n\nFor example, when we eat at (1,1), positions before: head at (1,2), body (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nMove to (1,1), eat, so new head (1,1), body: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4)  // tail at (3,4)\n\nNow, head at (1,1), no collision with body, since body are (1,2), (1,3), etc., not adjacent except (1,2), but (1,2) is adjacent, but it's not collision because when we move, the body moves after, but in terms of position, after move, head is at (1,1), body at (1,2), which is adjacent, but in snake, head and body can be adjacent, collision only if head moves into a body cell, but after move, head is at new position, and body follows, so if the new head position was occupied, it would be collision, but here (1,1) was free before move, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, after eating, positions are fine.\n\nThen when we move to (2,1), it was free.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the action sequence should be:\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: L\n\nTurn 9: L\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: D  // to eat (1,1)\n\nBut turn 11 D from (1,2) to (1,1)\n\nYes.\n\nTo think 5 turns ahead, from turn 7 to 11.\n\nTurn 7,8,9,10,11: five actions.\n\nWe could add turn 12: R to (2,1)\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nNow, in the beginning, we have to move D at turn 7, no choice.\n\nThen at turn 8, we chose L to go for food.\n\nIf we go R, it might be worse.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of actions considering the current state and potential future states up to turn 12. The key priorities are:\n- **Avoid risks**: The snake must not collide with walls, obstacles, or its own body. Given the constraints, the only safe move at turn 7 is down (D) to (3,3), as left and right are blocked by obstacles, and up is a reverse move into the body.\n- **Eat positive food**: The food at (1,3) and (1,1) are reachable with high life spans (10 and 7 at turn 7, respectively), while (2,6) is unreachable within its life span (disappears after turn 9) due to obstacles and distance. Thus, the plan targets (1,3) and (1,1) for +2 score.\n- **Long-term survival**: After eating, the snake moves to open areas to avoid dead ends. The sequence avoids the bottom-left corner after eating by moving right toward the center.\n\n### Analysis of Key Points\n- **Turn 7 (current)**: Only possible move is down (D) to (3,3) to avoid immediate death. Left and right are blocked by obstacles at (2,4) and (4,4); up is invalid reverse into body.\n- **Food accessibility**:\n  - (2,6): Life span 3 at turn 7, disappears after turn 9. It is 3 cells away (e.g., via (3,4) → (3,5) → (3,6) → (2,6)), but (3,5) is body and (3,6) is unreachable directly due to obstacles. Path is blocked, so it cannot be eaten safely.\n  - (1,3): Life span 10 at turn 7, reachable by turn 9 via (3,3) → (2,3) → (1,3).\n  - (1,1): Life span 7 at turn 7, reachable by turn 11 via (1,3) → (1,2) → (1,1).\n- **Collision risks**: No food is under the snake or tail, so \"tail reward danger\" does not apply. After eating, movements avoid body collisions by ensuring target cells are free.\n- **5+ turn plan**: The sequence below eats (1,3) on turn 9 (+1 score) and (1,1) on turn 11 (+1 score), growing to length 6. By turn 12, the snake moves right to (2,1) to access open space for future survival.\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 7 to 12)\n- **Turn 7**: D (down) – Only safe move; to (3,3).  \n- **Turn 8**: L (left) – To (2,3); positions snake toward (1,3) food.  \n- **Turn 9**: L (left) – To (1,3); eat positive food (+1), snake grows to length 5.  \n- **Turn 10**: D (down) – To (1,2); only safe move (up to (1,4) is obstacle, left to (0,2) is wall, right to (2,2) is possible but delays food).  \n- **Turn 11**: D (down) – To (1,1); eat positive food (+1), snake grows to length 6.  \n- **Turn 12**: R (right) – To (2,1); escape bottom-left corner for long-term mobility (e.g., to (3,1) or (2,2) next).\n\n### Rationale for 5+ Turn Lookahead\n- **Turns 7-9**: Ensures survival and reaches (1,3) efficiently. Moving right at turn 8 would lead to (4,3) with no food access, wasting turns.\n- **Turns 10-12**: After eating (1,3), moving down to (1,2) and then to (1,1) scores again. Turning right at turn 12 avoids trapping the snake in the corner (only (2,1) is safe from (1,1)).\n- **Beyond turn 12**: The snake can move to (3,1), (2,2), or other open cells, with no immediate threats. This maintains options for future food spawns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn 7: D} } \n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn 8: L} } \n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn 9: L} } \n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn 10: D} } \n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn 11: D} } \n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn 12: R} }",
