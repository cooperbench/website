There's an internal obstacle at (3, 6).\n2. **Snake**: Currently, the snake is just a single segment at (3, 3), moving left (\"L\").\n3. **Food**: There are three food items:\n   - (3, 5): value = 1, life_span = 10\n   - (6, 6): value = 1, life_span = 10\n   - (2, 3): value = 1, life_span = 10\n\n### Possible Actions\n\nSince the snake is moving left (\"L\"), the possible actions are:\n- **Continue Left (L)**: Move to (2, 3)\n- **Turn Up (U)**: Move to (3, 4)\n- **Turn Down (D)**: Move to (3, 2)\n\nNote: Turning right (\"R\") would be the opposite of the current direction (\"L\"), which is not allowed.\n\n### Evaluating Each Action\n\n#### 1. Continue Left (L) to (2, 3)\n- **New Head Position**: (2, 3)\n- **Food Check**: There's a food at (2, 3). \n  - **Value**: +1 (positive food)\n  - **Length Increase**: Snake length becomes 2.\n  - **Tail Position**: Since the snake was length 1, after eating, the tail would remain at (3, 3) (but the snake grows, so the new body would be [(2, 3), (3, 3)].\n  - **Tail Reward Danger**: Not applicable here since the snake was length 1 before eating.\n- **Collision Check**: No walls or obstacles at (2, 3).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, and we gain +1 score.\n\n#### 2. Turn Up (U) to (3, 4)\n- **New Head Position**: (3, 4)\n- **Food Check**: No food here.\n- **Collision Check**: No walls or obstacles at (3, 4).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Turn Down (D) to (3, 2)\n- **New Head Position**: (3, 2)\n- **Food Check**: No food here.\n- **Collision Check**: No walls or obstacles at (3, 2).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n### Comparing Options\n\n- **Left (L)**: Immediate reward (+1), safe.\n- **Up (U)**: No reward, safe.\n- **Down (D)**: No reward, safe.\n\nSince the goal is to maximize the score, moving left to (2, 3) is the best option as it allows the snake to eat the positive food there.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Not applicable here because the snake is length 1. After eating, the tail is at (3, 3), and the head is at (2, 3). They are adjacent, but since the tail moves away in the next step, there's no immediate collision risk.\n  \n### Verifying the Move\n\n- **Current State**: Snake at [(3, 3)], moving left.\n- **Action**: Move left to (2, 3).\n- **After Move**: \n  - Snake grows to [(2, 3), (3, 3)].\n  - The food at (2, 3) is eaten.\n  - The other foods remain.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move left to eat the positive food at (2, 3).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

To reach it:\n1. **First Move**: Up to (2,4).\n   - This sets the direction towards the food.\n   - From (2,4), the next move can be right to (3,4).\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Not applicable here since none of the food is under the tail.\n- **Obstacle at (3,6)**: Not directly in the path to (3,5), but needs consideration if the snake goes further up.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move **Up (U)** to (2,4), as it's a safe move and the first step towards the nearest food at (3,5).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Moving Up (U) → (2,5). Then, next move could be Right (R) → (3,5).\n   - But, need to ensure the tail doesn't cause a collision.\n   - Current tail is at (2,3). After moving Up, the tail moves to (2,4).\n   - Next move Right → (3,5). The new tail would be at (2,4).\n   - No collision since the head is at (3,5) and tail at (2,4).\n\n2. **(6,4)**:\n   - Current head at (2,4). Moving Right (R) → (3,4).\n   - Next moves could be Right → (4,4), (5,4), (6,4).\n   - But, the snake would be longer by then, and we need to ensure no body collisions.\n\n### Risk Assessment\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: The only food adjacent to the tail is if the tail has food. Currently, the tail is at (2,3), and there's no food there. So, no immediate danger.\n- **Food Under Body**: No food is under the snake's body right now.\n\n### Decision Making\n\n- **Option 1**: Move Up → (2,5). Safe but no immediate reward. Sets up for a right move to (3,5) next turn.\n- **Option 2**: Move Left → (1,4). Safe but no reward and moves away from food.\n- **Option 3**: Move Right → (3,4). Safe and moves towards food (3,5) and (6,4).\n\n**Best Immediate Action**: Move Right (R) to (3,4). It's safe and positions the snake closer to two food items.\n\n### Verification\n\n- **After Moving Right**: \n  - New head position: (3,4).\n  - Tail moves to (2,4).\n  - Next turn, possible moves from (3,4):\n    - Up (U) → (3,5) → food available.\n    - Right (R) → (4,4) → towards (6,4).\n    - Down (D) → (3,3) → safe but no food.\n    - Left (L) → (2,4) → but tail is at (2,4) now. However, since the tail moves, it's safe.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMoving Right (R) is the optimal choice as it's safe and positions the snake to potentially eat food in the next moves.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 3 \\)\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n   - Internal obstacle: (3, 6)\n3. **Snake Positions**: \n   - Head at (3, 4)\n   - Next segment at (2, 4)\n   - So, the snake is two segments long: head at (3,4) and tail at (2,4)\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Right (R)\n5. **Food Items**:\n   - (3, 5): value=1, life_span=7\n   - (6, 6): value=1, life_span=7\n   - (6, 4): value=1, life_span=8\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3,4) and direction R, the possible moves are U, D, L, R. But we have to consider:\n\n- **No instant reverse**: Current direction is R, so cannot move L (left) next.\n  \nSo, possible moves: U, D, R\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Move Right (R)**: (3,4) → (4,4)\n   - Check if (4,4) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=4 is not 0 or 7, y=4 is not 0 or 7.\n     - Not an internal obstacle: (3,6) is not (4,4).\n     - Not colliding with body: body is at (2,4), (3,4) → moving to (4,4), tail moves from (2,4) to (3,4), so no collision.\n   - Food at (4,4)? No, food is at (3,5), (6,6), (6,4).\n   - So, safe move, no food eaten.\n\n2. **Move Up (U)**: (3,4) → (3,5)\n   - Check (3,5):\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not an obstacle.\n     - Body: tail is at (2,4), moving to (3,4), so head at (3,5) doesn't collide.\n   - Food at (3,5): yes, value=1, positive food.\n     - Eating it: length increases by 1, new segment added where tail was.\n     - Check \"Tail Reward Danger\": \n       - Current tail is at (2,4), adjacent to head (3,4) is (2,4), (3,3), (3,5), (4,4).\n       - After eating, new tail is where old tail was (2,4), but head moves to (3,5), so new body is [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)].\n       - Next move, tail moves from (2,4) to (3,4), head moves somewhere.\n       - Is head adjacent to tail after eating? Tail is at (2,4), head at (3,5): adjacent (since (2,4) and (3,5) are diagonally adjacent, but in Snake, adjacency is usually up/down/left/right, not diagonal. So not directly adjacent.\n       - Wait, the rule says: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\"\n       - Here, tail is at (2,4), food is at (3,5), which is where head is moving to. The tail cell is (2,4), which does not have food (food is at (3,5)), so no danger.\n     - So, safe to eat.\n   - This seems like a good move: get +1 score, grow length.\n\n3. **Move Down (D)**: (3,4) → (3,3)\n   - Check (3,3):\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not an obstacle.\n     - Body: tail is at (2,4), moving to (3,4), so head at (3,3) doesn't collide.\n   - Food at (3,3)? No.\n   - Safe move, no food.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nLooking at the food positions:\n\n1. (3,5): value=1, life_span=7 (from turn 3, so disappears at turn 10)\n   - Currently at turn 3, so 7 turns left.\n   - Distance from head (3,4): Manhattan distance = |3-3| + |5-4| = 1 (adjacent)\n2. (6,6): value=1, life_span=7 (disappears at turn 10)\n   - Distance: |6-3| + |6-4| = 3 + 2 = 5\n3. (6,4): value=1, life_span=8 (disappears at turn 11)\n   - Distance: |6-3| + |4-4| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\nClosest is (3,5), distance 1, can be eaten immediately by moving U.\n\nOther foods are further away and not immediately accessible without risking running into walls or obstacles later.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\nMoving U to (3,5):\n\n- After eating, snake becomes [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)].\n- Next move options from (3,5), direction U:\n  - Cannot reverse to D (from U), so can go U, L, R.\n  - U: (3,6) - but (3,6) is an internal obstacle! So cannot go U next.\n  - L: (2,5) - need to check if that's safe next turn.\n  - R: (4,5) - seems safe.\n- So, after eating, next move is constrained (cannot go U), but not immediately deadly.\n\nAlternative is not to eat now, but then the food at (3,5) is the closest and most immediate reward.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that:\n\n- Moving U eats positive food safely (no tail reward danger).\n- Other moves don't eat food.\n- Not eating now might mean missing the closest food, and other foods are further away with potential risks in reaching them.\n\nBest immediate action is to move Up to eat the food at (3,5).\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn (t₀):** 4\n\n**Walls:**\n- **Border Cells:** x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. This means the grid is 8x8 (from (0,0) to (7,7)), and the snake cannot move outside these bounds.\n- **Internal Obstacles:** [(3, 6)]. There's a wall at (3,6), so the snake can't move there.\n\n**Snake Positions:**\n- Head: (3, 5)\n- Body: [(3, 4), (2, 4)]\n  \nSo, the snake's body is:\n- Head at (3,5)\n- Next segment at (3,4)\n- Tail at (2,4)\n\n**Snake Head Direction:** U (Up, which is increasing y-coordinate)\n\n**Food:**\n1. (6, 6), value=1, life_span=6\n2. (6, 4), value=1, life_span=7\n3. (3, 2), value=1, life_span=10\n\nAll food is positive (+1), and none is negative in this case.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3,5) and direction U (Up), the possible moves are U, L, R (can't go D because that would be opposite to current direction U, which is not allowed).\n\nLet's explore each:\n\n1. **Up (U):** (3,5) → (3,6)\n   - Check for walls: (3,6) is an internal obstacle (wall). Can't move there.\n   - So, U is invalid.\n\n2. **Left (L):** (3,5) → (2,5)\n   - Check for walls: (2,5) is not listed as a wall.\n   - Check for body collision: Snake body is at (3,4), (2,4). (2,5) is not in the body.\n   - Valid move.\n\n3. **Right (R):** (3,5) → (4,5)\n   - Check for walls: (4,5) is not listed as a wall.\n   - Check for body collision: (4,5) is not in the body.\n   - Valid move.\n\nSo, possible valid moves: L or R.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving L or R gets us closer to any food.\n\n**Food Positions:**\n1. (6,6)\n2. (6,4)\n3. (3,2)\n\nCurrent head: (3,5)\n\n- Moving L to (2,5):\n  - Distance to (6,6): |6-2| + |6-5| = 4 + 1 = 5\n  - Distance to (6,4): |6-2| + |4-5| = 4 + 1 = 5\n  - Distance to (3,2): |3-2| + |2-5| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- Moving R to (4,5):\n  - Distance to (6,6): |6-4| + |6-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n  - Distance to (6,4): |6-4| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3\n  - Distance to (3,2): |3-4| + |2-5| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nMoving R seems better as it reduces the distance to two foods (6,6) and (6,4) from 5 to 3, while moving L doesn't help as much.\n\nBut let's think about the path after moving R to (4,5). From there, the next move could be U, D, or R (can't go L opposite to R if we just moved R).\n\nSimilarly, moving L to (2,5), next moves could be U, D, or L.\n\nBut since we're only deciding the immediate action, and R seems to bring us closer to two foods, let's check if moving R is safe in terms of future moves.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nOne special rule is \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nOur tail is at (2,4). Is the head adjacent to the tail? Head is at (3,5), tail at (2,4). Adjacent means one coordinate differs by 1 and the other is same or vice versa.\n\nDistance: |3-2|=1, |5-4|=1 → total 2, not adjacent (adjacent would be total distance 1, like (3,5) and (3,4) or (2,5)).\n\nSo no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Checking for Food Under Snake\n\nIs any food under the snake's body? Food positions are (6,6), (6,4), (3,2). Snake body is at (3,4), (2,4). No food is under the body currently.\n\n### Life Span of Food\n\nAll foods have life spans: 6,7,10. Current turn is 4, so:\n\n1. (6,6): disappears at turn 4 + 6 = 10\n2. (6,4): disappears at turn 4 + 7 = 11\n3. (3,2): disappears at turn 4 + 10 = 14\n\nAll are safe for now in terms of disappearing.\n\n### Deciding Between L and R\n\nBoth L and R are safe immediate moves. R brings us closer to two foods, while L brings us slightly closer to one food (3,2), but moving towards (3,2) might not be optimal as it's further down.\n\nAlternatively, moving R to (4,5) opens up paths towards (6,6) and (6,4). From (4,5), next move could be R to (5,5), then R to (6,5), then U to (6,6) or D to (6,4).\n\nMoving L to (2,5) would take us away from most food, except (3,2), which is not the closest.\n\n### Potential Path After R\n\nAfter R to (4,5):\n\nNext move options from (4,5), direction R:\n- Can't go L (opposite to R)\n- Can go U, D, R\n\nTo reach (6,6):\n- R to (5,5), then R to (6,5), then U to (6,6)\n  \nTo reach (6,4):\n- R to (5,5), then R to (6,5), then D to (6,4)\n  \nBoth seem reachable in a few moves.\n\n### Potential Path After L\n\nAfter L to (2,5):\n\nNext move options from (2,5), direction L:\n- Can't go R\n- Can go U, D, L\n\nTo reach (3,2):\n- D to (2,4) - but (2,4) is the tail, which will move, but need to ensure no collision.\n  \nThis seems less straightforward and not leading to immediate food.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMoving R to (4,5) seems the better immediate action as it positions the snake closer to two pieces of food without any immediate risks. Moving L doesn't offer a clear advantage and takes us away from most food.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 5  \n**Grid Size**: Based on the walls, it's an 8x8 grid (x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7).  \n**Walls**:  \n- Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.  \n- Internal Obstacle: (3, 6) is a wall.  \n\n**Snake**:  \n- Positions: Head at (4, 5), then (3, 5), then (3, 4).  \n- Current Direction: Right (R).  \n\n**Food**:  \n1. (6, 6): value = +1, life_span = 5  \n2. (6, 4): value = +1, life_span = 6  \n3. (3, 2): value = +1, life_span = 9  \n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me sketch the snake's position to understand better:\n\n- Head: (4,5)  \n- Body: (3,5)  \n- Tail: (3,4)  \n\nCurrent direction is Right (R), meaning the snake was moving to the right to reach (4,5) from (3,5).\n\nPossible next moves from (4,5) without reversing (can't go Left since that's opposite of Right):\n\n- Up (U): (4,6)  \n- Down (D): (4,4)  \n- Right (R): (5,5)  \n\nLeft is not allowed because it would reverse the direction from Right to Left instantly.\n\n### Checking Possible Moves\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Right (R) to (5,5)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=7 is a wall, but (5,5) is not a wall.\n     - Body: Snake body is at (3,5) and (3,4). (5,5) is not in the body.\n   - Check for food:\n     - No food at (5,5).\n   - After moving, the new snake positions would be: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] (tail (3,4) is dropped).\n   - Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n2. **Up (U) to (4,6)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=7 is a wall, (4,6) is not a wall.\n     - Internal obstacle: (3,6) is a wall, but (4,6) is not.\n     - Body: (4,6) is not in the body.\n   - Check for food:\n     - No food at (4,6).\n   - After moving: [(4,6), (4,5), (3,5)].\n   - Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n3. **Down (D) to (4,4)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=0 is a wall, (4,4) is not.\n     - Body: (4,4) is not in the body.\n   - Check for food:\n     - No food at (4,4).\n   - After moving: [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5)].\n   - Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see where the food is and if any is reachable soon:\n\n1. (6,6): To reach this, from (4,5), possible path: Right to (5,5), then Right to (6,5), then Up to (6,6). But life_span is 5, current turn is 5, so it disappears after this turn (countdown decreases to 4 this turn, then next turn it's 3, etc., but since it's at 5 now, it disappears after turn 5+5=10, but current is 5, so it's present until turn 10? Wait, the countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 5, life_span is 5, next turn it's 4, etc., so it disappears after turn 9 (since at turn 10 it would be 0). So it's still there for a few turns.\n\nBut to reach (6,6), it would take at least 3 moves (R, R, U), and it's not immediately accessible.\n\n2. (6,4): Similar, to reach (6,4), path could be R to (5,5), then R to (6,5), then D to (6,4). Also not immediate.\n\n3. (3,2): From (4,5), to reach (3,2), path could be D to (4,4), then L to (3,4), then D to (3,3), then D to (3,2). Not immediate.\n\nNone of the food is immediately reachable in the next move.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food on the tail?\n\nTail is at (3,4). Adjacent cells to head (4,5) are:\n- (3,5) - body\n- (5,5)\n- (4,6)\n- (4,4)\n\nTail is at (3,4), which is not adjacent to head (4,5). Adjacent would be (3,5), (5,5), (4,6), (4,4). So no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Potential Future Moves\n\nSince no food is immediately accessible, let's think about positioning for future food:\n\n- Moving Right (R) to (5,5) gets us closer to (6,6) and (6,4).\n- Moving Up (U) to (4,6) is safe but doesn't seem to help much.\n- Moving Down (D) to (4,4) is safe but also doesn't seem advantageous.\n\nMoving Right seems better as it opens paths towards two food items.\n\n### Checking Immediate Safety of Right Move\n\nAfter moving Right to (5,5), next possible moves would be from (5,5):\n\nCurrent direction would be R (since we moved R).\nCannot move L (opposite).\nPossible moves from (5,5):\n- U: (5,6)\n- D: (5,4)\n- R: (6,5)\n\nAll seem safe at that point.\n\n### Avoiding Getting Boxed In\n\nWe should also avoid moving into positions where the snake might get trapped. Currently, moving Right seems safe in that regard.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, moving **Right (R)** seems the most promising as it moves towards two food items without immediate risks.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn 6.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - Internal obstacle: (3, 6).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (5,5), then (4,5), then (3,5). So, the snake is moving right (direction R) and is currently three segments long.\n4. **Food**:\n   - (6,6): value=1, life_span=4.\n   - (6,4): value=1, life_span=5.\n   - (3,2): value=1, life_span=8.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake's current direction is Right (R). From the head at (5,5), the possible next moves are:\n\n- **Right (R)**: (6,5)\n- **Up (U)**: (5,6)\n- **Down (D)**: (5,4)\n\nWe cannot move Left (L) because that's the opposite of the current direction (R), which is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (6,5)\n- **Position**: (6,5)\n- **Check Walls**:\n  - x=6 is not a border wall (since x=7 is the border).\n  - y=5 is not a border wall.\n  - (6,5) is not an internal obstacle (only internal obstacle is at (3,6)).\n- **Check Body Collision**:\n  - Snake body segments: (4,5) and (3,5).\n  - (6,5) is not in the body.\n- **Check Food**:\n  - No food at (6,5).\n- **Result**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (5,6)\n- **Position**: (5,6)\n- **Check Walls**:\n  - x=5 is not a border wall.\n  - y=6 is not a border wall (y=7 is).\n  - Internal obstacle at (3,6) doesn't affect (5,6).\n- **Check Body Collision**:\n  - (5,6) is not in the body [(4,5), (3,5)].\n- **Check Food**:\n  - No food at (5,6).\n- **Result**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (5,4)\n- **Position**: (5,4)\n- **Check Walls**:\n  - x=5 is not a border wall.\n  - y=4 is not a border wall (y=0 is).\n  - No internal obstacle at (5,4).\n- **Check Body Collision**:\n  - (5,4) is not in the body.\n- **Check Food**:\n  - Food at (6,4) is nearby but not at (5,4).\n- **Result**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's see if any food is accessible in the next move or if we should position ourselves to get food in subsequent moves.\n\n1. **Food at (6,6)**:\n   - Current head at (5,5).\n   - To reach (6,6), path would be: Right to (6,5), then Up to (6,6).\n   - Or Up to (5,6), then Right to (6,6).\n   - Both require two moves.\n\n2. **Food at (6,4)**:\n   - Current head at (5,5).\n   - Path: Down to (5,4), then Right to (6,4).\n   - Two moves.\n\n3. **Food at (3,2)**:\n   - Quite far, not immediately relevant.\n\n### Immediate Action Decision\n\nAt Turn 6, none of the immediate moves lead directly to food. So, we should choose a move that positions us to get food in the next turn.\n\nLet's consider the two closest foods:\n\n- **Approach (6,6)**:\n  - Move Right to (6,5), then next turn can go Up to (6,6).\n  - Or move Up to (5,6), then next turn can go Right to (6,6).\n\n- **Approach (6,4)**:\n  - Move Down to (5,4), then next turn can go Right to (6,4).\n\nBoth options are valid. Let's see which one is safer or more beneficial.\n\n**Option 1: Right then Up**\n- After Right to (6,5), next move is Up to (6,6).\n- At (6,6), check for Tail Reward Danger:\n  - Current tail is at (3,5), after moving Right, tail moves to (4,5).\n  - After moving Up, tail moves to (5,5).\n  - (6,6) is not adjacent to the new tail (5,5) (they are diagonally apart, not adjacent).\n  - So, no Tail Reward Danger.\n\n**Option 2: Up then Right**\n- After Up to (5,6), next move is Right to (6,6).\n- Similar check: no Tail Reward Danger.\n\n**Option 3: Down then Right**\n- After Down to (5,4), next move is Right to (6,4).\n- At (6,4), check Tail Reward Danger:\n  - After Down, tail is at (4,5).\n  - After Right, tail is at (5,5).\n  - (6,4) is adjacent to (5,5)? Let's see:\n    - (6,4) and (5,5): x difference 1, y difference 1, so diagonally adjacent, not directly adjacent (for adjacency, usually consider up/down/left/right, not diagonals).\n    - Assuming adjacency is only cardinal directions (U/D/L/R), then no.\n  - So, no Tail Reward Danger.\n\nAll options seem safe. Now, let's see the life spans:\n- (6,6): life_span=4 (will disappear at turn 10).\n- (6,4): life_span=5 (will disappear at turn 11).\n- (3,2): life_span=8 (will disappear at turn 14).\n\nBoth (6,6) and (6,4) have similar life spans left, but (6,6) is slightly sooner to disappear. Maybe prioritize (6,6).\n\nBetween Right then Up or Up then Right, both are similar. Maybe Right first is slightly better because it keeps the snake more straight, but not a big difference.\n\nAlternatively, moving Down to (5,4) then Right to (6,4) is also fine.\n\nGiven that, let's choose to move Right to (6,5), setting up to get (6,6) next.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nBefore finalizing, let's ensure that moving Right doesn't lead to any immediate danger in the next steps.\n\nAfter moving Right to (6,5):\n- Next turn, snake is at [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5)].\n- Possible moves from (6,5):\n  - Current direction is R, so can't move L to (5,5) (reverse).\n  - Can move R to (7,5) - but x=7 is a wall, so invalid.\n  - Can move U to (6,6) - valid, leads to food.\n  - Can move D to (6,4) - valid, no food yet.\n  \nSo, next move would be U to (6,6) to eat the food.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all options, the best immediate action is to move Right to position ourselves to eat the food at (6,6) in the next turn.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

So, possible moves are U, D, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R)\n- New head position: (6+1, 5) = (7, 5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Wall: x=7 is a border wall. So moving to (7,5) would collide with the wall → deadly.\n- **Conclusion**: Cannot move right.\n\n#### 2.

(6,6) is not part of the body → safe.\n  - Food: There's food at (6,6) with value=3.\n    - Check if eating is safe:\n      - Current tail is at (4,5). After eating, the tail stays where it is (since length increases by 1), but the body moves forward.\n      - New tail would be at (5,5), head at (6,6), so no immediate collision.\n      - Also, the food is not under the tail, so no \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n    - So eating is safe and beneficial (+3 score, length +1).\n- **Conclusion**: Moving up is safe and allows eating positive food.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D)\n- New head position: (6, 5-1) = (6, 4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Wall: No walls at (6,4).\n  - Body: (6,4) is not part of the body → safe.\n  - Food: There's food at (6,4) with value=4.\n    - Check eating safety:\n      - Current tail is at (4,5). After eating, tail stays, body moves.\n      - New tail at (5,5), head at (6,4) → no collision.\n      - Food not under tail → no \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n    - Eating is safe and beneficial (+4 score, length +1).\n- **Conclusion**: Moving down is also safe and allows eating positive food.\n\n### Comparing Up (U) and Down (D)\n\nBoth U and D are safe and lead to eating positive food:\n- U: eat (6,6) value=3\n- D: eat (6,4) value=4\n\nThe food at (6,4) has a higher value (4 vs 3), so moving down is better in terms of immediate score gain.\n\n### Checking Other Food\n\nOther food items are:\n- (3,2): too far away, not reachable immediately.\n- (5,1): also far, not relevant for immediate move.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Dangers\n\nAfter moving down to (6,4):\n- Next turn, the snake's positions would be: [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]\n- Possible moves from there would be L, R, D (can't go U, reverse of D).\n- Need to ensure no immediate traps, but since we're only deciding the immediate move, this seems fine.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween U and D, moving Down (D) gives a higher score (+4 vs +3), and both are safe.

So we cannot move R next. \n\nAllowed moves from current direction L: U, D, L (but not R).\n\nBut let's see where the head is and possible moves:\n\nCurrent head: (5,4)\nPossible moves:\n- U (Up): (5,5)\n- D (Down): (5,3)\n- L (Left): (4,4)\n- R (Right): (6,4) — but this is opposite to current direction L, so not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, let's check each for collisions and food.\n\n### Checking Possible Moves\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (5,5)**:\n   - Current body segments: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)\n   - (5,5) is the last body segment (tail). Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail will move away, but we have to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n     - If the tail cell has positive food and we eat it, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, causing the head to collide with the new tail.\n   - Is there food at (5,5)? Looking at the food list: no, none of the foods are at (5,5).\n   - So moving to (5,5) is safe — the tail will move away, no collision.\n   - Is there food to eat here? No.\n   - So this move is safe but doesn't gain points.\n\n2. **Move Down (D) to (5,3)**:\n   - Is (5,3) a wall? Border walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=3 is not a wall.\n   - Internal obstacle is (3,6), not (5,3).\n   - Is (5,3) part of the body? Current body: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) — no, so safe.\n   - Is there food at (5,3)? No, foods are at (6,6), (3,2), (5,1).\n   - Safe move, no points.\n\n3. **Move Left (L) to (4,4)**:\n   - Is (4,4) a wall? No walls at x=4 or y=4.\n   - Is (4,4) part of the body? No.\n   - Is there food at (4,4)? No.\n   - Safe move, no points.\n\nSo all possible moves are safe but don't yield points. But wait, maybe I missed something about the food.\n\n### Re-evaluating Food\n\nAll foods have life_span=1, so they'll disappear after this turn. Let's see if any are reachable:\n\n1. (6,6): value=1\n   - Current head at (5,4). To reach (6,6):\n     - From (5,4), can't go right (opposite direction), so can't go to (6,4) first.\n     - From (5,4), can go up to (5,5), then next turn could go right to (6,5), then up to (6,6), but food will be gone by then.\n   - Not reachable this turn.\n\n2. (3,2): value=5\n   - From (5,4), to reach (3,2) in one move? No, need multiple moves.\n   - Not reachable this turn.\n\n3. (5,1): value=8\n   - From (5,4), to reach (5,1) in one move: need to go down three steps, but can only move one per turn.\n   - Not reachable this turn.\n\nHmm, seems no food is reachable this turn. So all moves are safe but don't get food.\n\nBut is there any food under the snake's body that could be eaten if we move away?\n\nCurrent body segments:\n- (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)\nFood positions:\n- (6,6), (3,2), (5,1)\nNone of these are under the snake's body.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nSince no food is reachable this turn, the best move is one that keeps options open for next turns. \n\nPossible moves:\n- U to (5,5): then next turn head is at (5,5), direction U. Possible next moves from there.\n- D to (5,3): then next turn head at (5,3), direction D.\n- L to (4,4): then next turn head at (4,4), direction L.\n\nWhich is best? Maybe moving towards higher value foods for future turns.\n\n(5,1) has value 8, is below current head. Moving down gets closer to it.\n\n(3,2) is to the left, but moving left now might not be best since (5,1) is higher value.\n\n(6,6) is up-right, but we can't go right next turn, so hard to reach.\n\nSo moving down seems best to eventually reach (5,1).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs moving down dangerous in any way? \n- Next head position: (5,3)\n- Body will be: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) — tail (5,5) moves away.\nNo collisions, no walls.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nSince no food is immediately reachable, and moving down seems to position us better to reach the high-value food at (5,1) in future turns, the best immediate action is to move down.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (can't move beyond these).\n   - Internal obstacle at (3, 6).\n\n2. **Snake**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5)].\n     - Head at (5, 3).\n     - Next segment at (5, 4), then (6, 4), then tail at (6, 5).\n   - Current direction: Down (D). This means the snake was moving downward to reach (5, 3) from (5, 4).\n\n3. **Food**:\n   - Three food items:\n     - (3, 2): value=1, life_span=5.\n     - (5, 1): value=1, life_span=7.\n     - (2, 6): value=1, life_span=10.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5, 3) and direction D (down), the possible moves are:\n- **Down (D)**: (5, 2).\n- **Left (L)**: (4, 3).\n- **Right (R)**: (6, 3).\n\nCannot move Up (U) because that would be the opposite of the current direction D (no instant reverse).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D) to (5, 2):\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Body segments: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) — (5,2) is not in these, safe.\n     - Walls: y=0 is at y=0, (5,2) is y=2, safe.\n   - Food at (5,2)? No food listed there.\n   - Next head position: (5,2).\n   - After move, tail moves forward, so new snake positions: [(5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)].\n   - No food eaten, no score change.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (4, 3):\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Body segments: (4,3) is not in [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5)], safe.\n     - Walls: x=0 is at x=0, (4,3) is x=4, safe.\n   - Food at (4,3)? No food listed there.\n   - Next head position: (4,3).\n   - New snake positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)].\n   - No food eaten, no score change.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (6, 3):\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Body segments: (6,3) is not in [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5)], safe.\n     - Walls: x=7 is at x=7, (6,3) is x=6, safe.\n   - Food at (6,3)? No food listed there.\n   - Next head position: (6,3).\n   - New snake positions: [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)].\n   - No food eaten, no score change.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nCurrently, none of the immediate moves lead to eating food directly. However, let's look at the food positions to see if we can plan a path towards them:\n\n1. **Food at (3, 2)**:\n   - Current head at (5,3).\n   - To reach (3,2), possible path: Left to (4,3), then Left to (3,3), then Down to (3,2).\n   - But this is planning ahead, and we're only deciding the immediate move.\n\n2. **Food at (5, 1)**:\n   - Current head at (5,3).\n   - Down to (5,2), then Down to (5,1).\n   - So moving Down now could be a step towards this food.\n\n3. **Food at (2, 6)**:\n   - Current head at (5,3).\n   - Quite far, would require multiple moves left and up.\n\nGiven that moving Down doesn't immediately eat food but is a step towards (5,1), and the other moves don't lead towards food, Down seems like a reasonable choice to eventually reach the food at (5,1).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Under Head or Tail\n\n- **Food under head**: Head is at (5,3). No food listed there.\n- **Food under tail**: Tail is at (6,5). No food listed there.\n  \nNo immediate eating opportunities or dangers from tail reward.\n\n### Evaluating Safety of Moves\n\nAll three possible moves (D, L, R) are safe in terms of not colliding with body or walls this turn. \n\nHowever, let's think about future moves:\n\n- If we move Down to (5,2), next moves could be Down to (5,1) to eat food, but then we'd be at the border (y=0 is at y=0, (5,0) is a wall), so after (5,1), we'd have to turn left or right.\n  \n- Moving Left or Right now keeps more options open for future moves without nearing the border immediately.\n\nGiven that, moving Left or Right might be better for keeping options open, but since Down is a step towards food, it's a trade-off.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that moving Down is safe and is a step towards the food at (5,1), and the other moves don't offer immediate benefits, I'll choose Down.\n\nHowever, let me double-check if moving Down could lead to any immediate issues next turn:\n\nAfter moving Down to (5,2), snake is [(5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)].\n\nNext turn, possible moves from (5,2), direction D:\n- Continue Down to (5,1) — but need to check if that's safe:\n  - (5,1) is not in body [(5,3), (5,4), (6,4)], and not a wall (y=0 is at y=0, (5,1) is y=1), and has food.\n  - Eating at (5,1) would grow the snake, new tail would be at (6,4) (since the old tail at (6,4) doesn't move when eating), so new snake would be [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)].\n  - Then next move from (5,1), cannot go Up (reverse), so Left to (4,1) or Right to (6,1).\n  - Both seem safe at that point.\n\nSo moving Down now seems fine for setting up to eat (5,1) next turn.\n\nAlternatively, moving Left or Right now doesn't help in eating food soon, so Down is better for scoring.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the best immediate action is to move **Down (D)** to position (5,2), setting up to eat the positive food at (5,1) on the next turn.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn (t₀):** 11\n\n**Walls:**\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 6)\n\n**Snake Positions:**\n- Head: (5, 2)\n- Body segments: (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4)\n\nSo, the snake's body is:\n- Head at (5,2)\n- Next segment at (5,3)\n- Then (5,4)\n- Then tail at (6,4)\n\n**Snake Head Direction:** D (Down)\n\nThis means the snake was moving Down in the previous turn. The direction is important because we cannot reverse direction instantly (i.e., cannot go Up next if current direction is Down).\n\n**Food Items:**\n1. (3, 2) - value: 1, life_span: 4\n2. (5, 1) - value: 1, life_span: 6\n3. (2, 6) - value: 1, life_span: 9\n\nAll food items are positive (value +1), and none are negative in this case.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,2), and given the current direction is Down (D), the possible moves are:\n\n- **Down (D):** (5,1)\n- **Left (L):** (4,2)\n- **Right (R):** (6,2)\n\nWe cannot go Up (U) because that would be the opposite of the current direction (D), which is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D) to (5,1)\n\n- Check for walls: y=1 is not a border wall (border is y=0), and there are no internal walls at (5,1). So, no wall collision.\n- Check for body collision:\n  - Snake body segments are at (5,3), (5,4), (6,4). (5,1) is not in this list, so no body collision.\n- Food at (5,1):\n  - There is food at (5,1) with value +1.\n  - If we move here, the head will be at (5,1), which is food.\n  - After eating, the snake's length increases by 1, and the new tail will be where the current tail is (6,4) after the body moves.\n  - Check for Tail Reward Danger:\n    - The tail is at (6,4). Is the head adjacent to the tail before moving? Current head is (5,2), tail is (6,4). Adjacent means one coordinate differs by 1 and the other is the same, or vice versa.\n    - Distance: |5-6|=1, |2-4|=2 → total difference is 3, not adjacent (adjacent would be difference of 1 in one coordinate and 0 in the other, or both 1).\n    - So, no Tail Reward Danger here.\n  - So, moving Down to (5,1) is safe and allows eating positive food.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (4,2)\n\n- Check for walls: x=4 is not a border wall (border is x=0,7), and no internal wall at (4,2). Safe.\n- Check for body collision:\n  - Body segments at (5,3), (5,4), (6,4). (4,2) is not in this list. Safe.\n- Food:\n  - No food at (4,2). So, no score gain.\n- This move is safe but doesn't gain any points.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (6,2)\n\n- Check for walls: x=6 is not a border wall (border is x=7), no internal wall at (6,2). Safe.\n- Check for body collision:\n  - Body segments at (5,3), (5,4), (6,4). (6,2) is not in this list. Safe.\n- Food:\n  - No food at (6,2). No score gain.\n- This move is safe but doesn't gain any points.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- **Down (D):** Safe, eats food (+1 score), no risks.\n- **Left (L):** Safe, no food.\n- **Right (R):** Safe, no food.\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down to (5,1) to eat the positive food there, as it's safe and increases the score.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger Again\n\nJust to be thorough, let's ensure that after eating the food at (5,1), the new tail position doesn't cause a collision with the head.\n\nCurrent snake before move:\n- Head: (5,2)\n- Body: (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nAfter moving Down to (5,1) and eating:\n- New head: (5,1)\n- Body grows by 1, so the tail doesn't move. New body:\n  - (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)\n  \nNow, the tail is still at (6,4), and head is at (5,1). They are not adjacent (distance is |5-6|=1, |1-4|=3), so no collision next turn from tail.\n\n### Other Food Considerations\n\nOther food items:\n1. (3,2): life_span 4, current turn 11. So, disappears at turn 15. Not urgent.\n2. (5,1): life_span 6, disappears at turn 17. We're eating it now.\n3. (2,6): life_span 9, disappears at turn 20. Not urgent.\n\nNo need to prioritize other foods now.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down to eat the food at (5,1), which is safe and increases the score.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

This means the grid is 8x8 (from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 6). So, the snake can't move to this cell.\n\n**Snake Positions**:\n- Head: (5, 1)\n- Body segments in order: (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4)\n  \nSo, the snake's body is like this:\n- Head at (5,1), then straight down to (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), then right to (6,4).\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: D (Down)\n- This means the last move was Down, so the head moved from (5,2) to (5,1).\n\n**Food**:\n1. (3, 2), value = 3, life_span = 1\n   - Positive food (+1 score, snake length +1)\n   - Will disappear after this turn (since life_span decreases this turn to 0).\n2.

The current direction is D (last move was Down), so the opposite is U (Up). Therefore, we cannot move Up next. So, possible moves are D, L, R.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D): (5,1) → (5,0)\n- Check for walls: y=0 is a wall. So, moving to (5,0) is a wall collision → deadly.\n- **Not safe**.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L): (5,1) → (4,1)\n- Check for walls: (4,1) is not a wall (no internal obstacle there).\n- Check for body collision:\n  - Body segments: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)\n  - (4,1) is not in the body → safe.\n- Food check:\n  - No food at (4,1).\n  - Closest food is at (3,2) and (2,6).\n    - (3,2): To reach from (4,1), next move could be L to (3,1), then U to (3,2).\n    - But (3,2) food disappears after this turn, so can't reach it in time.\n    - (2,6): Too far, can't reach in one move.\n- **Safe move**, but no immediate food benefit.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R): (5,1) → (6,1)\n- Check for walls: (6,1) is not a wall.\n- Check for body collision:\n  - (6,1) is not in body segments.\n- Food check:\n  - No food at (6,1).\n  - Closest food:\n    - (3,2): Can't reach in one move.\n    - (2,6): Can't reach in one move.\n- **Safe move**, but no immediate food benefit.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nBoth foods will disappear after this turn (life_span=1, and it decreases this turn to 0). So, to eat any food, we must be able to move onto it this turn.\n\nCurrent head is at (5,1). Foods are at:\n1. (3,2):\n   - Distance: Δx=2, Δy=1 → can't reach in one move (must move exactly one cell).\n2. (2,6):\n   - Distance: Δx=3, Δy=5 → can't reach in one move.\n\nSo, we cannot eat any food this turn; they will disappear after this turn regardless.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food on the tail?\n\nTail is the last segment: (6,4).\nHead is at (5,1), tail at (6,4).\nDistance: Δx=1, Δy=3 → not adjacent (adjacent means Δx + Δy = 1, i.e., directly next to).\n\nSo, no tail reward danger.\n\n### Decision\n\nPossible safe moves: L or R.\nBoth don't lead to food this turn.\nWhich is better?\n\nLooking ahead:\n- If we move L to (4,1):\n  - Next moves could be towards center or other areas.\n- If we move R to (6,1):\n  - Next moves could be towards the right side.\n\nNeither is immediately better, but moving Left might keep us more centered, which is generally safer in Snake to have more options later.\n\nAlternatively, moving Right might be better because the body is currently extending to the right at (6,4), so moving right now might help in coiling the snake better.\n\nBut since both are equally safe and no food is immediately available, either is fine. I'll choose Left to stay more centered.\n\nHowever, looking at the body, the segment after the head is (5,2), then (5,3), (5,4), (6,4). Moving Left to (4,1) doesn't immediately help in coiling, but moving Right to (6,1) might set up for future moves where we can go up to (6,2), etc., potentially avoiding getting boxed in.\n\nGiven that, moving Right might be slightly better for future flexibility.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all options, the safest move is either Left or Right, with no immediate benefit for either. Moving Right might offer slightly better future flexibility.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Looking at the food positions:\n- (3,2), (2,6), (4,1) — none at (6,2), so no food to eat there.\n\n### Considering Other Options\n\nIs there any other way to move? The only valid move is Up, but let's think if we can plan for future moves to get food.\n\n**Food at (4,1):**\n- Current head at (6,1). To reach (4,1), we'd need to move Left twice, but:\n  - First move from (6,1) Left to (5,1): but (5,1) is the second segment of the snake (immediately after head), so moving Left would collide with the body.\n  - So, cannot go Left now.\n\n**Food at (3,2):**\n- From (6,1), to reach (3,2):\n  - Possible path: Up to (6,2), then Left to (5,2), Left to (4,2), Down to (4,1), Left to (3,1), Up to (3,2).\n  - But this is multiple moves ahead, and we're only deciding the immediate next move.\n\n**Food at (2,6):**\n- Quite far from (6,1), not immediately reachable.\n\nGiven that the only immediate safe move is Up to (6,2), and there's no food there, but it's safe and doesn't lead to a dead end immediately.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail with positive food on the tail?\n- Tail is at (5,4).\n- Head is at (6,1), tail at (5,4). Distance is |6-5| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4, not adjacent (adjacent means distance of 1).\n- So, no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Verifying No Other Moves\n\nIs there any other possible move besides Up?\n- Down to (6,0): wall.\n- Left to (5,1): body collision.\n- Right to (7,1): wall.\nSo, only Up is valid.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe and valid move at this turn is Up (U).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

(6,3) is not occupied by any body segment.\n     - Obstacles: (3,6) is not in our path.\n   - Food: No food at (6,3).\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n2. **Move Left (\"L\")**: (6, 2) → (5, 2)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=0 is a wall, but (5,2) is within bounds.\n     - Body: (5,2) is currently occupied by the snake's body (4th segment). However, this is the tail's position after the move because the tail is at (5,3) and will move forward to (5,2) when the head moves to (5,2). \n     - Normally, moving into the tail's current position is safe because the tail moves away, but here the tail is at (5,3) and will move to (5,2), while the head moves to (5,2), causing a collision.\n     - Wait, let's visualize the snake's movement:\n       - Current: [(6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)]\n       - Move L: head to (5,2), then body follows:\n         - New head: (5,2)\n         - Next segment: (6,2)\n         - Then: (6,1)\n         - Then: (5,1)\n         - Tail was at (5,3), which moves to (5,2), but (5,2) is now the head, so the head and tail would be at the same position, causing a collision.\n     - So, moving left would cause the head to collide with the new tail position.\n   - Food: No food at (5,2).\n   - Outcome: Collision with tail → Deadly.\n\n3. **Move Right (\"R\")**: (6, 2) → (7, 2)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=7 is a border wall → cannot move here.\n   - Outcome: Wall collision → Deadly.\n\n### Food Analysis\n\nLooking at the food positions:\n1. (3, 2): value=1, life_span=1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n   - Distance from head (6,2): |6-3| + |2-2| = 3 (Manhattan distance)\n   - Not reachable in one move.\n2. (2, 6): value=1, life_span=6\n   - Distance: |6-2| + |2-6| = 4 + 4 = 8\n   - Far away.\n3. (4, 1): value=1, life_span=9\n   - Distance: |6-4| + |2-1| = 2 + 1 = 3\n   - Not reachable in one move.\n\nNone of the food is immediately accessible in the next move.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nFrom the above:\n- \"U\": Safe, no reward.\n- \"L\": Deadly (collision with tail).\n- \"R\": Deadly (wall collision).\n\nOnly \"U\" is safe.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any positive food adjacent to the tail that could be dangerous if eaten?\n- Tail is at (5,3).\n- Adjacent to tail: (4,3), (6,3), (5,2), (5,4).\n  - (5,2) is part of the snake's body (not tail's current position, but the segment before tail).\n  - (5,4): no food there.\n  - (4,3): no food listed there.\n  - (6,3): no food listed there.\nNo adjacent food to the tail, so no tail reward danger in upcoming moves.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe only safe move is \"U\". \n\nHowever, let's think ahead:\n- After moving \"U\" to (6,3), next moves could be:\n  - From (6,3), direction \"U\":\n    - Can't reverse to \"D\".\n    - Possible: \"U\", \"L\", \"R\".\n    - \"U\" to (6,4): safe (no walls or body).\n    - \"L\" to (5,3): tail is at (5,3) now, but after moving head to (5,3), tail moves to (5,2), so no collision.\n    - \"R\" to (7,3): wall collision.\n  - So next turn could go \"L\" to (5,3), which is safe and closer to food at (4,1).\n\nAlternatively, is there any way to reach food at (3,2) before it disappears?\n- Current head at (6,2), food at (3,2).\n- Need to move left three times: but first move left is deadly, so can't.\n- Alternative path: up to (6,3), then left to (5,3), then left to (4,3), then down to (4,2), then left to (3,2) — but food at (3,2) disappears after this turn, so can't reach it in time.\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,1):\n- From (6,2), move up to (6,3), then left to (5,3), then down to (5,2), then left to (4,2), then down to (4,1) — takes multiple turns, life_span is 9, so possible.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAt Turn 14, the only safe immediate move is \"U\".\n\n\\boxed{U}",

The possible moves are Up, Left, Right (cannot move Down as it's the opposite of Up).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: Move from (6,3) to (6,4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=7 is a wall, (6,4) is not a wall.\n     - Body: Snake body segments are at (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2). (6,4) is not in the body.\n   - Food: No food at (6,4).\n   - Safe move, but doesn't eat food.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: Move from (6,3) to (5,3)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=0 is a wall, (5,3) is not a wall.\n     - Body: (5,3) is not in the body segments.\n   - Food: No food at (5,3).\n   - Safe move, but doesn't eat food.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: Move from (6,3) to (7,3)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=7 is a wall, so (7,3) is a wall → collision.\n   - Invalid move.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nBoth food items have life_span=1, meaning they will disappear after this turn. It's our last chance to eat them.\n\n1. **Food at (2,6)**:\n   - Distance from head (6,3): |6-2| + |3-6| = 4 + 3 = 7 steps away. Can't reach in one move.\n   \n2. **Food at (4,1)**:\n   - Distance from head (6,3): |6-4| + |3-1| = 2 + 2 = 4 steps away. Can't reach in one move.\n\nHowever, the snake's tail is at (5,2). There's food at (4,1), which is adjacent to the tail (5,2) and (5,1). \n\n**Tail Reward Danger**: If the head moves adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrently, the tail is at (5,2), and the food is at (4,1). The head is at (6,3). \n\nTo eat (4,1), the head would need to move to (4,1), but that's not possible in one move. \n\nAlternatively, if the head moves to (5,3), it's not adjacent to the tail's current position (5,2) in a way that would allow eating the food under the tail. \n\nWait, the food is at (4,1), and the tail is at (5,2). The tail is not on the food, so no danger from tail reward.\n\nBut the food at (4,1) is adjacent to the body segment (5,1). \n\nIs the food under the snake's body? \n\nSnake body: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2). \n\nFood at (4,1) is adjacent to (5,1), but not under the snake's body. \n\nSo no immediate danger from tail reward.\n\n### Best Immediate Action\n\nGiven that we can't reach any food in one move, and both foods will disappear after this turn, our priority is to avoid collisions and position ourselves for future moves.\n\nPossible safe moves:\n- Up (U) to (6,4)\n- Left (L) to (5,3)\n\nWhich is better?\n\n- Up (U) to (6,4):\n  - Moves towards the center, away from the wall at y=7.\n  \n- Left (L) to (5,3):\n  - Moves towards the center, away from the wall at x=7.\n\nBoth are safe. \n\nLooking ahead, moving Up might be better because it keeps more options open for next moves (can go left or right from (6,4)). \n\nMoving Left to (5,3) might limit options if we're near the left wall (but x=0 is at x=0, and we're at x=5, so still safe).\n\nAlternatively, moving Left could position us closer to potential future food spawns in the left part of the grid.\n\nGiven that both moves are safe and neither leads to food, either is acceptable. \n\nHowever, moving Up keeps the snake moving in its current direction, which might be simpler unless there's a reason to turn.\n\nGiven no immediate benefit to turning, continuing Up seems reasonable.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Food\n\nWait, is there any food adjacent to the head that we can eat?\n\nHead at (6,3). Adjacent cells:\n- Up: (6,4) - no food\n- Left: (5,3) - no food\n- Right: (7,3) - wall\n- Down: (6,2) - body segment\n\nNo adjacent food to eat this turn.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nSince both foods are out of reach this turn and will disappear, and both Up and Left are safe moves, I'll choose to continue moving Up to maintain direction unless there's a compelling reason to turn.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Move Up (U) to (6, 5)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: (6,5) is not a wall (since y=7 is the upper wall, and y=5 is within bounds).\n  - **Body**: The snake's body segments are at (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1). (6,5) is not occupied by any body part.\n- **Food Check**: No food at (6,5).\n- **Safety**: Safe move; no immediate collision.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (5, 4)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: (5,4) is not a wall.\n  - **Body**: (5,4) is not occupied by any body part.\n- **Food Check**: No food at (5,4).\n- **Safety**: Safe move; no immediate collision.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (7, 4)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: x=7 is a border wall, so (7,4) is a wall → **Collision**.\n- **Safety**: Not safe; would result in a wall collision.\n\nSo, possible safe moves are U and L.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions to see if any are reachable or beneficial:\n\n1. **(2, 6)**:\n   - Value: 5\n   - Distance from head (6,4): Manhattan distance = |6-2| + |4-6| = 4 + 2 = 6\n   - Life_span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n   - To reach (2,6) from (6,4) in one move is impossible; it's too far away.\n\n2. **(4, 1)**:\n   - Value: 7\n   - Distance from head (6,4): |6-4| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5\n   - Life_span: 1\n   - Cannot reach in one move.\n\n3. **(3, 1)**:\n   - Value: 10\n   - Distance from head (6,4): |6-3| + |4-1| = 3 + 3 = 6\n   - Life_span: 1\n   - Cannot reach in one move.\n\nNone of the food can be eaten in the next move since they're all more than one cell away. Therefore, the immediate goal is to move safely without considering food for this turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe also need to check if moving in a certain direction could lead to a \"Tail Reward Danger\" in the future. This occurs if:\n- The head is adjacent to the tail, and\n- The tail cell has positive food, and\n- Eating it would cause the head and newly grown tail to collide.\n\nCurrently, the tail is at (5,1). The head is at (6,4), which is not adjacent to the tail (Manhattan distance is |6-5| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4 > 1). So, this is not an immediate concern.\n\n### Choosing Between U and L\n\nBoth U and L are safe moves. To decide between them, we can consider future flexibility:\n\n- **Move Up (U) to (6,5)**:\n  - Next possible directions: U, L, R (can't go D)\n  - Moves the snake upwards, potentially towards the center where more food might spawn.\n\n- **Move Left (L) to (5,4)**:\n  - Next possible directions: U, D, L (can't go R)\n  - Moves the snake left, away from the right wall.\n\nBoth moves seem equally safe with no immediate advantage. However, moving up might keep the snake more centralized, which could be beneficial for future food collection.\n\n### Checking for Future Collisions\n\nLet's see if moving up could lead to a dead end or collision next turn:\n\nAfter moving to (6,5), the snake would be:\n- Head: (6,5)\n- Body: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)\n\nPossible moves from (6,5):\n- U to (6,6): Not a wall, not body.\n- L to (5,5): Not a wall, not body.\n- R to (7,5): Wall (x=7) → invalid.\n\nSo, next turn would have options U or L, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, moving left to (5,4):\n- Head: (5,4)\n- Body: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)\n\nPossible moves from (5,4):\n- U to (5,5): Not wall, not body.\n- D to (5,3): Not wall, not body.\n- L to (4,4): Not wall, not body.\n\nSo, next turn would have options U, D, or L, which is also fine.\n\nGiven that both moves are equally safe and don't lead to immediate dead ends, and since no food is reachable this turn, either move is acceptable. \n\n### Decision\n\nSince moving up continues the current upward trajectory and may help in keeping the snake more centralized, I'll choose to move up.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Move Right (R) to (7,5)\n- Check for walls:\n  - x=7 is a border wall.\n- **Conclusion**: Moving right would hit the wall → deadly collision.

It will disappear in 4 turns (including current turn), so it will be gone by turn 20.\n   - To reach it, we'd need at least 5 moves, but it disappears by turn 20 (current is 17), so we can't reach it in time (need to reach by turn 20, but earliest is turn 22). Hence, ignore.\n\n2. **Food at (4,1)**:\n   - Current tail is at (6,1). \n   - Distance from head (6,5): |6-4| + |5-1| = 2 + 4 = 6.\n   - Life span: 6. It will disappear at turn 22 (17 + 6 - 1 = 22).\n   - To reach it, need at least 6 moves. Possible to reach by turn 22 if we start moving towards it now.\n   - However, the tail is at (6,1), and the food is at (4,1). If we move towards this food, by the time the head reaches (4,1), the tail would have moved away (since the snake grows only when eating, and this food is positive). But we need to ensure that the head doesn't collide with the body while moving towards it.\n   - Currently, moving left (L) to (5,5) is safe, and then we can plan further moves towards (4,1).\n\n3. **Food at (3,1)**:\n   - Distance from head: |6-3| + |5-1| = 3 + 4 = 7.\n   - Life span: 9. Disappears at turn 25 (17 + 9 - 1 = 25).\n   - Similar to (4,1), but further away. Lower priority than (4,1).\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nOne special rule is the \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\n- Current tail is at (6,1).\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (5,1), (7,1), (6,0), (6,2).\n   - (7,1): x=7 is wall.\n   - (6,0): y=0 is wall.\n   - (5,1): Not head's current position.\n   - (6,2): Snake's body is at (6,2), so head is not adjacent to tail via this cell.\n- Head is at (6,5), which is not adjacent to tail (6,1). So no immediate danger here.\n\n### Decision\n\nFrom the possible moves:\n- Right (R) is invalid (wall).\n- Up (U) is safe but doesn't lead towards food.\n- Left (L) is safe and is the first step towards reaching the food at (4,1).\n\nWhile moving left doesn't immediately get us food, it opens up the path towards the food at (4,1), which is the most reachable positive food given its life span.\n\nMoving up is also safe but doesn't contribute to any immediate or near-future food collection.\n\n### Final Choice\n\nGiven that moving left is safe and is the first step towards the most reachable positive food, and moving up doesn't offer any advantage, the best immediate action is to move left.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn (t₀):** 18\n\n**Walls:**\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 6)\n\n**Snake:**\n- Positions (head first): [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)]\n  - Head: (5,5)\n  - Body segments: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)\n- Current direction: L (Left)\n\n**Food:**\n1. (2, 6) - value: 1, life_span: 3\n2. (4, 1) - value: 1, life_span: 5\n3. (3, 1) - value: 1, life_span: 8\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me try to visualize the snake's position and the food locations.\n\n- Snake:\n  - Head at (5,5)\n  - Next segment at (6,5) - so the snake was moving left from (6,5) to (5,5)\n  - Then down to (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)\n\nSo the snake's body is like this:\n- (5,5) ← head\n- (6,5) ← body\n- (6,4)\n- (6,3)\n- (6,2) ← tail\n\nFood:\n1. (2,6) - near the top left\n2. (4,1) - bottom middle\n3. (3,1) - bottom left\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving Left (L). The possible moves are U (Up), D (Down), L (Left), R (Right), but we cannot reverse direction instantly. Since the current direction is L, the opposite is R, so we cannot move R next. So possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow let's check each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) - (x-1, y)\nCurrent head: (5,5)\nNew head: (4,5)\n\nCheck for collisions:\n- Body: Snake body is at (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) - (4,5) is not in these, safe.\n- Walls: x=0 is a wall, x=7 is the other border. (4,5) is within bounds, no internal wall at (4,5), safe.\n\nFood at (4,5)? No food listed at (4,5).\n\nSo moving L is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) - (x, y+1)\nNew head: (5,6)\n\nCheck for collisions:\n- Body: (5,6) is not in [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)], but is (5,6) in the body? The head is at (5,5), body starts at (6,5), so no, safe.\n- Walls: y=7 is the top wall, (5,6) is within bounds. Internal obstacle at (3,6), not (5,6), safe.\n\nFood at (5,6)? No food listed at (5,6).\n\nSafe but no food.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) - (x, y-1)\nNew head: (5,4)\n\nCheck for collisions:\n- Body: (5,4) is not in [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)], safe.\n- Walls: y=0 is bottom wall, (5,4) is within bounds, no internal wall there, safe.\n\nFood at (5,4)? No food listed at (5,4).\n\nSafe but no food.\n\n### Checking for Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food is adjacent to the head that we can aim for in future moves.\n\nCurrent head: (5,5)\n\nAdjacent cells:\n- Left (L): (4,5) - no food\n- Right (R): (6,5) - but can't move R (opposite of current L)\n- Up (U): (5,6) - no food\n- Down (D): (5,4) - no food\n\nSo no immediate food to eat in one move. But let's see if moving in a certain direction can set us up to eat food in the next moves.\n\nFood locations:\n1. (2,6) - life_span: 3\n2. (4,1) - life_span: 5\n3. (3,1) - life_span: 8\n\n(2,6) is at top left, (4,1) and (3,1) are at bottom.\n\nFrom head (5,5):\n- To reach (2,6): need to go left and up\n- To reach (4,1) or (3,1): need to go left and down\n\nCurrently moving L, so continuing L might help reach (4,1) or (3,1).\n\nIf we move L to (4,5), next moves could be L to (3,5), then D to (3,4), etc., heading towards (3,1).\n\nAlternatively, moving U to (5,6), then could go L towards (2,6), but (2,6) has life_span 3, and it's turn 18, so it disappears at turn 18 + 3 = 21. To reach (2,6) from (5,5):\n- Path: L to (4,5), U to (4,6), L to (3,6) - but (3,6) is a wall, can't go there.\nAlternative path: U to (5,6), L to (4,6), L to (3,6) - again hits wall.\nSo seems (2,6) is blocked by wall at (3,6).\n\nSo (2,6) is not reachable in time.\n\nNow, (4,1) and (3,1):\nFrom (5,5), moving L to (4,5), then D to (4,4), D to (4,3), D to (4,2), D to (4,1) - eats (4,1) at turn 18 + 4 = 22, but (4,1) life_span is 5, so disappears at 18 + 5 = 23, so can reach it.\n\nSimilarly, to reach (3,1):\nFrom (5,5), L to (4,5), L to (3,5), D to (3,4), D to (3,3), D to (3,2), D to (3,1) - takes 6 moves, turn 18 + 6 = 24, but life_span is 8, so disappears at 18 + 8 = 26, so can reach it.\n\nBetween (4,1) and (3,1), (4,1) is closer (4 moves vs 6), but both are reachable within their life spans.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe also need to check if moving in a certain direction could lead to a situation where the head is adjacent to the tail with positive food on the tail cell, which would kill the snake if eaten.\n\nCurrent tail is at (6,2). Is there positive food on the tail? No, the foods are at (2,6), (4,1), (3,1), none on (6,2).\n\nSo no immediate danger from tail reward.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that:\n- Moving L, U, D are all safe in the immediate move.\n- No immediate food to eat in one move.\n- Best strategy seems to head towards the closest food, which is (4,1) (can reach in 4 moves) or (3,1) (6 moves).\n- Starting with L seems good to start heading towards the left where the foods are.\n\nBetween L, U, D:\n- L is continuing current direction, heading towards food.\n- U and D are safe but not directly helpful towards food.\n\nSo best immediate action is to continue Left.\n\n### Verifying No Better Option\n\nIs there a better immediate move than L? \n\nIf we move U or D, we're not making progress towards food, and the snake is already positioned to go left towards the food. Moving U or D would just delay reaching the food without any benefit.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter considering all possibilities, the best immediate action is to continue moving Left.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

This means the last move was to the left, so the snake can't instantly reverse to Right (R) next.\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (2, 6): value=2, life_span=1\n2. (4, 1): value=4, life_span=1\n3. (3, 1): value=7, life_span=1\n4. (6, 1): value=10, life_span=1\n\nAll foods have a life_span of 1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4,5) and moving Left (L), the possible moves are Up (U), Down (D), or continue Left (L). We can't go Right (R) because that would be an instant reverse.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Left (L)**: Move to (3,5)\n   - Check for walls: (3,5) is not a wall (border walls are x=0,7; y=0,7; internal is (3,6))\n   - Check for body collision: \n     - Snake body is at (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)\n     - (3,5) is not in the body, so safe.\n   - Check for food: No food at (3,5).\n   - This move is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: Move to (4,6)\n   - Check walls: (4,6) is not a wall (internal obstacle is at (3,6))\n   - Check body collision: \n     - (4,6) is not in the body.\n   - Check food: No food at (4,6).\n   - Safe move, no food.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: Move to (4,4)\n   - Check walls: (4,4) is not a wall.\n   - Check body collision: \n     - Body is at (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)\n     - (6,4) is part of the body, but (4,4) is not, so safe.\n   - Check food: No food at (4,4).\n   - Safe move, no food.\n\nHmm, none of the immediate moves lead to food directly. But let's think about the food positions and how we might reach them in future turns.\n\n### Analyzing Food Positions\n\nAll foods have life_span=1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn. So, if we don't eat any this turn, they'll be gone next turn.\n\nLet's see which foods we can potentially eat this turn:\n\n1. (2,6): value=2\n   - Current head is at (4,5). To reach (2,6) in one move, we'd need to move left to (3,5) then up to (2,6), but that's two moves. Can't reach in one move.\n   \n2. (4,1): value=4\n   - From (4,5), to reach (4,1) in one move, we'd need to move down 4 steps, which is impossible (only one move per turn).\n   \n3. (3,1): value=7\n   - Similarly, can't reach in one move from (4,5).\n   \n4. (6,1): value=10\n   - From (4,5), can't reach (6,1) in one move.\n\nSo, none of the foods are adjacent to the head right now, meaning we can't eat any this turn. They'll all disappear after this turn.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe \"Tail Reward Danger\" is when the head is adjacent to the tail, and the tail cell has positive food. Eating it would make the head and new tail collide.\n\nOur tail is at (6,3). Is the head adjacent to the tail?\n\nHead is at (4,5), tail at (6,3). Adjacent means one move away:\n- (4,5) to (6,3): difference is +2 in x, -2 in y. Not adjacent (adjacent would be one coordinate differing by 1).\n  \nSo, no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Deciding the Move\n\nSince we can't eat any food this turn, and all foods will disappear next turn, our primary goal is to move safely to a position where we can potentially find new food in future turns.\n\nPossible moves: L, U, D.\n\nLet's see which is safest and positions us best for future moves.\n\n1. Left (L) to (3,5):\n   - Next turn, from (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), or continue L to (2,5).\n   - (3,6) is an internal obstacle (wall), so can't go U.\n   - So next moves would be D or L.\n\n2. Up (U) to (4,6):\n   - Next turn, from (4,6), possible moves: L to (3,6) (wall), R to (5,6), or D to (4,5).\n   - D to (4,5) is where the body is now, but by then the body would have moved, so (4,5) would be empty unless the tail is there.\n   - Current body: after moving U, the body becomes (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4). Tail was at (6,3), which moves to (6,4), so (6,3) is freed.\n   - So next head position is (4,6), body is (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4).\n   - Moving D to (4,5): (4,5) is the first body segment, so that's a collision. Can't do that.\n   - So next moves would be R to (5,6).\n\n3. Down (D) to (4,4):\n   - Next turn, from (4,4), possible moves: L to (3,4), R to (5,4), or U to (4,5).\n   - U to (4,5): body after moving D is (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4). So (4,5) is body, can't go there.\n   - So next moves would be L or R.\n\nBetween these, moving Left seems safe and keeps us near the center, which might be better for accessing future foods. Moving Up brings us closer to the top wall and the internal obstacle, limiting future moves. Moving Down is also safe but might not be better than Left.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nSince all foods will disappear after this turn, and none are reachable this turn, the best move is to choose a safe direction that doesn't limit future options too much. Moving Left seems reasonable here.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 20  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 6)\n\n**Snake Positions**: [(3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4)]  \nThis means:\n- Head: (3, 5)\n- Body segments: (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4)\n- Tail: (6, 4)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: L (Left)  \nThis means the snake was moving left in the previous move, so it came from (4,5) to (3,5).\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (2, 6): value=1, life_span=1\n2. (4, 1): value=3, life_span=1\n3. (3, 1): value=6, life_span=1\n4. (6, 1): value=9, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3,5), the snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Left (L), the snake cannot instantly reverse to Right (R) on the next move. So, possible moves are U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L): (3,5) → (2,5)\n- New head position: (2,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is a wall, but (2,5) is not a wall.\n  - Body: Snake body is [(4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)]. (2,5) is not in this list.\n- Food at (2,5)? No, the foods are at (2,6), (4,1), (3,1), (6,1).\n- Safe move, but no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U): (3,5) → (3,6)\n- New head position: (3,6)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is a wall, but (3,6) is not a wall.\n    - Internal obstacle: (3,6) is an internal obstacle! So this is a wall collision.\n  - Body: (3,6) is not in the body segments.\n- Collision with internal wall at (3,6), so this move is deadly.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D): (3,5) → (3,4)\n- New head position: (3,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is a wall, but (3,4) is not a wall.\n  - Body: (3,4) is not in the body segments.\n- Food at (3,4)? No.\n- Safe move, but no food eaten.\n\n#### 4. Move Right (R): Not allowed because it's the opposite of current direction (L).\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's look at the food items to see if any are reachable or pose a risk:\n\n1. (2,6): value=1, life_span=1\n   - Adjacent to head (3,5)? (2,6) is left and up from (3,5). Distance is (3-2=1, 6-5=1), so it's diagonally adjacent, not directly adjacent (no move can reach it in one step).\n   \n2. (4,1): value=3, life_span=1\n   - Distance from (3,5): (4-3=1, 1-5=-4). Not reachable in one move.\n   \n3. (3,1): value=6, life_span=1\n   - Distance from (3,5): (3-3=0, 1-5=-4). Not reachable in one move.\n   \n4. (6,1): value=9, life_span=1\n   - Distance from (3,5): (6-3=3, 1-5=-4). Not reachable in one move.\n\nNone of the foods are directly reachable in the next move. Also, none are under the snake's body segments that could be eaten by moving away and then back (since the head can't reach them next turn).\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food:\n- Tail is at (6,4).\n- Adjacent to head (3,5)? Distance is (6-3=3, 4-5=-1), not adjacent (must be within 1 in both x and y).\n- So no tail reward danger.\n\n### Possible Moves Summary\n\nFrom above, possible safe moves are:\n- Left (L): (2,5) - safe, no food.\n- Down (D): (3,4) - safe, no food.\n- Up (U): (3,6) - deadly (wall).\n- Right (R): not allowed.\n\nBetween L and D, which is better?\n\nLooking ahead:\n- If we go Left to (2,5), next moves could be Left to (1,5), Down to (2,4), or Up to (2,6) (but (2,6) has food with value=1).\n- If we go Down to (3,4), next moves could be Left to (2,4), Down to (3,3), or Right to (4,4) (but Right is allowed then since current direction would be Down).\n\nNeither immediately gets food, but Left might allow us to go Up next to (2,6) for food, but that food has only value=1 and life_span=1, so it might disappear next turn (since countdown decreases this turn, life_span goes from 1 to 0).\n\nAlternatively, Down to (3,4) doesn't seem to lead to any immediate food either.\n\nGiven that, both moves are equally safe with no immediate benefit. Maybe Left is slightly better because it moves the snake towards the left where there's more space (right side has the body extending to (6,5) and (6,4)).\n\n### Decision\n\nAfter evaluating, the safest moves are Left or Down, with no immediate food benefit. Between the two, Left seems slightly better to keep the snake moving in its current direction and avoid potential future body collisions.\n\nTherefore, the immediate action is:\n\n\\boxed{L}",

However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No instant reverse**: Since the current direction is Left (L), the snake cannot immediately go Right (R) in the next move. So, possible moves are U, D, L.\n\n2. **Wall and Obstacle Collision**: The snake cannot move into a wall or an internal obstacle.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Left (L) - Current Direction\n- Current head: (2, 5)\n- New head position: (2-1, 5) = (1, 5)\n- Check:\n  - Is (1,5) a wall? No (walls are x=0,7; y=0,7).\n  - Is (1,5) an internal obstacle? No (only (3,6) is an obstacle).\n  - Is (1,5) part of the snake's body?\n    - Snake body segments: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)\n    - (1,5) is not in the body, so safe.\n- Outcome: Valid move.\n\n#### 2. Up (U)\n- New head position: (2, 5+1) = (2, 6)\n- Check:\n  - Is (2,6) a wall? y=7 is wall, y=6 is not.\n  - Is (2,6) an obstacle? No (obstacle is at (3,6)).\n  - Is (2,6) in body? No.\n- Outcome: Valid move.\n\n#### 3. Down (D)\n- New head position: (2, 5-1) = (2, 4)\n- Check:\n  - Is (2,4) a wall? No.\n  - Is (2,4) an obstacle? No.\n  - Is (2,4) in body? No.\n- Outcome: Valid move.\n\n#### 4. Right (R)\n- Not allowed because it's the opposite of current direction (L).\n\n### Evaluating Valid Moves for Optimal Action\n\nWe have three valid moves: L, U, D. Now, let's evaluate which is the best based on food proximity and potential risks.\n\n**Food Positions**:\n1. (4,1) - life_span=3\n2. (3,1) - life_span=5\n3. (6,1) - life_span=8\n\nThe snake is currently at y=5, and all food is at y=1. So, the snake needs to move downward to reach the food.\n\n**Distance to Food**:\n- To reach any food, the snake needs to move down (decrease y-coordinate).\n- Moving Left (L) keeps the snake at y=5, not helpful for reaching food.\n- Moving Up (U) takes the snake further away from food (y=6).\n- Moving Down (D) is the only move that gets the snake closer to food.\n\n**Potential Path to Food**:\nFrom (2,5), moving Down to (2,4), then can continue down to (2,3), (2,2), (2,1). But the closest food is at (3,1) and (4,1), so from (2,1), would need to move right to reach them.\n\nHowever, we must also consider the tail and potential collisions when growing.\n\n**Tail Reward Danger**:\nThis is when the head is adjacent to the tail, and the tail cell has positive food. Eating that food would make the snake grow, and the new tail would collide with the head.\n\nCurrently:\n- Tail is at (6,5).\n- Head is at (2,5), not adjacent to tail (distance is 4 in x-direction).\n- So, no immediate danger from this rule.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Access\n\nIs there any food that can be eaten in the next move?\n\nCurrent head is at (2,5). Adjacent cells:\n- Left: (1,5) - no food.\n- Up: (2,6) - no food.\n- Down: (2,4) - no food.\nSo, no immediate food to eat in the next move.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nGiven that:\n- Moving Down gets us closer to the food.\n- Moving Left keeps us at the same y-level, not helpful.\n- Moving Up takes us away from food.\n\n**Best Move**: Down (D)\n\n### Verifying for Safety\n\nAfter moving Down to (2,4):\n- Next possible moves from (2,4) would be L, D, R (can't go U, opposite of D).\n- Continuing down is safe to approach food.\n\nNo immediate risks in moving Down.\n\n### Considering Life Span of Food\n\nAll foods have life_span >=3, so they won't disappear immediately. The closest in terms of life is (4,1) with life_span=3, but it's not the closest spatially. Given the distances, we have time to reach them.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe most strategic immediate move is to head towards the food by moving Down.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state of the game and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 22  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is from (1,1) to (6,6) excluding internal obstacles)\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 6)\n\n**Snake Positions**:  \nHead at (2, 4), then body segments at (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5)  \nSo the snake is 5 segments long.\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Down (D).  \nThis means the last move was Down, so the head moved from (2, 5) to (2, 4).\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (4, 1), value=1, life_span=2\n2. (3, 1), value=1, life_span=4\n3. (6, 1), value=1, life_span=7\n4. (5, 4), value=1, life_span=10\n\nAll food items are positive (+1 reward, +1 length).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (2, 4), moving Down (D) would go to (2, 3).  \nBut the current direction is D, so the opposite is U (Up), which is not allowed next (no instant reverse).  \nSo possible moves: Left (L), Right (R), or continue Down (D).\n\nLet's check each:\n\n1. **Down (D)**: (2, 4) → (2, 3)\n   - Check walls: y=3 is not a wall (walls are y=0,7)\n   - Check body: (2,3) is not in snake body [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]\n   - Safe move.\n   - Food at (2,3)? No food there.\n   - So this is a safe move but doesn't eat food.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: (2, 4) → (1, 4)\n   - Check walls: x=1 is not a wall (walls are x=0,7)\n   - Check body: (1,4) not in snake body\n   - Safe move.\n   - Food at (1,4)? No.\n   - Safe but no food.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: (2, 4) → (3, 4)\n   - Check walls: x=3 is not a wall\n   - Check body: (3,4) not in snake body\n   - Safe move.\n   - Food at (3,4)? No.\n   - Safe but no food.\n\nHmm, none of the immediate moves lead to food. But let's think ahead. Maybe we can position ourselves to get food in the next steps.\n\n### Looking at Food Positions\n\nFoods:\n1. (4,1), life=2\n2. (3,1), life=4\n3. (6,1), life=7\n4. (5,4), life=10\n\nThe food at (5,4) is closest to the head (distance of |5-2| + |4-4| = 3).  \nOthers are at y=1, which is further.\n\nLet's see how to reach (5,4):\n\nFrom (2,4), to reach (5,4), need to move Right thrice: R, R, R.\n\nBut after first R to (3,4), then R to (4,4), then R to (5,4).\n\nBut food at (5,4) has life=10, so it will last until turn 22 + 10 = 32.\n\nIs there any risk in moving towards it?\n\nLet's simulate:\n\nCurrent turn: 22\nMove R to (3,4) at turn 23\nMove R to (4,4) at turn 24\nMove R to (5,4) at turn 25 - eat food, length becomes 6, new tail is where? Original tail is at (5,5), after moving, tail moves to (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) - wait no, let's see:\n\nOriginal snake: [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]\nAfter R to (3,4): [(3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)], tail (5,5) is gone\nAfter R to (4,4): [(4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5)]\nAfter R to (5,4): [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5)], then eat food, so length +1: new segment added where? The tail was at (2,5), so new tail is (2,5), snake is [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,5)]? Wait no, when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so it's [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (old tail was (2,5), so new tail is (2,5), but that would mean two (2,5), which is not possible. Maybe the tail stays, and the new segment is added at the head's position after moving, but the tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nWait, the rule is: when you eat, length +1, so the tail doesn't move that turn. So normally, the tail moves forward, but when eating, it doesn't.\n\nSo after moving to (5,4), normally tail would be (2,5) moves to (3,5), but since we eat, tail stays at (2,5), and new segment is added at head's new position, which is (5,4), but that's already the head. Maybe the new segment is added where the head was before moving, but that's (4,4). So snake becomes [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (4,4)]? That doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe the new segment is added at the tail's position, but tail doesn't move, so it's like the tail stays, and the new segment is the old tail. So snake becomes [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,5)] - two (2,5), which is collision.\n\nThis seems like the \"Tail Reward Danger\" case: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and new tail collide.\n\nIs the head adjacent to tail before eating? At turn 25, before eating, snake is [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5)]. Tail is at (2,5). Is (5,4) adjacent to (2,5)? Adjacent means same x and y differs by 1 or same y and x differs by 1. (5,4) and (2,5): x diff is 3, y diff is 1, not adjacent (must be one coordinate same and other differs by 1). So not adjacent, so no Tail Reward Danger.\n\nBut the tail is at (2,5), head at (5,4), not adjacent. So eating is safe.\n\nBut let's see if there's a better option.\n\nOther foods:\n(4,1), life=2: disappears at turn 24\n(3,1), life=4: disappears at turn 26\n(6,1), life=7: disappears at turn 29\n(5,4), life=10: disappears at turn 32\n\n(5,4) is the most reachable, others are at y=1, which is far.\n\nAlternative plan: go down to (2,3), then left to (1,3), then down to (1,2), then right towards (3,1) or (4,1), but (4,1) disappears at turn 24, so by turn 24 we'd be at (1,2), then turn 25 to (2,2), turn 26 to (3,2), then down to (3,1) at turn 27, but (3,1) disappears at turn 26, so too late.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) disappears at turn 24, to reach it by turn 24:\nFrom (2,4):\nturn 22: D to (2,3)\nturn 23: L to (1,3)\nturn 24: D to (1,2) - but (4,1) is at turn 24, can't reach in time.\n\nSo can't get (4,1) or (3,1) in time.\n\n(6,1) is at turn 29, but it's at (6,1), which is x=6, y=1. To reach\n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{S}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 23  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 6)\n\n**Snake Positions** (head first): [(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5)]  \nThis means:\n- Head at (2, 3)\n- Body segments at (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)\n- Tail at (4,5)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: D (Down)  \nThis means the snake was moving Down in the previous move.\n\n**Food Items** (each with (x, y, life_span, value)):\n1. (4, 1, 1, 1) - positive food at (4,1), life span 1, value +1\n2. (3, 1, 3, 1) - positive food at (3,1), life span 3, value +1\n3. (6, 1, 6, 1) - positive food at (6,1), life span 6, value +1\n4. (5, 4, 9, 1) - positive food at (5,4), life span 9, value +1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Down (D), the snake cannot instantly reverse to Up (U) on the next move. So, possible moves are D, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D) - (2,3) to (2,2)\n- New head position: (2,2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is at y=0, so (2,2) is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: (3,6) is not (2,2).\n  - Body collision: Snake body is at [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)]. (2,2) is not in this list.\n- Safe move.\n- Check for food at (2,2): No food listed there.\n- After moving, the tail (4,5) moves forward, so the new body will be [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5)]. The tail (4,5) is gone.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) - (2,3) to (1,3)\n- New head position: (1,3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is at x=0, so (1,3) is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: (3,6) is not (1,3).\n  - Body collision: (1,3) is not in [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)].\n- Safe move.\n- Check for food at (1,3): No food listed there.\n- New body: [(1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5)]. Tail (4,5) is gone.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) - (2,3) to (3,3)\n- New head position: (3,3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is at x=7, so (3,3) is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: (3,6) is not (3,3).\n  - Body collision: (3,3) is not in [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)].\n- Safe move.\n- Check for food at (3,3): No food listed there.\n- New body: [(3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5)]. Tail (4,5) is gone.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable soon and worth targeting.\n\nCurrent head at (2,3). Food positions:\n1. (4,1) - distance: |4-2| + |1-3| = 2 + 2 = 4\n2. (3,1) - distance: |3-2| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n3. (6,1) - distance: |6-2| + |1-3| = 4 + 2 = 6\n4. (5,4) - distance: |5-2| + |4-3| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nAll foods are positive (+1 value). Life spans:\n- (4,1): 1 turn left (will disappear after this turn)\n- (3,1): 3 turns left\n- (6,1): 6 turns left\n- (5,4): 9 turns left\n\nThe food at (4,1) will disappear after this turn, so unless we can reach it this turn (which we can't since we're at (2,3)), it's not reachable.\n\nNext closest is (3,1) with distance 3. Let's see a path to (3,1):\n\nFrom (2,3):\n- Option 1: Right to (3,3), then Down to (3,2), then Down to (3,1) - total 3 moves.\n- Option 2: Down to (2,2), Left to (1,2), but that's not helpful.\n  \nSimilarly, (5,4) is distance 4:\nFrom (2,3):\n- Right to (3,3), Right to (4,3), Right to (5,3), Up to (5,4) - but (5,4) is the tail's current position (4,5) will move to (3,5), so (5,4) is safe to eat next turn if we're at (5,3).\n\nBut we have to be careful about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake. Currently, tail is at (4,5), head is at (2,3), not adjacent (distance is |4-2| + |5-3| = 2 + 2 = 4), so no danger now.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nGiven that the food at (3,1) is the closest with 3 turns left, let's aim for it. To start moving towards (3,1):\n\nFrom (2,3), the first move should be Right to (3,3), then Down to (3,2), then Down to (3,1).\n\nAlternatively, if we go Down to (2,2), then Left to (1,2), that's not helpful. Or Right to (3,2), but from (2,3), Right is to (3,3).\n\nSo first move should be Right to (3,3).\n\n### Verifying Safety of Right (R) Move\n\nMove Right to (3,3):\n- New head: (3,3)\n- Body: [(3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5)]\n- Tail was at (4,5), which moves away, so no collision.\n- No walls or obstacles at (3,3).\n- No food at (3,3) to eat.\n\nSafe move that starts us towards (3,1).\n\n### Other Considerations\n\nIs there any immediate food we can eat? No, none of the foods are at (2,2), (1,3), or (3,3).\n\nIs there any risk in moving Down or Left? Moving Down to (2,2) is safe but doesn't help much in reaching food. Moving Left to (1,3) is safe but moves away from most food.\n\nRight seems the best to start heading towards (3,1).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the best immediate action is to move **Right (R)** to position (3,3), starting the path towards the food at (3,1).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

The possible moves are:\n- **Right (R)**: (x+1, y) → (4,3)\n- **Up (U)**: (x, y+1) → (3,4)\n- **Down (D)**: (x, y-1) → (3,2)\n\nCannot move Left (L) because that's the opposite of current direction (Right).\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for safety and food opportunities.\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (4,3)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is the right border, so (4,3) is safe.\n  - Body: Current body segments are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5). (4,3) is not in these, so safe.\n  \n- Food at (4,3)? No, no food is listed there.\n  \n- Next moves after Right: If we go Right now, next turn we can't go Left (opposite), so options would be R, U, D.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (3,4)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is top, (3,4) is safe.\n  - Body: (3,4) is not in the body segments, safe.\n  \n- Food at (3,4)? No.\n  \n- Next moves after Up: Can't go Down next turn.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (3,2)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is bottom, (3,2) is safe.\n  - Body: (3,2) is not in the body segments, safe.\n  \n- Food at (3,2)? No, but there's food at (3,1) which is one more step down.\n  \n- Next moves after Down: Can't go Up next turn.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable soon:\n\n1. (3,1): value=1, life_span=3\n   - Currently at turn 24, so disappears at turn 27.\n   - To reach (3,1), need to go Down twice: (3,3)→(3,2)→(3,1)\n   - But after first Down to (3,2), next move can't be Up, so must go Down again to (3,1).\n   - However, after eating at (3,1), the tail is at (3,5), and the new tail would be where the second body segment was, which is (2,3). So no immediate collision.\n   - But is the food at (3,1) under the snake's body? Let's see:\n     - Current body: (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5)\n     - (3,1) is not under the snake, so can be eaten directly by moving head there.\n     - No \"Tail Reward Danger\" because the tail is at (3,5), not adjacent to head at (3,1).\n\n2. (6,1): value=1, life_span=5\n   - Disappears at turn 29.\n   - To reach (6,1) from (3,3):\n     - Need to go Right three times: (3,3)→(4,3)→(5,3)→(6,3), then Down to (6,2), then Down to (6,1).\n     - That's 5 moves, but life_span is 5, so it would disappear at turn 29, and we're at 24, so can reach by turn 29 (just in time).\n     - But seems risky to go for it now; maybe not the best immediate move.\n\n3. (5,4): value=1, life_span=8\n   - Disappears at turn 32.\n   - To reach from (3,3):\n     - Right to (4,3), then (5,3), then Up to (5,4).\n     - 3 moves, plenty of time.\n\n### Immediate Priorities\n\nAt turn 24, the food at (3,1) disappears at turn 27, so we have 3 turns to eat it (including current turn). It's the most urgent.\n\nTo eat (3,1):\n- First move Down to (3,2).\n- Next turn (25), move Down to (3,1) to eat it.\n\nThis seems safe and maximizes score by eating positive food.\n\nOther moves:\n- Right to (4,3): no immediate benefit, but keeps options open.\n- Up to (3,4): moves away from food, not optimal.\n\n### Checking for Dangers\n\nIs there any danger in moving Down to (3,2)?\n- Next move would be Down to (3,1) to eat.\n- After eating, snake grows by 1, so new tail is where the old tail was at the time of eating.\n- Current tail is (3,5), which is not adjacent to (3,1), so no \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down (D) towards the food at (3,1), which is about to disappear soon, ensuring we don't miss out on the point.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 25\n\n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. This means the grid is 8x8 (from (0,0) to (7,7)), and the snake can't go beyond these borders.\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 6). The snake can't move into this cell.\n\n**Snake Positions**: \n- Head: (3, 2)\n- Body segments: (3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)\n  \nSo, the snake's body is as follows:\n- Head at (3, 2)\n- Next segment at (3, 3)\n- Then (2, 3)\n- Then (2, 4)\n- Tail at (2, 5)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: D (Down). This means the snake was moving downward in the previous turn.\n\n**Food Items**:\nEach food is represented as (x, y, life_span, value). All foods have a value of +1 (positive food), and their remaining life spans are:\n1. (3, 1): life_span = 2\n2. (6, 1): life_span = 4\n3. (5, 4): life_span = 7\n4. (1, 3): life_span = 10\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Down (D), the snake cannot instantly reverse to Up (U) on the next turn. So, possible moves are D, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D)\n- Current head: (3, 2)\n- Move Down: (3, 1)\n  \nCheck for collisions:\n- Walls: y=0 is a wall, but (3,1) is y=1, so no wall collision.\n- Body segments: \n  - (3, 3) - not (3,1)\n  - (2, 3) - not (3,1)\n  - (2, 4) - not (3,1)\n  - (2, 5) - not (3,1)\n  - Tail is at (2,5), moving to (2,4) next turn, so no collision.\n  \nCheck for food:\n- (3,1) is a food with value +1.\n  \nEating this food:\n- The head moves to (3,1), which is food.\n- The snake grows by +1, so a new segment is added where the tail was (but the tail moves forward, so the new segment is added at the position before the tail moves).\n  \nBut we need to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- Is the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food on the tail cell?\n  - Head is at (3,2), tail is at (2,5). Adjacent means sharing a side (up, down, left, right), not diagonally.\n  - Distance: |3-2| + |2-5| = 1 + 3 = 4, not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1).\n  - So no tail reward danger here.\n  \nSo moving Down to (3,1) is safe and eats positive food.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L)\n- Current head: (3, 2)\n- Move Left: (2, 2)\n  \nCheck for collisions:\n- Walls: No walls at (2,2).\n- Body segments:\n  - (3,3) - not (2,2)\n  - (2,3) - adjacent to (2,2), but not the same cell.\n  - (2,4) - not (2,2)\n  - (2,5) - not (2,2)\n  - Tail is at (2,5), moving to (2,4), so no collision.\n  \nCheck for food:\n- No food at (2,2).\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R)\n- Current head: (3, 2)\n- Move Right: (4, 2)\n  \nCheck for collisions:\n- Walls: No walls at (4,2).\n- Body segments:\n  - None at (4,2).\n  \nCheck for food:\n- No food at (4,2).\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- **Down (D)**: Eats positive food at (3,1), safe, no tail reward danger.\n- **Left (L)**: Safe, no food.\n- **Right (R)**: Safe, no food.\n\nEating food is beneficial (+1 score, +1 length), so Down is the best choice here.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger Again\n\nJust to be thorough, let's confirm the tail reward danger:\n- After moving Down, head is at (3,1), tail is at (2,5) (but actually, after growth, the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is at (2,5), and the segment before that is (2,4), etc.\n- The new head is (3,1), new tail is (2,5). Are they adjacent? No, distance is |3-2| + |1-5| = 1 + 4 = 5, not adjacent.\n- Also, the food is at (3,1), not on the tail cell (which is (2,5)), so no issue.\n\n### Other Considerations\n\nAre there any other foods that might be better to go for?\n- (6,1): life_span=4, current turn=25, will disappear at turn=29.\n- (5,4): life_span=7, disappears at turn=32.\n- (1,3): life_span=10, disappears at turn=35.\n  \nCurrent food at (3,1) disappears at turn=27 (current turn=25, life_span=2, so counts down this turn to 1, next turn to 0, gone at turn=27).\n\nIs it better to go for other foods now and come back to (3,1) next turn?\n- Next turn, (3,1) will have life_span=1, so can still be eaten at turn=26.\n- But if we don't eat it now, next turn we'd have to move to (3,1) from (3,2) again, which would require moving Down again, but then the direction would be D, and we'd have to avoid reversing from D to U, which isn't an issue here.\n  \nHowever, eating now is safe and doesn't preclude future moves. Also, the other foods are farther away:\n- (6,1): need to go right then down, but currently at (3,2), moving right to (4,2), then down to (4,1), then right to (5,1), then right to (6,1) - that's 3 turns, but life_span is 4, so possible.\n- (5,4): even farther.\n- (1,3): need to go left to (2,2), then left to (1,2), then up to (1,3).\n\nBut (3,1) is immediate and safe, so best to eat it now.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the best immediate action is to move Down (D) to eat the positive food at (3,1).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

So we need to think about setting up for future food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nLet's look at the food items:\n\n1. **(6,1)**: value=3, life_span=1\n   - Current turn is 26, so it disappears at turn 27.\n   - To reach (6,1) from (3,1):\n     - Need to move Right three times: (3,1)→(4,1)→(5,1)→(6,1)\n     - But life_span is 1, so it disappears next turn. Cannot reach it in time.\n   - Not viable.\n\n2. **(5,4)**: value=6, life_span=1\n   - Disappears at turn 27.\n   - From (3,1), need to go:\n     - Right to (4,1), then Up to (4,2), then Up to (4,3), then Right to (5,3), then Up to (5,4)\n     - That's 4 moves, but life_span is 1. Cannot reach in time.\n   - Not viable.\n\n3. **(1,3)**: value=9, life_span=1\n   - Disappears at turn 27.\n   - From (3,1), possible path:\n     - Left to (2,1), then Up to (2,2), then Left to (1,2), then Up to (1,3)\n     - 3 moves, but life_span is 1. Cannot reach in time.\n   - Not viable.\n\nHmm, none of the current food can be eaten in the next move or even in time before they disappear. So the immediate goal is to stay alive and position for potential future food.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nSince no food is reachable now, let's think about where to position the snake for future opportunities. \n\nCurrent head at (3,1), moving Down (D). Next moves:\n\nOption 1: Left (L) to (2,1)\n- Then possible moves from (2,1):\n  - Current direction would be Left (since we moved Left), so can't go Right.\n  - Can go Left to (1,1) or Down to (2,0) (but y=0 is wall), or Up to (2,2).\n  - So possible: Left to (1,1) or Up to (2,2).\n\nOption 2: Right (R) to (4,1)\n- Then possible moves from (4,1):\n  - Current direction Right, can't go Left.\n  - Can go Right to (5,1), Down to (4,0) (wall), or Up to (4,2).\n  - So possible: Right to (5,1) or Up to (4,2).\n\nBetween Left and Right, which is better?\n\nLooking at the snake's body:\n- Body segments: (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n- Moving Left to (2,1) brings the head closer to the body segments at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5).\n- Moving Right to (4,1) moves away from the body.\n\nMoving Right seems safer as it moves the head away from the body, reducing the chance of future collisions.\n\n### Checking Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any food under the tail that could be dangerous?\n- Tail is at (2,5). Is there food at (2,5)?\n- Food positions: (6,1), (5,4), (1,3) — none at (2,5).\n- So no immediate danger from tail food.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween Left and Right:\n- Left moves towards the body, which might limit future moves.\n- Right moves away from the body, giving more space.\n- Neither leads to immediate food, but Right seems safer for future moves.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

So, last move was to the right (from (3,1) to (4,1)).\n\n3. **Food**:\n   - Three food items:\n     - (6,1): value=1, life_span=2\n     - (5,4): value=1, life_span=5\n     - (1,3): value=1, life_span=8\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (4,1), current direction is Right (R).

But the tail is at (2,4), so (3,1) is not the tail; it's the second segment. So moving Left would collide with the body — invalid.\n\nThus, valid moves are:\n- Up (U): (4,2)\n- Right (R): (5,1)\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\n**Option 1: Up (U) to (4,2)**\n- Check if (4,2) is occupied by body or wall:\n  - Body segments: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4) — none at (4,2).\n  - Walls: not a wall.\n- Check for food at (4,2): No food listed there.\n- After moving, the new snake positions would be:\n  - Head: (4,2)\n  - Body: (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3) — tail (2,4) is removed.\n- No immediate reward, just moving.\n\n**Option 2: Right (R) to (5,1)**\n- Check (5,1):\n  - Not in body segments.\n  - Not a wall.\n- Food at (6,1) is two steps to the right; not directly reachable now.\n- After moving:\n  - Head: (5,1)\n  - Body: (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3)\n- No immediate reward.\n\n**Option 3: Left (L) to (3,1)**\n- As discussed, this would collide with the body at (3,1) — invalid.\n\n**Option 4: Down (D) to (4,0)**\n- y=0 is a wall — invalid.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nLet's see where the foods are relative to the head at (4,1):\n\n1. (6,1): value=1, life_span=2\n   - Current distance: |6-4| + |1-1| = 2 (right twice).\n   - To reach it, need to move Right twice: (4,1)→(5,1)→(6,1).\n   - But life_span is 2, meaning it disappears after 2 more turns (including current turn). So if we move Right now, next turn it will have life_span=1, then gone. So we can reach it by moving Right now and Right next turn.\n\n2. (5,4): value=1, life_span=5\n   - Distance: |5-4| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n   - Need to move Right then Up three times, etc. Not immediately reachable.\n\n3. (1,3): value=1, life_span=8\n   - Distance: |1-4| + |3-1| = 3 + 2 = 5.\n   - Far away, not immediately relevant.\n\n### Potential Plan\n\nThe most promising is to go for (6,1):\n- Move Right now to (5,1), then Right next turn to (6,1) to eat it before it disappears.\n\nBut let's check if moving Right now to (5,1) is safe:\n- Next position: (5,1)\n  - Not a wall, not in body.\n- Then next move would be Right to (6,1):\n  - (6,1) is not in body (current body after moving to (5,1) is (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3)).\n  - Not a wall (x=7 is wall, but x=6 is fine).\n  - Eating (6,1) would grow the snake, adding a new segment where the tail was (2,3), so new tail would be (3,1) — no immediate collision.\n\nAlternative is moving Up to (4,2):\n- Then next moves could be towards other foods, but (6,1) will disappear soon.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Under Head or Adjacent\n\nIs there food under the head or adjacent that can be eaten now?\n- Head is at (4,1).

The snake's body is at [(4,1), (3,1), ...], so (6,1) is clear.\n    - So eating (6,1) is safe.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, can eat +1 food.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (5, 2)\n- **Position**: (5, 2)\n- **Check Walls**: Not a wall.\n- **Check Body Collision**:\n  - Snake body: (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3)\n  - (5,2) is not in the body.\n- **Food Check**:\n  - No food at (5,2).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, no food.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (5, 0)\n- **Position**: (5, 0)\n- **Check Walls**:\n  - y=0 is a wall, so (5,0) is a wall.\n  - **Invalid**: Would collide with wall.\n- **Conclusion**: Invalid move.\n\n### Comparing Valid Moves\n\nWe have two valid moves:\n1. Right (R) to (6,1): eat +1 food, safe.\n2. Up (U) to (5,2): no food, safe.\n\nOther foods are:\n- (5,4): value=4, but moving right doesn't help reach it soon.\n- (1,3): value=7, but far away.\n- (4,6): value=10, but also far.\n\nGiven that the food at (6,1) has a life_span=1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. So it's now or never for that food.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nFor the food at (6,1):\n- After eating, new head at (6,1), new tail stays at (2,3).\n- Distance between (6,1) and (2,3) is not adjacent (as calculated above), so no danger.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Right (R) to eat the +1 food at (6,1) before it disappears, and it's safe to do so.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n   - Internal obstacle at (3, 6).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3)].\n   - Current direction: Right (R).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (5,4): value=3, life_span=1.\n   - (1,3): value=6, life_span=1.\n   - (4,6): value=9, life_span=1.\n\n### Snake's Current Position and Possible Moves\n\nThe snake's head is at (6,1), moving Right (R). From the current direction (R), the possible moves are:\n- **Right (R)**: (7,1) → But x=7 is a wall → Invalid (collision).\n- **Up (U)**: (6,2).\n- **Down (D)**: (6,0) → y=0 is a wall → Invalid.\n  \nSince we can't reverse direction instantly (from R to L is a reverse), the only possible moves are:\n- Up (U) to (6,2).\n- Left (L) to (5,1) → But (5,1) is the second segment of the snake's body → Collision unless it's the tail that's moving away.\n\nWait, let's check the snake's body segments after the head:\n- (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3).\n\nMoving Left to (5,1): (5,1) is the second segment. Normally, moving into a body segment is deadly, but if it's the tail, and the tail moves away, it's okay. Here, the tail is at (2,3), so (5,1) is not the tail → Collision if we move left. So Left is invalid.\n\nThus, the only valid move is Up (U) to (6,2).\n\nBut let's double-check if (6,2) is safe:\n- Is (6,2) a wall? No, walls are at x=0,7; y=0,7; and (3,6).\n- Is (6,2) in the snake's body? Let's see the body segments:\n  - (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3) → No (6,2) here → Safe.\n\n### Checking for Food at (6,2)\n\nIs there any food at (6,2)? Looking at the food positions:\n- (5,4), (1,3), (4,6) → No food at (6,2).\n\nSo moving Up doesn't eat any food, but it's the only safe move.\n\n### Are There Other Possible Moves?\n\nWait, is Left completely invalid? Let me think again about moving Left to (5,1):\n- The snake's body is [(6,1), (5,1), ...].\n- Moving Left would place the head at (5,1), which is currently occupied by the second segment.\n- After the move, the tail (last segment) moves away, so the body becomes [(5,1), (6,1), (5,1), ...] Wait no, the tail is at (2,3), which moves to (3,3) (since the segment before tail is (3,3)).\nWait, the snake's body is:\nHead: (6,1)\nNext: (5,1)\nThen: (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3) (tail).\n\nIf head moves to (5,1), then the new body is:\n[(5,1), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] and tail (2,3) is removed.\nBut now (5,1) is both the head and the third segment → Collision. So Left is indeed invalid.\n\nSimilarly, Right is a wall, Down is a wall, so only Up is valid.\n\n### Is There Any Risk in Moving Up?\n\nMoving Up to (6,2):\n- No food there.\n- Next turn, the snake's head will be at (6,2), and the tail will have moved from (2,3) to (3,3), so the body will be:\n  [(6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)].\n\nFrom (6,2), possible moves would be U to (6,3), D to (6,1) (but (6,1) is the next segment → collision unless it's the tail), L to (5,2), R to (7,2) (wall).\n\n(6,1) is the second segment, not the tail (tail is at (3,3)), so Down would be invalid next turn unless the tail moves there, but it's not.\n\nSo moving Up now seems safe, but we're not gaining any points. However, it's the only safe move.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nIs there a way to reach any food safely? Let's see the food positions:\n1. (5,4): value=3, life=1 (will disappear next turn).\n   - From (6,1), to reach (5,4):\n     - Need to go Left to (5,1), but that's invalid as we saw.\n     - So can't reach it this turn.\n2. (1,3): value=6, life=1.\n   - From (6,1), to reach (1,3):\n     - Need to go Left multiple times, but first Left is invalid.\n3. (4,6): value=9, life=1.\n   - From (6,1), to reach (4,6):\n     - First move Up to (6,2), then next turn can go Up to (6,3), then Left to (5,3), etc., but food will disappear by then (life=1).\n\nSo none of the food can be reached this turn safely.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any positive food adjacent to the tail that could be dangerous?\nTail is at (2,3). Adjacent cells:\n- (1,3), (3,3), (2,2), (2,4).\nFood at (1,3): value=6 (positive).\nIf the head were adjacent to (2,3) and (1,3) is positive food, eating it could be dangerous if it causes the head and new tail to collide. But currently, head is at (6,1), not adjacent to tail (distance is |6-2| + |1-3| = 4 + 2 = 6), so no danger here.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe move is Up (U) to (6,2). All other moves lead to collisions or walls.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the scenario:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls.\n   - Internal Obstacle: There's one at (3, 6).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]\n   - Current direction: U (Up, meaning the head is moving towards increasing y).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (5, 4): value=2, life_span=1\n   - (1, 3): value=5, life_span=1\n   - (4, 6): value=8, life_span=1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake's body to understand possible movements:\n\n- Head at (6, 2), moving Up (U) means next move would be to (6, 3) unless we change direction.\n- Body segments: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n\nFood locations:\n- (5,4): 2 points, disappears after 1 more turn.\n- (1,3): 5 points, disappears after 1 more turn.\n- (4,6): 8 points, disappears after 1 more turn.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (6,2) and direction U, possible moves are:\n\n1. **Continue Up (U)**: (6,3)\n   - Check if (6,3) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: y=3 is not a border (y=0 and y=7 are borders).\n     - Not an internal obstacle: (3,6) is the only internal obstacle, not (6,3).\n     - Not part of the body: Check snake positions:\n       - (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) — none at (6,3).\n     - Valid move.\n   - Food at (6,3)? No food listed there.\n   - Next head position: (6,3), body follows.\n\n2. **Turn Left (L)**: (5,2)\n   - Current direction is U, so L is allowed (not opposite, which would be D).\n   - Check (5,2):\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not an obstacle.\n     - Not in body: (6,1), (5,1), etc. — (5,2) not listed.\n     - Valid move.\n   - Food at (5,2)? No.\n   - Next head position: (5,2).\n\n3. **Turn Right (R)**: (7,2)\n   - Check (7,2):\n     - x=7 is a border wall — invalid, would collide with wall.\n   - Cannot move R.\n\n4. **Reverse (D)**: (6,1)\n   - Opposite of current direction U, which is not allowed.\n   - Cannot move D.\n\nSo, possible valid moves: U or L.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\nNow, let's evaluate U and L based on food and future possibilities.\n\n**Move U to (6,3)**:\n- No immediate food.\n- Next possible moves from (6,3):\n  - Continue U to (6,4): \n    - Check food: (5,4) is at (5,4), not (6,4).\n    - (6,4) is valid (no walls, obstacles, or body).\n  - Turn L to (5,3):\n    - No food.\n    - Valid.\n  - Turn R to (7,3):\n    - x=7 is wall — invalid.\n- From (6,3), can move U or L next turn.\n- Not gaining any points now, but positioning for future.\n\n**Move L to (5,2)**:\n- No immediate food.\n- Next possible moves from (5,2):\n  - Current direction would be L, so can't reverse to R immediately.\n  - Continue L to (4,2):\n    - No food.\n    - Valid.\n  - Turn U to (5,3):\n    - No food.\n    - Valid.\n  - Turn D to (5,1):\n    - (5,1) is body segment — would collide.\n    - Invalid.\n- From (5,2), can move L or U next turn.\n- Also not gaining points now.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nAll foods have life_span=1, meaning they disappear after this turn if not eaten now.\n\nFoods:\n1. (5,4): 2 points\n   - Distance from head (6,2):\n     - Manhattan distance: |6-5| + |2-4| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n     - Cannot reach in one move.\n2. (1,3): 5 points\n   - Distance: |6-1| + |2-3| = 5 + 1 = 6.\n   - Cannot reach.\n3. (4,6): 8 points\n   - Distance: |6-4| + |2-6| = 2 + 4 = 6.\n   - Cannot reach.\n\nThus, none of the foods can be eaten this turn directly by moving the head onto them in one move.\n\nHowever, there's a special case where food can be under the snake's body. Let's check if any food is under the snake's body:\n\nSnake body positions:\n- (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n\nFood positions:\n- (5,4): not under body.\n- (1,3): not under.\n- (4,6): not under.\n\nNo food is under the snake's body currently.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food.\n\nTail is the last segment: (3,3).\nAdjacent to head (6,2):\n- Adjacent means |x1-x2| + |y1-y2| = 1.\n- |6-3| + |2-3| = 3 + 1 = 4 ≠ 1.\n- Not adjacent.\n\nNo danger from tail reward.\n\n### Deciding Between U and L\n\nBoth moves are safe in terms of not colliding and not eating food under the body. Neither can reach food this turn. So, we need to consider which move positions us better for future food collection.\n\nLooking at foods:\n- (5,4): 2 points, distance 3 from head.\n- (1,3): 5 points, distance 6.\n- (4,6): 8 points, distance 6.\n\n(5,4) is the closest. After moving U to (6,3), distance to (5,4) is |6-5| + |3-4| = 1 + 1 = 2.\nAfter moving L to (5,2), distance to (5,4) is |5-5| + |2-4| = 0 + 2 = 2.\n\nSame distance after both moves. But from (6,3), next move could be L to (5,3), then U to (5,4).\nFrom (5,2), next move could be U to (5,3), then U to (5,4).\n\nBoth paths take two moves to reach (5,4), but (5,4) disappears after this turn, so it won't be there next turn.\n\nThus, no immediate benefit in terms of food.\n\n### Checking for Future Paths\n\nPerhaps moving towards the center or areas with more open space is better to avoid getting trapped.\n\nCurrent snake is long (length 7), and part of it is at (3,1)-(3,3), which could block movements in that area.\n\nMoving U to (6,3) seems to keep more options open, as moving L to (5,2) brings us closer to the body at (5,1).\n\n### Potential Risks\n\nMoving L to (5,2):\n- Next move could be L to (4,2), then down to (4,1) is body, left to (3,2) is body, up to (4,3) is open.\n- Seems a bit constrained.\n\nMoving U to (6,3):\n- Next move U to (6,4), then can go L to (5,4) if food appears, or continue.\n- More open space upwards.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that both moves don't lead to immediate food and both are safe, moving Up seems slightly better as it keeps more options open in the upper part of the grid where there's less body congestion.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 31 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid and Walls:**\n- The grid is bounded by walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6.\n- There's an internal obstacle at (3, 6), meaning we can't move to that cell.\n\n**2. Snake:**\n- Positions (head first): [(6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)]\n  - Head is at (6, 3).\n  - The body segments follow: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2).\n  - Tail is at (3,2).\n- Current head direction: Up (\"U\"). This means the snake was moving upwards in the previous turn (from (6,2) to (6,3)).\n\n**3. Food:**\nThere are four food items:\n1. (5, 4): value = 1, life_span = 1\n2. (1, 3): value = 1, life_span = 4\n3. (4, 6): value = 1, life_span = 7\n4. (4, 4): value = 1, life_span = 10\n\nAll foods are positive (+1 reward, length increases by 1).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (6,3), moving \"U\" (up) would go to (6,4). But since the current direction is \"U\", we can't instantly reverse to \"D\" (down) to (6,2). So possible moves are:\n\n- **Up (U):** (6,4)\n- **Left (L):** (5,3)\n- **Right (R):** (7,3) → But x=7 is a wall, so invalid.\n  \nSo, valid immediate moves: U, L.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\n**Option 1: Up (U) to (6,4)**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (6,4) is within bounds (x=6 is okay, y=4 is okay).\n  - Body: Is (6,4) in the snake's body? Current body positions: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2). No, (6,4) is not in the body.\n- Food at (6,4)? No food listed there.\n- So, safe move, no food eaten.\n\n**Option 2: Left (L) to (5,3)**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (5,3) is within bounds.\n  - Body: Is (5,3) in the body? No.\n- Food at (5,3)? No food listed there.\n- So, safe move, no food eaten.\n\n**Option 3: Right (R) to (7,3)**\n- Invalid, hits wall at x=7.\n\n**Option 4: Down (D) to (6,2)**\n- Instantly reverses direction from \"U\" to \"D\", which is not allowed.\n- So, invalid.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable or beneficial to go towards:\n\n1. (5,4): life_span=1 (will disappear next turn if not eaten now)\n   - Distance from head (6,3): Manhattan distance is |6-5| + |3-4| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n   - To reach (5,4) in one move: need to move left to (5,3), then up to (5,4) next turn.\n   - But life_span is 1, so it disappears after this turn. Can't reach in one move, so can't eat it now.\n\n2. (1,3): life_span=4\n   - Distance: |6-1| + |3-3| = 5 + 0 = 5.\n   - Too far to consider immediately.\n\n3. (4,6): life_span=7\n   - Distance: |6-4| + |3-6| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n   - Also far.\n\n4. (4,4): life_span=10\n   - Distance: |6-4| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n   - Could be a target, but not immediately reachable.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if the tail is adjacent to the head and has positive food:\n- Tail is at (3,2).\n- Adjacent to head (6,3)? Manhattan distance: |6-3| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4. Not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1).\n- So, no danger from tail food.\n\n### Decision Between U and L\n\nBoth U and L are safe with no immediate food benefit. Which is better?\n\n- **Up (U) to (6,4):**\n  - Next turn, from (6,4), possible moves: U to (6,5), L to (5,4), R to (7,4) (wall).\n  - (5,4) has food that's disappearing now, so next turn it's gone.\n  - Maybe opens up more space.\n\n- **Left (L) to (5,3):**\n  - Next turn, from (5,3), possible moves: U to (5,4) (but food there is gone), L to (4,3), D to (5,2).\n  - (4,3) is empty, (5,2): check snake body - (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), etc. (5,2) is not in body, safe.\n  - Moves towards the center, which might be safer.\n\nGiven that moving left seems to keep us more centered and away from walls, which might be safer in the long run, and moving up doesn't offer immediate benefits, **Left (L)** seems slightly better.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Food\n\nThe food at (5,4) is tempting but can't be reached this turn (life_span=1). Other foods are too far to consider for immediate action.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating both possible moves (U and L), both are safe with no immediate food to eat. Moving left seems slightly better as it keeps the snake more centered.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Possible moves (cannot reverse to Right immediately):\n\n- **Left (L)**: Continue left to (4,3).\n- **Up (U)**: From (5,3) to (5,4).\n- **Down (D)**: From (5,3) to (5,2).\n\n### Checking Each Possible Move\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) to (4,3)\n- New head position: (4,3).\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (4,3) is not a wall.\n  - Body: Snake body is at (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). (4,3) is not in the body.\n- Food at (4,3)? No food there.\n- Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (5,4)\n- New head position: (5,4).\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (5,4) is not a wall.\n  - Body: (5,4) is not in the body.\n- Food at (5,4)? No.\n- Safe move, no reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (5,2)\n- New head position: (5,2).\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (5,2) is not a wall.\n  - Body: Snake body is at (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). (5,2) is not in the body.\n- Food at (5,2)? No.\n- Safe move, no reward.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nCurrently, none of the immediate moves lead to food. However, let's see where the food is and how we might reach it:\n\n1. **Food at (1,3)**:\n   - Current head at (5,3). To reach (1,3), need to move left 4 times.\n   - But food's life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn. Cannot reach it in time.\n\n2. **Food at (4,6)**:\n   - At (4,6), but there's an internal wall at (3,6). Not directly blocking, but need to navigate.\n   - Life_span is 1, will disappear after this turn. Current head is at (5,3). To reach (4,6):\n     - Need to go up three times and left once, which is impossible in one move.\n   - Cannot reach in time.\n\n3. **Food at (4,4)**:\n   - At (4,4), life_span is 1, will disappear after this turn.\n   - From (5,3), can reach (4,4) by moving left to (4,3) then up to (4,4), but that's two moves.\n   - Cannot reach in one move.\n\n### Conclusion on Immediate Moves\n\nNone of the immediate moves lead to food that can be eaten this turn. Therefore, the priority is to choose a safe move that doesn't lead to a dead end or trap.\n\n### Choosing the Safest Move\n\nAll three possible moves (L, U, D) are safe in terms of not colliding with walls or body this turn. However, we should consider future moves:\n\n- **Left (L) to (4,3)**:\n  - Next moves from (4,3): Can go L to (3,3), U to (4,4), D to (4,2).\n  - (3,3): Not a wall, not in body.\n  - (4,4): Has food (but will disappear after this turn, so next turn it's gone).\n  - (4,2): Safe.\n\n- **Up (U) to (5,4)**:\n  - Next moves from (5,4): Can go L to (4,4), R to (6,4), U to (5,5).\n  - (4,4): Food will be gone.\n  - (6,4): Safe.\n  - (5,5): Safe.\n\n- **Down (D) to (5,2)**:\n  - Next moves from (5,2): Can go L to (4,2), R to (6,2), D to (5,1).\n    - (6,2) is in body, so cannot go R.\n    - (5,1) is in body, but it's the tail. Normally, tail moves forward, so head can go to (5,1) if the tail moves away.\n    - Need to check if (5,1) is safe:\n      - Current tail is at (3,1). Next turn, tail will move from (3,1) to (?,?), but the segment before tail is at (4,1), so tail moves to (4,1).\n      - So (5,1) is currently occupied by (5,1), which is not the tail (tail is at (3,1)), so moving to (5,1) would collide with body.\n    - Therefore, cannot go D to (5,1).\n    - Can go L to (4,2) or R to (6,2) (but R is body).\n    - So only L to (4,2) is safe next move.\n\nGiven this, moving Down seems to limit future options more than moving Left or Up.\n\nBetween Left and Up:\n\n- Left leads to (4,3), then can go L to (3,3), which is safe.\n- Up leads to (5,4), then can go L to (4,4) (food gone), R to (6,4), or U to (5,5).\n\nBoth seem similarly safe, but moving Up might open more options next turn.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nSince all immediate moves are safe and no food is reachable this turn, I'll choose to move **Up** to keep more options open for the next turn.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

After eating, new tail will be at (4,1) (since length increases by 1, tail doesn't move).\n    - Next head position is (4,4), which is not adjacent to (4,1) (distance is 3 in y-coordinate).\n    - No immediate collision risk from tail.\n  - High reward, safe.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (6,4)\n\n- **Collision Check**:\n  - **Walls**: x=7 is a wall, but (6,4) is within bounds.\n  - **Body**: Check if (6,4) is in snake body.\n    - Current body: (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1).

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake at turn \\( t_0 = 34 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid Dimensions and Walls:**\n   - The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move outside these bounds.\n   - Internal obstacle: (3, 6). The snake cannot move into this cell.\n\n**2. Snake Details:**\n   - Positions (head first): [(4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)]\n     - Head at (4,4), tail at (4,1).\n   - Current direction: Left (L). This means the snake was moving left in the previous turn, so it cannot move right (opposite direction) in the next move.\n\n**3. Food Items:**\n   - (1, 3): value = 2, life_span = 1\n   - (4, 6): value = 4, life_span = 1\n   - (6, 5): value = 10, life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (4,4), current direction is Left (L). Possible moves (cannot reverse to Right):\n- Up (U): (4,5)\n- Down (D): (4,3)\n- Left (L): (3,4)\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n**1. Up (U) to (4,5):**\n   - Check if (4,5) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=4 is not 0 or 7; y=5 is not 0 or 7.\n     - Not an internal obstacle: (3,6) is not (4,5).\n     - Not part of the snake's body: Check all segments except tail (since tail moves).\n       - Current body: (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)\n       - (4,5) is not in this list.\n   - Safe move.\n   - Is there food at (4,5)? No.\n   - Next head position: (4,5), body becomes [(4,5), (4,4), (5,4), ..., (5,1)], tail (5,1) moves away from (4,1).\n\n**2. Down (D) to (4,3):**\n   - Check (4,3):\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not an obstacle.\n     - Not in body: (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), etc. — (5,3) and (6,3) are at y=3, but x is different.\n     - Wait, (5,3) is part of the body. Is (4,3) same as any body part?\n       - (5,3) is at x=5, y=3; (4,3) is different.\n     - So, safe.\n   - Food at (4,3)? No.\n   - Next head: (4,3), body: [(4,3), (4,4), (5,4), ..., (5,1)], tail moves from (4,1) to (5,1).\n\n**3. Left (L) to (3,4):**\n   - Check (3,4):\n     - Not a border wall (x=3 is not 0 or 7; y=4 is not 0 or 7).\n     - Internal obstacle is at (3,6), not (3,4).\n     - Not in body: (5,4), etc. — (5,4) is at x=5, y=4; (3,4) is different.\n     - Safe.\n   - Food at (3,4)? No.\n   - Next head: (3,4), body: [(3,4), (4,4), (5,4), ..., (5,1)], tail moves from (4,1) to (5,1).\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable or if moving towards food is beneficial.\n\nFood positions:\n1. (1,3): value=2, life=1\n   - Distance from (4,4): |4-1| + |4-3| = 3 + 1 = 4\n   - To reach in 1 move (since life=1), impossible. It will disappear next turn.\n2. (4,6): value=4, life=1\n   - Distance: |4-4| + |6-4| = 0 + 2 = 2\n   - Can't reach in 1 move (life=1), will disappear.\n3. (6,5): value=10, life=1\n   - Distance: |6-4| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n   - Can't reach in 1 move, will disappear.\n\nSo, none of the current food can be eaten this turn because their life spans are 1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn, and we can't reach them in one move from (4,4).\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food on the tail?\n\n- Tail is at (4,1).\n- Head is at (4,4).\n- Adjacent means one cell apart in x or y (not diagonal).\n- Distance: |4-4| + |4-1| = 0 + 3 = 3 → Not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1).\n- So, no tail reward danger.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nSince no food is reachable this turn, the goal is to avoid collisions and stay alive, possibly positioning for future food.\n\nCurrent options: U, D, L.\n\n- Up to (4,5):\n  - Next turn, from (4,5), possible moves: U (4,6), D (4,4), L (3,5), R (5,5).\n  - (4,6) is food (value=4), but it's disappearing this turn, so next turn it's gone.\n  - Other directions are safe.\n- Down to (4,3):\n  - Next turn from (4,3), moves: U (4,4), D (4,2), L (3,3), R (5,3).\n  - (5,3) is body, so cannot go R.\n  - U is back to (4,4) which is where the neck is, but since the body moves, it's okay (tail was at (4,1), now at (5,1)).\n- Left to (3,4):\n  - Next turn from (3,4), moves: U (3,5), D (3,3), L (2,4), R (4,4).\n  - R to (4,4) is where the neck is, but body moves, so okay.\n\nAll three moves seem safe. Which is best?\n\nLooking at future possibilities:\n- Up to (4,5): moves towards the top where there's an obstacle at (3,6), but not immediately problematic.\n- Down to (4,3): moves towards the bottom, where the tail is moving towards (5,1).\n- Left to (3,4): moves towards the left side, away from the long body on the right.\n\nLeft seems safe and opens space on the right where the body is long. Maybe better to move left to avoid getting boxed in by the body.\n\n### Verifying Left Move\n\nMove Left to (3,4):\n- New head: (3,4)\n- New body: [(3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)]\n- Tail was (4,1), now moves away (since the head was at (4,4), body moves forward).\n\nNo immediate collisions, and it moves away from the dense body area on the right.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, moving **Left (L)** seems the safest and most strategic choice to avoid potential future collisions and keep the snake alive.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

This means the snake cannot move outside the grid.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (3, 6).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented by the following coordinates in order from head to tail:\n     - Head: (2, 4)\n     - Body: (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1)\n   - **Direction**: The snake is currently moving left (\"L\"), meaning its head is at (2, 4) and was previously at (3, 4).\n4. **Food**:\n   - **Positive Food at (4, 6)**: Value = +1, Life Span = 3 turns.\n   - **Positive Food at (6, 5)**: Value = +1, Life Span = 8 turns.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nTo better visualize, let's sketch a simplified version of the grid:\n\n```\ny=7 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\ny=6 |   |   |   | X |   |   |   |   |  (X is internal wall at (3,6))\ny=5 |   |   |   |   |   |   | F |   |  (F is food at (6,5))\ny=4 |   | H | B | B | B | B |   |   |  (H is head at (2,4), B is body)\ny=3 |   |   |   |   | B |   | B |   |\ny=2 |   |   |   |   |   |   | B |   |\ny=1 |   |   |   |   |   |   | B |   |\ny=0 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n     x=0 x=1 x=2 x=3 x=4 x=5 x=6 x=7\n```\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position\n\nThe snake's head is at (2, 4), moving left (\"L\"). From the rules, the snake cannot make an instant reverse, meaning it cannot move right (\"R\") next since it's moving left now. So, possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (\"U\")**: (2, 5)\n2. **Down (\"D\")**: (2, 3)\n3. **Left (\"L\")**: (1, 4)\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move for safety (no collisions) and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Up (\"U\") to (2, 5)\n\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: (2,5) is not a wall (x=2 is not 0 or 7, y=5 is not 0 or 7).\n  - **Body**: Check if (2,5) is in the snake's body positions:\n    - Current body: (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)\n    - (2,5) is not in the body, so safe.\n- **Food**: \n  - (4,6) is too far to reach in one move.\n  - (6,5) is also not adjacent to (2,5).\n  - No immediate food to eat by moving up.\n  \n**Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate benefit.\n\n#### 2. Move Down (\"D\") to (2, 3)\n\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: (2,3) is not a wall.\n  - **Body**: Check if (2,3) is in the snake's body:\n    - (2,3) is not in the body segments listed.\n- **Food**:\n  - No food at (2,3).\n  \n**Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate benefit.\n\n#### 3. Move Left (\"L\") to (1, 4)\n\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: (1,4) is not a wall.\n  - **Body**: Check if (1,4) is in the snake's body:\n    - Not present in the body segments.\n- **Food**:\n  - No food at (1,4).\n  \n**Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate benefit.\n\n### Evaluating Food Accessibility\n\nNow, let's see if any food is accessible in the near future to plan a path towards it.\n\n1. **Food at (4, 6)**:\n   - Current position: (2,4)\n   - To reach (4,6), need to move right and up.\n   - Possible path: Right to (3,4), then up to (3,5), then right to (4,5), then up to (4,6).\n   - But (3,4) is the first body segment after the head, so moving right would collide with the body.\n   - Alternatively: Up to (2,5), then right to (3,5), then right to (4,5), then up to (4,6).\n   - This seems possible but takes multiple moves; food has a life span of 3 turns, so may disappear before we reach it.\n\n2. **Food at (6, 5)**:\n   - Current position: (2,4)\n   - To reach (6,5), need to move right and up.\n   - Possible path: Right to (3,4) (collision), so not immediate.\n   - Alternative: Up to (2,5), then right to (3,5), then right to (4,5), then right to (5,5), then right to (6,5).\n   - This is 5 moves, but food has a life span of 8 turns, so feasible.\n\nGiven that the food at (6,5) has a longer life span and is more reachable without immediate collision, it might be better to aim for it.\n\n### Immediate Action Decision\n\nGiven that all immediate moves (U, D, L) are safe but don't lead to food, we should choose a move that starts us on a path towards the more accessible food at (6,5). \n\nThe first step towards (6,5) is to move up to (2,5), then proceed right.\n\n**Chosen Action**: Move Up (\"U\")\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nOne special rule is the \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\n- Current tail is at (6,1).\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (5,1), (7,1), (6,0), (6,2).\n- Our head is at (2,4), not adjacent to tail, so no danger here.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the safest and most strategic immediate move is to go up to start navigating towards the food at (6,5).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

(1, 6): value = 10, life_span = 1\n   - Positive food, disappears after 1 more turn.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake's current direction is Up (U). The possible moves are U, L, R (cannot move Down because that's the opposite of current direction, which is not allowed).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: Move from (2,5) to (2,6)\n   - Check if (2,6) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: (2,6) is not in the wall list (border walls are y=0 and y=7, and internal obstacle is (3,6)).\n     - Not part of the snake's body: The body segments are (2,4), (3,4), etc.; (2,6) is not in the list.\n   - Food at (2,6)? No food is listed at (2,6).\n   - Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: Move from (2,5) to (1,5)\n   - Check (1,5):\n     - Not a wall: x=0 is a wall, but x=1 is not.\n     - Not part of the body: (1,5) is not in the snake's positions.\n   - Food at (1,5)? No food listed here.\n   - Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: Move from (2,5) to (3,5)\n   - Check (3,5):\n     - Not a wall: (3,6) is a wall, but (3,5) is not.\n     - Not part of the body: (3,5) is not in the snake's positions.\n   - Food at (3,5)? No food listed here.\n   - Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable in one move from the current head position (2,5):\n\n- (4,6): Distance from (2,5) is |4-2| + |6-5| = 2 + 1 = 3 (cannot reach in one move).\n- (6,5): Distance is |6-2| + |5-5| = 4 + 0 = 4 (cannot reach in one move).\n- (1,6): Distance is |1-2| + |6-5| = 1 + 1 = 2 (cannot reach in one move).\n\nNone of the foods are adjacent to the head, so we cannot eat any food this turn directly.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nSince no food is immediately accessible, we should choose a move that:\n- Keeps the snake safe (no collisions).\n- Potentially moves towards food for future turns.\n\nLooking at the foods:\n- (1,6) is to the left and up from (2,5). Moving Left (L) to (1,5) could be a step towards (1,6), but we'd need to move up next turn.\n- (4,6) is to the right and up. Moving Right (R) to (3,5) could be a step towards (4,6), but still two moves away.\n- (6,5) is to the right. Moving Right (R) to (3,5) is a step in that direction.\n\nAlternatively, moving Up (U) to (2,6) doesn't seem to lead directly towards any food, but it's safe.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe tail is at (6,2). The head is at (2,5), so the tail is not adjacent to the head (distance is |6-2| + |2-5| = 4 + 3 = 7). No danger here.\n\n### Decision\n\nAll three possible moves (U, L, R) are safe with no immediate reward. Moving Left or Right seems more strategic as they move the snake towards potential food locations for future turns. Between L and R:\n\n- Left (L) towards (1,6): Next turn from (1,5), could go Up to (1,6) to eat the food.\n- Right (R) towards (6,5): From (3,5), next could go Up to (3,6), but (3,6) is a wall. Then would need to go Right to (4,6), but that's two steps away.\n\nMoving Left seems more promising as it can reach (1,6) in two moves (L then U), whereas reaching (6,5) would take more moves with obstacles.\n\nHowever, (1,6) has a life_span of 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn. So by next turn, it will be gone. Therefore, moving Left won't help us reach (1,6) in time.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) and (6,5) also have life_span=1, so they will disappear after this turn. Hence, none of the foods will be available next turn.\n\nGiven that, the choice is arbitrary since no food can be reached in time. We can choose any safe move. Let's choose Right (R) to (3,5), which keeps the snake moving towards the center.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 38  \n**Grid Size**: Based on the border walls, it's an 8x8 grid (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).  \n**Internal Obstacle**: There's one at (3, 6).  \n**Snake Positions**: \n- Head: (3, 5)\n- Body: [(2, 5), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3)]  \n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Right (R).  \n**Food Items**:\n1.

(1, 6): value = 1, life_span = 9\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3, 5) moving Right (R), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (3, 6)\n- **Down (D)**: (3, 4)\n- **Left (L)**: (2, 5)\n- **Right (R)**: (4, 5)\n\nBut we must consider:\n- **No instant reverse**: Since the current direction is R, we cannot move Left (L) next, as that would be the opposite direction.\n  \nSo, valid immediate moves: U, D, R.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (3, 6)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is the top wall, but (3,6) is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacle: (3,6) is an obstacle! So, moving here would collide with the obstacle → deadly.\n  \n**Conclusion**: Not safe. Cannot move Up.\n\n#### 2. Move Down (D) to (3, 4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is the bottom, (3,4) is safe.\n  - Body segments: Current body is [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4), ...]. (3,4) is the 4th segment (counting from head as 0).\n    - The tail is at (6,3), which is moving forward, so unless the head moves to where the tail is and the tail doesn't move away, it's safe.\n    - Here, (3,4) is a body segment, but it's not the tail. The tail is at (6,3), so moving to (3,4) would collide with the body → deadly.\n  \n**Conclusion**: Not safe. Would collide with body at (3,4).\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (4, 5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is the right wall, (4,5) is safe.\n  - Body segments: Check if (4,5) is in the body.\n    - Current body positions: (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3). (4,5) is not in the body.\n  \n- Check for food:\n  - Food at (4,6), (6,5), (1,6). (4,5) has no food.\n  \n- Future implications:\n  - Moving right doesn't eat food, but it's safe.\n  - Next turn, from (4,5), possible moves would be U, D, R (can't go left to (3,5) unless direction changes).\n\n**Conclusion**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nLet's see if any food is reachable safely in the next move.\n\n1. Food at (4,6):\n   - Current head at (3,5). To reach (4,6), need to go Right then Up or Up then Right.\n   - But Up from (3,5) is blocked by obstacle at (3,6).\n   - So cannot reach (4,6) in one move.\n\n2. Food at (6,5):\n   - From (3,5), need to go Right three times to (6,5).\n   - Not reachable in one move.\n\n3. Food at (1,6):\n   - From (3,5), need to go Left twice then Up once.\n   - Not reachable in one move.\n\n**Conclusion**: No food is reachable in the immediate next move.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if the tail has positive food that could be dangerous:\n- Tail is at (6,3). Is there food at (6,3)? \n  - Food positions: (4,6), (6,5), (1,6). No food at (6,3).\n  \nSo, no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Life Span of Food\n\nAll foods have life_span = 1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn if not eaten. But none are reachable this turn, so they'll disappear regardless.\n\n### Best Move\n\nFrom the valid moves:\n- Up: blocked by obstacle.\n- Down: collides with body.\n- Right: safe, no collision.\n\nOnly possible safe move is Right.\n\n### Verifying No Better Options\n\nIs there any other consideration? Maybe waiting to see if a better path opens up next turn, but since we must make a move now, and Right is the only safe option, we have to choose that.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe only safe immediate action is to move Right.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 40  \n**Grid Size**: Based on the border walls, it's an 8x8 grid (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).  \n**Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (3, 6).  \n**Snake Positions**: The snake's body is represented by the following coordinates in order from head to tail:\n- Head: (5, 5)\n- Body: (4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4)\n  \nSo, the snake is currently moving to the **Right (R)**.\n\n**Food Items**:\n1.

Move Right (R) to (6, 5)\n- **Food Check**: There's a food at (6, 5) with value +1.\n  - Eating it would increase the snake's length by 1.\n  - The current tail is at (5, 4). After moving right, the tail would move forward, so the new tail would be at (4, 4).\n  - The head moves to (6, 5), and the new segment is added at (6, 5), making the new tail (4, 4).\n  - Is there a risk of Tail Reward Danger? The tail is at (5, 4), which is not adjacent to (6, 5) (adjacent means sharing an edge, so (6,5) is adjacent to (5,5), (6,4), (7,5), (6,6)). So no danger here.\n- **Collision Check**:\n  - Walls: (6,5) is within bounds (x=7 is border, so x=6 is fine; y=5 is fine).\n  - Body: The body segments are at (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4). (6,5) is not in this list, so no collision.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, can eat +1 food.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (5, 6)\n- **Food Check**: No food at (5, 6).\n- **Collision Check**:\n  - Walls: (5,6) is within bounds (y=7 is border, so y=6 is fine; x=5 is fine).\n  - Body: (5,6) is not in the body segments list.\n  - Internal Obstacle: (3,6) is not at (5,6).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no food to eat.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (5, 4)\n- **Food Check**: No food at (5, 4).\n- **Collision Check**:\n  - Walls: (5,4) is within bounds.\n  - Body: The tail is at (5,4), but since the tail will move forward (from (5,4) to (4,4)), moving to (5,4) is safe (head moves to where tail was, tail moves away).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no food to eat.\n\n### Comparing the Moves\n\n- **Right (R)**: Eats +1 food, safe.\n- **Up (U)**: Safe, no food.\n- **Down (D)**: Safe, no food.\n\nClearly, moving Right is the best option as it allows the snake to eat positive food without any risks.\n\n### Checking for Other Considerations\n\nIs there any reason not to move Right?\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: As calculated, the tail is not adjacent to the new head position after eating.\n- **Other Foods**: The other foods are at (1,6) and (2,4). \n  - (1,6): Far from current head, not immediately reachable.\n  - (2,4): Currently under the snake's body at segment (2,4). To eat this:\n    - The body must move away from (2,4), then head can move there. Currently, moving right doesn't help with this.\n    - Also, life_span is 10, so it will last until turn 50, plenty of time to consider later.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move **Right (R)** to eat the +1 food at (6,5) safely.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

No, food is at (1,6) and (2,4).\n   - Conclusion: Safe move, no food.\n\n2. **Move D (Down) to (6,4)**:\n   - Check for walls:\n     - (6,4) is not a border wall.\n     - Not an internal obstacle.\n   - Check for body collision:\n     - (6,4) is not in the body segments.\n   - Food at (6,4)? No.\n   - Conclusion: Safe move, no food.\n\n3. **Move R (Right) to (7,5)**:\n   - Check for walls:\n     - x=7 is a border wall, so (7,5) is a wall.\n     - Moving here would cause a wall collision → death.\n   - Conclusion: Not safe.\n\n### Checking for Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food can be eaten in the next move.\n\n- Food at (1,6): \n  - Current head is at (6,5). To reach (1,6), it's not possible in one move.\n- Food at (2,4):\n  - Current head is at (6,5). To reach (2,4), not possible in one move.\n  \nBut wait, there's a special case where food can be under the snake's body. Let's check:\n\n- The tail is at (5,4), and there's food at (2,4). \n  - The tail is at (5,4), food is at (2,4), so not under the tail.\n  - Other body segments: (2,4) is part of the body (6th segment in the list).\n     - So, food at (2,4) is under the snake's body.\n     - To eat it:\n       1. The body must move away from (2,4).\n       2. The head must move onto (2,4).\n     - Currently, the body is moving such that the tail is at (5,4), and the segment at (2,4) is part of the body.\n     - Next turn, if the snake moves, the tail will move from (5,4) to ...? \n       - The snake's movement will cause the tail to move forward based on the body's path. It's not straightforward to determine without simulating, but generally, the tail follows the body's previous path.\n     - To have the head reach (2,4), it would take multiple moves, not immediate.\n     - Also, the food is under the body, but not directly accessible in one move.\n  \nGiven that, we can't eat any food in the next immediate move.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a mention of \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\n- Tail is at (5,4).\n- Adjacent to head (6,5): \n  - (5,5) is adjacent (left), but tail is at (5,4), which is diagonally down-left, not directly adjacent (adjacent in grid terms are up, down, left, right).\n  - So, head is not adjacent to tail.\n- Even if it were, the tail cell (5,4) doesn't have food (food is at (2,4) and (1,6)).\n\nNo danger here.\n\n### Life Span of Food\n\nBoth foods have life_span = 1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn if not eaten. But since we can't eat them this turn, they'll disappear regardless of our move.\n\n### Deciding the Move\n\nWe have two safe moves: U or D.\n\n- Move U to (6,6):\n  - Next possible moves from (6,6): \n    - Current direction would be U, so can't move D next.\n    - Possible: L (5,6), R (7,6), U (6,7) - but y=7 is wall, so U is invalid.\n    - So next could be L or R.\n- Move D to (6,4):\n  - Next possible moves from (6,4):\n    - Current direction D, so can't move U next.\n    - Possible: L (5,4), R (7,4), D (6,3).\n    - L to (5,4): tail is currently at (5,4), but tail will move, so (5,4) might be free next.\n    - R to (7,4): x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n    - D to (6,3): valid.\n\nBetween U and D, both seem safe. Maybe choose one that keeps more options open next turn.\n\nMoving U to (6,6) leaves next moves L or R.\nMoving D to (6,4) leaves next moves L or D.\n\nLooking at the snake's body, moving D might be better because:\n\n- After moving D to (6,4), the tail moves forward, possibly freeing up space.\n- Moving U to (6,6) is closer to the top border, limiting space.\n\nBut both are safe. Let's choose D to keep closer to the center.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating, the safest moves are U or D. I'll choose D to (6,4).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

The possible moves are:\n\n- **Up (U)**: (6,4) → (6,5)\n- **Down (D)**: (6,4) → (6,3)\n- **Left (L)**: (6,4) → (5,4)\n- **Right (R)**: (6,4) → (7,4)\n\nHowever, we must consider:\n- **No instant reverse**: Since the current direction is Down (D), we cannot move Up (U) next.\n- **Wall Collisions**:\n  - Right (R) to (7,4): x=7 is a wall → invalid.\n  - Down (D) to (6,3): y=3 is not a wall → valid.\n  - Left (L) to (5,4): Not a wall → valid.\n  \nSo, valid immediate moves are **Down (D)** and **Left (L)**.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nLet's evaluate each valid move:\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D): (6,4) → (6,3)\n\n- **New Head Position**: (6,3)\n- **Body Check**: \n  - The body segments are [(6,5), (5,5), ..., (4,4)]. \n  - (6,3) is not in the body → no collision.\n- **Wall Check**: y=3 is not a wall → safe.\n- **Food Check**: \n  - No food at (6,3).\n  - The tail is at (4,4), so no tail reward danger.\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L): (6,4) → (5,4)\n\n- **New Head Position**: (5,4)\n- **Body Check**: \n  - (5,4) is not in the body → no collision.\n- **Wall Check**: Not a wall → safe.\n- **Food Check**: \n  - No food at (5,4).\n  - The tail is at (4,4), adjacent to (5,4). \n    - There is food at (2,4), but it's not on the tail (tail is at (4,4)) → no tail reward danger.\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions:\n\n1. **Food at (1,6)**:\n   - Current distance from head (6,4): \n     - Manhattan distance = |6-1| + |4-6| = 5 + 2 = 7.\n   - Life span: 5 turns.\n   - Not reachable within its life span (would take at least 7 moves, but disappears in 5).\n\n2. **Food at (2,4)**:\n   - Current distance from head (6,4):\n     - Manhattan distance = |6-2| + |4-4| = 4 + 0 = 4.\n   - Life span: 8 turns.\n   - Reachable within life span.\n   - Path to (2,4):\n     - One possible path: Left to (5,4), then Left to (4,4), then Left to (3,4), then Left to (2,4).\n     - This takes 4 moves, within the life span of 8.\n\nHowever, the food at (2,4) is currently under the snake's body segment at (2,4). According to the rules:\n- To eat food under the body:\n  1. The body must move away from the food cell.\n  2. Then, the head must move onto the food cell.\n\nCurrently, (2,4) is occupied by the snake's body (specifically, the 7th segment counting from the head). To move the body away from (2,4), the snake needs to move such that the tail moves forward, freeing up (2,4).\n\nGiven the snake's current length is 9, and the tail is at (4,4), moving the head will cause the tail to move forward by one cell. \n\nBut currently, the segment at (2,4) is not the tail; the tail is at (4,4). So moving the head won't immediately free up (2,4). \n\nTo free up (2,4), we'd need the tail to pass over it, which would require the snake to move in a way that the tail moves towards (2,4). Given the current body positions, this seems complex and may not be feasible within the food's life span.\n\n### Immediate Action Decision\n\nGiven that both immediate moves (Down and Left) are safe but don't lead to immediate food consumption, and the food at (2,4) is currently under the body and not immediately accessible, the priority is to avoid collisions and position the snake for future opportunities.\n\nBetween Down and Left:\n- Moving Down (D) to (6,3) keeps the snake moving downward, which may help in exploring other parts of the grid.\n- Moving Left (L) to (5,4) starts moving the snake towards the left side where the food at (2,4) is, but as discussed, it's not immediately accessible.\n\nGiven that moving Left doesn't immediately help in accessing the food and both moves are safe, either is acceptable. However, moving Down might be slightly better to explore new areas where new food might spawn.\n\nBut looking at the snake's body, moving Left to (5,4) would start aligning the snake towards the left side where the food is, even if it's not immediately accessible. This could be a step towards eventually reaching the food if the body moves away in subsequent turns.\n\nGiven that, moving Left seems like a small step towards the food's general direction, even if not immediately beneficial.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nOne critical rule is the \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our current state:\n- Tail is at (4,4).\n- Adjacent to tail: (3,4), (5,4), (4,3), (4,5).\n- Current head is at (6,4), not adjacent to tail.\n- If we move Left to (5,4), then the head is at (5,4), adjacent to tail at (4,4).\n- Is there food at (4,4)? No, food is at (2,4) and (1,6).\n- So no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating both options:\n- **Down (D)**: Safe, no immediate benefit.\n- **Left (L)**: Safe, starts moving towards food's general direction, no immediate danger.\n\nGiven that moving Left is a step towards the food's direction without immediate risks, it seems slightly more proactive.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

(6, 2): value = 1, life_span = 10\n\nAll foods are positive (+1 reward, +1 length).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,4), possible moves are:\n- U (Up): (5,5)\n- D (Down): (5,3)\n- L (Left): (4,4)\n- R (Right): (6,4)\n\nBut we cannot reverse the direction instantly. Current direction is L, so we cannot move R (Right) next.\n\nSo, allowed moves: U, D, L\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move U (Up) to (5,5)\n\nCheck if (5,5) is safe:\n- Is it a wall? No, walls are at borders and (3,6).\n- Is it part of the snake's body? Looking at snake positions: (6,5) is in the body, but (5,5) is also in the body (4th position in the list). So, moving to (5,5) would collide with the body. Deadly collision.\n  \n**Conclusion:** U is not safe.\n\n#### 2. Move D (Down) to (5,3)\n\nCheck (5,3):\n- Walls: Not at borders or (3,6).\n- Snake body: Check all body segments. None are at (5,3).\n  \nIs there food here? Check food positions: (1,6), (2,4), (6,2). No food at (5,3).\n\n**Conclusion:** D is safe, but no food to eat.\n\n#### 3. Move L (Left) to (4,4)\n\nCheck (4,4):\n- Walls: Not a wall.\n- Snake body: Check positions. (3,4) is the tail, but the tail will move forward when the head moves, so it's safe to move where the tail is currently (as the tail will no longer be there after the move).\n\nIs there food here? No, food is at (1,6), (2,4), (6,2). (2,4) is food, but we're moving to (4,4).\n\n**Special Case - Tail Reward Danger:**\nThe tail is at (3,4). Is the head adjacent to the tail and is there positive food on the tail?\n- Adjacent to tail: Current head is (5,4), tail is (3,4). They are two cells apart (left), not adjacent (adjacent would be one cell apart like (4,4)). So no adjacency here.\n  \nBut even if we consider that moving left to (4,4) makes the head adjacent to tail at (3,4), and there is food at (2,4), but (2,4) is not the tail's current position (tail is at (3,4)), so no danger from Tail Reward Danger.\n\n**Conclusion:** L is safe, no food to eat here.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable soon or if we should plan to go towards food.\n\nFoods:\n1. (1,6): life_span = 4 (will disappear at turn 47)\n2. (2,4): life_span = 7 (disappears at turn 50)\n3. (6,2): life_span = 10 (disappears at turn 53)\n\nCurrent head is at (5,4). Let's see paths to foods:\n\n- (1,6): From (5,4), need to go left to (4,4), then up to (4,5), but (4,5) is part of the body. Alternatively, up to (5,5) is body, left to (4,5) is body. Seems tricky to reach without colliding soon.\n  \n- (2,4): Currently at (5,4), need to go left to (4,4), then (3,4) (tail, will move), then (2,4). But (2,4) is food. So in two moves: L to (4,4), then L to (3,4) (tail moves), then L to (2,4) to eat. But need to ensure that when we reach (2,4), the tail has moved away.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (3,4). After first move L to (4,4), tail moves from (3,4) to ... let's see snake movement:\nCurrent snake: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)]\nAfter move L to (4,4), new head is (4,4), add to front, remove last (tail moves):\nNew snake: [(4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]\nTail was at (3,4), now at (2,4). So next move L to (3,4), then next L to (2,4) to eat. But (2,4) is the new tail position after first move, so moving to (2,4) would mean head goes to tail's current position, which is safe because tail moves away, but is there food there? Yes, (2,4) is food.\n\nBut Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake. After first move L to (4,4), tail is at (2,4). Next move to (3,4), then to (2,4). At that point, head is at (3,4), tail is at (2,4) (adjacent), and (2,4) has food. So eating it would be dangerous.\n\nThus, going for (2,4) seems risky.\n\n- (6,2): From (5,4), need to go right (but current direction is L, cannot reverse to R immediately), so next turn could go R. Alternatively, go D to (5,3), then can go R to (6,3), then D to (6,2). But that's two moves away.\n\nGiven that, immediate options are D or L, both safe but no immediate food.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween D and L:\n- D to (5,3): safe, no food, opens possibility to go right next turn towards (6,2).\n- L to (4,4): safe, no food, can then go L to (3,4), but then risk with (2,4) food.\n\nGoing D seems better as it avoids the risky path towards (2,4) and allows future movement towards (6,2).\n\n### Checking for Food Under Snake\n\nIs any food under the snake's body?\nFood positions: (1,6), (2,4), (6,2).\nSnake body: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4).\n(2,4) is food and is under the snake's body (specifically, the segment before the tail). To eat it, the body must move away and head move onto it, which is the risky path we're avoiding.\n\n### Final Choice\n\nBest immediate safe move is D (Down) to (5,3).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and determine the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n   - Internal Obstacle: (3, 6) is also a wall.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]\n   - Current direction: Down (D) — meaning the head was moving downwards in the previous move.\n4. **Food**:\n   - (1, 6): value=1, life_span=3\n   - (2, 4): value=1, life_span=6\n   - (6, 2): value=1, life_span=9\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me try to visualize the snake's position:\n\n- Head at (5,3)\n- Next segment at (5,4), then (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), tail at (2,4)\n\nFood is at:\n- (1,6)\n- (2,4) — this is interesting because the tail is at (2,4)\n- (6,2)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,3) and direction D (down), the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Continue Down (D)**: (5,2)\n   - Check if (5,2) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=5 is not a border, y=2 is not a border, and (5,2) is not an internal wall.\n     - Not part of the snake's body: Looking at the snake's positions, (5,2) is not listed.\n     - So, moving to (5,2) is safe in terms of not colliding with walls or body.\n   \n2. **Turn Left (L)**: (4,3)\n   - Check (4,3):\n     - Not a wall: x=4, y=3 are not borders, and (4,3) is not an internal wall.\n     - Not in snake's body: Checking the list, (4,3) is not there.\n     - Safe move.\n   \n3. **Turn Right (R)**: (6,3)\n   - Check (6,3):\n     - Not a wall: x=6 is not a border (though x=7 is), y=3 is not a border, and (6,3) is not an internal wall.\n     - Not in snake's body: (6,3) is not listed.\n     - Safe move.\n   \n4. **Up (U)**: (5,4)\n   - Current direction is D, so moving U is the reverse direction.\n   - Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n   - So, moving U is not allowed.\n\nThus, possible valid moves: D, L, R.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable or beneficial in these moves.\n\n1. **Food at (1,6)**:\n   - Far from the head (distance of |5-1| + |3-6| = 4 + 3 = 7), not immediately reachable.\n   \n2. **Food at (2,4)**:\n   - Current tail is at (2,4), and there's positive food there.\n   - Rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n   - Is the head adjacent to the tail?\n     - Head at (5,3), tail at (2,4).\n     - Distance: |5-2| + |3-4| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n     - Adjacent means distance of 1 (up, down, left, right), so no, not adjacent.\n   - So, no immediate danger from this food, but also not reachable in one move.\n   \n3. **Food at (6,2)**:\n   - Distance from head (5,3): |6-5| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n   - Can reach in two moves if we move right then down, or down then left, etc.\n   - Not directly reachable in one move from (5,3).\n\nSo, none of the foods are directly reachable in the next move. Therefore, the immediate goal is to move safely towards food or away from potential dangers.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nAre there any immediate dangers in the possible moves?\n\n1. **Move D (5,2)**:\n   - Next to (5,2), are there any body parts that could collide in future moves?\n   - Not immediately obvious, seems safe.\n   \n2. **Move L (4,3)**:\n   - Next to (4,3), any dangers?\n   - Snake's body includes (4,5), which is two steps away, no immediate collision.\n   \n3. **Move R (6,3)**:\n   - Next to (6,3), snake has (6,4) and (6,5).\n   - Moving to (6,3) is safe, but next move if we go up to (6,4), that's the body.\n   - But that's future planning, not immediate danger.\n\n### Path Towards Food\n\nLet's think about moving towards the nearest food (6,2):\n\n- From (5,3), to reach (6,2):\n  - One path: R to (6,3), then D to (6,2).\n  - Another path: D to (5,2), then R to (6,2).\n\nBoth require two moves. Which first move is better?\n\nOption 1: R then D\n- R to (6,3): safe.\n- Then D to (6,2): but (6,2) is food, and after eating, snake grows, so tail moves from (2,4) to (2,5).\n  - New tail is (2,5), which is not adjacent to head at (6,2), so safe.\n\nOption 2: D then R\n- D to (5,2): safe.\n- Then R to (6,2): same as above, safe to eat.\n\nBoth options seem equally good in terms of reaching the food safely.\n\nAlternatively, consider the food at (2,4):\n\n- Currently tail is at (2,4), and food is there.\n- To eat it, we'd need to move the tail away first, then move head there.\n- This seems more complicated and not immediately beneficial, especially since the food's life span is 6, so we have time.\n\n### Avoiding Future Collisions\n\nWe should also think about not boxing ourselves in.\n\nCurrent snake is quite long, and its body is in the upper part of the grid. Moving down seems to open more space.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that moving D or R both can lead us towards the food at (6,2) in two moves, and both are safe, which is better?\n\n- Moving R (right) to (6,3):\n  - Next move D to (6,2) to eat food.\n  \n- Moving D (down) to (5,2):\n  - Next move R to (6,2) to eat food.\n\nBoth are equivalent in steps, but moving R first might be slightly better because:\n\nAfter eating at (6,2), the snake grows, and the new tail is at (2,5). The head is at (6,2), which is far from the tail, so no immediate danger.\n\nAlternatively, moving D first to (5,2), then R to (6,2) is also safe.\n\nBut looking at the snake's body, moving R first might keep more options open for future moves.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Benefits\n\nIs there any immediate benefit to moving L (left) to (4,3)?\n\n- Not directly towards food, but maybe opens space.\n- Not immediately beneficial unless we're avoiding something, which we're not.\n\n### Final Choice\n\nBetween D and R, both are safe and lead equally to food. I think moving R first is slightly better because it aligns the head to be closer to the right side where the food is at (6,2).\n\n### Verifying No Tail Reward Danger\n\nWait, the food at (2,4) is under the tail. If we move in a way that the tail moves away and then head moves there, we could eat it, but that's more steps. Also, the head is not adjacent to the tail now, so no immediate danger from that rule.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter considering all options, the best immediate move is to go **Right (R)** to position (6,3), setting up to move down to (6,2) next to eat the food.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

(6, 2): value=1, life_span=8  \n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me try to visualize the snake's position:\n\n- Head at (6, 3), direction R (from left to right, so previous position was to its left, which is (5,3)).\n- The body winds around: from (5,3) to (5,4) up, then to (6,4) right, then (6,5) up, then (5,5) left, etc.\n\nFood positions:\n- (1,6): top-left area\n- (2,4): left side\n- (6,2): bottom-right, directly below the head\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (6,3) with direction R, the possible moves are:\n- U (Up): (6,4)\n- D (Down): (6,2)\n- L (Left): (5,3) - but this is opposite to current direction R, so cannot do this (no instant reverse).\n- R (Right): (7,3) - but x=7 is a wall, so cannot move here.\n\nSo, possible moves are U or D.\n\n### Evaluating Move U (Up to (6,4))\n\nCheck if (6,4) is safe:\n- Is it a wall? No, walls are at x=0,7 and y=0,7, and (3,6) is an obstacle, but (6,4) is clear.\n- Is it part of the snake's body? Let's see the body segments after the head:\n  (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), ... Wait, (6,4) is the 4th segment (counting head as 1st). So moving to (6,4) would collide with the body.\n\nSo, U is not safe (collision with body at (6,4)).\n\n### Evaluating Move D (Down to (6,2))\n\nCheck if (6,2) is safe:\n- Walls: y=2 is not a wall (walls are at y=0,7).\n- Obstacles: (3,6) is the only internal obstacle, not (6,2).\n- Body segments: Check if (6,2) is in the body list. The body is:\n  (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) - no (6,2), so safe.\n  \nAlso, is there food at (6,2)? Yes, the third food item is at (6,2), value=1, life_span=8.\n\n### Checking Food at (6,2)\n\nIf we move D to (6,2), we eat the food there. Let's check the rules:\n- It's positive food (+1 score, length increases by 1).\n- Tail Reward Danger: Is the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food at the tail?\n\nCurrent tail is the last segment: (2,5). Head is at (6,3), tail at (2,5). Distance is |6-2| + |3-5| = 4 + 2 = 6, not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1). So no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Other Considerations\n\nAre there any other immediate dangers or better options?\n- Only other possible move was U, which is unsafe.\n- Moving D is safe and gets us food.\n\n### Potential Future Moves After D\n\nAfter moving to (6,2), next turn:\n- New head position: (6,2)\n- New body: add (6,2) to front, remove tail (2,5) unless we ate food (which we did, so tail stays, length increases by 1).\n- New direction: D (since we moved down).\nPossible next moves would be L (left to (5,2)), R (right to (7,2) - wall), U (up to (6,3) - opposite to D, so no), so only L is possible next turn unless we can move D again (but (6,1) is y=1, not a wall yet, but need to see then).\n\nThis seems fine for now.\n\n### Checking Other Food\n\nIs there a better food to aim for?\n- (1,6): life_span=2, so will disappear in 2 turns, currently at turn 45, so gone by turn 47. It's far from head (distance |6-1| + |3-6| = 5 + 3 = 8), unlikely to reach in time.\n- (2,4): life_span=5, so gone by turn 50. Distance |6-2| + |3-4| = 4 + 1 = 5.

So, the snake cannot move outside these bounds.\n   - There's one internal obstacle at (3, 6).\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake's head is at (6, 2), moving downward (D).\n   - The body segments follow: [(6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5)].\n   - Current direction is D (down), meaning the last move was from (6, 3) to (6, 2).\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - (1, 6): value = 1, life_span = 1\n   - (2, 4): value = 1, life_span = 4\n   - (6, 3): value = 1, life_span = 10\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (6, 2) moving downward (D), the possible next moves are:\n- **Continue Down (D)**: (6, 1)\n- **Turn Left (L)**: (5, 2)\n- **Turn Right (R)**: (7, 2)\n  \nCannot move Up (U) because that would be an instant reverse from D to U, which is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D) to (6, 1)\n- Check for walls: y=1 is not a border wall (y=0 is), so (6,1) is within bounds.\n- Check for body collision: \n  - Current body segments: (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n  - (6,1) is not in this list, so no body collision.\n- Check for food: No food at (6,1).\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't collect any food.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (5, 2)\n- Check for walls: x=5 is within bounds, no internal obstacle at (5,2).\n- Check for body collision: \n  - (5,2) is not in the body segments list.\n- Check for food: No food at (5,2).\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't collect any food.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (7, 2)\n- Check for walls: x=7 is a border wall, so (7,2) is a wall. Cannot move here.\n  \nThis move is invalid due to wall collision.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nCurrently, the available foods are:\n1. (1, 6): value = 1, life_span = 1 (will disappear after this turn)\n2. (2, 4): value = 1, life_span = 4\n3. (6, 3): value = 1, life_span = 10\n\nLet's see if any of these can be reached safely in the next move:\n\n- **Food at (6, 3)**:\n  - Currently at (6,3) is the first body segment after the head.\n  - To eat this, the body must move away, and the head must move onto it.\n  - Currently, the head is at (6,2), moving down to (6,1) would not help in eating (6,3).\n  - To eat (6,3), the head would need to move to (6,3), but that's currently occupied by the body, and moving there would cause a collision unless the body moves away first.\n  - The body segment at (6,3) would move to (6,2) if the head moves down to (6,1), but then the head isn't on (6,3).\n  - Alternatively, if the head moves left to (5,2), the body at (6,3) moves to (6,2), but still no head movement to (6,3).\n  - It seems impossible to eat (6,3) in the next move.\n\n- **Food at (2, 4)**:\n  - Currently at (2,4), not adjacent to head (6,2).\n  - Distance is |6-2| + |2-4| = 4 + 2 = 6, cannot reach in one move.\n\n- **Food at (1, 6)**:\n  - At (1,6), not adjacent to head (6,2).\n  - Distance is |6-1| + |2-6| = 5 + 4 = 9, cannot reach in one move.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nThe tail is at (2,5). Is there positive food adjacent to the head where the tail is?\n- Head is at (6,2), tail at (2,5). They are not adjacent (distance is |6-2| + |2-5| = 4 + 3 = 7), so no immediate danger from tail reward.\n\n### Decision\n\nFrom the possible moves:\n- Down (D) to (6,1): safe, no food.\n- Left (L) to (5,2): safe, no food.\n- Right (R) to (7,2): invalid (wall).\n\nNeither safe move allows eating food immediately. Between D and L, which is better?\n\nLooking ahead:\n- Moving Down (D) to (6,1):\n  - Next possible moves from (6,1): D to (6,0) (wall), L to (5,1), R to (7,1) (wall).\n  - So only L is possible next, leading to (5,1).\n  \n- Moving Left (L) to (5,2):\n  - From (5,2), possible moves: D to (5,1), L to (4,2), R to (6,2) (but R would be opposite of current L, so only D and L are allowed unless we're considering the new direction).\n  \nBetween the two, moving Left seems slightly better because it opens up more options in the next move (can go down or left again), whereas moving down limits the next move to left only.\n\nHowever, both moves don't lead to immediate food, so it's a tie in terms of immediate benefit. \n\nGiven that, and considering that moving Left might position the snake better to reach the food at (2,4) in future moves (since it's moving towards the left side where (2,4) is), I'll choose Left.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

So, the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and the borders are walls.\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 6)\n\n**Snake Positions**: \nHead is at (5, 2), followed by body segments in this order:\n1. (5, 2) - Head\n2. (6, 2)\n3. (6, 3)\n4. (5, 3)\n5. (5, 4)\n6. (6, 4)\n7. (6, 5)\n8. (5, 5)\n9. (4, 5)\n10. (3, 5) - Tail\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Left (L).\n\n**Food Items**:\n1.

However, since it's currently moving Left, it cannot instantly reverse to Right (no instant reverse rule). So, possible moves are U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) - (x-1, y)\nCurrent head: (5, 2)\nNew head position: (4, 2)\n\nCheck for collisions:\n- Walls: x=0 is a wall, but (4,2) is not on any wall.\n- Body: Check if (4,2) is in snake body segments.\n  - Snake body: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n  - (4,2) is not in the body.\n- Food: Is there food at (4,2)? No.\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) - (x, y+1)\nCurrent head: (5, 2)\nNew head position: (5, 3)\n\nCheck for collisions:\n- Walls: y=7 is top wall, (5,3) is safe.\n- Body: Is (5,3) in body?\n  - Yes, (5,3) is the 4th segment.\n  - But wait, the tail is at (3,5), and the segment just before tail is (4,5). The tail will move forward when the head moves, so the current tail (3,5) will be vacated. However, (5,3) is not the tail; it's a body segment that won't move away. So moving into (5,3) would collide with the body.\n  \nThis move is unsafe due to body collision.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) - (x, y-1)\nCurrent head: (5, 2)\nNew head position: (5, 1)\n\nCheck for collisions:\n- Walls: y=0 is bottom wall, (5,1) is not on y=0 (since y=0 is wall, y=1 is safe).\n- Body: Is (5,1) in body? No.\n- Food: Is there food at (5,1)? No.\n\nThis move is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable in one move:\n\n1. Food at (2,4):\n   - Current head at (5,2). To reach (2,4) in one move, impossible (need at least two moves: e.g., left then up).\n   \n2. Food at (6,3):\n   - Current head at (5,2). To reach (6,3) in one move:\n     - From (5,2), right (R) to (6,2), then up to (6,3) - but that's two moves.\n     - Or from (5,2), up to (5,3), but (5,3) is already occupied by body (collision as seen above).\n     - Or from (5,2), right to (6,2), but (6,2) is the second segment - collision.\n   \n   So, cannot reach (6,3) in one move safely.\n\n### Checking Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food on the tail?\n\n- Tail is at (3,5).\n- Head is at (5,2). Distance: |5-3| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5. Not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1).\n  \nSo, no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Possible Moves Summary\n\nFrom above:\n- Left (L): safe, no food\n- Up (U): unsafe (body collision)\n- Down (D): safe, no food\n- Right (R): not allowed (reverse of current direction L)\n\nSo, safe moves are L and D. Both don't eat food. Which is better?\n\nLooking at future possibilities:\n- Moving Left to (4,2):\n  - Next moves could be towards food at (2,4) by going left then up.\n  \n- Moving Down to (5,1):\n  - Next moves could go left to (4,1), but not towards any food directly.\n\nMoving Left seems slightly better for future pathing towards (2,4).\n\n### Verifying Food at (6,3)\n\nWait, the food at (6,3) is on the body segment (6,3). Can we eat it?\n\nRules say:\n- Food can be under body but can only be eaten if:\n  1. Body moves away, and\n  2. Head moves onto the food cell.\n\nCurrently, (6,3) is a body segment. To eat it:\n- The body must move away from (6,3), meaning the segment at (6,3) must move to a new position.\n- Then, head must move to (6,3).\n\nBut the segment at (6,3) is preceded by (6,2), which is preceded by head at (5,2). If head moves right to (6,2), then (6,2) moves to (6,3), but (6,3) is already occupied by the next segment. So the body doesn't move away from (6,3); it's still occupied by the next segment.\n\nThus, cannot eat (6,3) in one move.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nSafe moves: Left or Down.\nBetween these, Left seems better for future pathing towards (2,4).\n\n**Action**: \\boxed{L}",

Possible moves (can't reverse direction immediately, so can't go Right):\n\n- Up (U): (4,2) -> (4,3)\n- Down (D): (4,2) -> (4,1)\n- Left (L): (4,2) -> (3,2)\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for safety and potential to reach food.\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (4,3)\n- Check if (4,3) is occupied by body or wall:\n  - Snake body: [(5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]\n    - (5,3) is at (5,3), (6,3) is at (6,3), etc. (4,3) is not in the body.\n  - Walls: (4,3) is not a wall (walls are at x=0,7, y=0,7 and (3,6)).\n- Safe to move to (4,3).\n- After moving, new head is at (4,3), tail moves forward, so last segment (4,5) is removed.\n- Food at (2,4) is still reachable in future moves (need to go left twice and up once from (4,3)).\n- Food at (6,3) is currently under body at (6,3), but after this move, the body segment at (6,3) might move, but not immediately helpful.\n\n#### 2. Move Down (D) to (4,1)\n- Check (4,1):\n  - Not in body: body is at y >= 2.\n  - Walls: y=0 is a wall, y=1 is not.\n- Safe to move to (4,1).\n- But moving down takes us away from both foods. Not optimal for scoring.\n\n#### 3. Move Left (L) to (3,2)\n- Check (3,2):\n  - Not in body.\n  - Walls: x=0 is wall, x=3 is not, but internal obstacle at (3,6), which doesn't affect (3,2).\n- Safe to move to (3,2).\n- Closer to food at (2,4): from (3,2), can go left to (2,2) then up to (2,3) then (2,4).\n- Food at (6,3) is still under body.\n\n### Evaluating Best Move\n\nBetween Up and Left:\n- Up: moves towards center, keeps options open, but not directly towards food.\n- Left: directly moves towards food at (2,4), which has a short lifespan (3 turns). Need to reach it quickly.\n\nFood at (2,4) is 2 left and 2 up from head (4,2):\n- Current distance: Manhattan distance = |4-2| + |2-4| = 2 + 2 = 4.\n- Lifespan is 3, so it will disappear in 3 turns (including current turn). So need to reach it in 2 more moves after this one.\n- After Left to (3,2), next move could be Left to (2,2), then Up to (2,3), but food is at (2,4), so need one more move, which would be after it disappears.\n- Alternatively, after Left to (3,2), could go Up to (3,3), then Left to (2,3), then Up to (2,4) - but that's 3 moves, food disappears after 3 turns (current is 48, disappears at 51, so moves at 48,49,50 - can reach at 50).\n\nBut current move is 48, next is 49, then 50. So can reach at 50 (turn 50), which is before it disappears at 51.\n\nPath:\n1. Turn 48: Left to (3,2)\n2. Turn 49: Up to (3,3)\n3. Turn 50: Left to (2,3)\n4. Turn 51: Up to (2,4) - but food disappears at 51, so too late.\nWait, no: lifespan is 3, current turn is 48, so disappears at 51, but countdown decreases every turn including current, so:\n- at turn 48: life_span=3\n- at turn 49: life_span=2\n- at turn 50: life_span=1\n- at turn 51: disappears\nSo to eat at turn 50, it's still there (life_span=1 at start of turn 50, then decreases to 0 at turn 51).\n\nSo path:\n1. Turn 48: Left to (3,2)\n2. Turn 49: Up to (3,3)\n3. Turn 50: Left to (2,3)\n4. Turn 51: Up to (2,4) - but food is already gone (disappeared at turn 51).\nWait, no, at turn 50, food is still there (life_span=1), so can eat at turn 50 by moving to (2,4) from (2,3).\n\nWait, no, at turn 50, if we're at (2,3), then move Up to (2,4) to eat at turn 50, which is before it disappears at turn 51.\n\nSo possible to reach it.\n\nAlternatively, if we go Up at turn 48 to (4,3), then path to (2,4):\n1. Turn 48: Up to (4,3)\n2. Turn 49: Left to (3,3)\n3. Turn 50: Left to (2,3)\n4. Turn 51: Up to (2,4) - but food disappears at 51, so can't eat.\n\nSo only Left at turn 48 allows reaching food at (2,4).\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail, and tail cell has positive food?\n- Tail is at (4,5).\n- Head is at (4,2), tail at (4,5): distance is |4-4| + |2-5| = 3, not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1).\n- So no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Decision\n\nBest move is Left to (3,2), as it allows reaching the positive food at (2,4) before it disappears, and is safe.\n\nOther food at (6,3) is under body now, and moving left doesn't help immediately, but we can consider it later after eating (2,4).\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

(2, 4): value=2, life_span=1\n2. (6, 3): value=7, life_span=1\n3. (5, 3): value=10, life_span=1\n\nWait a minute, the format seems a bit off for food. Earlier it was given as (x, y, value, life_span), but here it's (x, y, life_span, value). Assuming the order is (x, y, value, life_span), let's correct:\n\n1. (2, 4): value=1, life_span=2\n2. (6, 3): value=1, life_span=7\n3. (5, 3): value=1, life_span=10\n\nAll foods are positive (+1 value), and their life spans are decreasing each turn.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving Left (L). The possible moves are U, D, L, R, but we cannot reverse direction instantly (so no Right (R), since that's opposite to Left).\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Left (L)**: From (3,2) to (2,2)\n   - Check for walls: x=0 is a wall, but x=2 is not.\n   - Check for body collision: \n     - Snake body segments: (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)\n     - (2,2) is not in the body, so safe.\n   - Check for food at (2,2): No food listed there.\n   - So moving Left is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: From (3,2) to (3,3)\n   - Check walls: y=7 is wall, y=3 is fine.\n   - Internal obstacle at (3,6), but we're going to (3,3), so okay.\n   - Check body collision:\n     - (3,3) is not in the body segments.\n   - Check food at (3,3): No food there.\n   - Safe but no food.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: From (3,2) to (3,1)\n   - Check walls: y=0 is wall, y=1 is fine.\n   - Check body collision:\n     - (3,1) not in body.\n   - Check food at (3,1): No food.\n   - Safe but no food.\n\nHmm, none of the immediate moves lead to food. But let's look at the food positions:\n\nFoods:\n1. (2,4): life_span=2 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten now)\n2. (6,3): life_span=7\n3. (5,3): life_span=10\n\nThe food at (2,4) is about to disappear next turn. Is there a way to reach it?\n\nCurrent head at (3,2). To reach (2,4):\n- Need to go up twice and left once, or left then up twice, etc.\nBut we can only decide the immediate next move.\n\nFrom (3,2), to eventually reach (2,4), the first move could be Up to (3,3), then next turn can go Left to (2,3), then Up to (2,4). But the food at (2,4) will disappear after this turn (since its life_span is 2, and it's decreasing this turn to 1, then next turn to 0).\n\nSo we cannot reach (2,4) in time to eat it before it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, other foods:\n- (6,3): currently under the snake's body (part of the body at (6,3))\n  - To eat this, the body must move away, then head moves onto it.\n  - Currently, the segment after (6,2) is (6,3), then (5,3), etc.\n  - So (6,3) is occupied by the snake's body.\n  - To eat it, the tail would have to move away from (6,3), but the tail is at (5,5), which is far.\n  - Not immediately possible to eat (6,3).\n\n- (5,3): also under the snake's body (part of the body at (5,3))\n  - Similar issue as (6,3), cannot eat immediately.\n\nSo none of the foods can be eaten in the immediate next move. Therefore, the priority is to avoid collisions and stay alive.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nOur tail is at (5,5). Is the head adjacent to (5,5)?\n\nHead at (3,2), tail at (5,5). Distance is |3-5| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5, not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1). So no danger here.\n\n### Best Immediate Action\n\nSince no food can be eaten immediately, and all possible moves (U, D, L) are safe, we can choose any. But to optimize future possibilities, we might prefer moves that keep more options open.\n\n- Left (L): to (2,2)\n  - Next turn from (2,2), can't go R (reverse), can go U, D, L.\n- Up (U): to (3,3)\n  - Next turn from (3,3), can't go D, can go U, L, R.\n- Down (D): to (3,1)\n  - Next turn from (3,1), can't go U, can go D, L, R.\n\nUp seems slightly better as it moves towards the center where more food opportunities might arise, but all are equally safe here.\n\nAlternatively, since we're moving Left, continuing Left maintains consistency unless there's a reason to turn.\n\nGiven no immediate benefit to turning, continuing Left is fine.\n\n### Verifying Left Move\n\nMove Left to (2,2):\n- Not a wall.\n- Not in body.\n- No food.\nSafe.\n\n### Verifying Up Move\n\nMove Up to (3,3):\n- Not a wall.\n- Not in body.\n- No food.\nSafe.\n\n### Verifying Down Move\n\nMove Down to (3,1):\n- Not a wall.\n- Not in body.\n- No food.\nSafe.\n\n### Decision\n\nAll three possible moves are safe with no immediate food gain. Continuing Left is a reasonable default to maintain current path unless there's a reason to turn. \n\nHowever, looking at the snake's body, moving Left might eventually lead to more open space on the left side, whereas moving Up or Down could start wrapping around the body. \n\nGiven that, **Left** seems the most straightforward safe move.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

(5, 3): value = 1, life_span = 9\n\n### Possible Moves and Constraints\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is Left (L), the snake cannot immediately move Right (R) in the next turn.\n2. **Wall Collision**: The snake cannot move into a cell that's a wall.\n3. **Body Collision**: The snake cannot move into its own body, except for the tail segment under specific conditions.\n\n#### Current Head Position: (2, 2)\nPossible moves from (2, 2):\n- **Up (U)**: (2, 3)\n- **Down (D)**: (2, 1)\n- **Left (L)**: (1, 2)\n- **Right (R)**: (3, 2) — But this is the current body segment after the head, so moving right would cause a collision unless it's the tail that's moving away.\n\nHowever, since the current direction is Left, we cannot move Right (instant reverse is prohibited). So, possible moves are U, D, or L.\n\n#### Checking Each Possible Move:\n\n1. **Move Left (L) to (1, 2)**:\n   - Check walls: x=0 is a wall, so (1, 2) is not a wall.\n   - Check body: The body segments are (3,2) to (6,5). (1,2) is not in the body, so safe.\n   - Food: No food at (1,2).\n   - Valid move.\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (2, 3)**:\n   - Check walls: y=7 is the upper wall, (2,3) is not a wall.\n   - Check body: (2,3) is not in the body segments.\n   - Food: No food at (2,3).\n   - Valid move.\n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (2, 1)**:\n   - Check walls: y=0 is the lower wall, (2,1) is not a wall.\n   - Check body: (2,1) is not in the body segments.\n   - Food: No food at (2,1).\n   - Valid move.\n\nAll three moves (L, U, D) are valid in terms of not causing immediate collisions.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see if any of these moves can lead us toward food in the future or if there's immediate food to eat.\n\n#### Food at (2, 4):\n- Value: +1\n- Life_span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n- Position: (2,4)\nTo eat this, we'd need to move towards it. Currently at (2,2), moving Up twice would reach it:\n- Turn t0: (2,2) -> (2,3)\n- Turn t1: (2,3) -> (2,4)\nBut the food disappears after this turn (life_span=1), so we cannot reach it in time. Hence, this food is not accessible.\n\n#### Food at (6, 3):\n- Value: +1\n- Life_span: 6\n- Position: (6,3)\nCurrently, the body segment (6,3) is part of the snake's body. According to the rules:\n- Food under the body can only be eaten if:\n  1. The body moves away.\n  2. The head moves onto the food cell.\nCurrently, the head is at (2,2), far from (6,3). It's not feasible to reach (6,3) in a few moves, and even if we could, the body would need to move away first. Not immediately relevant.\n\n#### Food at (5, 3):\n- Value: +1\n- Life_span: 9\n- Position: (5,3)\nThis is also under the body (specifically, the segment (5,3)). Similar to above, not immediately accessible.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe need to check if the head is adjacent to the tail and if the tail cell has positive food that could cause a collision if eaten.\n\n- Tail position: (6,5)\n- Adjacent cells to head (2,2):\n  - (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3)\n- (6,5) is not adjacent to (2,2), so no danger here.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nSince none of the foods are immediately accessible, we should choose a move that:\n1. Keeps the snake safe (no collisions).\n2. Positions the snake for potential future food collection.\n3. Avoids getting trapped.\n\nPossible moves: L, U, D.\n\n- **Left (L) to (1,2)**:\n  - Moves towards the left wall (x=0 is at x=1 next).\n  - Not much space to the left; may limit future movements.\n  \n- **Up (U) to (2,3)**:\n  - Moves away from the lower wall, more open space upwards.\n  \n- **Down (D) to (2,1)**:\n  - Moves closer to the lower wall (y=0 at y=1 next).\n  - Less space downwards.\n\nBetween U and D, moving Up seems better as it opens more space towards the center of the grid where more food might spawn.\n\nMoving Left is also safe but limits space quickly.\n\n### Verifying Immediate Safety After Move\n\nLet's simulate moving Up to (2,3):\n- New head: (2,3)\n- Body shifts: (2,2) becomes new first body segment, and the tail (6,5) is removed.\nNew body: [(2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)]\nCheck for immediate collisions in next possible moves from (2,3):\nPossible moves from (2,3) (current direction was L, but now moving U changes direction to U, so cannot move D next):\n- U: (2,4) — not in body, no wall.\n- L: (1,3) — not in body, no wall.\n- R: (3,3) — not in body, no wall.\nAll seem safe.\n\nSimilarly, moving Left to (1,2):\nNew body: [(1,2), (2,2), (3,2), ..., (6,4)]\nNext moves from (1,2), direction L:\nCannot move R.\nU: (1,3) — safe.\nD: (1,1) — safe.\nL: (0,2) — x=0 is wall, so cannot move L.\nStill safe but limiting.\n\nMoving Down to (2,1):\nNew body: [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2), ..., (6,4)]\nNext moves from (2,1), direction D:\nCannot move U.\nL: (1,1) — safe.\nR: (3,1) — safe.\nD: (2,0) — y=0 is wall, cannot move D.\nAlso safe but limiting.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that moving Up provides more open space and doesn't immediately limit future moves, and considering that no food is immediately accessible, the best immediate action is to move Up.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state of the game and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 51 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Game Board and Walls:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n- Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move beyond these coordinates.\n- There's one internal obstacle at (3, 6).\n\n**2. Snake Position and Direction:**\n- Snake's head is at (2, 3), and its body segments follow in this order: [(2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)].\n- Current head direction is \"U\" (Up), meaning the snake was moving upwards in the previous turn.\n\n**3. Food Items:**\n- Two food items:\n  - (6, 3): value = 1, life_span = 6\n  - (5, 3): value = 1, life_span = 8\n\n### Possible Moves and Constraints\n\nFrom the current head position (2, 3) and direction \"U\", the possible moves are Up, Left, or Right (since we cannot instantly reverse direction, so Down is not allowed).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n**1. Move Up (U): (x, y+1) → (2, 4)**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is the upper wall, so (2,4) is within bounds.\n  - Body: Check if (2,4) is in the snake's body segments.\n    - Current body segments: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)\n    - (2,4) is not in the body, so no collision.\n- Food at (2,4)? No, no food is listed there.\n- So, moving Up is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n**2. Move Left (L): (x-1, y) → (1, 3)**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is the left wall, so (1,3) is within bounds.\n  - Body: Is (1,3) in the body segments? No.\n- Food at (1,3)? No.\n- Moving Left is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n**3. Move Right (R): (x+1, y) → (3, 3)**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is the right wall, so (3,3) is within bounds.\n  - Body: Is (3,3) in the body segments? No.\n- Food at (3,3)? No.\n- Moving Right is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n### Considering Food Items\n\nNow, let's look at the food items and see if we can plan to eat them in future moves.\n\n**Food at (6, 3):**\n- Current position: head at (2,3).\n- To reach (6,3), we'd need to move right multiple times.\n- But the snake's body is currently blocking some paths. For example, moving right to (3,3), then (4,3), but at (4,3), the body is at (4,2), so moving to (5,3) is possible, but (5,3) has food with value 1.\n- However, the food at (6,3) is under the snake's body at (6,3). According to rules:\n  - To eat food under the body, the body must move away first, then the head can move onto it.\n  - Currently, the body segment at (6,3) is part of the snake, so the head cannot directly move to (6,3) to eat the food unless the body moves away first.\n  - This seems complicated to achieve immediately, so maybe not the best target right now.\n\n**Food at (5, 3):**\n- Current position: head at (2,3).\n- Path to (5,3): right to (3,3), then (4,3), then (5,3).\n- At (5,3), the body is currently at (5,3), so the food is under the body.\n- To eat this:\n  - The body at (5,3) must move away first.\n  - Currently, the body segment after (5,3) is (5,4), so the tail is moving towards (6,4), but it's not straightforward to have (5,3) move away immediately.\n  - Also, if we move towards (5,3), by the time we reach there, the body might have moved, but it's risky because the tail is at (6,4), and moving to (5,3) could lead to a collision if not timed right.\n  - Moreover, the food at (5,3) is positive, but we need to ensure that after eating, the new tail (which would be the previous tail's position) doesn't cause a collision.\n  - Given the snake's length is 10, and the tail is at (6,4), if we eat at (5,3), the new tail would be the old tail's position, but the head would be at (5,3), and the new tail would be where the last body segment was, which is (6,4). So, no immediate collision, but need to ensure future moves don't trap us.\n\nGiven the complexity, it might be safer to avoid trying to eat the food under the body right now unless we can ensure a safe path.\n\n### Evaluating Immediate Moves\n\nGiven that none of the immediate moves (U, L, R) lead to eating food, and all are safe, we should choose the move that keeps options open for future food collection.\n\n- Moving Up to (2,4):\n  - From (2,4), possible next moves: U (to (2,5)), L (to (1,4)), R (to (3,4)).\n  - This moves the snake upwards, away from the current body segments.\n\n- Moving Left to (1,3):\n  - From (1,3), next moves: U (to (1,4)), L (to (0,3) - wall), D (to (1,2)).\n  - Moving towards the left wall limits future options.\n\n- Moving Right to (3,3):\n  - From (3,3), next moves: U (to (3,4)), R (to (4,3)), D (to (3,2) - body at (3,2)).\n  - Moving right brings us closer to the food at (5,3), but as discussed, it's risky to try to eat it now.\n\n### Avoiding Future Collisions\n\nLooking at the snake's body, the tail is at (6,4), and the body winds around. Moving upwards seems to be the safest as it moves the head away from the body's current positions.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nOne rule is about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrently:\n- Tail is at (6,4).\n- Adjacent to tail: (5,4), (6,5), (7,4), (6,3).\n- Head is at (2,3), not adjacent to tail, so no immediate danger here.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven all options:\n- Moving Up is safe and doesn't lead to any immediate dead ends.\n- Moving Left is safe but limits future options.\n- Moving Right is safe but may lead to complications with food under the body.\n\n**Best immediate action: Move Up (U).**\n\nThis keeps the snake moving away from its body and maintains flexibility for future moves.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 52\n\n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. This means the grid is 8x8 (from (0,0) to (7,7)), and the snake cannot move outside these bounds.\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 6). The snake cannot move into this cell.\n\n**Snake Positions**: \nThe snake's body is represented as a list from head to tail:\n1. Head: (2, 4)\n2. (2, 3)\n3. (2, 2)\n4. (3, 2)\n5. (4, 2)\n6. (5, 2)\n7. (6, 2)\n8. (6, 3)\n9. (5, 3)\n10. Tail: (5, 4)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: U (Up). This means the snake was moving upwards in the previous turn.\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (6, 3): value = 1, life_span = 5\n2. (5, 3): value = 1, life_span = 7\n3. (1, 5): value = 1, life_span = 10\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (2, 4), the snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, we must consider:\n- **No instant reverse**: Since the current direction is U, the snake cannot move D (Down) in the next move.\n- **Wall collisions**: Cannot move outside the grid or into internal obstacles.\n- **Body collisions**: Cannot move into any body segment except possibly the tail under certain conditions.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (x, y+1) → (2, 5)\n   - Check walls: (2,5) is within bounds (x=2 is between 0-7, y=5 is between 0-7), and it's not an internal obstacle.\n   - Check body: Is (2,5) in the snake's body?\n     - Snake body positions: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), ..., (5,4). (2,5) is not in this list.\n   - Safe to move.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (x, y-1) → (2, 3)\n   - But current direction is U, so moving D is reverse, which is not allowed.\n   - Invalid move.\n\n3. **Left (L)**: (x-1, y) → (1, 4)\n   - Walls: (1,4) is within bounds.\n   - Body: Is (1,4) in the snake's body? No.\n   - Safe to move.\n\n4. **Right (R)**: (x+1, y) → (3, 4)\n   - Walls: (3,4) is within bounds and not an obstacle.\n   - Body: Is (3,4) in the snake's body? No.\n   - Safe to move.\n\nSo, possible valid moves: U, L, R.\n\n### Evaluating Food Positions\n\nNow, let's see where the food is and if moving in any direction can help us eat positive food safely.\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (6, 3): value = +1, life_span = 5\n   - Current position: (2,4). Distance: |6-2| + |3-4| = 4 + 1 = 5. Not immediately reachable.\n2. (5, 3): value = +1, life_span = 7\n   - Current position: (2,4). Distance: |5-2| + |3-4| = 3 + 1 = 4. Not immediately reachable.\n3. (1, 5): value = +1, life_span = 10\n   - Current position: (2,4). Distance: |1-2| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n   - To reach (1,5) from (2,4):\n     - Move L to (1,4), then U to (1,5) — but next turn's move would be after this one.\n     - Alternatively, move U to (2,5), then L to (1,5).\n   - Neither is immediate; no food is adjacent to the head right now.\n\n### Checking for Food Under the Snake's Body\n\nThe rules mention that food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:\n1. The body moves away, and\n2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nLooking at the food positions:\n- (6,3): This is part of the snake's body (position 8 in the list: (6,3)).\n- (5,3): Also part of the snake's body (position 9: (5,3)).\n- (1,5): Not under the snake.\n\nSo, (6,3) and (5,3) are under the snake's body. To eat them:\n- For (6,3): The head would need to move to (6,3), but currently, the body is there. The tail is at (5,4), and the segment before tail is (5,3), then (6,3), etc. Moving the head to (6,3) would require the body to have moved away first, which isn't possible in one move.\n- Similarly for (5,3).\n\nThus, we cannot eat the food under the body in the immediate next move.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule states: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrent tail position: (5,4)\nAdjacent to head (2,4)? \n- Distance: |5-2| + |4-4| = 3 + 0 = 3. Not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1).\nSo, no danger from this rule in the current position.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nSince no food is immediately accessible, the primary goal is to avoid collisions and position ourselves to potentially reach food in future moves.\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R.\n\n1. **Up (U) to (2,5)**:\n   - Next to (1,5) which has food. Could be a path towards food.\n   - Not moving towards any walls or body.\n   \n2. **Left (L) to (1,4)**:\n   - Moves towards the left wall (x=0 is a wall, but (1,4) is safe).\n   - Not directly towards food, but could be a strategic move to loop around.\n   \n3. **Right (R) to (3,4)**:\n   - Moves towards the center.\n   - Not directly towards food, but keeps options open.\n\nConsidering the food at (1,5), moving U to (2,5) seems like a step towards it, as the next move could be L to (1,5) to eat the food.\n\nMoving L to (1,4) is also okay, but then to reach (1,5), we'd need to move U, which might not be possible next turn if the direction changes.\n\nMoving R to (3,4) doesn't seem to help in reaching food immediately.\n\n### Checking for Future Collisions\n\nIf we move U to (2,5):\n- Next turn, head is at (2,5), direction is U.\n- Possible moves: U (to (2,6)), L (to (1,5)), R (to (3,5)).\n   - (1,5) has food, so moving L would eat it.\n   - Eating (1,5) is safe because:\n     - It's not under the body.\n     - After eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, but the new tail would be where the old tail was (5,4), and the head is at (1,5), no collision.\n\nNo immediate risks in moving U.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up (U) to position the snake closer to the food at (1,5), setting up for a potential eat in the next move.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

The walls are at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and there's one internal obstacle at (3, 6).\n\n**Snake Position**: The snake's body is represented by the following coordinates in order from head to tail:\n- Head: (2, 5)\n- Body: (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: The snake is currently moving \"Up\" (U), meaning its last move was in the positive y-direction.\n\n**Food Items**:\n1.

No.\n   - Safety: Safe move, but doesn't eat food.\n\n2. **Move Left (L)**: (2, 5) → (1, 5)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=0 is the left wall, (1,5) is within bounds.\n     - Body: (1,5) is not in the body segments.\n     - Obstacles: (3,6) is not (1,5).\n   - Food: There is food at (1,5) with value +1.\n   - Check Tail Reward Danger: \n     - Current tail is at (5,3). The head is at (2,5), which is not adjacent to (5,3) (they are 3 units apart in x and 2 in y, not adjacent).\n     - So, no danger from tail reward.\n   - Outcome: Eats positive food, safe.\n\n3. **Move Right (R)**: (2, 5) → (3, 5)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=7 is the right wall, (3,5) is within bounds.\n     - Body: (3,5) is not in the body segments.\n     - Obstacles: (3,6) is not (3,5).\n   - Food: No food at (3,5).\n   - Safety: Safe move, but doesn't eat food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nThere are three food items:\n1. (6,3): Currently under the snake's body (specifically, the segment at (6,3)). Cannot be eaten now because the head is not moving onto it this turn.\n2. (5,3): Also under the snake's body (segment at (5,3)). Same as above.\n3.

The head at (2,5) is not adjacent to (5,3) (they are 3 units apart in x and 2 in y, which is more than one unit in either direction). Therefore, even after eating and growing, the new tail (which would be the old last segment before the tail) is not adjacent to the new head position, so no collision risk from tail reward.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move left to eat the positive food at (1,5), increasing the score and length safely.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

These are the edges of the grid.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: (3, 6) is a single internal wall.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is a list from head to tail: [(1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)].\n     - **Head**: (1,5)\n     - **Tail**: (5,3)\n   - **Direction**: The head is currently moving Left (L).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (6, 3): Value = 1, Life Span = 3\n   - (5, 3): Value = 1, Life Span = 5\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake's body to understand its shape and possible movements:\n\n- Head at (1,5), moving Left (L), so the previous move was from (2,5) to (1,5).\n- The body segments follow:\n  - (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), then turns right to (3,2), continues right to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then left to (5,3) which is the tail.\n\nThe two food items are:\n- (6,3): This is currently under the snake's body segment (6,3), which is not the tail (tail is (5,3)). So, this food is under a body segment that is not the tail.\n- (5,3): This is exactly at the tail position.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is Left (L), the snake cannot move Right (R) next.\n   - So, possible moves: U, D, L.\n\n2. **Wall Collisions**: We need to ensure the new head position isn't a wall.\n   - Current head: (1,5)\n   - Possible new heads:\n     - U: (1,6) - Check y=6: y=7 is wall, so y=6 is safe unless internal wall. No internal wall at (1,6).\n     - D: (1,4) - y=4 is safe.\n     - L: (0,5) - x=0 is a wall. So, L is invalid.\n   - So, possible moves after considering walls: U, D.\n\n3. **Body Collisions**: The new head must not collide with any body segment except the tail (since the tail will move away).\n   - Current body segments (excluding head): (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3).\n   - Possible new heads:\n     - U: (1,6) - Check if (1,6) is in body: No.\n     - D: (1,4) - Check if (1,4) is in body: No.\n   - Both U and D are safe from body collisions.\n\n### Food Considerations\n\nNow, let's consider the food:\n\n1. **Food at (6,3)**:\n   - Currently under body segment (6,3).\n   - To eat it:\n     - The body must move away from (6,3), and then the head must move onto (6,3).\n   - Currently, the head is at (1,5), far from (6,3), so not immediately relevant for this move.\n\n2. **Food at (5,3)**:\n   - This is at the tail position (5,3).\n   - **Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the newly grown tail will collide with the head.\n   - Current head (1,5) is not adjacent to tail (5,3):\n     - Distance: |1-5| + |5-3| = 4 + 2 = 6, which is more than 1, so not adjacent.\n   - So, no immediate danger from this food.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nWe have two possible moves: U or D.\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (1,6)**:\n   - New head: (1,6)\n   - Is there food here? No.\n   - Next possible moves from (1,6):\n     - Current direction would be U, so cannot move D next.\n     - Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n     - From (1,6), possible moves next would be U (to y=7 - wall), L (to x=0 - wall), R (to (2,6)).\n     - So, only R is possible next, which is restrictive.\n\n2. **Move Down (D) to (1,4)**:\n   - New head: (1,4)\n   - Is there food here? No.\n   - Next possible moves from (1,4):\n     - Current direction D, so cannot move U next.\n     - Possible: D (to (1,3)), L (to (0,4) - wall), R (to (2,4)).\n     - So, D or R next, more options than after U.\n\nBetween U and D, D seems better because it leaves more options for the next move.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Gains\n\nIs there any food that can be eaten immediately by moving U or D?\n\n- Food at (6,3) and (5,3) are not reachable in one move from (1,5).\n- So, no immediate food gain from either move.\n\n### Long-term Considerations\n\nSince no immediate food is reachable, we should choose a move that:\n- Doesn't restrict future movements (D is better than U here).\n- Doesn't lead to a dead end.\n\nLooking at the snake's body, moving D to (1,4) seems safe and keeps options open.\n\n### Verifying Tail Movement\n\nAfter moving, the tail will move forward:\n- Current tail is at (5,3), connected to (6,3).\n- After moving head to (1,4), the body will be:\n  - New head: (1,4)\n  - Rest: (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)\n  - Tail was (5,3), connected to (6,3), so tail moves to (6,3).\n\nFood at (5,3) will be uncovered, but since head is not adjacent, no danger.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween U and D, D is the better choice as it doesn't immediately restrict future movements and doesn't lead to any collisions.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Game Board and Walls:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n- Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move outside these bounds.\n- There's one internal obstacle at (3, 6).\n\n**2. Snake's Current Position and Direction:**\n- Snake positions (head first): [(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3)]\n  - Head is at (1, 4).\n  - Tail is at (6, 3).\n- Current direction: Down (D). This means the last move was downward (from (1,5) to (1,4)).\n\n**3. Food Items:**\n- (6, 3): value=1, life_span=2\n- (5, 3): value=1, life_span=4\n- (1, 1): value=1, life_span=10\n\n### Possible Moves and Constraints\n\n**Movement Constraints:**\n- Cannot reverse direction immediately. Since the last move was Down (D), we cannot move Up (U) next.\n- Possible moves from current direction (D): Left (L), Right (R), or continue Down (D).\n\n**Current Head Position: (1,4)**\nPossible next positions:\n- Down (D): (1, 3)\n- Left (L): (0, 4) → x=0 is a wall → invalid\n- Right (R): (2, 4)\n\nSo, valid immediate moves are D or R.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\n**Option 1: Move Down (D) to (1,3)**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Body segments: Looking at the snake's body positions, (1,3) is not in the list [(1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)] → no body collision.\n  - Walls: (1,3) is within bounds, no wall there.\n- Food at (1,3)? No food listed there.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n**Option 2: Move Right (R) to (2,4)**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - (2,4) is in the body segments (fourth segment) → collision with body.\n  - However, the body segment at (2,4) is the fourth segment, and the tail is at (6,3). When the head moves to (2,4), the tail will move forward, so (2,4) will no longer be occupied by the body after the move. But the rule says \"head touches any body segment\" is deadly, unless it's the tail which is moving away.\n  - Specifically, the tail is at (6,3), and the segment before the tail is (6,2). So, (2,4) is not the tail; it's a body segment that will still be there after the tail moves (since the tail is at the end). Wait, let's see:\n    - Current body: [(1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), ..., (6,3)]\n    - If head moves to (2,4), new body will be [(2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), ...] Wait, no, the tail moves forward, so the last segment (6,3) is removed, and the new head is at (2,4), followed by (1,4), then the rest.\n    - But (2,4) is already in the body before the move, and after the move, the segment that was at (2,4) moves to (1,4), but the new head is at (2,4), which would overlap with the next segment unless the tail moves correctly.\n    - Actually, moving into a body segment that is not the tail is deadly because after the move, that segment would still be part of the body (since the tail moves forward, but other segments follow).\n    - So moving to (2,4) would mean the head is on a body segment that isn't the tail → collision → death.\n- Therefore, moving Right is deadly.\n\n**Re-evaluating Option 1 (Down):**\nOnly safe move is Down to (1,3). No food there, but safe.\n\nIs there any other consideration? Let's check if any food is adjacent to the tail that could be dangerous if eaten next turn.\n\n**Tail Position and Adjacent Foods:**\n- Tail is at (6,3).\n- Adjacent cells to tail:\n  - Up: (6,4)\n  - Down: (6,2) → part of the snake's body (second last segment)\n  - Left: (5,3) → has food (value=1, life_span=4)\n  - Right: (7,3) → x=7 is wall\n- So, (5,3) is adjacent to the tail with positive food.\n- If the head were to move adjacent to the tail and then eat the food at (5,3), it would be dangerous because:\n  - Eating it would make the snake grow, so the tail wouldn't move, and the new head position would be where the tail is, causing a collision.\n- But currently, the head is at (1,4), far from the tail, so this isn't an immediate concern for the next move.\n\n### Checking for Food Under the Snake's Body\n\nFood can be under the body but can only be eaten if:\n1. The body moves away, and\n2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nCurrent food positions:\n- (6,3): under the tail.\n- (5,3): not under the snake.\n- (1,1): not under the snake.\n\nFor (6,3):\n- Currently under the tail.\n- To eat it, the tail would have to move away, and the head would have to move onto (6,3).\n- But the head is at (1,4), far from (6,3), so not possible in one move.\n- Also, moving down to (1,3) doesn't affect the tail's position directly for this turn's move.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe move is Down (D) to (1,3). Moving Right leads to a collision with the body. Moving Left is invalid (wall). Moving Up is reversing direction, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is:\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's visualize the current state of the game based on the provided information.\n\n#### Grid Dimensions and Walls:\n- The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n- Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. This means the snake cannot move to any cell where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7.\n- There's one internal obstacle at (3, 6). The snake cannot move to this cell.\n\n#### Snake:\n- **Positions**: The snake's body segments are listed from head to tail:\n  - Head: (1, 3)\n  - Body: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)]\n- **Direction**: The head is currently moving Down (\"D\"). This means the last move was from (1,4) to (1,3) (since moving down decreases the y-coordinate).\n\n#### Food:\nThere are three food items on the grid:\n1. (6, 3): value = 1, life_span = 1\n2. (5, 3): value = 3, life_span = 1\n3. (1, 1): value = 9, life_span = 1\n\nAll foods have a life_span of 1, meaning they will disappear after the current turn if not eaten.\n\n### Possible Moves and Constraints\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However:\n- **No instant reverse**: Since the current direction is Down (\"D\"), the snake cannot move Up (\"U\") next, as that would be the opposite direction.\n  \nSo, possible moves are: Down (\"D\"), Left (\"L\"), Right (\"R\").\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Down (\"D\"):\n- Current head: (1, 3)\n- Move Down: (1, 2)\n- Check:\n  - Is (1,2) a wall? y=2 is not a border wall, and (1,2) is not an internal obstacle.\n  - Is (1,2) occupied by the snake's body? Looking at the snake positions, (2,2) is part of the body, but (1,2) is not. So, no collision.\n  \nHowever, let's see if moving Down is beneficial:\n- After moving Down, the new head is at (1,2), and the tail (6,2) moves away, so the snake's body will be: [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), ..., (5,2)] (tail moves forward).\n- Is there food at (1,2)? No.\n- The foods are at (6,3), (5,3), (1,1). Moving Down doesn't get us closer to any food directly.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (\"L\"):\n- Current head: (1, 3)\n- Move Left: (0, 3)\n- Check:\n  - x=0 is a border wall. Cannot move here.\n  \nSo, Left is invalid.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (\"R\"):\n- Current head: (1, 3)\n- Move Right: (2, 3)\n- Check:\n  - Is (2,3) a wall? No.\n  - Is (2,3) occupied by the snake's body? Looking at the snake positions: (2,3) is the 6th segment (from head). So, it's part of the body.\n  \nNow, is it safe to move into (2,3)?\n- Normally, moving into a body segment is deadly, but there's an exception: if the segment is the tail, and the tail moves away at the same time, it's safe.\n- The tail is at (6,2). The segment at (2,3) is not the tail; it's in the middle of the body. So, moving into (2,3) would cause a collision with the body. This is deadly.\n\nTherefore, Right is invalid due to body collision.\n\n#### Re-evaluating Possible Moves:\nFrom the above, the only possible move without immediate death is Down (\"D\"), but it doesn't seem beneficial. Are there other considerations?\n\n#### Checking for Food Under the Snake:\nThe rules mention that food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:\n1. The body moves away, and\n2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nLooking at the snake's body positions and food positions:\n- Food at (1,1): The snake's body includes (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), but not (1,1). So, (1,1) is not under the snake's body.\n- Food at (5,3): The snake's body includes up to (6,2), so (5,3) is not under the snake.\n- Food at (6,3): Similarly, not under the snake.\n\nSo, no food is currently under the snake's body that we can eat by moving away.\n\n#### Tail Reward Danger:\nIs there any positive food adjacent to the tail that could be dangerous?\n- Tail is at (6,2).\n- Adjacent cells to tail:\n  - Up: (6,3) - has positive food (value=1).\n  - Down: (6,1) - not a food position.\n  - Left: (5,2) - part of the snake's body.\n  - Right: (7,2) - x=7 is a wall.\n  \nNow, is the head adjacent to the tail?\n- Head is at (1,3), tail at (6,2). They are not adjacent (distance is more than 1 in both x and y).\nSo, the \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule doesn't apply here.\n\n#### Alternative Strategy:\nSince moving Down is the only safe move but doesn't lead to food, and other moves are deadly, we might have to choose Down to stay alive, even if it doesn't increase the score immediately.\n\nHowever, let's check if there's any way to reach food in future turns after moving Down:\n- After moving Down to (1,2), next possible moves would be Left, Right, or Down (cannot go Up, as that would reverse the Down move).\n  - Left: (0,2) - wall, invalid.\n  - Right: (2,2) - currently part of the snake's body, but after moving Down, the tail moves away, so (2,2) might be free. Need to see the new snake positions after moving Down:\n    - New head: (1,2)\n    - Body: (1,3), (1,4), ..., (5,2)\n    - So, (2,2) is not in the new body (original (2,2) was the 7th segment, now the tail is at (5,2)).\n    - So, moving Right to (2,2) next would be safe.\n    - From (2,2), could then move Right to (3,2) (but (3,2) is in the new body), or Up to (2,3) (which is (1,3) in new body?), seems confusing. Maybe not directly helpful.\n  \nAlternatively, from (1,2), could move Down to (1,1):\n  - (1,1) has food with value=9.\n  - But is it safe to eat?\n    - After moving Down to (1,2), then Down to (1,1):\n      - Snake would be: [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), ..., (4,2)]\n      - Tail is at (4,2).\n      - Adjacent to tail: (4,1), (4,3), (3,2), (5,2).\n      - None of these have positive food that would cause Tail Reward Danger.\n    - So, eating (1,1) seems safe and highly rewarding (value=9).\n\nTherefore, moving Down now sets us up to potentially eat the high-value food at (1,1) next turn.\n\n#### Checking Other Possibilities:\nIs there any other sequence that could let us eat food this turn?\n- Currently, the foods are at (6,3), (5,3), (1,1).\n- To eat (1,1), we'd need to be at (1,1), which we're not.\n- To eat (5,3) or (6,3), we'd need to be adjacent to them and move into them, but we're not adjacent to either currently.\n\nThus, no way to eat food this turn; must plan for next turn.\n\n### Decision:\nThe only safe move is Down (\"D\"), which also sets up the possibility to eat the high-value food at (1,1) next turn.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Adjacent cells to head (1,2) are:\n    - (0,2): wall\n    - (2,2): part of body (but will be new tail if we eat)\n    - (1,1): food\n    - (1,3): body\n  - After eating, new tail is the second last segment before eating, which is (5,2). The new tail will be at (5,2) until the next move, but since we're moving to (1,1), the head is not adjacent to (5,2). So no immediate collision.\n- However, after eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move next turn. The new tail would be (5,2), and the head is at (1,1). They're not adjacent, so safe.\n- But let's think about the next move after eating:\n  - Head at (1,1), direction D.\n  - Possible moves:\n    - L: (0,1) → wall\n    - R: (2,1) → free?\n    - D: (1,0) → wall\n    - U: (1,2) → opposite of D → invalid\n  - So next move would have to be R to (2,1).

No food at (2,2).\n- So moving to (2,2) is safe, but doesn't eat food.\n- After moving R to (2,2), the tail moves to (3,2), and the new body is [(2,2), (1,2), (1,3), ..., (5,2)].\n- Next possible moves from (2,2), direction R:\n  - U: (2,3) → occupied by body (6th segment)\n  - D: (2,1) → free\n  - R: (3,2) → occupied by body (9th segment)\n  - L: (1,2) → opposite of R → invalid\n  - So only D to (2,1) is possible next.\n  \nComparing both:\n- Moving D to (1,1) eats positive food (+1 score, length +1), seems safe.\n- Moving R to (2,2) doesn't eat food, but is safe.\n\nIs there any risk with eating (1,1)?\n- The only risk is if after eating, the head is adjacent to the new tail, causing a collision next move.\n- After eating (1,1), new tail is (5,2), head is at (1,1). Distance is |5-1| + |2-1| = 5, not adjacent.\n- So safe.\n\nIs moving R to (2,2) better?\n- Doesn't gain score, but maybe positions for future food.\n- Food at (5,3) is closer after moving R, but still not immediately accessible.\n\n### Checking Other Food\n\nFood at (5,3):\n- Current head at (1,2). To reach (5,3):\n  - Need to go right to x=5, then up to y=3.\n  - But snake is long, path may be blocked by body.\n  - After moving R to (2,2), path is still long.\n\nFood at (1,1):\n- Immediately accessible by moving D.\n\n### Decision\n\nBest immediate action is to eat the positive food at (1,1) by moving Down (D).\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Collision After Eating\n\nAfter moving D to (1,1):\n- New head: (1,1)\n- New body: [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), ..., (5,2)] (length 12)\n- Tail is at (5,2)\n- Next move from (1,1), direction D:\n  - Can't reverse to U.\n  - L to (0,1): wall\n  - R to (2,1): free\n  - D to (1,0): wall\n  - So must move R to (2,1), which is safe.\n\nNo immediate collision risk.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{D}",

This means the snake cannot move outside the grid; any move that would take the head to these coordinates is invalid.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (3, 6). The snake cannot move into this cell.\n\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head to the tail:\n     - Head: (1, 1)\n     - Body segments: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2)\n   - **Direction**: The current direction of the snake's head is \"D\" (Down). This means the snake was moving downward in the previous turn.\n\n4. **Food**:\n   - **Food at (5, 3)**: Value = 2, Life Span = 1\n   - **Food at (1, 4)**: Value = 10, Life Span = 1\n\n### Movement Constraints\n\nGiven the current direction is \"D\" (Down), the snake cannot instantly reverse its direction to \"U\" (Up) in the next move. Therefore, the possible moves are:\n- Continue Down (\"D\")\n- Turn Left (\"L\")\n- Turn Right (\"R\")\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Head Position (1, 1)\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Move Down (\"D\")**:\n   - New head position: (1, 0)\n   - Check for walls: y=0 is a border wall → **Invalid move (collision with wall)**\n\n2. **Move Left (\"L\")**:\n   - New head position: (0, 1)\n   - Check for walls: x=0 is a border wall → **Invalid move (collision with wall)**\n\n3. **Move Right (\"R\")**:\n   - New head position: (2, 1)\n   - Check for walls: (2,1) is not a wall.\n   - Check for body collision: The snake's body segments are at (1,2) to (5,2). (2,1) is not in this list → **Valid move**\n\nSo, the only valid move from the current position is \"R\" (Right).\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving right leads to eating any food:\n\n- New head position after \"R\": (2, 1)\n   - Is there food at (2,1)? Checking the food positions:\n     - (5, 3): No\n     - (1, 4): No\n   - **No food is eaten by moving right.**\n\nHowever, let's also consider the food positions to see if they influence our decision:\n\n1. **Food at (5, 3)**:\n   - Value: +2\n   - Life Span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n   - Current distance from head (1,1) to (5,3):\n     - Manhattan distance: |5-1| + |3-1| = 4 + 2 = 6\n     - It's too far to reach in one move; we cannot eat it this turn.\n\n2. **Food at (1, 4)**:\n   - Value: +10\n   - Life Span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n   - Current position is part of the snake's body: (1,4) is the 4th segment of the snake.\n   - To eat this food:\n     - The body must move away from (1,4), and then the head must move onto it.\n     - Currently, the body is at (1,4), and the head is at (1,1). The next segment is (1,2).\n     - Even if we move the head to (2,1), the body will move:\n       - Tail (5,2) will be removed, and the new tail will be (4,2).\n       - (1,4) will move to (1,3), etc.\n     - It's not possible to have the head reach (1,4) in one move from (1,1).\n   - **Cannot eat this food this turn.**\n\nGiven that neither food can be eaten this turn, and the only valid move is \"R\", the decision is straightforward.\n\n### Verifying \"Tail Reward Danger\"\n\nThere's a special rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our current state:\n- Tail position: (5, 2)\n- Head position: (1, 1)\n- Distance from head to tail: |5-1| + |2-1| = 4 + 1 = 5\n- They are not adjacent (adjacent means distance = 1), so this rule doesn't apply here.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves and considering the food positions and game rules, the only valid and safe move is to turn right (\"R\").\n\n\\boxed{R}",

There's also an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\n2. **Snake Details**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head to the tail. The current positions are:\n     - Head: (2,1)\n     - Body: [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)]\n   - **Direction**: The snake is currently moving to the Right (R), meaning its last move was towards increasing x-coordinate.\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - **Food at (5,3)**: Value = +1, Life Span = 1\n   - **Food at (1,4)**: Value = +1 (assuming \"9\" is a typo and should be +1 based on the positive food description), Life Span = 1\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the snake is currently moving Right (R), it cannot make an immediate reverse to Left (L) in the next move (no instant reverse rule). So, possible immediate moves are U, D, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (3,1)\n- **New Head Position**: (3,1)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: x=7 is the right border, so (3,1) is within bounds.\n  - **Internal Obstacle**: (3,6) is not in the path.\n  - **Body Collision**: Check if (3,1) is in the snake's body. Current body positions are from (1,1) to (4,2). (3,1) is not in the list → safe.\n- **Food Check**: \n  - (5,3) and (1,4) are not at (3,1) → no food eaten.\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no score change.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (2,2)\n- **New Head Position**: (2,2)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: y=7 is the top border, (2,2) is within bounds.\n  - **Body Collision**: (2,2) is part of the snake's body (10th segment) → collision!\n- **Outcome**: Deadly collision → invalid move.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (2,0)\n- **New Head Position**: (2,0)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: y=0 is the bottom border → (2,0) is a wall → collision!\n- **Outcome**: Wall collision → invalid move.\n\n### Re-evaluating Possible Moves\n\nFrom the above, moving Right (R) is the only viable immediate move since:\n- Moving Up causes a body collision.\n- Moving Down hits a wall.\n- Moving Left is a reverse of current direction (R → L), which is not allowed.\n\nHowever, moving Right doesn't lead to eating any food. Let's check if there's any food that can be targeted in subsequent moves or if we missed any considerations.\n\n### Checking Food Accessibility\n\n1. **Food at (5,3)**:\n   - Current head at (2,1). To reach (5,3):\n     - Need to move Right to increase x, and Up to increase y.\n     - Possible path: R, R, U, U, R (from (2,1) → (3,1) → (4,1) → (4,2) → (4,3) → (5,3)).\n   - But the food's life span is 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn. So, we cannot reach it in time.\n\n2. **Food at (1,4)**:\n   - Currently under the snake's body at segment (1,4).\n   - To eat it:\n     - The body must move away from (1,4), and then the head must move onto it.\n     - Currently, the segment after (1,4) is (1,5), then (2,5), etc. The tail is at (4,2).\n     - It's not possible to move the head to (1,4) in one move from (2,1) without colliding or reversing.\n   - Also, life span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn → cannot be eaten.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nIs there any positive food adjacent to the tail that could be dangerous?\n- Tail is at (4,2). Adjacent cells:\n  - (4,1), (4,3), (3,2), (5,2)\n- Food is at (5,3) and (1,4):\n  - (5,3) is adjacent to (5,2), but (5,2) is not the tail.\n  - (1,4) is not adjacent to the tail.\n- No immediate danger from tail reward.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe move is to continue moving Right (R) to (3,1), as other moves lead to collisions or are invalid. There's no immediate food that can be eaten in this turn due to life spans and positions.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

From here, the possible moves are:\n\n- **Right (R)**: (4,1)\n- **Up (U)**: (3,2)\n- **Down (D)**: (3,0)\n\nCannot move Left (L) because that's the opposite of the current direction (R), which is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (4,1)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is the right border, so (4,1) is safe.\n  - Body: The snake's body segments are at [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)]. (4,1) is not in this list, so no body collision.\n- Food: No food at (4,1).\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (3,2)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is the top border, (3,2) is safe.\n  - Body: (3,2) is the last segment of the snake's body (from the list). Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail will move forward, but we need to check if this is the tail.\n    - Current tail is (3,2). After moving, the new tail will be (2,2), so (3,2) is now empty. Wait, let's see:\n    - Current snake: [(3,1), (2,1), ..., (3,2)].\n    - After moving U, the head moves to (3,2), and the tail (last segment) is removed, so the new snake is [(3,2), (3,1), (2,1), ..., (2,2)].\n    - So (3,2) was the tail and is now the head, and the new tail is (2,2). This is safe because the tail moves away.\n- Food: No food at (3,2).\n\nThis move is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (3,0)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is the bottom border, so (3,0) is a wall → collision.\n  \nThis move is invalid.\n\n### Considering the Food\n\nThere's food at (1,4):\n\n- Current position: (3,1).\n- To reach (1,4), the snake would need to move left and up, but:\n  - Current direction is R, so cannot move L immediately (opposite direction).\n  - Even if we could, the path is blocked by the snake's body at (2,1), (1,1), etc.\n  \nMoreover, the food is at (1,4), which is currently under the snake's body (from the positions: ..., (1,4), ...). \n\nFrom the rules:\n- Food under the body can only be eaten if:\n  1. The body moves away, and\n  2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nCurrently, (1,4) is occupied by the snake's body, so the head cannot move there unless the body moves away first. Given the snake's length and positions, it's not immediately possible to move the body away from (1,4) in one move to allow the head to reach it next turn.\n\nAlso, the food's life_span is 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn (since countdown decreases every turn, including current). So even if we could reach it, it's not possible in one move.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule mentions:\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Tail is at (3,2).\n- Head is at (3,1), which is adjacent to the tail (directly below it).\n- Is there food at the tail? No, food is at (1,4), not at (3,2).\n  \nSo this rule doesn't apply here.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven the above, the safe moves are R and U. D is invalid. Neither R nor U leads to eating food (and the food is about to disappear anyway). \n\nBetween R and U:\n- Moving R to (4,1) is safe and moves away from the body.\n- Moving U to (3,2) is also safe but moves onto the previous tail position, which is fine but doesn't offer any advantage over R.\n\nSince both are equally safe and neither leads to food, we can choose either. Typically, moving away from the body might be slightly better to avoid getting boxed in. \n\nHowever, looking at the snake's body, moving R to (4,1) seems better because moving U to (3,2) is where the tail was, and the body is wrapping around that area, so R might give more space.\n\n### Final Decision\n\n\\boxed{R}",

The next possible positions from (4,1) are:\n- Right (R): (5,1)\n- Up (U): (4,2)\n- Down (D): (4,0) — but y=0 is a wall, so invalid.\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (4,1) with Direction R\n\nGiven the current direction is R, the possible moves are:\n1. **Continue Right (R)**: (5,1)\n   - Check if (5,1) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=5 is not a border wall, and (5,1) is not an internal obstacle.\n     - Not part of the snake's body: Looking at the snake's positions, (5,1) is not listed.\n     - So, moving R to (5,1) is valid.\n2. **Turn Up (U)**: (4,2)\n   - Check if (4,2) is valid:\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not part of the snake's body: (4,2) is not in the snake's positions.\n     - So, moving U to (4,2) is valid.\n3. **Turn Down (D)**: (4,0)\n   - y=0 is a border wall, so invalid.\n4. **Turn Left (L)**: (3,1)\n   - Opposite of current direction (R), which is not allowed (no instant reverse).\n   - So, moving L is invalid.\n\nThus, valid immediate moves are R and U.\n\n### Evaluating Food Positions\n\nNow, let's look at the food:\n\n1. **Food at (1,4)**:\n   - Value: +8\n   - Life_span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n   - Current position: (1,4) is part of the snake's body (from the list: (1,4) is the 7th segment).\n   - To eat this:\n     - The body must move away from (1,4), and the head must move onto it.\n     - Currently, the head is at (4,1), which is far from (1,4).\n     - It's impossible for the head to reach (1,4) in one move from (4,1).\n     - So, cannot eat this food now.\n\n2. **Food at (2,2)**:\n   - Value: +10\n   - Life_span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n   - Current position: (2,2) is the tail of the snake.\n   - To eat this:\n     - The tail must move away, and the head must move onto (2,2).\n     - The tail is at (2,2), and the segment before it is at (2,3).\n     - Normally, the tail moves forward in the next turn, so it would move from (2,2) to where (2,3) was, but since (2,3) is part of the body, the tail's movement depends on the snake's movement.\n     - For the head to reach (2,2) in one move from (4,1), it would need to move left twice, which is impossible in one move.\n     - Alternatively, if the snake could wrap around, but walls prevent that.\n     - So, cannot eat this food now either.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule states that if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\n- Current tail is at (2,2) with food (+10).\n- Adjacent cells to head (4,1):\n  - Right: (5,1) — not adjacent to tail.\n  - Up: (4,2) — distance to tail (2,2) is |4-2| + |2-2| = 2 (not adjacent).\n  - So, no adjacency to tail from possible moves.\n\nThus, no immediate danger from this rule.\n\n### Deciding the Move\n\nGiven that neither food can be eaten this turn and both will disappear after this turn, the primary goal is to avoid collisions and stay alive while positioning for future food.\n\nPossible moves:\n1. **Right (R) to (5,1)**:\n   - Next to border wall at x=7, but still safe.\n   - Future moves from (5,1): could go R to (6,1), or U/D if possible.\n2. **Up (U) to (4,2)**:\n   - Moves towards the center of the grid.\n   - Future moves from (4,2): more options (L/R/U/D).\n\nConsidering the snake's length and avoiding getting trapped:\n- Moving R keeps the snake moving along the bottom, which might limit future options as it approaches the right wall.\n- Moving U opens up more space and flexibility.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers After Move\n\n1. **Move R to (5,1)**:\n   - Next head position: (5,1)\n   - Body segments will follow: new head at (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), etc.\n   - Tail at (2,2) will move to where (2,3) was, but since (2,3) is part of the body, the tail moves to (2,3).\n   - Check if (5,1) collides with body: no, it's not in the current body segments.\n   - Safe move.\n\n2. **Move U to (4,2)**:\n   - Next head position: (4,2)\n   - Body segments: new head at (4,2), then (4,1), (3,1), etc.\n   - Tail moves similarly.\n   - Check if (4,2) collides with body: no, it's not in the current body segments.\n   - Safe move.\n\nBoth moves are safe, but moving U seems better for long-term flexibility.\n\n### Considering Future Food\n\nSince both foods disappear next turn, we don't need to consider them for future moves right now. The priority is to stay alive and position the snake where it can easily reach new food that may appear.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween R and U:\n- R: continues along the bottom, may lead to less flexibility soon.\n- U: moves towards the center, more options next turn.\n\nGiven that, **U** seems the better choice to maintain maneuverability.\n\nHowever, looking at the snake's current position and length, moving R might also be fine, but U seems slightly better for opening up space.\n\nBut wait, the snake is quite long, and moving U might not immediately open up more space since the body is convoluted. Maybe moving R is equally fine, but since both are safe and no food is immediately accessible, either is acceptable.\n\nGiven that, and since no food is reachable, and both moves are safe, I'll choose **U** to potentially open up more options in the center.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Food Benefit\n\nNeither food can be eaten this turn, so the choice doesn't affect immediate scoring.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the best immediate action is to move **Up (U)**.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Wait, no: the tail moves forward, so the segment before tail is (2,4), which moves to (2,3), and new tail is added at (2,2).\n     - New snake: head at (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), ..., tail at (2,2)? Wait, no, the tail was at (2,3), which was preceded by (2,4). After eating, the tail moves from (2,3) to (2,4), and a new segment is added at (2,2). So the new tail is at (2,4).\n     - Checking adjacency: head at (2,2), tail at (2,4). Not adjacent, so no danger.\n- **Potential Reward**: Can reach food at (2,2) next turn safely.\n\n#### Move Right (R) to (5,2)\n- **Food**: No food at (5,2).\n- **Next Moves**: From (5,2), can go U to (5,3), R to (6,2), or D to (5,1).\n- **Safety**: Safe now, but moving towards right edge (x=7).\n- **Future Access**: Less immediate food access.\n\n### Considering Food at (1,4)\n\nThe food at (1,4) is currently under the snake's body (7th segment). To eat it:\n1. The body must move away from (1,4).\n2. The head must move onto (1,4).\n\nCurrently, the segment at (1,4) is the 7th from the head.

(2,2) and (2,4) are two apart in y, not adjacent.\n- So no tail reward danger.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move **Left (L)** to position (3,2), setting up to safely eat the food at (2,2) on the next turn.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake at turn \\( t_0 = 63 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid Dimensions and Walls:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls; cannot move into these cells.\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 6) is also a wall; cannot move here.\n\n**2. Snake Details:**\n- Current positions (head first): \n  - Head: (3, 2)\n  - Body: [(4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4)]\n- Current direction: L (Left), meaning the head is moving towards decreasing x.\n\n**3. Food Items:**\n- (1, 4): value = 6, life_span = 1\n- (2, 2): value = 8, life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3, 2) moving Left (L), the possible next moves are U (Up), D (Down), or continue L (Left). Cannot move R (Right) because that's the opposite of current direction L (no instant reverse).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n**Option 1: Continue Left (L)**\n- Current head: (3, 2)\n- Move L: (2, 2)\n  \nCheck:\n- Is (2, 2) a wall? No.\n- Is (2, 2) occupied by snake body? Let's see the body segments after the head:\n  - (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4)\n  - (2, 2) is not in this list; safe.\n  \nFood at (2, 2):\n- Value: 8 (positive)\n- Life_span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n  \nEating (2, 2):\n- Head moves to (2, 2), which is food.\n- Tail is currently at (2, 4). After moving, the tail will move forward, so the new tail will be at (2, 5) (since the current tail is (2, 4), and the segment before is (1, 5)).\n- Is the head adjacent to the new tail? New head: (2, 2), new tail: (2, 5). They are not adjacent (distance is 3 in y), so no danger of collision.\n  \nSo, moving L to (2, 2) is safe and eats positive food.\n\n**Option 2: Move Up (U)**\n- Current head: (3, 2)\n- Move U: (3, 3)\n  \nCheck:\n- Is (3, 3) a wall? No.\n- Is (3, 3) in snake body? No.\n  \nFood: No food at (3, 3).\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n**Option 3: Move Down (D)**\n- Current head: (3, 2)\n- Move D: (3, 1)\n  \nCheck:\n- Is (3, 1) a wall? No.\n- Is (3, 1) in snake body? Yes, it's the 4th segment in the body list: (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), ...\n  \nMoving into (3, 1) would collide with the body; deadly. So, cannot move D.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nWe have two food items:\n1. (1, 4): value 6, life_span 1\n   - Currently under snake's body at (1, 4) (part of the body).\n   - To eat it:\n     - Body must move away, then head moves onto it.\n     - Currently, head is at (3, 2); not adjacent to (1, 4).\n     - Not immediately accessible.\n   \n2. (2, 2): value 8, life_span 1\n   - Accessible by moving Left to (2, 2).\n   - As calculated, safe to eat.\n\n### Decision\n\n- Moving Left (L) to (2, 2):\n  - Eats positive food (+8).\n  - Safe (no collision with body or walls).\n  - Food will disappear next turn, so must eat now.\n  \nOther options:\n- Up (U): safe but no food.\n- Down (D): deadly collision.\n  \nBest immediate action: **Left (L)** to eat the high-value food at (2, 2).\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nJust to be thorough, after eating (2, 2):\n- New head: (2, 2)\n- Body grows by 1, so tail doesn't move (but actually, the tail moves forward, and a new segment is added where the head was).\n  \nOriginal tail is (2, 4), before that is (1, 5). After move:\n- Tail was at (2, 4), next is (1, 5), so new tail is (1, 5).\n- New head is (2, 2), new tail is (1, 5). Distance is (1 in x, 3 in y), not adjacent (adjacent means distance of 1 in one direction).\n  \nNo danger of head colliding with new tail.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Left to eat the positive food at (2, 2).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

The current positions are:\n     - Head: (2,2)\n     - Body segments: (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4)\n   - **Direction**: The snake's head is currently moving to the Left (\"L\").\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - There are two food items:\n     - (1,4): value = 5, life_span = 1\n     - (4,2): value = 10, life_span = 1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nTo better understand, let's visualize the snake's body and the food positions.\n\n- **Snake Body**:\n  - Head at (2,2)\n  - Next segment at (3,2)\n  - Then (4,2)\n  - Then down to (4,1)\n  - Then left to (3,1), (2,1), (1,1)\n  - Then up to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n  - Then right to (2,5), then down to (2,4)\n\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,4): This is currently under the snake's body (specifically, the 9th segment counting from the head).\n  - (4,2): This is at the same position as the snake's third segment (from the head).\n\n### Movement Constraints\n\nThe snake cannot:\n1. Move opposite to its current direction in the next move. Current direction is Left (\"L\"), so it cannot move Right (\"R\") next.\n2. Move into walls or its own body (except the tail, which will move away if the head moves onto it).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (2,2) moving Left (\"L\"), the possible next moves are:\n- Up (\"U\"): (2,3)\n- Down (\"D\"): (2,1)\n- Left (\"L\"): (1,2)\n\nCannot move Right (\"R\") because it's the opposite of current direction (\"L\").\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (\"U\") to (2,3)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (2,3) is within bounds (x=1-6, y=1-6) and not a wall.\n     - Body: Check if (2,3) is in the snake's body segments. Current body segments are from (3,2) to (2,4). (2,3) is not in this list.\n   - Food: No food at (2,3).\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n2. **Down (\"D\") to (2,1)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (2,1) is within bounds.\n     - Body: (2,1) is the 6th segment of the snake (from head). Moving here would mean the head collides with the body, which is deadly.\n   - Outcome: Deadly collision, cannot move Down.\n\n3. **Left (\"L\") to (1,2)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (1,2) is within bounds (x=1, y=2).\n     - Body: (1,2) is the 8th segment of the snake. Moving here would collide with the body.\n   - Outcome: Deadly collision, cannot move Left.\n\n### Re-evaluating Possible Moves\n\nFrom the above, the only safe move is Up (\"U\") to (2,3). The other two possible moves lead to collisions with the body.\n\nHowever, let's think about the food:\n\n1. **Food at (1,4)**:\n   - Currently under the snake's body at (1,4).\n   - To eat this, the body must move away first, then the head can move onto it.\n   - Currently, the head is at (2,2), and (1,4) is not adjacent to the head, so we cannot eat it immediately.\n   - Life_span is 1, so it will disappear next turn if not eaten now. But since we can't eat it now, it will disappear.\n\n2. **Food at (4,2)**:\n   - Currently under the snake's body at (4,2).\n   - To eat this, the body must move away first.\n   - The head is at (2,2), and (4,2) is two cells to the right.\n   - Even if we could move right (which we can't this turn), we'd need the body to move away first, which isn't possible immediately.\n   - Life_span is 1, so it will disappear next turn.\n\nGiven that both foods will disappear next turn and we can't reach them safely this turn, our best option is to make a safe move that doesn't lead to a collision.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule states that if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\n- Current tail is at (2,4).\n- Adjacent cells to the head (2,2) are:\n  - (2,3) - Up\n  - (2,1) - Down (body segment)\n  - (1,2) - Left (body segment)\n  - (3,2) - Right (body segment)\n  \nThe tail is at (2,4), which is not adjacent to the head (distance is (0,2)), so this rule doesn't apply here.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe only safe move is Up (\"U\") to (2,3). The other moves lead to collisions, and we cannot reach the food this turn before it disappears.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 65  \n**Grid Size**: Based on the border walls, it's an 8x8 grid (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).  \n**Internal Obstacle**: There's one at (3, 6).  \n**Snake Positions**:  \n- Head: (2, 3)  \n- Body: [(2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5)]  \n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Up (U).  \n**Food Items**:  \n1. (1, 4): value = 1, life_span = 4  \n2. (4, 2): value = 1, life_span = 9  \n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (2, 3) moving Up (U), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (2, 4)  \n- **Left (L)**: (1, 3)  \n- **Right (R)**: (3, 3)  \n- **Down (D)**: (2, 2)  \n\nBut we cannot move in the opposite direction of the current movement in the next turn. Current direction is Up, so the opposite is Down (D). Therefore, Down is not an option this turn.\n\nSo, valid moves: U, L, R.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (2, 4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is the upper border, (2,4) is within bounds.\n  - Obstacles: (3,6) is not at (2,4).\n  - Body: Check if (2,4) is in snake body positions. Current body: [(2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5)]. (2,4) is not in this list.\n  - Safe to move here.\n- Food at (2,4)? No food listed there.\n- Potential next moves from (2,4):\n  - Could lead to exploring more of the upper area.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (1, 3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is left border, (1,3) is within bounds.\n  - Obstacles: (3,6) is not at (1,3).\n  - Body: Check if (1,3) is in snake body. It is! (1,3) is the 10th segment from the head.\n  - Moving into your own body is deadly unless it's the tail, and the tail moves away.\n  - Current tail is (2,5). Moving left to (1,3) is not the tail, so it's a body collision. Deadly.\n  - **Cannot move Left**.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (3, 3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is right border, (3,3) is within bounds.\n  - Obstacles: (3,6) is not at (3,3).\n  - Body: Check if (3,3) is in snake body. Not present.\n  - Safe to move here.\n- Food at (3,3)? No food listed there.\n- Potential next moves from (3,3):\n  - Could explore more of the right side.\n\n#### Checking Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food is adjacent to the head that we can eat safely.\n\nCurrent head: (2,3)  \nAdjacent cells:\n- Up: (2,4) - no food\n- Left: (1,3) - no food (but has body)\n- Right: (3,3) - no food\n- Down: (2,2) - body segment, no food\n\nFood positions:\n1. (1,4): value = 1, life_span = 4  \n   - Distance from head (2,3): Manhattan distance = |1-2| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2  \n   - Not adjacent, can't eat this turn.\n2. (4,2): value = 1, life_span = 9  \n   - Distance from head (2,3): |4-2| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3  \n   - Not adjacent, can't eat this turn.\n\nNo immediate food to eat this turn based on adjacency.\n\n#### Special Case: Food Under Snake's Body\n\nIs any food under the snake's body that could be eaten if we move away?\n- Food at (1,4): is it under the snake's body?  \n  - Snake body includes (1,4). So yes, food is under the body at (1,4).\n  - To eat it:\n    1. The body must move away from (1,4).\n    2. Then the head must move onto (1,4).\n  - Currently, the segment at (1,4) is part of the body. Next turn, if the snake moves in a way that (1,4) is no longer occupied by the body, and then the head moves to (1,4), it can be eaten.\n  - But this requires planning over multiple turns, and we're only deciding the immediate next move.\n\n#### Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food at the tail?\n- Tail is at (2,5).\n- Head is at (2,3). Adjacent cells to head: (2,4), (1,3), (3,3), (2,2).\n- (2,5) is not adjacent to (2,3) (distance is 2 vertically), so no danger here.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nFrom the valid moves:\n- Left (L): deadly (body collision)\n- Up (U): safe, no food\n- Right (R): safe, no food\n\nBetween Up and Right, both are safe with no immediate food benefit. We need to consider future moves and potential to reach food.\n\nLooking at the food:\n- (1,4): life_span = 4, so it will disappear in 4 turns. Currently at turn 65, disappears at turn 69.\n- (4,2): life_span = 9, disappears at turn 74.\n\n(1,4) is closer to disappearing. It's at (1,4), and the head is at (2,3). To reach (1,4):\n- Need to move left then up, but left is deadly now.\n- Alternatively, move up to (2,4), then left to (1,4) next turn.\n  - But moving up to (2,4): next turn, from (2,4), possible moves:\n    - Left to (1,4): check if (1,4) is body then.\n      - Current body after moving up:\n        - New head: (2,4)\n        - Body: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), ..., tail moves forward from (2,5) to (1,5).\n      - (1,4) is currently body, but after moving up, the segment at (1,4) would be the one that was at (1,3) moving to (1,4)? Wait, let's see:\n        - Original body after head moves up:\n          - Head moves to (2,4)\n          - Body: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), ..., (1,5), (2,5) is tail, which moves to (1,5), so (1,4) is now free? Wait, no:\n          - Original body segments: (2,2), (3,2), ..., (1,5), (2,5)\n          - After head moves to (2,4), body shifts:\n            - (2,3) added to front, (2,5) removed from end.\n            - So new body: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), ..., (1,5)\n            - (1,4) was originally part of body (10th segment), now it's the segment that was at (1,3) moving to (1,4) if the snake moves left next.\n            - So (1,4) would still be body next turn if we move left from (2,4).\n            - Therefore, cannot eat (1,4) next turn by moving left from (2,4).\n\nAlternative path to (1,4):\n- Move right to (3,3), then next turn move left to (2,3), then left to (1,3), then up to (1,4).\n  - But (1,4) would be eaten only if it's not body when head moves there\n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{S}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the positions and constraints:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. These are the edges of the grid.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: (3, 6) — a single internal wall cell.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list starting from the head to the tail:\n     - Head: (2, 4)\n     - Body: [(2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5)]\n   - **Direction**: The head is currently moving \"U\" (Up), meaning the last move was upwards.\n4. **Food**:\n   - (1, 4, 3, 1): Position (1,4), value = 3, life_span = 1.\n     - This is positive food (+3 score, snake length +1).\n   - (4, 2, 8, 1): Position (4,2), value = 8, life_span = 1.\n     - This is positive food (+8 score, snake length +1).\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake's position and the food locations:\n\n- **Head at (2,4)**:\n  - Adjacent cells:\n    - Up (U): (2,5)\n    - Down (D): (2,3) — but this is the first body segment; moving here would collide with the body.\n    - Left (L): (1,4) — contains food (1,4,3,1).\n    - Right (R): (3,4)\n\n- **Food at (1,4)**:\n  - Adjacent to the head (left move).\n  - Value: +3, life_span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten).\n\n- **Food at (4,2)**:\n  - Currently under the snake's body segment (4,2).\n  - To eat this, the body must move away, and the head must move onto (4,2).\n  - Currently, the head is at (2,4), so reaching (4,2) in one move is impossible (distance is 2 in x and 2 in y).\n  - Life_span: 1, so it will disappear after this turn.\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (2,4)\n\nGiven the current direction is \"U\", the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (2,5)\n   - Check if (2,5) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: y=5 is not a border (y=7 is), and no internal wall at (2,5).\n     - Not part of the snake's body: Checking the list, (2,5) is not in the snake positions.\n     - Valid move.\n2. **Down (D)**: (2,3)\n   - (2,3) is the first body segment — collision! Invalid.\n3. **Left (L)**: (1,4)\n   - (1,4) has food with value +3.\n   - Check if eating is safe:\n     - The tail is at (1,5). After eating, the snake grows by 1, so the new tail would be at (1,5) (since the last segment moves forward).\n     - The head would be at (1,4), and the new tail at (1,5). They are adjacent, but not overlapping.\n     - No immediate collision from this.\n     - However, we must ensure that moving left doesn't cause a future collision.\n     - Also, the food at (1,4) is under the body segment (1,4), but the head is moving onto it, which is allowed if the body moves away. Here, the body segment at (1,4) is the 11th segment (from head count), and the tail is at (1,5). When the head moves left to (1,4), the tail will move from (1,5) to (1,4) if the food is eaten, but since the food is at (1,4), the tail would stay at (1,5), and the snake grows by adding a new segment at (1,4), making the new tail (1,5). So no collision.\n   - Valid move with food consumption.\n4. **Right (R)**: (3,4)\n   - Check if (3,4) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=3 is not a border, and (3,4) is not an internal wall.\n     - Not in snake's body: Checking the list, (3,4) is not present.\n     - Valid move.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible moves based on the rules:\n\n1. **Up (U) to (2,5)**:\n   - No food.\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n2. **Left (L) to (1,4)**:\n   - Eats food worth +3.\n   - Snake length increases by 1.\n   - Need to ensure no collision with the new tail.\n     - After eating, the snake grows: new head at (1,4), body extends by adding (1,4), pushing the tail to (1,5).\n     - The new tail is at (1,5), adjacent to head at (1,4), but not overlapping.\n     - No immediate collision.\n   - High reward (+3), safe.\n3. **Right (R) to (3,4)**:\n   - No food.\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\nBetween U and R, both are safe but offer no reward. L offers a high reward and is safe.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Reverse\n\nCurrent direction is \"U\". The opposite is \"D\", which is invalid (collision with body). So no issue with instant reverse here.\n\n### Considering Food Under Body\n\nThe food at (4,2) is under the body segment (4,2). To eat it:\n- The body must move away: the segment at (4,2) is the 4th segment from the head.\n- The head must move to (4,2) in one move, which is impossible from (2,4).\n- Life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn.\n- Hence, cannot eat this food this turn.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move **Left (L)** to (1,4) to eat the +3 food, which is safe and maximizes the score.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule states: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\"\n\nIn our case:\n- Current tail is at (1,5).\n- Head is at (2,4), adjacent to tail (distance is 1 in x and 1 in y — diagonally adjacent, but adjacency is typically considered up, down, left, right).\n- The food is at (1,4), which is adjacent to the head (left move), but not at the tail.\n- The tail is at (1,5), which does not have food.\n- Hence, no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the best immediate action is:\n\n\\boxed{L}",
