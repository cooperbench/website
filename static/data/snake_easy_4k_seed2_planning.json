        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 0, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (1,6). The snake is just a single segment at (3,3), and the head direction is left, so it's facing west.\n\nThe food items are:\n\n- (4,5) with life span 10, value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (3,5) with life span 10, value +1\n\n- (6,6) with life span 10, value +1\n\nAll food has the same life span and value, so they're all positive and will disappear after 10 turns if not eaten.\n\nSince the snake is only one segment long, it's just the head. So, moving will grow the snake when it eats food.\n\nThe head direction is L (left), so from (3,3), moving left would go to (2,3), but I need to consider the grid boundaries.\n\nGrid size: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) to (7,7) inclusive, I think. x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nNow, possible moves: I can go Up, Down, Left, or Right, but since the head is facing left, I cannot instantly reverse to right on the next turn. But since it's the first move, I think I can choose any direction except possibly the reverse, but the rule says \"cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\", so from left, I shouldn't go right immediately.\n\nCurrent direction is L, so opposite is R. So I cannot move right on turn 0.\n\nAllowed moves: U, D, L. Not R.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and prioritize survival.\n\nFirst, where are the food items?\n\n- (4,5): this is east and north of head (3,3). (3,3) to (4,5): delta x +1, delta y +2, so not adjacent.\n\n- (3,5): same x, y+2, so north.\n\n- (6,6): delta x +3, delta y +3.\n\nAll are a bit far, but since life span is 10, I have time.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (1,6), which might be in the way if I go that way.\n\nSince snake is at (3,3), and direction left, let's see adjacent cells:\n\n- Left: (2,3) – is this valid? x=2, y=3. Walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=2 is not wall. y=3 not wall. Obstacle at (1,6), not (2,3). So (2,3) is empty, I assume, since no food or anything mentioned.\n\nThe state doesn't list empty cells, so cells not wall, not obstacle, not food, not snake are free.\n\nSo (2,3) is free.\n\n- Up: (3,4) – y=4, not wall. Free.\n\n- Down: (3,2) – y=2, not wall. Free.\n\n- Right: (4,3) – but cannot move right because it's opposite to current left direction? No: current direction is L, so moving right would be opposite, so not allowed this turn.\n\nRule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nSo on turn t=0, direction is L, so I cannot choose R for turn 0 action.\n\nActions for turn 0: U, D, L possible.\n\nNow, I need to plan multiple turns ahead.\n\nSince snake is only one segment, no body to worry about, so no collision risk except walls and obstacles.\n\nAlso, food can be eaten only when head moves onto it, and since no body, moving onto food is fine.\n\nBut there's a special case: tail reward danger, but tail doesn't exist yet, so irrelevant.\n\nSo for now, eating food is safe.\n\nI should aim for the closest food.\n\nClosest food: (3,5) is at (3,5), head at (3,3), so same x, y+2. So if I go up twice, I can reach it.\n\n(3,3) to (3,4) then (3,5).\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) is at (4,5), so from (3,3), I need to go right then up, but I cannot go right immediately because of direction.\n\n(4,5) is x+1, y+2.\n\n(6,6) is farther.\n\nBut (3,5) is vertically closer.\n\nLife span all 10, so no urgency.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nGrid has walls and obstacle.\n\nObstacle at (1,6), which might block paths later.\n\nSince snake is small, I can grow it.\n\nBut I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nLet me sketch the grid mentally.\n\nGrid 8x8, (0,0) bottom left? Usually in coordinates, y=0 bottom or top? In the food positions, (4,5) etc., and walls y=0 and y=7, but not specified orientation. I'll assume y increases up, so y=0 bottom, y=7 top. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSo head at (3,3).\n\nFood:\n\n- (4,5) : one right, two up from head? Head (3,3), so (4,5) is (3+1,3+2) = (4,5), so east-northeast.\n\n- (3,5) : (3,3+2) = (3,5), north.\n\n- (6,6) : (3+3,3+3) = (6,6), southeast.\n\nInternal obstacle at (1,6), which is near top left.\n\nNow, for turn 0, possible moves: U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3).\n\nIf I go U to (3,4), then I'm closer to (3,5).\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go U to (3,5) to eat it on turn 1 if I go U now and then U again.\n\nTurn 0: move to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 1: from (3,4), direction would be U if I go up, so I can go U to (3,5) and eat the food there.\n\n(3,5) has food, so on turn 1, if I move to (3,5), I eat it, snake grows to two segments: head at (3,5), tail at (3,4)? When snake moves, if it doesn't eat, head moves to new position, tail moves off, so length same. But if it eats, head moves to food, new segment added, so tail stays or something.\n\nStandard snake: when snake moves to a cell without food, head moves to new cell, tail leaves the last cell. If it moves to food, head moves to food cell, a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move, and snake grows.\n\nIn this case, initially snake at [(3,3)], one segment.\n\nAfter move U to (3,4), no food there, so snake becomes [(3,4)], still one segment? No: positions: head moves to (3,4), and since no tail, it's just [(3,4)].\n\nThen if I move to (3,5) and eat food, snake becomes: head at (3,5), and previous position (3,4) becomes body, so [(3,5), (3,4)], length 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, if I go directly to food.\n\nBut on turn 0, if I go U to (3,4), no food eaten.\n\nThen on turn 1, if I go U to (3,5), eat food, snake grows to length 2.\n\nNow, after that, I have other food to consider.\n\nBut I need to think 5 turns ahead.\n\nAlso, the food at (3,5) has life span 10, but turns start from 0, so if I eat it on turn 1, it's fine.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 0, life span 10, so it will disappear after 10 turns if not eaten, meaning on turn 10 it's still there? Let's see the rule.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\"\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, life_span L, it will disappear at turn t + L.\n\nFor example, at turn 0, life_span 10, so it exists from turn 0 to turn 9, and disappears at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, if eaten before, it's gone.\n\nIn this case, all food at turn 0 with life 10, so they last until turn 9, disappear at 10.\n\nSince I can eat (3,5) by turn 1, it's fine.\n\nNow, other options.\n\nIf I go left to (2,3) on turn 0.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can go U, D, L, or R? Direction: after moving left, head direction is L, so I can go U, D, L, but not R (east).\n\nFrom (2,3), going U to (2,4), etc., but no food nearby, and (3,5) is at (3,5), which I can reach later but might take longer.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down to (3,2), even farther.\n\nSo going up seems best to get to (3,5) quickly.\n\nBut let's see the other food.\n\n(4,5) is at (4,5), which I could reach after eating (3,5).\n\nAfter eating (3,5), snake at [(3,5), (3,4)], head at (3,5), direction U if I came from below.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go L, R, U, D? But cannot instantly reverse down, but since direction is U, I cannot go D.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, so collision if I go down? (3,4) is the tail.\n\nRule: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, because when you move, the tail moves away.\n\n\"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo if I move to the tail cell, it's ok because the tail moves, and head takes its place, no collision.\n\nIn this case, after moving to (3,5) and eating, snake is [(3,5), (3,4)].\n\nHead at (3,5), tail at (3,4).\n\nIf I move down to (3,4), which is the tail, it should be ok because tail will move forward, meaning when head moves to (3,4), the tail is still there, but since it's the tail, and head moves there, the snake would be head at (3,4), and the body segment at (3,5) becomes the new tail? Let's think.\n\nWhen snake moves to a cell without food: head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the position of the previous one, so tail cell is vacated.\n\nBut if the new head position is the current tail position, it might be different.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo it's allowed and safe.\n\nIn this case, from [(3,5), (3,4)], if I move down to (3,4), which is occupied by tail, head moves to (3,4), and the tail moves away? But since no growth, the tail segment is removed or moved.\n\nStandard: when moving without eating, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the segment in front, so the tail position is left empty.\n\nIf head moves to the current tail position, since the tail will move to the next position, but there is no next, so when head moves to tail position, the tail is no longer there after the move.\n\nFor example: positions: [H, T] where H and T are adjacent.\n\nMove: head moves to T's position, and since no eat, tail is removed, so new snake is just [H at former T position].\n\nBut if H moves to T, and T was there, after move, H is at that cell, and T is gone, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, if snake longer, say [A,B,C] with C tail, if head moves to C, then new head at C, A moves to where? Positions: let's index: segments S0=head, S1, S2, ..., Sk=tail.\n\nAfter move: new head position based on move, then each Si moves to Si-1 position for i=1 to k, but if head moves to Sk position, then new S0 at Sk position, S1 moves to S0 position, ..., Sk-1 moves to Sk-2 position, and Sk is removed since no growth.\n\nSo the cell that was Sk is now occupied by new S0, and no segment at previous positions except the new ones.\n\nSo moving to tail cell is safe.\n\nBack to point.\n\nIf I go up on turn 0 to (3,4).\n\nThen on turn 1, I can go up to (3,5) and eat the food at (3,5).\n\nSnake becomes length 2: positions [(3,5), (3,4)].\n\nHead at (3,5), direction U (since I moved up).\n\nNow, from here, I need to plan next moves.\n\nAvailable food: (4,5) and (6,6).\n\n(4,5) is adjacent: east of (3,5), so (4,5).\n\nI can move right to (4,5) to eat it.\n\nBut is it safe? Head at (3,5), body at (3,4).\n\nIf I move right to (4,5), which has food, so eat it, snake grows to length 3: new head at (4,5), body: (3,5) and (3,4), so positions [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)].\n\nHead at (4,5).\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen I have (6,6) to eat.\n\nBut (6,6) is at (6,6), from (4,5), I need to go east and north, or something.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nI should think 5 turns ahead from start.\n\nTurn 0: action\n\nTurn 1: action\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 5 or so.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (1,6), which might be relevant if I go that way.\n\nBut for now, let's consider the sequence.\n\nOption 1: Go U now to get to (3,5) faster.\n\nTurn 0: U to (3,4)  // no eat\n\nTurn 1: U to (3,5)  // eat food at (3,5), snake length 2, positions [(3,5), (3,4)]\n\nNow from (3,5), I can go R to (4,5) to eat the other food.\n\n(4,5) has food, so:\n\nTurn 2: R to (4,5)  // eat, snake length 3, positions [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nHead at (4,5), direction R.\n\nNow, next food (6,6) is at (6,6), which is two steps away: from (4,5), to (5,5) then (6,6), or (4,6) then (6,6) not adjacent, so must go through (5,5) or (4,6) etc.\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), from (4,5), I can go R to (5,5) then R to (6,5)? No, (6,6) is (6,6), so from (5,5) I can go U to (5,6) then R to (6,6), but (5,6) might be free.\n\nFirst, on turn 2, after eating (4,5), head at (4,5), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, so collision? (3,5) is a body segment, not tail.\n\nPositions: [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nTail is at (3,4).\n\nIf I move left to (3,5), (3,5) is occupied by the second segment, which is body, so head would touch body, collision, die.\n\nCannot move left.\n\nMove down to (4,4): free? Assuming no wall, not obstacle, not food, so should be free.\n\nMove up to (4,6): free.\n\nMove right to (5,5): free.\n\n(5,5) is x=5,y=5, not wall, not obstacle.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6), (4,4) etc.\n\nTo reach (6,6), I can go right then up, or up then right.\n\nSay turn 3: R to (5,5)  // no eat, assuming no food there.\n\nSnake: head to (5,5), then body: (4,5) and (3,5)? When move without eat, head moves to new position, each segment moves forward.\n\nSo from positions [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nHead moves to (5,5), then the segment at (4,5) becomes the new body after head, and (3,5) moves to (4,5)? Let's think.\n\nSegments: S0=(4,5), S1=(3,5), S2=(3,4)\n\nAfter move to (5,5), new S0 = (5,5), new S1 = old S0 = (4,5), new S2 = old S1 = (3,5), and since no eat, tail S2 is removed? No, when no eat, the tail cell is vacated, so the snake shortens? No.\n\nStandard: when moving without eating, the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front, and the tail segment is left, so the snake remains the same length but shifts.\n\nIn this case: positions before move: [S0, S1, S2] = [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nAfter moving head to (5,5): new head (5,5), then S1 moves to where S0 was, but S0 moved, so S1 moves to (4,5), which was S0's position, and S2 moves to (3,5), which was S1's position.\n\nThen the position (3,4) is vacated.\n\nSo new positions: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nLength still 3.\n\nTail at (3,5).\n\nNow, (3,4) is free.\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved to a food, new segment added, tail doesn't move.\n\nBack to turn 3: after moving to (5,5), positions [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nHead at (5,5), direction R.\n\nNow, (6,6) is at (6,6), which is adjacent east and north? (5,5) to (6,6) is delta x+1, y+1, not adjacent; adjacent cells are (5,6), (5,4), (6,5), (4,5) but (4,5) is body.\n\nSo to reach (6,6), I need to go to (6,5) or (5,6) first.\n\nSay turn 4: from (5,5), I can go R to (6,5) or U to (5,6).\n\n(6,5) is free? x=6,y=5, not wall, walls x=7, so x=6 ok. Obstacle (1,6), not here.\n\nSimilarly (5,6) free.\n\n(6,6) has food, but not adjacent from (5,5).\n\nSo I need two moves.\n\nSay turn 4: R to (6,5)  // no food, assuming\n\nThen positions: head to (6,5), body: (5,5) and (4,5)? Segments: before move [ (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ]\n\nAfter move to (6,5): new head (6,5), S1 moves to (5,5), S2 moves to (4,5), tail at (4,5)? S2 was (3,5), moves to (4,5).\n\nPositions: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nThen turn 5: U to (6,6)  // eat food at (6,6)\n\nThen snake grows to length 4.\n\nBut we are at turn 5.\n\nIn this sequence, I ate two foods: (3,5) on turn 1 and (4,5) on turn 2, then (6,6) on turn 5.\n\nTurn 0: U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: U to (3,5) eat\n\nTurn 2: R to (4,5) eat\n\nTurn 3: R to (5,5) no eat\n\nTurn 4: R to (6,5) no eat\n\nTurn 5: U to (6,6) eat\n\nAte three foods by turn 5.\n\nBut is there a better way?\n\nI could go directly to (4,5) first, but I couldn't on turn 0 because of direction.\n\nOn turn 0, from (3,3), direction L, cannot go R.\n\nSo I have to go U, D, or L.\n\nIf I go L to (2,3) on turn 0.\n\nThen from (2,3), direction L, I can go U, D, L.\n\n(3,5) is still there, but I need to go back.\n\nTurn 0: L to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 1: from (2,3), go U to (2,4) or something, but (3,5) is at (3,5), so from (2,3) to (3,5) not easy.\n\nGo to (3,4) first? But (3,4) might not be reached directly.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can go R to (3,3), but (3,3) is where I came from, and direction: after moving left to (2,3), direction is L, so moving right to (3,3) is opposite? Current direction after move is L, so on turn 1, I cannot move right because it's opposite to current direction L.\n\nAfter turn 0 move L, head at (2,3), direction L.\n\nOn turn 1, I cannot move R (east) because it's opposite to current direction.\n\nSo I can go U, D, or L.\n\nU to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3).\n\n(1,3) is near obstacle, but obstacle at (1,6), different.\n\nTo reach (3,5), I need to go up first, then right later.\n\nFor example, turn 1: U to (2,4)\n\nThen turn 2: from (2,4), direction U, I can go U to (2,5) or R to (3,4) etc.\n\nIf I go R to (3,4), but (3,4) was previous position? Not necessarily.\n\nTurn 2: from (2,4), direction U (since I moved up), so I can go R to (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is free, I think.\n\nThen at (3,4), I can go U to (3,5) to eat.\n\nBut on turn 0: L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 1: U to (2,4)  // assume no food\n\nTurn 2: R to (3,4)  // no food\n\nTurn 3: U to (3,5) eat  // now at turn 3, ate one food.\n\nWhereas in first sequence, I ate on turn 1.\n\nSo slower.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down first, even worse.\n\nSo going up on turn 0 is better to get food faster.\n\nNow, back to the first plan, I can eat (3,5) on turn 1 and (4,5) on turn 2.\n\nNow, about (6,6), it's at (6,6), and I need to go there.\n\nBut after turn 2, I'm at (4,5) with snake [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nIn my earlier, after turn 2: positions [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nThen turn 3: I moved to (5,5), but from (4,5), I could go directly to (5,5) or other.\n\nBut (6,6) is not directly accessible.\n\nI could go up first to (4,6) or something.\n\nBut (4,6) has no food, but it might be a path.\n\nSince I need to think about survival, after eating (4,5), I'm at (4,5), with body at (3,5) and (3,4).\n\nThe area around: (4,6) north, (5,5) northeast, (4,4) south, (3,5) west but body.\n\n(5,5) is free.\n\nGoing to (5,5) seems good to head towards (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), which is near the wall, x=7, y=7.\n\nx=7 is wall, so (6,6) is ok, but if I go to (7,6), that's wall, cannot.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 wall.\n\nSo from (6,6), I need to be careful.\n\nBut for now.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (6,6) might be riskier because it's closer to wall.\n\nBut I can eat it.\n\nIn the sequence, by turn 5 I can eat it.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbers.\n\nTurn 0: start at (3,3), direction L\n\nAction U: move to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: at (3,4), direction U (since moved up)\n\nAction U: move to (3,5), eat food, snake grows: positions [(3,5), (3,4)]\n\nDirection U\n\nTurn 2: at (3,5), action R: move to (4,5), eat food there, snake grows: positions [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]? After eating, head to (4,5), new segment, so body: (3,5) and (3,4) become body, but (3,4) was tail, now new tail is (3,4)? Segments: before move [ (3,5), (3,4) ], head (3,5)\n\nMove to (4,5) with eat: head to (4,5), add new segment, so positions: head (4,5), then previous head (3,5) becomes body, and previous tail (3,4) remains, so [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nTail at (3,4)\n\nDirection R\n\nTurn 3: at (4,5), action R: move to (5,5), no food (assume), so no eat, head to (5,5), body: (4,5) and (3,5)? Positions before: [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nAfter move: head to (5,5), S1 moves to (4,5), S2 moves to (3,5), so new positions [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nTail at (3,5)\n\nDirection R\n\nTurn 4: at (5,5), action R: move to (6,5), no food, positions: head to (6,5), S1 to (5,5), S2 to (4,5), so [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nTail at (4,5)\n\nDirection R\n\nTurn 5: at (6,5), action U: move to (6,6), eat food, snake grows: head to (6,6), add new segment, so positions [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]? Before move [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nAfter eating: head (6,6), then body: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), so [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nLength 4.\n\nAte three foods by turn 5.\n\nNow, is there a way to eat more? But only three foods, all eaten.\n\nFood at (4,5) and (3,5) are both eaten.\n\nBut in this, I ate (3,5) and (4,5) quickly.\n\nCould I go to (6,6) first? But it's farther, and I might miss the closer ones.\n\nFor example, if on turn 0 I go U to (3,4), turn 1 U to (3,5) eat, then instead of going right to (4,5), I go elsewhere, but (4,5) is adjacent and has food, so not eating it would be wasting opportunity.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is farther, so better to eat the close ones first.\n\nNow, but I need to consider the tail reward danger, but in this case, when I ate (3,5) and (4,5), no issue because snake was small.\n\nAfter eating (6,6), I have a longer snake, but no more food, so I need to survive.\n\nBut since no more food, I just need to avoid walls and body.\n\nBut food might respawn or something? The state doesn't say, so I think only these foods for now.\n\nBut life span, they disappear after 10 turns, but I eat them early.\n\nIn this plan, all eaten by turn 5, so no issue.\n\nNow, the internal obstacle at (1,6) is not in my path, so fine.\n\nAnother thing: when I move to (6,6), it's near corner, but I can move away.\n\nFor example, after turn 5, head at (6,6), direction U (since I moved up).\n\nThen I can go left or down to avoid wall.\n\nBut since no food, it's ok.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for several turns, but it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" but output format is to list actions starting from turn t1=0.\n\nAnd the boxed answer should have actions for turn 0,1,2,... probably for a few turns, but it doesn't specify how many to list.\n\nLook: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn \\(t_1\\): action ... Turn \\(t_1 + 1\\): action ... }\"\n\nIt doesn't say how many turns, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should list actions for at least 5 turns.\n\nIn the state, turn t1=0, so list from turn 0 to, say, turn 5.\n\nIn my sequence, I have actions up to turn 5.\n\nBut on turn 5 I eat (6,6), so after that, I might need to move, but for the plan, I can list until I eat the foods.\n\nSince I ate all by turn 5, and no more food, I can stop or list more moves to survive.\n\nBut the output should include actions for the immediate turns.\n\nPerhaps I should list the actions for the turns where I decide.\n\nBut let's see if there is a risk.\n\nIn the sequence, when I moved to (6,5) on turn 4, and then to (6,6) on turn 5, but (6,6) is a cell, and I moved up from (6,5), fine.\n\nBut (6,6) has food, I eat it.\n\nNow, another point: the food at (3,5) and (4,5) are both at y=5, and I ate them.\n\nBut is there any negative food? No, all positive.\n\nAlso, the special case about food under body, but here no, food not under body initially.\n\nIn this state, all food on free cells.\n\nSo my plan seems good.\n\nBut let's consider if going to (4,5) first is possible, but I can't on turn 0.\n\nAnother idea: on turn 0, I go up to (3,4), then on turn 1, instead of going to (3,5), I go right to (4,4) or something, but (4,4) has no food, while (3,5) has food, so better to eat (3,5).\n\n(4,5) is also food, but from (3,4), I can go right to (4,4), not directly to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is north of (4,4).\n\nBut if I go to (4,4), I miss (3,5) temporarily.\n\nBut (3,5) might be eaten later, but risk it disappears, but life span 10, I have time.\n\nFor example: turn 0: U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: R to (4,4)  // no food\n\nThen at (4,4), direction R (since moved right)\n\nThen turn 2: U to (4,5) eat food at (4,5)\n\nThen snake grows to length 2: positions [(4,5), (4,4)]? Head to (4,5), previous position (4,4) becomes body, so [(4,5), (4,4)]\n\nThen from (4,5), I can go left to (3,5) to eat (3,5), but (3,5) is adjacent west.\n\nBut direction after move to (4,5) is U? Turn 2 action U to (4,5), so direction U.\n\nThen turn 3: from (4,5), direction U, I can go L to (3,5), which has food, so move to (3,5), eat.\n\nSnake: before move [(4,5), (4,4)]\n\nMove to (3,5) with eat: head to (3,5), add new segment, so positions [(3,5), (4,5), (4,4)]\n\nLength 3.\n\nThen I can go to (6,6) later.\n\nBut compared to first sequence, I ate (4,5) on turn 2 and (3,5) on turn 3, whereas in first I ate (3,5) on turn 1 and (4,5) on turn 2, so I got the first food earlier, which is better for score since I have the growth earlier for potential more moves, but since no more food, same.\n\nBut in terms of turns, I ate both by turn 2 in first sequence, here by turn 3.\n\nFirst sequence: turn 1 eat (3,5), turn 2 eat (4,5)\n\nHere: turn 2 eat (4,5), turn 3 eat (3,5)\n\nSo one turn later for (3,5), but same score eventually.\n\nBut I might reach (6,6) later.\n\nIn this, after turn 3 at (3,5) with positions [(3,5), (4,5), (4,4)]\n\nDirection L (since moved left to (3,5))\n\nThen to go to (6,6), I need to go east.\n\nBut from (3,5), I can go R to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, collision.\n\nCannot go right.\n\nGo U to (3,6) or D to (3,4), etc.\n\n(3,4) might be free.\n\nThen I need to navigate to (6,6), which takes more turns.\n\nFor example, turn 4: U to (3,6) // no food\n\nThen positions: head to (3,6), body (3,5) and (4,5)? Before [(3,5), (4,5), (4,4)]\n\nAfter move no eat: head to (3,6), S1 to (3,5), S2 to (4,5), so [(3,6), (3,5), (4,5)]\n\nTail at (4,5)\n\nDirection U\n\nThen turn 5: R to (4,6) or something, but (4,6) free? Then to (5,6), etc. to reach (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) is at (6,6), so from (4,6) I need to go to (5,6), (6,6), but not directly.\n\nTakes longer than the first sequence where I was at (6,5) by turn 4.\n\nIn first sequence, by turn 4 I was at (6,5), close to (6,6).\n\nSo better to follow first plan.\n\nThus, for turn 0, action U.\n\nThen turn 1, action U to eat (3,5)\n\nThen turn 2, action R to eat (4,5)\n\nThen turn 3, action R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 4, action R to (6,5)\n\nTurn 5, action U to (6,6) eat\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to list these actions.\n\nBut turn t1=0, so from turn 0 to turn 5.\n\nAfter that, I can stop or add more, but since no food, it might not be necessary.\n\nThe instruction says \"maximize score\", but with no more food, score is fixed after eating all.\n\nTo survive, I need to keep moving, but no food, so I can just move safely.\n\nFor example, after turn 5, at (6,6), direction U, I can go left to (5,6) or down to (6,5), but (6,5) might be body or not.\n\nIn turn 5, after moving to (6,6), positions [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nSo (6,5) is body, (5,5) body, (4,5) tail.\n\nIf I go down to (6,5), it is body, so collision, die.\n\nCannot go down.\n\nGo left to (5,6): (5,6) is free? Assuming, yes.\n\nThen I can go there.\n\nBut since not part of the immediate plan, for the answer, listing up to turn 5 might be sufficient, as I have eaten all food by then.\n\nThe food at (6,6) eaten on turn 5.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to write in the boxed format.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid and obstacles.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are invalid.\n\nInternal obstacle at (1,6), which is not in my path.\n\nIn my moves:\n\nTurn 0: from (3,3) U to (3,4) - valid\n\nTurn 1: (3,4) U to (3,5) - valid, eat\n\nTurn 2: (3,5) R to (4,5) - valid, eat\n\nTurn 3: (4,5) R to (5,5) - valid, no issue\n\n(5,5) is x=5,y=5, not wall.\n\nTurn 4: (5,5) R to (6,5) - (6,5) x=6,y=5, x=6<7, so not wall, ok.\n\nTurn 5: (6,5) U to (6,6) - (6,6) valid, eat.\n\nAll good.\n\nI could consider if there is negative food, but no, all positive.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: R\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nIn the answer, I need to specify the action for each turn starting from t1=0.\n\nAnd in the box.\n\nBut for turn 3 and 4, I move to (5,5) and (6,5), no food, but that's fine.\n\nI could go directly to (6,6) but not possible in one move.\n\nAnother thing: on turn 2, after eating (4,5), I'm at (4,5), and (6,6) is at (6,6), I could go up to (4,6) then right, but (4,6) to (5,6) to (6,6), but (6,6) requires moving to (6,6) from (6,5) or (5,6).\n\nFrom (4,5), if I go U to (4,6) on turn 3.\n\nThen at (4,6), direction U.\n\nThen turn 4: R to (5,6)\n\nThen turn 5: R to (6,6) eat.\n\nBut in this case, I reach (6,6) on turn 5 same as before, but in the first way, I was at (6,5) on turn 4, then U to (6,6) turn 5.\n\nIn this alternative: turn 3 U to (4,6), turn 4 R to (5,6), turn 5 R to (6,6).\n\nBut on turn 4, I go to (5,6), which is closer to obstacle? (1,6) is far, (5,6) is fine.\n\nBut in this, I didn't eat any additional food, and I have the same number of moves to (6,6), but in the first sequence, by going to (5,5) and (6,5), I might have explored more, but not necessary.\n\nIn terms of path, both similar.\n\nBut in the first sequence, when I went to (5,5) and (6,5), the snake body is in row 5, whereas in this, going to (4,6) and (5,6), body in row 6.\n\nBut no issue.\n\nI think the first is fine.\n\nTo be consistent, I'll go with the initial plan.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: R\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nFor the answer, I need to write in the format.\n\nAlso, since I thought ahead to turn 5, and actions are defined.\n\nNow, for the boxed output.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating all positive food while ensuring long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned 5 turns ahead. The snake starts at (3,3) with direction left. The closest food is at (3,5), which can be eaten in two moves by going up twice. After that, the adjacent food at (4,5) can be eaten by moving right. Finally, the food at (6,6) is reached by moving right twice to (6,5) and then up to (6,6). This sequence eats all three foods by turn 5 and avoids all walls, obstacles, and collisions. The internal obstacle at (1,6) is not in the path. All moves respect the no-instant-reverse rule.\n\n- **Turn 0 (current turn)**: Move up (U) to (3,4). This positions the snake closer to (3,5) and avoids moving left or down, which would delay food acquisition. Direction changes to U.\n- **Turn 1**: Move up (U) to (3,5) to eat the positive food. Snake grows to length 2. Direction changes to U.\n- **Turn 2**: Move right (R) to (4,5) to eat the positive food. Snake grows to length 3. Direction changes to R.\n- **Turn 3**: Move right (R) to (5,5). This moves toward (6,6) with no immediate food. Direction changes to R.\n- **Turn 4**: Move right (R) to (6,5). This positions the snake adjacent to (6,6) for eating next turn. Direction changes to R.\n- **Turn 5**: Move up (U) to (6,6) to eat the positive food. Snake grows to length 4. Direction changes to U.\n\nAfter turn 5, all food is eaten, and the snake can continue moving safely (e.g., left to (5,6) or down to (6,5) if possible) to avoid walls, but no further actions are needed for this plan.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U (up)  \nTurn 1: U (up)  \nTurn 2: R (right)  \nTurn 3: R (right)  \nTurn 4: R (right)  \nTurn 5: U (up)  \n}",
