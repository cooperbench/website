We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe car update rules:\n- Left-moving: the car moves left, so the entire span [h, tau] (if h < tau, but note the representation) shifts left by s*(T-t1). However, note the representation for left vs right.\n- The problem states:\n    Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n    Right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note the representation of the span: \n- For left-moving, they give [h, tau] and then subtract, so if h is the head and tau the tail, then for left-moving the head is at the right? Actually, the problem states:\n    \"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" meaning the car spans from h to tau, and then moves left so both decrease.\n\nBut note the example for right-moving: they write [tau, h] and then add. This is a bit confusing.\n\nLet me reinterpret from the update rules:\n\nFor a car on a freeway at turn t1, we are given (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nBut note the representation of the span:\n- For a right-moving car: the head is the front (so the rightmost point) and the tail is the leftmost? But the update rule for right-moving: \n    Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n    This implies that at time t1, the car spans from tau to h (with tau < h, because as time increases, both increase). So in the initial state, tau is the left end and h is the right end.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: \n    Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n    Here, if the car is moving left, then at time t1, the car spans from h to tau. But note: as time increases, both decrease. So if the car is moving left, then the head (which is the front) is at h (the rightmost point at t1) and the tail at tau (the leftmost). Then when it moves left, both decrease.\n\nBut in our problem, all cars are right-moving? Let's check the given cars:\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36) -> so direction is right, so we use the right-moving update: \n    At t1=0: span = [tau, h] = [-83, -48]? But the table says head=-48, tail=-83. \n    According to the update rule for right-moving: they write the span as [tau, h] and then update by adding. So if head=-48 and tail=-83, then the span is from tail to head: from -83 to -48? But that would be a car of length 35? And then at time T, the span becomes [-83 + 36*T, -48 + 36*T].\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: (-48, -71, right, 24) -> span at t1: [-71, -48]? Actually, the table says: head=-48, tail=-71? Then for right-moving, the span is [tail, head] = [-71, -48]. Then at time T: [-71+24*T, -48+24*T].\n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and then updates to [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So in the table, the first number is head and the second is tail? But the table header says: (head, tail, ...). So for a right-moving car, the head is the right end and the tail is the left end. Therefore, the initial span is [tail, head] = [left_end, right_end].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 7 and 8: \n    (48, 37, right, 4): so head=48, tail=37? Then span at t1: [37,48]? But the table has three cars per freeway? \n    Actually, freeway 7 and 8 have three cars each: \n        (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nSo for freeway 7: \n    Car1: head=48, tail=37 -> span at t1: [37,48]\n    Car2: head=12, tail=1 -> span [1,12]\n    Car3: head=-24, tail=-35 -> span [-35,-24]\n\nNow, the collision condition: \n    At turn T, if the player is at (0, y_T) and if at that turn, for the freeway k = y_T (if the player is on freeway k at turn T) then we check if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNote: the player is on freeway y_T at turn T. And the update of the player happens at the same time as the cars? The problem says: \n    \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAlso note: when the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at the moment of turn T, the player is still on y_T. Then at turn T+1, the player is on y_{T+1}. \n\nSo at turn T, we are on freeway y_T, and we check the cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nWe start at (0,0) at turn 0. We are at y=0. The freeways are from 1 to 8. So at turn 0, we are at y=0 (which is not a freeway) so no collision.\n\nWe need to reach (0,9). The freeway at y=9? But the freeways are defined for y=1..8. So when we are at y=9, there are no cars? So we don't check any freeway? Therefore, we are safe at y=9.\n\nHowever, note the problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". So when we are on freeway k (which is from 1 to 8) at turn T, then we must avoid having 0 in the span of a car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nOur goal: minimize H (number of turns) and provide the sequence of actions from turn t1=0 to turn t1+H-1.\n\nWe start at (0,0). We can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). But note: if we are at y=0 and we try to go down, we stay at 0 (since y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]). Similarly, at y=9 we cannot go up.\n\nWe need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns in terms of vertical moves is 9 moves (if we only move up). But we have to avoid the freeways at the times when we are on them and the cars cover x=0.\n\nSo we must plan the moves so that when we are on a freeway k at turn T, the cars on freeway k do not have 0 in their span at that turn.\n\nWe are going to simulate the moves. We have to choose a sequence of actions (U, D, S) to move from 0 to 9.\n\nWe can also wait (by using S) to avoid a collision.\n\nWe note that the cars move continuously (in discrete steps) along the x-axis.\n\nWe are going to compute for each freeway and each car, the times when they cover x=0.\n\nBut note: a car covers x=0 at time T if 0 is in [left_end(T), right_end(T)].\n\nFor a right-moving car on freeway k, with initial tail = t0, head = h0 (at turn t1=0), speed = s, then at turn T:\n    left_end = t0 + s*T\n    right_end = h0 + s*T\nWe require: left_end <= 0 <= right_end.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, but we don't have any left-moving in this instance.\n\nSo for each car, we can compute the set of T (integer turns) for which 0 is in the interval.\n\nBut note: the problem says the cars are updated for T>t1, and we are at turn 0.\n\nLet's compute for each freeway the dangerous times (when at least one car on that freeway has 0 in its span).\n\nFreeway 1: \n    Car: (-48, -83, right, 36) -> tail=-83, head=-48, speed=36.\n    At time T: left = -83 + 36*T, right = -48 + 36*T.\n    We need: -83+36T <= 0 <= -48+36T\n        => 36T <= 48  => T <= 48/36 = 4/3 = 1.333 -> T<=1 (integer)\n        and 36T >= 83? -> T >= 83/36 ≈ 2.305 -> T>=3? \n    But wait: we require both:\n        -83+36T <= 0  => T <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305 -> so T<=2\n        and 0 <= -48+36T => 48 <= 36T => T >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333 -> T>=2? (since T integer, T>=2)\n\n    So T=2: \n        left = -83 + 36*2 = -83+72 = -11\n        right = -48+72 = 24 -> 0 is in [-11,24] -> dangerous at T=2.\n    T=1: left=-83+36=-47, right=-48+36=-12 -> 0 is not in [-47,-12] -> safe.\n    T=0: left=-83, right=-48 -> safe.\n\n    So freeway 1 is dangerous only at T=2.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? \n    Car: (-48, -83, right, 36) -> same as above, dangerous at T=2.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 1 -> dangerous at T=2.\n\nFreeway 4: (-48, -71, right, 24) -> tail=-71, head=-48, speed=24.\n    At time T: left = -71+24T, right = -48+24T.\n    Conditions:\n        -71+24T <= 0 -> 24T <=71 -> T<=71/24≈2.958 -> T<=2\n        0<=-48+24T -> 48<=24T -> T>=2.\n    So T=2: \n        left = -71+48 = -23, right = -48+48=0 -> 0 is in [-23,0] -> dangerous? Note: the interval is inclusive? The problem says \"if 0 in Span(T)\", so at T=2, 0 is the right endpoint -> included -> dangerous.\n\n    T=1: left=-71+24=-47, right=-48+24=-24 -> safe.\n    T=0: safe.\n\n    So freeway 4 dangerous at T=2.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4 -> dangerous at T=2.\n\nFreeway 6: same -> dangerous at T=2.\n\nFreeway 7: has three cars. We must check each one.\n\n    Car1: (48,37,right,4) -> tail=37, head=48, speed=4.\n        At T: left=37+4T, right=48+4T.\n        Conditions: 37+4T<=0<=48+4T -> \n            left<=0: 37+4T<=0 -> 4T<=-37 -> T<=-9.25 -> never (T>=0) -> safe for all T.\n\n    Car2: (12,1,right,4) -> tail=1, head=12, speed=4.\n        left=1+4T, right=12+4T.\n        Conditions: 1+4T<=0<=12+4T -> \n            1+4T<=0 -> 4T<=-1 -> T<=-0.25 -> never -> safe.\n\n    Car3: (-24,-35,right,4) -> tail=-35, head=-24, speed=4.\n        left=-35+4T, right=-24+4T.\n        Conditions: -35+4T<=0<=-24+4T -> \n            left<=0: 4T<=35 -> T<=8.75\n            right>=0: -24+4T>=0 -> 4T>=24 -> T>=6\n        So T in [6,8] (integer T=6,7,8) are dangerous.\n\n        T=6: left=-35+24=-11, right=-24+24=0 -> 0 included -> dangerous.\n        T=7: left=-35+28=-7, right=-24+28=4 -> 0 in [-7,4] -> dangerous.\n        T=8: left=-35+32=-3, right=-24+32=8 -> dangerous.\n\n    Therefore, freeway 7 is dangerous at T=6,7,8.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7 -> dangerous at T=6,7,8.\n\nSummary of dangerous freeways by time:\n\nAt turn T=0: we are at y=0 (safe) -> no freeway to check.\n\nAt turn T=1: \n    freeway 1: safe\n    freeway 2: safe\n    freeway 3: safe\n    freeway 4: safe\n    freeway 5: safe\n    freeway 6: safe\n    freeway 7: safe (none of the cars cover 0 at T=1: car3: left=-35+4=-31, right=-24+4=-20 -> 0 not in [-31,-20])\n    freeway 8: safe\n\nAt turn T=2: \n    freeways 1,2,3,4,5,6: dangerous (all at T=2)\n    freeway 7: safe (car3: left=-35+8=-27, right=-24+8=-16 -> safe)\n    freeway 8: safe\n\nSo if we are on any of freeways 1 to 6 at T=2, we crash.\n\nAt turn T=3: \n    freeway1: T=3: left=-83+108=25, right=-48+108=60 -> safe? (0 not in [25,60]) -> safe.\n    Similarly, freeway2,3: same -> safe.\n    freeway4: T=3: left=-71+72=1, right=-48+72=24 -> 0 not in [1,24] -> safe.\n    freeway5,6: same -> safe.\n    freeway7: car3: left=-35+12=-23, right=-24+12=-12 -> safe.\n    freeway8: same -> safe.\n\nAt turn T=4: \n    freeway1: safe (as above, even safer)\n    ...\n    freeway7: car3: left=-35+16=-19, right=-24+16=-8 -> safe.\n\nAt turn T=5: \n    freeway7: car3: left=-35+20=-15, right=-24+20=-4 -> safe.\n\nAt turn T=6: \n    freeway7 and 8: dangerous (from above, T=6,7,8)\n\nAt turn T=7: dangerous for freeway7,8.\n\nAt turn T=8: dangerous for freeway7,8.\n\nAt turn T=9: \n    freeway7: car3: left=-35+36=1, right=-24+36=12 -> safe? (0 not in [1,12]) -> safe.\n\nBut note: we are going to be on a freeway only when we are at y between 1 and 8.\n\nOur plan: we start at y0=0 at T=0.\n\nWe want to get to y=9. The minimal moves would be 9 consecutive U moves. Then we would be at:\n\nTurn 0: y=0 -> safe\nTurn 1: move U -> y=1 (freeway1) at T=1 -> safe? at T=1, freeway1 is safe -> yes.\nTurn 2: move U -> y=2 (freeway2) at T=2 -> but freeway2 is dangerous at T=2 -> crash.\n\nSo we cannot be on freeway2 at T=2. Similarly, we cannot be on any freeway 1..6 at T=2.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on freeways 1..6 at T=2.\n\nOne idea: wait at y=0 for one turn? Then at turn0: stay at 0 (action S). Then at turn1: we are still at y=0? No: \n    If we do S at turn0: y1 = y0 + 0 = 0.\nThen at turn1: we are at (0,0) again? Then we can move.\n\nBut we are at turn1: y=0 -> safe (no freeway). Then at turn1 we can do U to go to y=1 at turn2? Then at turn2: we are on freeway1 at T=2 -> dangerous! So that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, we can go up to y=1 at T=1 (which is safe) and then at T=2, instead of going up to y=2 (which would be dangerous) we can stay at y=1? \n    Then at T=2, we are on freeway1 at T=2 -> dangerous? freeway1 is dangerous at T=2 -> crash.\n\nOr we can go down? But at T=1 we are at y=1, then at T=2 we do D -> y=0? Then we avoid the freeway at T=2 because we are at y=0 (safe). But then we are back to 0.\n\nWe need to get to 9 eventually.\n\nAnother idea: we can avoid the dangerous time T=2 by not being on freeways 1..6 at T=2. But note that freeways 7 and 8 are safe at T=2. So if we can be at freeway7 or 8 at T=2? \n\nBut from y=0 at T=0 to y=7 at T=2? That would require 7 moves in 2 turns: impossible (max we can do is 2 moves: from 0 to 2).\n\nAlternatively, we can wait at y=0 for more turns? \n\nLet me try:\n\nOption 1: wait at y=0 until after T=2? \n    Turn0: S -> y=0 at T=1\n    Turn1: S -> y=0 at T=2\n    Turn2: U -> y=1 at T=3 -> safe (freeway1 at T=3 is safe, as we saw)\n\nThen we can proceed upwards. But note: we must also avoid freeway7,8 at T=6,7,8.\n\nSo from T=3: we are at y=1. Then we can go up as fast as possible? \n\nTurn3: U -> y=2 at T=4 -> freeway2 at T=4: safe (we saw freeway2 is safe for T>=3)\nTurn4: U -> y=3 at T=5 -> freeway3 at T=5: safe\nTurn5: U -> y=4 at T=6 -> freeway4 at T=6: safe (freeway4: at T=6: left=-71+24*6=-71+144=73, right=-48+144=96 -> safe)\nTurn6: U -> y=5 at T=7 -> freeway5 at T=7: safe? freeway5 same as freeway4: at T=7: left=-71+24*7=-71+168=97 -> safe.\nTurn7: U -> y=6 at T=8 -> freeway6 at T=8: safe? freeway6: at T=8: left=-71+24*8=-71+192=121 -> safe.\nTurn8: U -> y=7 at T=9 -> freeway7 at T=9: safe? we saw at T=9: freeway7 car3: [1,12] -> safe.\nTurn9: U -> y=8 at T=10 -> freeway8 at T=10: same as freeway7? \n        freeway8: car3: at T=10: left=-35+40=5, right=-24+40=16 -> safe? 0 not in [5,16] -> safe.\nTurn10: U -> y=9 at T=11 -> goal.\n\nSo total turns: 11? But we started at turn0 and we did 11 moves: from turn0 to turn10 (so H=11? because we need to count the number of actions: from t0 to t10 -> 11 actions? but the sequence is from t0 to t10, which is 11 turns?).\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we have H actions. And we start at turn t1 and then we do H actions, so we end at turn t1 + H - 1? \n\nActually, the player update: at turn t, we do action a_t, and then we get the next state at turn t+1.\n\nWe start at turn0. After H actions, we have done actions at turn0, turn1, ... turnH-1, and we are at turn H (state at turn H). And we want at turn H-1? \n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nSo we start at turn0 (t1=0). We do actions at turn0, turn1, ... turnH-1, and at the end of these actions, at turn H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nIn the above plan:\n\nAt turn0: we do S -> at turn1: (0,0)\nAt turn1: S -> turn2: (0,0)\nAt turn2: U -> turn3: (0,1)\nAt turn3: U -> turn4: (0,2)\nAt turn4: U -> turn5: (0,3)\nAt turn5: U -> turn6: (0,4)\nAt turn6: U -> turn7: (0,5)\nAt turn7: U -> turn8: (0,6)\nAt turn8: U -> turn9: (0,7)\nAt turn9: U -> turn10: (0,8)\nAt turn10: U -> turn11: (0,9)\n\nBut we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 = 0+H-1. So at turn H-1 we are at (0,9). In the above, we are at (0,9) at turn11. So we require H-1=11 -> H=12? \n\nBut note: we did 11 actions (from turn0 to turn10). So the last action is at turn10, and then at turn10 we do U and then at the next state (turn11) we are at y=9. But we are required to have the position at the turn after the last action? \n\nThe problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nAt turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nHow do we compute the turn? \n    At the start: turn t1 (which is 0) we are at (0,y0)= (0,0). \n    Then we do action a_{t1} (turn0) -> then we are at turn t1+1 (turn1) at y1.\n    Then ... until we do action a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1? But then the next state is at turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem says: we are to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\nThis implies that we are at (0,9) at the same turn as the last action? But the update happens after the action. \n\nRe-read the update: \n    \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nSo at turn t, we do action a_t, and then at turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, we start at turn0: we are at (0,y0). \n    After action a0 at turn0, at turn1 we are at (0,y1).\n    ...\n    After action a_{H-1} at turn H-1, at turn H we are at (0,y_H).\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nt1+H-1 is the turn index at which we are at (0,9)? \n\nBut according to the update, at turn t, the position is (0,y_t). So if we are at (0,9) at turn T, that means that the action at turn T-1 caused the move to y_T=9.\n\nThe problem says: we do actions from t1 to t1+H-1 (H actions) and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nBut by the update, the action at turn t1+H-1 produces the state at turn t1+H. \n\nThere seems to be a confusion.\n\nLooking back: \n    \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nAnd the update: \n    y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo at the start (turn t1) we are at y_{t1}. Then after the first action (at turn t1) we get y_{t1+1}. Then after the second action (at turn t1+1) we get y_{t1+2}, ... and after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we get y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? That would be the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is y_{t1+H-1}. And then we do an action to get y_{t1+H}. \n\nThe problem must mean that at the turn after the last action we are at (0,9)? But it says \"at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nAlternatively, note that the problem says: \"current turn is t1\", and we are at (0, y_{t1}). Then we do H actions: from t1 to t1+H-1, and then we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut that would require that we are at (0,9) at the same turn as the last action, without having moved? \n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nLooking at the answer format: \n    Turn t1: a_{t1}\n    Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n    ...\n    Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nSo we write H lines, for turns t1 to t1+H-1. And we want that at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nBut by the update: \n    At turn t1: we do a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1 we are at a new state.\n    ...\n    At turn t1+H-1: we do a_{t1+H-1} -> then at turn t1+H we are at a new state.\n\nBut the problem says we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. That would be the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. But then we do an action to move to the next state.\n\nSo if we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we don't need to do any action? But we are required to do an action at that turn? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me look at the problem statement: \n    \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nand the player update is defined as: \n    y_{t+1} = ... \n\nSo the position at turn t is y_t. \n\nTherefore, we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nAnd we do actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2? But the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nActually, the actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. And the state at turn t1 is given. Then:\n\n    After action at t1: state at t1+1 is updated.\n    ...\n    After action at t1+H-1: state at t1+H is updated.\n\nBut we care about the state at the turns: we want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9). \n\nThat means that we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? Then we do an action at turn t1+H-1 to go to turn t1+H, but we don't care about that state? \n\nBut that would be inconsistent because we require the last action to be at turn t1+H-1, and then we are at (0,9) at the same turn (before the action) or after?\n\nI think the problem means: we want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9). And we do actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2, which cause the state at turns t1+1, t1+2, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nTherefore, the number of actions is H-1? But the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1, which is H actions.\n\nAlternatively, note the index: \n    We do actions: \n        a_{t1} at turn t1: then state at turn t1+1 is updated.\n        a_{t1+1} at turn t1+1: state at turn t1+2 is updated.\n        ...\n        a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1: state at turn t1+H is updated.\n\nBut we want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9. So we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nHow many actions have been taken to get to state at turn t1+H-1? \n    We started at turn t1 (state given). \n    To get to state at turn t1+1: we did one action (at turn t1).\n    To get to state at turn t1+2: we did two actions (at turn t1 and t1+1).\n    ...\n    To get to state at turn t1+H-1: we did (H-1) actions (at turns t1 to t1+H-2).\n\nBut the problem says the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, which is H actions, and we want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9.\n\nThis implies that we are doing H actions, but we only care about the state after the first H-1 actions? \n\nThis is messy.\n\nLet me assume that the problem means: \n    We start at turn t1. We do H actions. Then the state at the turn after the last action (turn t1+H) is (0,9). \nBut the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean: \n    We do H actions, and then at the turn when we have done the last action (turn t1+H-1), we are at (0,9) at that turn (meaning before the action? or after the action?).\n\nTo resolve, let's look at the collision condition: \n    \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nThe state at turn T is (0, y_T). And we are on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nSo we care about the state at turn T: y_T.\n\nWe want at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9) and we have avoided collisions at every turn from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nIn the update: \n    At turn t1: we start at y_{t1}. Then we do action a_{t1} to move to y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1.\n    At turn t1+1: we are at y_{t1+1}, and we do action a_{t1+1} to move to y_{t1+2} at turn t1+2.\n    ...\n    At turn t1+H-1: we are at y_{t1+H-1} = 9, and we do action a_{t1+H-1} to move to y_{t1+H} (which we don't care about).\n\nBut the collision condition at turn t1+H-1: we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9, and 9 is not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nSo the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and we are at 9 at that turn? \n\nBut the update rule: the action a_t at turn t determines y_{t+1}. So to be at 9 at turn t, we must have been moved there by the previous action.\n\nTherefore, the only way to be at 9 at turn t is if the action at turn t-1 moved us to 9.\n\nSo for turn t1+H-1 to be 9, we must have that the action at turn t1+H-2 moved us to 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut then we do an action at turn t1+H-1? But we are already at 9. That action might move us away? \n\nThe problem doesn't say we have to stay there, but it only requires to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So we can be there and then move away? \n\nBut the minimal H would be if we get there as soon as possible and then stop? However, the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then provide the sequence of H actions.\n\nAnd the last action is at turn t1+H-1. And we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\nSo if we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, then we are safe at that turn (since y=9 is not a freeway).\n\nBut how did we get there? The action at turn t1+H-2 caused y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nThen at turn t1+H-1, we do an action. What action? It can be any, because we are already at the goal at that turn. But we must avoid collision at that turn: at turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9 -> safe.\n\nSo the last action is not used to move to 9, but we are already at 9 at the beginning of the turn, and then we do an action that might move us or not, but we are required to be at 9 at that turn (beginning) and then we do an action.\n\nThis is a bit odd, but it meets the requirement.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a off-by-one. But we'll follow the requirement.\n\nSo in the example above with 11 actions (from turn0 to turn10) we were at y=9 at turn11. But we want to be at y=9 at turn10? \n\nBecause we do actions at turn0 to turn10 (11 actions, H=11), then we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 = 0+11-1 = 10. So at turn10, we are at (0,9).\n\nSo in the plan I described, we were at (0,9) at turn11, which is too late.\n\nWe need to be at (0,9) at turn10.\n\nSo how to get to y=9 by turn10.\n\nWe start at turn0: y0=0.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn10.\n\nThe net movement is 9. Each U is +1, D is -1, S is 0. So the number of U minus number of D must be 9.\n\nThe total number of actions is 10 (if we want to be at turn10 after 10 actions?).\n\nBut note: we do actions at turn0, turn1, ... turn9 (10 actions) and then at turn10 we are at y10=9.\n\nThe actions from turn0 to turn9: 10 actions.\n\nThe minimal number of moves is 9 if we do 9 U and one S, but we have to avoid collisions.\n\nIn the earlier plan, we had a delay at the beginning. Can we arrive at turn10?\n\nLet me try to optimize.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeways 1..6 at turn2.\n\nAlso avoid freeways 7 and 8 at turns6,7,8.\n\nWe can try to go as fast as possible, but skip the dangerous turns.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nWe start at turn0: we can do U at turn0: then at turn1 we are at y1=1 (freeway1). At turn1, freeway1 is safe.\n\nAt turn1: we want to avoid being on freeway2 at turn2? But if we go U at turn1, then at turn2 we are at y2=2 (freeway2) at T=2 -> crash.\n\nSo at turn1: we cannot go U. We can only do S or D.\n\nIf we do S at turn1: then at turn2 we are at y2=1 (freeway1) at T=2 -> crash.\n\nIf we do D at turn1: then at turn2 we are at y2=0 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn2: we are at y=0, and we can then start moving up.\n\nBut we are already behind.\n\nHow about we move up to y=3 quickly? But we have to pass through freeways 1,2,3 at some turns.\n\nBut we must avoid being on them at T=2.\n\nWe can try to be at y=3 at turn3? Then we are safe for freeway3 at T=3.\n\nHow:\n\nTurn0: U -> y1=1 (at turn1) -> safe (freeway1 at T1 safe)\nTurn1: U -> y2=2 (at turn2) -> freeway2 at T2: dangerous! -> crash.\n\nSo that fails.\n\nTurn0: U -> y1=1 (turn1)\nTurn1: D -> y2=0 (turn2) -> safe (y0)\nTurn2: U -> y3=1 (turn3) -> freeway1 at T3: safe? yes, as computed earlier.\nTurn3: U -> y4=2 (turn4) -> freeway2 at T4: safe? yes (freeway2 at T4: left=-83+36*4=-83+144=61, right=-48+144=96 -> safe)\nTurn4: U -> y5=3 (turn5) -> freeway3 at T5: safe\nTurn5: U -> y6=4 (turn6) -> freeway4 at T6: safe (as before, freeway4: T6: left=-71+24*6=73, right=96 -> safe)\nTurn6: U -> y7=5 (turn7) -> freeway5 at T7: safe (freeway5 same as freeway4: T7: left=-71+24*7=97, safe)\nTurn7: U -> y8=6 (turn8) -> freeway6 at T8: safe (T8: left=-71+24*8=121, safe)\nTurn8: U -> y9=7 (turn9) -> freeway7 at T9: safe (T9: car3: left=-35+36=1, right=12 -> safe)\nTurn9: U -> y10=8 (turn10) -> freeway8 at T10: safe (T10: car3: left=-35+40=5, right=16 -> safe)\nThen we are at y10=8 at turn10, but we want to be at 9 at turn10? \n\nWe need one more U.\n\nTurn10: U -> y11=9 at turn11.\n\nBut we want to be at 9 at turn10.\n\nSo we are at 8 at turn10.\n\nHow to get to 9 by turn10? \n\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn10.\n\nWe started at y0=0. We need to gain 9 in 10 turns? \n\nWe have 10 actions: turn0 to turn9.\n\nEach U: +1, D: -1, S:0.\n\nSum of moves must be +9.\n\nThe minimal number of U is 9. So we can do 9 U and 1 S (or 9 U and 1 D, but D would reduce the net, so we need 10 U? No, 9 U and one S: net +9.\n\nBut with 9 U and one S, we have 10 actions.\n\nWe have to place the S somewhere to avoid a collision.\n\nIn the above plan, if we do 9 U and one S, and we avoid the dangerous turns.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on freeway1..6 at T=2, and freeway7,8 at T=6,7,8.\n\nWe have an extra S to use.\n\nWe can use the S to wait at a safe spot.\n\nFor example, we can wait at y=0 for one turn? But then we start with S.\n\nTurn0: S -> y1=0\nTurn1: U -> y2=1 (at turn2) -> freeway1 at T2: dangerous -> crash.\n\nNot good.\n\nWait at y=3? But we have to get to y=3 without crashing.\n\nLet me try:\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at turn10.\n\nWe need to avoid:\n\n- At turn2: we cannot be on freeways 1..6.\n\n- At turns6,7,8: we cannot be on freeways7,8.\n\nWe can be on freeways7,8 at turns other than 6,7,8.\n\nAnd freeways1..6 are safe for turns>=3.\n\nSo one idea: go up as fast as possible until we are about to hit a dangerous freeway, then wait, then continue.\n\nWe can try to get to y=6 by turn5? Then we can go through freeway7 and 8 at turn5 and turn6? but freeway7 at turn6 is dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, we can wait at y=6 for some turns? But freeway6 is safe at turn6? \n\nfreeway6: at turn6: left=-71+24*6=73, safe. So we can be at freeway6 at turn6.\n\nBut then at turn6: we are at y6=6 (freeway6) -> safe.\nThen at turn6: we do U -> then at turn7 we are at y7=7 (freeway7) at T7: dangerous! -> crash.\n\nSo we cannot be on freeway7 at T7.\n\nWe need to delay being on freeway7 until after T8.\n\nSo we must not be on freeway7 or 8 at T6, T7, T8.\n\nThat means if we are on freeway7 at T6, T7, or T8, we crash.\n\nSo we can be on freeway7 at T5, T9, T10, etc.\n\nSimilarly for freeway8.\n\nNow, we want to be at y=9 at T10.\n\nWe can plan:\n\n- We need to be at y=7 (freeway7) at a safe time: T<=5 or T>=9.\n\nBut T>=9: then we are at freeway7 at T9 or T10.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8 at T9 or T10 is safe.\n\nBut we also have to cover the lower freeways safely.\n\nLet me try to reach y=6 by turn5: safe (since freeway6 at T5: safe).\n\nThen we can wait at y=6 for 3 turns (to skip the dangerous times T6,T7,T8 for freeway7 and 8) and then at turn9, move to y=7, then turn10 to y=8, and then we need turn11 to go to y=9? But we want to be at y=9 at turn10.\n\nAlternatively, we can go from y=6 to y=9 in 3 turns (turn6: y=6, turn7: y=7, turn8: y=8, turn9: y=9) -> but then at turn7: y=7 at T7: dangerous; turn8: y=8 at T8: dangerous.\n\nSo that won't work.\n\nWe must not be on y=7 or 8 during turns6,7,8.\n\nSo we can be at y=7 at turn5 or turn9, turn10.\n\nBut turn10: we want to be at y=9, so we can't be at y=7 at turn10.\n\nSimilarly, we can be at y=8 at turn9 or turn10.\n\nBut if we are at y=7 at turn9, then at turn9 we do U to go to y=8 at turn10, but then at turn10 we are at y=8, not 9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn10, we must be at y=8 at turn9, then do U at turn9 to get y10=9.\n\nBut then at turn9, we are at y9=8 (freeway8) at T9: safe? freeway8 at T9: car3: left=-35+36=1, right=12 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn9: do U -> y10=9.\n\nSo the plan:\n\nWe need to be at y=8 at turn9.\n\nAnd we need to avoid:\n  - freeways 1..6 at turn2\n  - freeways 7 and 8 at turns6,7,8\n\nHow to get to y=8 at turn9.\n\nWe start at y0=0.\n\nWe have 9 actions (turn0 to turn8) to go from 0 to 8? net +8.\n\nWe can do 8 U and 1 S, or 9 U and 1 D? but net must be 8.\n\nMinimal actions is 8 U, but we have 9 actions, so we have one extra action that is S or D or U.\n\nWe can do 8 U and 1 S.\n\nNow, we have to avoid the dangerous turns.\n\nDangerous turns for freeways 1..6: only turn2.\n\nDangerous turns for freeways 7 and 8: turns6,7,8.\n\nWe must not be on freeway1..6 at turn2, and not on freeway7 or 8 at turns6,7,8.\n\nWe will be on freeway7 or 8 only if we are at y=7 or 8 at turns6,7,8.\n\nWe want to be at y=8 at turn9, so we are not on freeway7 or 8 at turns6,7,8? because at those turns we will be at lower freeways.\n\nBut we will be at freeway7 or 8 at turn9: which is safe.\n\nSo the only constraint is to avoid being on freeway1..6 at turn2.\n\nWe also have to avoid being on freeway7 or 8 at turns6,7,8, but since we won't be at y=7 or 8 until turn9, we are safe.\n\nThe journey from y=0 to y=8 in 9 actions (8U and 1S) and avoid being on freeway1..6 at turn2.\n\nWhen are we on freeway1..6? only if we are at y in {1,2,3,4,5,6} at turn2.\n\nWe need to ensure that at turn2, we are not in {1,2,3,4,5,6}. \n\nThe only safe y at turn2 are 0,7,8,9. But we can't be at 7,8,9 at turn2 because we start at 0 and in two moves we can only reach at most 2.\n\nSo the only safe y at turn2 is 0.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 at turn2.\n\nHow to be at y=0 at turn2?\n\nWe start at turn0: y0=0.\n\nWe do action0: must leave us at y1=0 at turn1? But then at turn1 we are at 0.\n\nThen action1: must leave us at y2=0 at turn2.\n\nSo action0 and action1 must be S or D. But if we do D at y0=0, we stay at 0. Similarly, S stays.\n\nSo we can do: \n    turn0: S or D -> y1=0\n    turn1: S or D -> y2=0\n\nThen we are safe at turn2.\n\nThen we have 7 actions (turn2 to turn8) to go from y2=0 to y9=8.\n\nNet +8 in 7 actions: so we need 8 U and one non-U? But 7 actions for net +8 requires at least 8 U and one D? That would be 8U and 1D: net +7, not enough.\n\nWe have 7 actions for 8 steps up: impossible.\n\nWe have 9 actions in total (turn0 to turn8), but we used 2 actions to stay at 0, so we have 7 actions left.\n\nWith 7 actions, the maximum net gain is 7 (if we do 7U). But we need 8.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to be at y=8 at turn9 if we spend two turns at 0.\n\nWe need to be at y=8 at turn9, but we only have 9 actions from turn0 to turn8. The net gain from these 9 actions must be 8.\n\nThat means we must have at least 8 U and the other action can be S or D? \n    If we have 8U and 1S: net +8.\n    If we have 8U and 1D: net +7 -> not enough.\n    If we have 9U: net+9 -> too much, we only need 8.\n\nSo the only possibility is 8U and 1S.\n\nBut we must use one S.\n\nWe can use the S at a safe place.\n\nBut we also must be at y=0 at turn2.\n\nLet me denote the state at turn0: y0=0.\n\nAfter action0: y1 = y0 + a0, where a0 in { -1,0,1} but bounded to [0,9].\n\nWe require y2=0.\n\ny2 = y1 + a1.\n\nWe have:\n    y1 = 0 + a0\n    y2 = y1 + a1 = a0 + a1\n\nWe require y2=0, so a0 + a1 =0.\n\nSince a0 and a1 are in {-1,0,1} and a0>=0, then the only possibilities are:\n    a0=0, a1=0\n    a0=1, a1=-1\n    a0=-1, a1=1 -> but a0 cannot be -1 at y0=0 because y1 would be -1, which is clamped to 0? \n\nThe problem says: y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we try to go below 0, we stay at 0.\n\nSo if a0 = D, then y1 = max(0, 0-1)=0.\nSimilarly, a0 = S: y1=0.\na0 = U: y1=1.\n\nThen for a1:\n    if a0=0: then y1=0, then a1 can be D or S: y2=0, or U: y2=1.\n    if a0=1: y1=1, then a1 can be D: y2=0, or S: y2=1, or U: y2=2.\n\nSo to have y2=0:\n    - if a0=S or D, then a1 must be S or D -> y2=0.\n    - if a0=U, then a1 must be D -> y2=0.\n\nSo we have two options:\n   Option A: a0=S or D, a1=S or D.\n   Option B: a0=U, a1=D.\n\nIn option B: \n    turn0: U -> y1=1 (at turn1) \n    turn1: D -> y2=0 (at turn2)\n\nThen we are at 0 at turn2, safe.\n\nAnd we used one U and one D, net 0.\n\nThen we have 7 actions (turn2 to turn8) to net +8: impossible because 7 actions can net at most 7.\n\nIn option A: a0 and a1 are S or D, so net 0. Then we have 7 actions to net +8: also impossible.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y=0 at turn2 and then get to y=8 at turn9 with only 7 actions.\n\nSo we cannot use the strategy of being at 0 at turn2.\n\nWe must be at a safe y at turn2 that is not in {1,2,3,4,5,6} and within 2 moves from 0.\n\nThe only possibilities are y=0 or y=1 or y=2? but y=1 and 2 are freeways and dangerous at turn2.\n\nOr y>2? impossible in two moves.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 at turn2.\n\nBut then we cannot reach y=8 at turn9.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H might be larger than 10.\n\nEarlier with 11 actions (H=11) we had a valid plan, but we were at y=9 at turn11, and we want to be at y=9 at turn10 for H=11? \n\nLet me clarify the turn indexing for H=11.\n\nWe do actions from turn0 to turn10 (11 actions), and then the state at turn11 is y11=9.\n\nBut we want the state at turn0+H-1 = turn0+11-1 = turn10 to be 9.\n\nSo we need a plan that gets us to y=9 at turn10.\n\nHow many actions? H=11 actions to get to turn10 state being 9.\n\nWe need to go from y0=0 to y10=9 in 10 steps ( because the actions from turn0 to turn10-1 = turn9 affect states from turn1 to turn10).\n\nThe states: \n    turn0: y0=0\n    after action0 ( turn0): turn1: y1 = y0 + a0\n    ...\n    after action9 ( turn9): turn10: y10 = y9 + a9\n\nWe want y10=9.\n\nWe have 10 actions: a0 to a9.\n\nNet gain: 9.\n\nSo we need net +9 in 10 actions: 9 U and 1 S, or 10 U, etc. Minimal is 9 U and 1 non-U.\n\nNow, we must avoid:\n    at turn2: not on freeway1..6\n    at turns6,7,8: not on freeway7,8\n\nWe also note that at turn10, we are at y=9, which is safe.\n\nWe can use the S to wait at a safe spot.\n\nWe must be at y=0 at turn2.\n\nSo for the first two actions, we must ensure y2=0.\n\nThis is the same as before.\n\nWe have two actions (a0 and a1) to keep y2=0.\n\nThen we have 8 actions (a2 to a9) to net +9.\n\nNet gain from a0 to a9: must be 9.\n\nBut a0 and a1 net 0.\n\nSo a2 to a9 must net 9 in 8 actions: requires at least 9 U and one non-U? but 8 actions can only have net at most 8.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to net 9 in 8 actions.\n\nWe need to net 9 in 10 actions, and the first two actions net 0, leaving 8 actions to net 9: impossible.\n\nWe must net 9 in the 10 actions.\n\nBut if the first two actions net 0, then the last 8 must net 9: which is impossible.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=0 at turn2.\n\nWe must be at a safe position at turn2, but the only safe position is y=0.\n\n unless we can be at y=7 or 8 at turn2, but that's impossible.\n\nTherefore, we must use a different strategy: be on a freeway that is not dangerous at turn2.\n\nBut freeways 1..6 are dangerous at turn2, and freeways 7 and 8 are safe at turn2.\n\nSo if we can be at y=7 or 8 at turn2, we are safe.\n\nIs it possible to reach y=7 or 8 in two moves from y=0? \n    turn0: U -> y1=1\n    turn1: U -> y2=2\n    cannot reach 7 or 8.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only safe position at turn2 is y=0.\n\nAnd then we have to net +9 in the next 8 actions: impossible.\n\nBut wait, we have 10 actions in total for the 10 state changes (from turn0 to turn10), but the first two actions are used to stay at 0, so only 8 actions for the rise, and 8 actions can only net +8, but we need +9.\n\n unless we use more actions.\n\nFor H=11 actions, we are to be at turn0+11-1 = turn10 at y=9.\n\nSo states: turn0 to turn10.\n\nWe have 10 state changes: from turn0 to turn1, turn1 to turn2, ..., turn9 to turn10.\n\nActions: a0 to a9 (10 actions) to influence these 10 state changes.\n\nWe want y10=9.\n\nNet gain from turn0 to turn10: 9.\n\nWe must have y2=0.\n\nThen the net gain from turn0 to turn2 is 0.\n\nThen from turn2 to turn10: 8 state changes ( actions a2 to a9) to net 9.\n\n8 state changes can net at most 8.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to achieve with H=10 or H=11 actions if we require y2=0.\n\nBut earlier with H=11 actions ( a0 to a10) we were at turn11 with y=9, and that was for being at turn11.\n\nFor the requirement to be at turn10 with y=9, we need to achieve it in 10 state changes.\n\nBut then we are at turn10 after 10 state changes, with y10=9.\n\nAnd we must avoid being on freeway1..6 at turn2.\n\nWe must have y2=0.\n\nThen net from turn0 to turn2: 0.\n\nNet from turn2 to turn10: 9 in 8 state changes: impossible.\n\nUnless we are not at y=0 at turn2, but we must be at a safe y at turn2, and the only safe y is 0.\n\nTherefore, we must find a way to be at a safe freeway at turn2.\n\nBut freeways 7 and 8 are safe at turn2, and we can't reach them.\n\nSo the only possibility is to be at y=0 at turn2.\n\nAnd then we need to net 9 in the remaining 8 state changes: impossible.\n\nThis suggests that we have to use more than 10 state changes.\n\nLet me try H=12 actions.\n\nThen we are to be at turn0+12-1 = turn11 with y=9.\n\nWe have 12 actions: a0 to a11.\n\nWe want y11=9.\n\nNet gain: 9.\n\nNumber of state changes: 12.\n\nWe can be at y2=0.\n\nThen net from turn0 to turn2: 0.\n\nNet from turn2 to turn11: 9 state changes to net 9.\n\nSo we can do 9 U and 0 non-U? But we have 9 state changes for 9 steps, but we have 9 state changes from turn2 to turn11? \n    state at turn2: y2=0.\n    state at turn3: y3 = y2 + a2\n    ...\n    state at turn11: y11 = y10 + a10\n\nSo there are 9 state changes (from turn2 to turn3, ... turn11).\n\nWe need net +9 in 9 state changes: so we can do 9 U.\n\nBut we must avoid collisions at turns: turn2: safe (y=0), turn3: y3=1 (freeway1) -> must be safe at turn3: freeway1 at T3: safe.\n turn4: y4=2 (freeway2) at T4: safe.\n turn5: y5=3 (freeway3) at T5: safe.\n turn6: y6=4 (freeway4) at T6: safe.\n turn7: y7=5 (freeway5) at T7: safe.\n turn8: y8=6 (freeway6) at T8: safe.\n turn9: y9=7 (freeway7) at T9: safe.\n turn10: y10=8 (freeway8) at T10: safe.\n turn11: y11=9 (goal, safe).\n\nBut note: at turn6: y6=4 -> freeway4 at T6: safe ( as computed: left=73, right=96, 0 not in)\n turn7: y7=5 -> freeway5 at T7: safe (left=97, right=120)\n turn8: y8=6 -> freeway6 at T8: safe (left=121, right=144)\n turn9: y9=7 -> freeway7 at T9: safe (car3: [1,12], safe)\n turn10: y10=8 -> freeway8 at T10: car3: [5,16] -> safe.\n\nSo this plan is safe.\n\nThe actions: \n    a0 and a1: to keep y2=0.\n    a2 to a10: 9 U actions.\n\nBut we have 12 actions? H=12, so a0 to a11.\n\nWe have a11 to do.\n\nWe are at turn11: we are at y11=9. We need to do an action at turn11, but the state at turn11 is already 9, and we are to be at turn11 at 9, so we can do any action (S, for example).\n\nSo the plan:\n\n turn0: S (or D) -> y1=0\n turn1: S (or D) -> y2=0\n turn2: U -> y3=1\n turn3: U -> y4=2\n turn4: U -> y5=3\n turn5: U -> y6=4\n turn6: U -> y7=5\n turn7: U -> y8=6\n turn8: U -> y9=7\n turn9: U -> y10=8\n turn10: U -> y11=9\n turn11: S (or any) -> y12=9 (if S) or 8 if D, but we don't care as long as at turn11 we are at 9.\n\nBut at turn11, we are at y11=9, and then we do action a11 which produces y12, but the requirement is only for turn11.\n\nSo the sequence for turns0 to turn11: 12 actions.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? \n\nWe could use the option where we do U then D for the first two actions:\n\n turn0: U -> y1=1\n turn1: D -> y2=0\n turn2: U -> y3=1\n ... same as above, and then we do 9 U from turn2 to turn10, and then turn11: S.\n\nThis is also 12 actions.\n\nBut in this case, at turn1: we are at y1=1 (freeway1) at T1: safe.\n at turn2: we are at y2=0: safe.\n\nSo both are valid.\n\nCan we do it in 11 actions? \n\nFor H=11, we are to be at turn0+11-1 = turn10 at y=9.\n\nWe have 11 actions: a0 to a10.\n\nWe want y10=9.\n\nNet gain: 9 in 10 state changes.\n\nWe must have y2=0.\n\nNet from turn0 to turn2: 0.\n\nNet from turn2 to turn10: 8 state changes to net 9: impossible.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 12.\n\nSo the answer is 12 actions.\n\nNow, to write the sequence.\n\nWe can choose either:\n\nOption 1: \n    turn0: S\n    turn1: S\n    turn2: U\n    turn3: U\n    turn4: U\n    turn5: U\n    turn6: U\n    turn7: U\n    turn8: U\n    turn9: U\n    turn10: U\n    turn11: S\n\nOption 2:\n    turn0: U\n    turn1: D\n    turn2: U\n    turn3: U\n    turn4: U\n    turn5: U\n    turn6: U\n    turn7: U\n    turn8: U\n    turn9: U\n    turn10: U\n    turn11: S\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nBut in option 2, we are at freeway1 at turn1, which is safe, and then at turn2 we are at 0.\n\nWe can also do:\n\n    turn0: D  -> y1=0\n    turn1: S  -> y2=0\n    ... same as option 1.\n\nI think any is fine.\n\nLet's write one.\n\nI'll choose option 2 because it has an extra move but it is safe.\n\nBut both are 12 actions.\n\nNow, the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: D\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n}\n\nBut wait, at turn11 we do S, and then at turn12 we are at 9 or stay at 9? But we are at turn11: we are at y11=9 (because turn10: action U from y10=8 to y11=9). Then at turn11 we do S, and then y12=9, but we don't care about turn12.\n\nAnd at turn11, we are at y=9 -> safe.\n\nSo it meets the requirement.\n\nIn this sequence, we are at:\n    turn0: y0=0\n    turn1: y1=1 (after a0=U) -> freeway1 at T1: safe.\n    turn2: y2=0 (after a1=D) -> safe.\n    turn3: y3=1 (after a2=U) -> freeway1 at T3: safe.\n    turn4: y4=2 -> freeway2 at T4: safe.\n    turn5: y5=3 -> freeway3 at T5: safe.\n    turn6: y6=4 -> freeway4 at T6: safe.\n    turn7: y7=5 -> freeway5 at T7: safe.\n    turn8: y8=6 -> freeway6 at T8: safe.\n    turn9: y9=7 -> freeway7 at T9: safe.\n    turn10: y10=8 -> freeway8 at T10: safe.\n    turn11: y11=9 -> safe.\n\nAnd we are at (0,9) at turn11, which is t1+H-1 = 0+12-1=11.\n\nSo it's correct.\n\nIs there a shorter sequence? We saw that 11 actions is impossible.\n\nSo minimal H is 12.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the sequence above.\n\nBut note: in the sequence, the last action at turn11 is S, but we could do U or D? \n    If we do U at turn11: we are at y=10, but the grid only goes to 9, so it would be clamped to 9? \n    The problem says: y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if we do U at y=9, we stay at 9.\n\nSimilarly for D.\n\nSo we can do any action at the last step.\n\nI think S is fine.\n\nSo final answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) is 12. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by ensuring the player is not on any dangerous freeway during critical turns. Specifically:\n- At turn 2, freeways 1 to 6 are dangerous, so the player is at \\(y = 0\\) (safe).\n- At turns 6, 7, and 8, freeways 7 and 8 are dangerous, but the player is on lower freeways (safe) and reaches freeway 7 at turn 9 and freeway 8 at turn 10, which are safe.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- At turn 0, move up to \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1 at turn 1 is safe).\n- At turn 1, move down to \\(y = 0\\) (safe at turn 2).\n- From turns 2 to 10, move up consecutively to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n- At turn 11, stay to remain at \\(y = 9\\) (already at goal, so any action is valid; staying is chosen).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 11 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 0 + 12 - 1 = 11\\)) safely.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U \\\\\nTurn 1: D \\\\\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 1) on turn t_1 = 1. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The vertical axis goes from y=0 to y=9, and I need to get to y=9.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay within 0 to 9. Since I'm starting at y=1 and need to get to y=9, I need to move up, but I have to avoid cars on the freeways when I'm on them.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes over time based on the car's speed and direction.\n\nThe key point is that when I move from y_T to y_{T+1}, I am considered on y_T at turn T, and I won't be on y_{T+1} until turn T+1. So if I move up at turn T, from y_T to y_T+1, at turn T I'm on y_T, so I check for cars on y_T at turn T. Then at turn T+1, I'm on y_T+1, so I check cars on y_T+1 at turn T+1.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states for each freeway at turn t_1 = 1.\n\nFreeway 1: car with head h=-12, tail tau=-47, direction right, speed s=36. Since it's right-moving, the span at turn T is [tau + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-47 + 36(T-1), -12 + 36(T-1)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2 and 3, same as freeway 1: (-12, -47, right, 36)\n\nFreeway 4: (-24, -47, right, 24) so span at T: [-47 + 24(T-1), -24 + 24(T-1)]\n\nFreeway 5 and 6 same as 4.\n\nFreeway 7: has three cars: (52,41,right,4), (16,5,right,4), (-20,-31,right,4)\n\nSince all are right-moving, for each, span at T: for first car [41 + 4(T-1), 52 + 4(T-1)]? Head is 52, tail is 41, and direction right, so since it's moving right, the tail is the left end? Let's see the car update.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [tau, h] → Span(T) = [tau + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, head is the front, so when moving right, head is larger, tail is smaller, so span at t_1 is [tail, head] = [tau, h], and at T, [tau + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all cars are right-moving.\n\nFor freeway 7:\n\nFirst car: head=52, tail=41, right, s=4 → span at T: [41 + 4(T-1), 52 + 4(T-1)]\n\nSecond car: head=16, tail=5, right, s=4 → [5 + 4(T-1), 16 + 4(T-1)]\n\nThird car: head=-20, tail=-31, right, s=4 → [-31 + 4(T-1), -20 + 4(T-1)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same as freeway 7.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if I am on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThat is, for freeway k at turn T, if y_T = k and 0 ∈ [low, high] for some car on k, where [low, high] is the span at T.\n\nSince the player is at x=0 always, I think, as per position (0, y_t), so we care about whether x=0 is covered by a car span on the current y.\n\nNow, I start at turn t=1, position y=1.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H would be if I could go straight up, but I have to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's see for each freeway and each turn, when there is a car covering x=0.\n\nSince the cars move, the span changes, so for each freeway, I can find for which turns 0 is in the span.\n\nLet t = T - t_1 = T - 1, since t_1=1, so at turn T, elapsed time t = T - 1.\n\nFor freeway 1: car span at T: [ -47 + 36(T-1) , -12 + 36(T-1) ]\n\nSet 0 in [a,b] where a = -47 + 36t, b = -12 + 36t, t = T-1\n\n0 in [a,b] iff a <= 0 and b >= 0.\n\na <= 0: -47 + 36t <= 0 => 36t <= 47 => t <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305\n\nb >= 0: -12 + 36t >= 0 => 36t >= 12 => t >= 12/36 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333\n\nSo for t >= 1/3 and t <= 1.305, since t integer (turns), t=1 (since t=0,1,2,... t=0: T=1, t=1: T=2, etc.)\n\nt = T-1, so at T=1, t=0; T=2, t=1; etc.\n\nAt t=0 (T=1): a = -47 +0 = -47, b= -12 +0 = -12, both negative, so 0 not in [-47,-12], since -47 < -12 < 0, so 0 > b, not covered.\n\nt=1 (T=2): a = -47 +36 = -11, b= -12 +36 = 24\n\n-11 <= 0 <= 24? 0 is between -11 and 24, yes, so covered.\n\nt=2 (T=3): a = -47 +72 = 25, b= -12 +72 = 60, both positive, 0 < a, so not covered.\n\nt=1.305 is about, t=1 is covered, t=2 not.\n\nt=0: not covered, t=1: covered, t=2: not.\n\nBut t=0: T=1, t=1: T=2, etc.\n\nFor freeway 1, at turn T=1: not covered (since t=0)\n\nT=2: covered\n\nT=3: not covered\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 and 3 are identical to freeway 1, so same: at T=1 not covered, T=2 covered, T=3 not.\n\nNow freeway 4: car (-24,-47,right,24)\n\nSpan at T: [ -47 + 24(t) , -24 + 24(t) ] with t=T-1\n\n0 in [a,b] where a= -47+24t, b= -24+24t\n\na <=0: -47+24t <=0 => 24t <=47 => t <= 47/24 ≈ 1.958\n\nb >=0: -24+24t >=0 => 24t >=24 => t >=1\n\nSo t >=1 and t <=1.958, so for integer t, t=1 (T=2)\n\nt=0 (T=1): a=-47, b=-24, both negative, 0 not in range.\n\nt=1 (T=2): a= -47+24= -23, b= -24+24=0? b=0\n\nb = -24 + 24t, at t=1, b= -24+24=0\n\na= -47+24= -23\n\nSo span [ -23, 0 ], so 0 is included since b=0.\n\nSimilarly, t=2 (T=3): a= -47+48=1, b= -24+48=24, both positive, 0 not in [1,24]\n\nSo for freeway 4, at T=2, covered (0 in span)\n\nT=1 and T=3 not covered.\n\nFreeway 5 and 6 same as 4.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (head=52,tail=41,right,s=4) span at T: [41 + 4(t), 52 + 4(t)] t=T-1\n\n[41+4t, 52+4t]\n\n0 in [41+4t, 52+4t]? Since 41+4t >=41 >0 for t>=0, so always positive, 0 never in this span.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (16,5,right,4) span [5+4t, 16+4t]\n\n5+4t >=5>0, so always positive, 0 never in span.\n\nThird car: (-20,-31,right,4) span [-31 +4t, -20 +4t]\n\nSet 0 in [a,b] with a= -31+4t, b= -20+4t\n\na <=0: -31+4t <=0 => 4t <=31 => t <= 31/4 = 7.75\n\nb >=0: -20+4t >=0 => 4t >=20 => t >=5\n\nSo t >=5 and t <=7.75, so t=5,6,7\n\nt=5: T=6 (since t=T-1, T=t+1)\n\nt=5: T=6\n\nt=6: T=7\n\nt=7: T=8\n\nNow for freeway 8, same as freeway 7, since same cars.\n\nFreeway 8 has same cars as 7: (52,41,right,4), (16,5,right,4), (-20,-31,right,4), so identical to freeway 7.\n\nSo for freeway 7 and 8, at T=6,7,8, the third car covers 0.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt t=5 (T=6): a= -31+4*5= -31+20= -11, b= -20+20=0? b= -20+4t, t=5, b= -20+20=0, so span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nt=6 (T=7): a= -31+24= -7, b= -20+24=4, span [-7,4], 0 in it.\n\nt=7 (T=8): a= -31+28= -3, b= -20+28=8, span [-3,8], 0 in it.\n\nt=8 (T=9): a= -31+32=1, b= -20+32=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 7 and 8, covered at T=6,7,8.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway when 0 is covered (collision if on that freeway at that turn):\n\nFreeway 1: covered at T=2\n\nFreeway 2: same, T=2\n\nFreeway 3: same, T=2\n\nFreeway 4: covered at T=2\n\nFreeway 5: same, T=2\n\nFreeway 6: same, T=2\n\nFreeway 7: covered at T=6,7,8\n\nFreeway 8: covered at T=6,7,8\n\nFor freeways 1-6, only T=2 is critical, other times not covered.\n\nFreeways 7-8, covered at T=6,7,8.\n\nI start at T=1, y=1.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since I need to go from y=1 to y=9, that's 8 steps up, so at least 8 turns if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I might need to stay or something to avoid collisions.\n\nNow, at T=1, I am on y=1.\n\nFreeway 1 at T=1: not covered, as above.\n\nSo at T=1, I can be on y=1 safely.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions: at each turn, I choose U, D, or S, changing y.\n\nSince I need to go up, D is probably not useful, but I might use S to wait.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nI start at T=1, y=1.\n\nIf I go up at T=1, to y=2 at T=2.\n\nBut at T=2, if I am on y=2, freeway 2 is covered at T=2, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to any freeway 1-6 at T=2, collision, since all covered at T=2.\n\nFreeway 1 covered, 2 covered, ..., 6 covered at T=2.\n\nOnly freeways 1-6 are covered at T=2, freeways 7 and 8 not covered at T=2.\n\nAt T=2, freeway 7: for t=T-1=1, earlier for freeway 7, covered only at T=6,7,8, so at T=2, t=1, not covered.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8.\n\nBut I need to be on a freeway to have collision; if I'm not on freeway, no collision.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to 8, I think y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since no cars.\n\nThe goal is (0,9), and collision only on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nSo y=0 and y=9 are safe positions.\n\nNow, at T=1, I am on y=1, which is freeway 1, and at T=1, not covered, so safe.\n\nIf I take action at T=1: if I go U, I move to y=2 at T=2.\n\nAt T=2, y=2, freeway 2, which is covered at T=2, so collision.\n\nIf I go D, to y=0 at T=2, but y=0 is safe, no cars.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9, so going down might not help.\n\nIf I stay S, at T=1, I stay at y=1 for T=2? No.\n\nAction at turn T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, based on action at t.\n\nAt turn t, action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAnd at turn t, position is (0, y_t), and we check for collision on freeway y_t at turn t.\n\nSo at turn T, we are at y_T, and we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nStart: turn t=1, position y=1.\n\nAt turn t=1, we are on freeway 1, and since at T=1, freeway 1 not covered, safe.\n\nNow, we choose action a_1 for turn 1, which will set y_2.\n\nIf a_1 = U, then y_2 = y_1 +1 = 1+1=2.\n\nThen at turn t=2, we are at y=2, freeway 2.\n\nAt T=2, freeway 2 is covered (since all freeways 1-6 covered at T=2), so collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf a_1 = D, then y_2 = y_1 -1 = 1-1=0.\n\nThen at turn t=2, we are at y=0, which is not a freeway (freeways 1-8), so no collision, safe.\n\nBut now at y=0, and we need to go to y=9.\n\nIf a_1 = S, then y_2 = y_1 +0 =1, so at turn t=2, we are at y=1 again.\n\nAt T=2, freeway 1 is covered, so collision.\n\nFreeway 1 covered at T=2, yes.\n\nSo only safe action at t=1 is to go down to y=0, avoiding collision at T=2.\n\nThen at t=2, we are at y=0.\n\nNow, from y=0, we need to go up.\n\nBut at t=2, we are at y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nChoose action a_2 for turn 2.\n\nIf we go U, y_3 = 0 +1 =1, then at turn t=3, we are at y=1.\n\nNow, at T=3, what is the status?\n\nFor freeway 1 at T=3: earlier, for freeway 1, at T=3, t=T-1=2, not covered, since only covered at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, all freeways 1-6 not covered at T=3, only covered at T=2.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 covered at T=6,7,8.\n\nSo at T=3, all freeways are safe, since no coverage at T=3.\n\nSimilarly, T=4,5, etc., except T=2 and T=6,7,8 for some.\n\nSpecifically, freeways 1-6 only unsafe at T=2, freeways 7-8 unsafe at T=6,7,8.\n\nAt T=3, y=1 is safe.\n\nIf at t=2, we go U to y=1 at t=3.\n\nThen at t=3, we are at y=1, safe since T=3 not critical.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nThe critical points are to avoid being on freeways 1-6 at T=2, and on freeways 7-8 at T=6,7,8.\n\nSince we start at t=1, y=1, and T=2 is problematic for y=1-6, we avoided by going down to y=0 at t=2.\n\nNow from there, we can go up.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nAlso, the unsafe turns: T=2 for low freeways, and T=6,7,8 for high freeways.\n\nNow, time is turn number.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn, say at turn H.\n\nBut minimal H, so probably we want to go up as much as possible.\n\nSince from y=0 to y=9, 9 steps up, minimal 9 turns from start? Start at t=1, y=1, so to y=9, need to increase by 8, so at least 8 actions, so H=9 turns? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t=1, we are at y=1.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, we are at y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1? The sequence.\n\nThe player position after actions: start at turn t_1, position given.\n\nThen we take actions a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_1 + H -1}, so after H actions, we have H new positions.\n\nAfter k actions, we are at turn t_1 + k.\n\nAnd we need at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nSpecifically, after H-1 actions, we reach y=9 at turn t_1 + (H-1).\n\nt_1 + H -1 = T, with y_T=9.\n\nAnd we take actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, at turn t_1, we take action a_{t_1}, which sets y_{t_1 +1}, and so on, up to a_{t_1 + H -1} which sets y_{t_1 + H}, but we need y_{t_1 + H} =9? No.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nThe sequence: actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nAfter taking a_{t_1}, we go to y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nAfter taking a_{t_1 +1}, we go to y_{t_1 +2}, ..., after taking a_{t_1 + H -1}, we go to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nAnd we need y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H, we are at position y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd at each turn, from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, we are at y_t for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and we need no collision during these turns, including the start turn? At turn t_1, we are already at position, and we need no collision at each turn from t_1 to the turn before reaching, but since we reach at turn t_1 + H, we need no collision from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn when we are on a freeway.\n\nAt turn T, if we are on freeway y_T, we check for collision at that turn.\n\nWhen we reach y=9 at turn t_1 + H, if y=9 is not a freeway, no collision to check, I think.\n\nSimilarly, at start, turn t_1, we are at y_t1, which may be freeway.\n\nIn the path, from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H -1, we are at positions y_{t_1} to y_{t_1 + H -1}, and at each of these turns, if on freeway, we need no collision.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H, we are at y_{t_1 + H} =9, which is not a freeway, so no collision check needed.\n\nSo we need safe from t=t_1 to t=t_1 + H -1.\n\nt from t_1 to t_1 + H -1 inclusive.\n\nIn this case, t_1=1, so turns 1 to (1 + H -1) = H.\n\nTurns from 1 to H inclusive? Turn indices.\n\nLet K = H, the number of actions.\n\nAfter K actions, we are at turn t_1 + K, position y_{t_1 + K} =9.\n\nAnd for turns t from t_1 to t_1 + K -1, we are at y_t, and need no collision at those turns.\n\nAt turn t_1 + K, we are at y=9, no collision check.\n\nStart: turn 1, y=1.\n\nWe need to reach turn T with y_T=9 for some T.\n\nMinimal T, but with actions, we need minimal number of actions.\n\nSince we must increase y by 8, minimal actions is 8, if we go up each time, but may not be possible due to collisions.\n\nWith 8 actions, we go from y1=1 to y9=1+8=9, at turn 9.\n\nBut we need to check if we can do it without collision.\n\nFirst, the critical turns: T=2 is unsafe for y=1-6.\n\nT=6,7,8 unsafe for y=7-8.\n\nNow, if we start at t=1, y=1.\n\nIf we go up at each turn:\n\nAt t=1, action U: y2=2\n\nBut at turn t=2, y=2, which is freeway 2, and T=2, covered, collision. Not possible.\n\nIf we go down first: at t=1, action D: y2=0\n\nAt turn t=2, y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nThen at t=2, action U: y3=1\n\nAt turn t=3, y=1, freeway 1. Now T=3, not covered, safe.\n\nThen at t=3, action U: y4=2\n\nAt turn t=4, y=2, freeway 2. T=4, not covered (only T=2 critical), safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=4, action U: y5=3\n\nTurn t=5, y=3, safe.\n\nt=5, U: y6=4\n\nTurn t=6, y=4, freeway 4. T=6, for freeway 4, at T=6: t=T-1=5, for freeway 4, we had coverage only at T=2, so at T=6, not covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5,6 same.\n\nNow at t=6, action U: y7=5\n\nTurn t=7, y=5, freeway 5. T=7, not covered, safe.\n\nt=7, U: y8=6\n\nTurn t=8, y=6, freeway 6. T=8, not covered, safe.\n\nt=8, U: y9=7\n\nTurn t=9, y=7, freeway 7. Now T=9? T=9, for freeway 7, covered at T=6,7,8? T=9: t=T-1=8, for freeway 7, covered at t=5,6,7 (T=6,7,8), at t=8, T=9, not covered, as we saw span [1,12] for the car that matters.\n\nAt T=9, freeway 7: t=8, a= -31+4*8= -31+32=1, b= -20+32=12, [1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 same.\n\nBut we are at y=7 at turn t=9.\n\nThen at t=9, we need to go to y=8 or y=9.\n\ny9=7, so to reach y=9, we need two more actions.\n\nAt t=9, action U: y10=8\n\nThen at turn t=10, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nT=10, t=T-1=9, for freeway 8, similar to 7, at t=9, a= -31+36=5? s=4, t=9, a= -31+4*9= -31+36=5, b= -20+36=16, [5,16], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at t=10, action U: y11=9\n\nThen at turn t=11, we are at y=11? No, y_{11} =9, but turn is t=11, position y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nBut we reached at turn 11 with 10 actions? Let's count.\n\nStart: turn 1, y=1\n\nAction a1: D, go to y2=0 at turn 2\n\nAction a2: U, go to y3=1 at turn 3\n\nAction a3: U, go to y4=2 at turn 4\n\nAction a4: U, go to y5=3 at turn 5\n\nAction a5: U, go to y6=4 at turn 6\n\nAction a6: U, go to y7=5 at turn 7\n\nAction a7: U, go to y8=6 at turn 8\n\nAction a8: U, go to y9=7 at turn 9\n\nAction a9: U, go to y10=8 at turn 10\n\nAction a10: U, go to y11=9 at turn 11\n\nNow, at turn 11, y=9, reached.\n\nNumber of actions: 10, H=10 turns? The sequence has H actions, from t=1 to t=1+H-1.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t1 to t1+H-1, here t1=1, actions a1 to a10, so H=10.\n\nBut we started from y=1, went down to y=0, then up to y=7 at t=9, then to y=8 at t=10, y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut we can reach faster.\n\nSince after going down, we are at y=0 at t=2, then we can go up multiple times.\n\nBut we have to be careful around T=6,7,8 for y=7-8.\n\nIn the above, when we were at y=7 at t=9, which is after T=8, so safe.\n\nBut we can be at higher y earlier.\n\nFor example, from y=0 at t=2, instead of going up one by one, but we have to, since each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nUnless we stay, but staying doesn't help to go up.\n\nSo we need at least 8 up actions to go from y=1 to y=9, but we have one down action, so minimum 9 actions? From y=1 to y=9, difference 8, so 8 up actions needed, but we did one down, so net +7, from y=1 to y=8? In the sequence, we had one down and then multiple up.\n\nStart y1=1, after down to y2=0, then up to y3=1, which is back to start, then up to y4=2, etc., so effectively, we wasted one action to go down and up, so we are at y=1 at t=3, same as start but later.\n\nThen from there, to y=9, 8 up actions, so from t=3 to t=11, 8 actions, but we have actions from t=1 to t=10 for 10 actions.\n\nTotal turns: from t=1 to t=11, with positions at t=1 to t=11, but we reach at t=11.\n\nMinimal H: since we must have at least 8 up actions, and we start at y=1, so minimal actions is 8 if no detour.\n\nBut with detour, we have extra actions.\n\nIn this case, we used 10 actions.\n\nBut perhaps we can avoid the down by waiting or something.\n\nAnother idea: at t=1, instead of going down, we stay.\n\nBut if we stay at t=1, a1=S, then y2=1, at turn t=2, y=1, freeway 1, which is covered at T=2, collision. Not possible.\n\nSo must go down at t=1 to avoid collision at t=2.\n\nThen from y=0 at t=2, we can go up.\n\nBut to reach faster, we need to be at higher y when time is critical.\n\nThe critical times are T=2 for low freeways, and T=6,7,8 for high freeways.\n\nAt T=2, we must not be on y=1-6.\n\nWe are at t=1, y=1, so at T=1, safe, but T=2, if we are on y=1-6, collision.\n\nSo we need to be on y=0 or y=7-8 or y=9 at T=2.\n\nBut y=9 not possible from y=1 in one action.\n\ny=7-8: from y=1, we can only go to y=2 or y=0 or y=1, not to y=7 directly.\n\nSo only possibilities: go to y=0 or go to y=2 but collision, or stay y=1 collision.\n\nSo only go to y=0.\n\nSimilarly, at T=6,7,8, we must not be on y=7 or 8.\n\nNow, we need to plan the path to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at T=6,7,8.\n\nIn the previous path, we were at y=7 at t=9, which is after, and y=8 at t=10, after T=8.\n\nBut t=9 is after T=8.\n\nT=8 is turn 8.\n\nWe can be at y=9 before T=6 or after T=8.\n\nT=6,7,8 are turns 6,7,8.\n\nIf we can reach y=9 by turn 5, then we avoid the high freeway issue.\n\nBut from y=1, to y=9 in 4 actions? y1=1, after 4 actions, y5=1+4=5 if all up, but 1 to 5 is increase by 4, so y5=5.\n\nNot 9.\n\nTo go from y=1 to y=9 in 8 actions, we would be at turn 9 with y=9.\n\nBut at turn 9, y=9, safe.\n\nBut during the path, we have issues at T=2.\n\nWith the down action, we are at turn 11.\n\nBut turn 11 is late.\n\nSince we are at y=0 at t=2, we can go up faster? No, each action only one step.\n\nAnother idea: at t=1, go down to y=0.\n\nThen at t=2, we are at y=0, safe.\n\nNow, instead of going up immediately, we can stay at y=0 for some turns to let time pass, but since the critical times are fixed, staying might not help, and we want minimal turns.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=0 for multiple turns, we delay, which is worse.\n\nSo better to go up as soon as possible.\n\nBut from y=0, we need to go to y=1, but at which turn.\n\nAt t=2, y=0.\n\nIf we go U at t=2, to y3=1 at turn 3.\n\nAs before.\n\nIf we go S at t=2, stay y=0, then y3=0 at turn 3, then we can go U later.\n\nBut turn 3 is safe for y=1, as before.\n\nBut if we stay, we waste time.\n\nFor example, if at t=2, S, then y3=0 at turn 3.\n\nThen at t=3, U, y4=1 at turn 4.\n\nThen same as before but later.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo better to go up immediately from y=0.\n\nNow, about the high end: to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at T=6,7,8.\n\nT=6,7,8 turns.\n\nIf we can be at y=7 before T=6 or after T=8.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nIn the path, we were at y=7 at t=9, which is after T=8 (turn 8).\n\nt=9 >8.\n\nWe can be at y=7 at turn 5, for example.\n\nTurn 5: T=5.\n\nAt T=5, for freeway 7, covered? Freeway 7 covered at T=6,7,8, so T=5 not covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=4, etc.\n\nSo if we can reach y=7 at turn 5, then we can go to y=8 and y=9 quickly.\n\nBut from start, how to reach high y fast.\n\nStart at t=1, y=1.\n\nAfter down to y=0 at t=2.\n\nThen from t=2, y=0, we need to go to y=7.\n\nBut from y=0 to y=7, need 7 up actions, so at least 7 actions from t=2.\n\nAfter k actions from t=2, we are at turn 2+k, position y=0 + k if all up.\n\nTo be at y=7 at turn T.\n\nIf T=5, y=7.\n\nBut from t=2, to turn 5, that is 3 turns later: turn 3,4,5.\n\nAfter 3 actions, y from 0 to 3 if all up.\n\ny=3 at turn 5.\n\nNot 7.\n\nImpossible to be at y=7 at turn 5 from y=0 at t=2 in 3 actions.\n\nMax y at turn 5: from t=2 y=0, after a2, a3, a4, to turn 5 y? Actions at t=2,3,4 set y3,y4,y5.\n\ny3 = y2 + delta a2, y2=0, so y3 = 0 + delta a2\n\ny4 = y3 + delta a3\n\ny5 = y4 + delta a4\n\nIf all U, y3=1, y4=2, y5=3.\n\nSo at turn 5, y=3.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 6, y=4 if another U, etc.\n\nTo be at y=7 at turn 5 is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, earliest to be at y=7: from y=0 at t=2, after 7 up actions, at turn 9, y=7.\n\nIn my first sequence, at turn 9, y=7, which is after T=8.\n\nThen from there, to y=8 at t=10, y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut at t=10, y=8, turn 10, which is after T=8, so freeway 8 safe.\n\nNow, we can be at y=9 at turn 10 if we go faster earlier, but we can't because of the down.\n\nAnother way: perhaps we don't need to go all the way down; maybe we can go to a freeway that is safe at T=2.\n\nBut at T=2, only freeways 7 and 8 are safe, but we can't reach them from y=1 in one action.\n\ny=1 to y=2, or y=0, or y=1.\n\nNo way to y=7 or 8.\n\nSo must go to y=0 at T=2.\n\nThen from there, we can only go up step by step.\n\nBut to avoid the high freeway issue at T=6,7,8, we need to not be on y=7 or 8 at those turns.\n\nIn the sequence, when do we reach y=7 and y=8.\n\nIn the slow path: at turn 6, y=4 (if we start from t=3 y=1)\n\nLet's list the turn and y position in the first sequence:\n\nTurn 1: y=1\n\nAction a1=D: y2=0\n\nTurn 2: y=0\n\nAction a2=U: y3=1\n\nTurn 3: y=1\n\nAction a3=U: y4=2\n\nTurn 4: y=2\n\nAction a4=U: y5=3\n\nTurn 5: y=3\n\nAction a5=U: y6=4\n\nTurn 6: y=4\n\nAction a6=U: y7=5\n\nTurn 7: y=5\n\nAction a7=U: y8=6\n\nTurn 8: y=6\n\nAction a8=U: y9=7\n\nTurn 9: y=7\n\nAction a9=U: y10=8\n\nTurn 10: y=8\n\nAction a10=U: y11=9\n\nTurn 11: y=9\n\nAt turn 6, y=4; turn 7, y=5; turn 8, y=6; all below 7, so not on y=7 or 8 during T=6,7,8.\n\nThen at turn 9, y=7, T=9>8, safe.\n\nTurn 10, y=8, T=10>8, safe.\n\nTurn 11, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, total actions: 10, from a1 to a10.\n\nBut H is the number of actions, so H=10.\n\nBut we can reduce by not going down and up, but we have to.\n\nPerhaps at some point we can stay to skip the critical time.\n\nFor example, at the high end.\n\nSuppose we go up faster to be at y=6 at some point, then stay or something.\n\nBut from start, we have to go down first.\n\nAnother idea: since at T=2, we must be on y=0, but after that, we can go up.\n\nNow, for the high freeways, unsafe at T=6,7,8.\n\nSo at turn 6,7,8, we should not be on y=7 or 8.\n\nWe can be on y=6 or y=9 or lower.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 6, if we are on y=6, freeway 6, which is not covered at T=6, only at T=2, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5, etc.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 6, y=4; turn 7, y=5; turn 8, y=6; all not y=7 or 8, so fine.\n\nThen we go to y=7 at turn 9, after.\n\nBut we reached y=9 at turn 11.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be at higher y at earlier turns.\n\nBut from y=0 at t=2, after 4 actions: at turn 6, y=4 if all up from t=2.\n\ny2=0, a2=U, y3=1; a3=U, y4=2; a4=U, y5=3; a5=U, y6=4; so turn 6 y=4.\n\nThen a6=U, y7=5 turn7; a7=U, y8=6 turn8; a8=U, y9=7 turn9; a9=U, y10=8 turn10; a10=U, y11=9 turn11.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf we start going up immediately from t=2, but we have to go through y=1,2,etc.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 at turn 9 if no detour, but with detour, we have delay.\n\nBut we must have the detour to avoid T=2.\n\nUnless we can be on a safe freeway at T=2, but only y=7 or 8, not reachable.\n\nSo I think 10 actions is necessary in this case.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision points.\n\nAt turn 2, if on y=1-6, collision, which we avoided by being on y=0.\n\nAt turn 6,7,8, if on y=7 or 8, collision.\n\nIn the path, at turn 6, we are on y=4, not 7 or 8.\n\nTurn 7 y=5, turn 8 y=6, not 7 or 8.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nAnd we reach at turn 11.\n\nBut minimal H: since we need 8 net up actions, but we have one down and one up to same position, so effectively 9 actions for net +8, but with positions from turn 1 to turn 10 for actions, reaching at turn 11.\n\nNumber of actions H, after H actions, at turn t1 + H =1+H, y=9.\n\nAnd for turns 1 to 1+H-1, safe positions.\n\nIn this case, with H=10, turn from 1 to 10 for positions? Turns with positions: turns 1 to 11, but turn 11 is the reached position, no collision check.\n\nCollision checks at turns 1 to 10.\n\nIn the sequence, turns 1 to 10 have positions y=1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n\nAt turn 1: y=1, safe as per.\n\nTurn 2: y=0, safe.\n\nTurn 3: y=1, freeway 1, T=3, not covered, safe.\n\nTurn 4: y=2, freeway 2, T=4, not covered, safe.\n\nTurn 5: y=3, freeway 3, T=5, not covered, safe.\n\nTurn 6: y=4, freeway 4, T=6, not covered (only T=2), safe.\n\nTurn 7: y=5, freeway 5, T=7, not covered, safe.\n\nTurn 8: y=6, freeway 6, T=8, not covered, safe.\n\nTurn 9: y=7, freeway 7, T=9, not covered (covered only T=6,7,8), safe.\n\nTurn 10: y=8, freeway 8, T=10, not covered, safe.\n\nThen turn 11: y=9, no check.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nNow, is there a way with fewer actions?\n\nSuppose we go up faster after y=0.\n\nBut we can't, since each action only one step.\n\nPerhaps at some point we stay to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at critical times, but in this case, we are not on them during T=6,7,8.\n\nFor example, at turn 8, we are at y=6, which is fine.\n\nIf we were at y=7 earlier, but we can't.\n\nSuppose we start at t=1, go down to y=0.\n\nThen at t=2, go up to y=1 at t=3.\n\nBut instead of going up each turn, we could go up multiple times, but no, only one per action.\n\nAnother idea: since freeways 1-3 are identical, but not helpful.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 before T=6.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at turn T.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=1, to y=9, need 8 up actions.\n\nAfter 8 actions, at turn 1+8=9, y=9.\n\nBut during the path, at t=2, we need to not be on y=1-6, but if we go all up, at t=2 y=2, collision.\n\nSo we must have a down or something, but down only to y=0 at t=2.\n\nThen from there, to y=9 at turn 9, we need to go from y=0 to y=9 in 7 actions? Actions from t=2 to t=8 for 7 actions? Let's see.\n\nStart t=1 y=1.\n\na1=D: y2=0 at t=2.\n\nThen from t=2, we need actions to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nIf we take actions a2 to a9, for example.\n\na2: at t=2, action, set y3.\n\nAfter k actions from t=2, at turn 2+k, y position.\n\nTo have y=9 at turn T.\n\nEarliest T=9, with y9=9.\n\nBut from y2=0, to y9=9, need 9 up actions? y2=0 at turn 2.\n\nAfter first action a2 at t=2, set y3.\n\nIf a2=U, y3=1 at turn 3.\n\n...\n\nAfter 7 actions from t=2: actions at t=2 to t=8, set y3 to y9.\n\nIf all U, y3=1, y4=2, ..., y9=7? y3=1 (after first action), y4=2, y5=3, y6=4, y7=5, y8=6, y9=7.\n\ny9=7 at turn 9.\n\nThen need two more actions to y10=8, y11=9.\n\nTo have y9=9, we need y9=9, so from y2=0, we need to increase by 9 in 7 actions, impossible since max +7.\n\ny at turn T is set by actions before.\n\nAt turn 2, y=0.\n\nAfter action a2 at t=2, y3 = y2 + delta a2\n\nAfter a3 at t=3, y4 = y3 + delta a3\n\n...\n\nAfter a8 at t=8, y9 = y8 + delta a8\n\nTo have y9=9, since y8 <=8, etc., but y2=0, so y3 <=1, y4 <=2, ..., y9 <=7 if all U, so y9=7 max at turn 9.\n\nThen y10=8, y11=9.\n\nCannot reach y=9 before turn 11 with this start.\n\nIf we had no down, but we must.\n\nPerhaps at t=1, we go down, then from there go up, but same.\n\nSo I think minimal is 10 actions to reach at turn 11.\n\nBut let's confirm the action sequence.\n\nt1=1, start y=1\n\nAction a1: D, so y2=0\n\nTurn t=2, y=0\n\nAction a2: U, y3=1\n\nTurn t=3, y=1\n\nAction a3: U, y4=2\n\nTurn t=4, y=2\n\nAction a4: U, y5=3\n\nTurn t=5, y=3\n\nAction a5: U, y6=4\n\nTurn t=6, y=4\n\nAction a6: U, y7=5\n\nTurn t=7, y=5\n\nAction a7: U, y8=6\n\nTurn t=8, y=6\n\nAction a8: U, y9=7\n\nTurn t=9, y=7\n\nAction a9: U, y10=8\n\nTurn t=10, y=8\n\nAction a10: U, y11=9\n\nTurn t=11, y=9 reached.\n\nNow, H=10 actions.\n\nThe sequence of actions: a1 to a10, which are for turns t=1 to t=10.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = D (since t_1=1)\n\nThen Turn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1} = U (t=2)\n\nTurn t_1 +2: a_{t_1 +2} = U (t=3)\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 +9: a_{t_1 +9} = U (t=10)\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nH=10, so t from 0 to 9.\n\nt=0: turn t_1 +0 =1, a1=D\n\nt=1: turn 2, a2=U\n\nt=2: turn 3, a3=U\n\nt=3: turn 4, a4=U\n\nt=4: turn 5, a5=U\n\nt=5: turn 6, a6=U\n\nt=6: turn 7, a7=U\n\nt=7: turn 8, a8=U\n\nt=8: turn 9, a9=U\n\nt=9: turn 10, a10=U\n\nThen at turn 11, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, all actions except first are U.\n\nBut in the output, we need to list the actions for each turn.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but we only cared about the one that covers 0.\n\nIn freeway 7, cars: (52,41,right,4) never covers 0, (16,5,right,4) never, only (-20,-31,right,4) covers at T=6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly for 8.\n\nAnd we avoided.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter path by using stay, but I don't think so.\n\nFor example, suppose at some point we stay to be at different position.\n\nBut since we need to go up, staying delays.\n\nSo I think 10 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach by turn 10 with y=9.\n\nTo reach at turn 10: y10=9.\n\nThen at turn 10, position, but collision check up to turn 9? Turns 1 to 9 for positions.\n\ny10=9, no check.\n\nSo need safe from turn 1 to 9.\n\ny at turn 9 must be 9 or less, but to have y10=9, at turn 9, y9 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y9=9, then no action needed? But we need to take action to reach.\n\ny10 = y9 + delta a9, so if y9=8, a9=U, y10=9.\n\nOr if y9=9, a9=S, y10=9, but same.\n\nBut to have y10=9, we need y9 <=9.\n\nNow, from start, to have y9=9.\n\nStart y1=1.\n\nAfter actions a1 to a8, set y2 to y9.\n\ny9 = y1 + sum of delta from a1 to a8.\n\ny1=1, y9=9, so sum delta = +8.\n\nEach delta +1,0,-1.\n\nTo have +8 in 8 actions, must be all U, no S or D.\n\nBut if all U from t=1: a1=U, y2=2; but at turn 2, y=2, collision, not possible.\n\nIf we have some other, but to have net +8, we need all U, but impossible because of collision at turn 2.\n\nSo cannot reach y9=9 with all U.\n\nWith down, but if we have down, net sum less, so y9<9 if not all U.\n\nFor example, if a1=D, then y2=0, then a2 to a8 all U: y3=1, y4=2, ..., y9=7? y3=1 after a2, y4=2 after a3, ..., y9=7 after a8.\n\ny9=7, then to y10=8 or 9, not 9 directly.\n\nSo cannot have y9=9 or y10=9 at turn 10.\n\nEarliest reach at turn 11 with y11=9.\n\nThus H=10 actions.\n\nNow, for the sequence, in the first part, I have a1=D, then all U.\n\nIn the actions, at t=1, D; t=2 to t=10, all U? t=2 to t=10 is 9 actions, but we need 10 actions? H=10 actions from t=1 to t=10.\n\na1 to a10.\n\na1 at t=1: D\n\na2 at t=2: U\n\na3 at t=3: U\n\n...\n\na10 at t=10: U\n\nYes.\n\nIn the output format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  so Turn 1: D\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1} Turn 2: U\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1 + 9: a_{t_1 +9} Turn 10: U\n\nAnd that should be it.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, we have three cars, but only one matters, and we handled.\n\nNow, to be thorough, at turn 9, y=7, freeway 7, T=9, not covered, as computed.\n\nSimilarly turn 10, y=8, T=10, not covered.\n\nSo all good.\n\nI think this is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 1: D\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nWith H=10.\n\nBut in the sequence, after a10 at turn 10, we go to y11=9 at turn 11.\n\nThe actions are for turns t=1 to t=10.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed as:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 1: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut H=10, and we reached at turn 11.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H=10 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter sequence by combining, but I don't see how.\n\nAnother thought: at the beginning, instead of going down, but we must to avoid collision.\n\nPerhaps for the high freeways, we can pass through during safe times.\n\nBut in this case, we did.\n\nSo I think this is the way.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collisions occur only if the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) at turn \\(T\\) and the position \\(x = 0\\) is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Coverages:\n- **Freeways 1 to 6**: Covered (collision risk) only at turn \\(T = 2\\). Safe at all other turns.\n- **Freeways 7 and 8**: Covered (collision risk) at turns \\(T = 6, 7, 8\\). Safe at all other turns.\n\n### Strategy:\n- At turn \\(T = 1\\), the player is at \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1), which is safe since freeway 1 is not covered at \\(T = 1\\).\n- To avoid collision at \\(T = 2\\) (where freeways 1–6 are covered), the player must not be on \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\) at \\(T = 2\\). The only safe action at \\(T = 1\\) is to move down to \\(y = 0\\) (not a freeway, so no collision).\n- From \\(y = 0\\) at \\(T = 2\\), move up consistently to reach \\(y = 9\\). The path avoids \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) during turns \\(T = 6, 7, 8\\) (covered turns for freeways 7 and 8) by being at lower \\(y\\) values:\n  - At \\(T = 6\\), \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4, safe as not covered at \\(T = 6\\)).\n  - At \\(T = 7\\), \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5, safe).\n  - At \\(T = 8\\), \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, safe).\n- Reach \\(y = 7\\) at \\(T = 9\\) and \\(y = 8\\) at \\(T = 10\\), both safe since \\(T = 9\\) and \\(T = 10\\) are after the critical period for freeways 7 and 8.\n- Reach \\(y = 9\\) at \\(T = 11\\) (not a freeway, so no collision).\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 1 (\\(t_1\\))**: Action \\(D\\) (down) to move to \\(y = 0\\) at turn 2, avoiding collision on freeway 1 at \\(T = 2\\).\n- **Turns 2 to 10**: Actions \\(U\\) (up) each turn to increment \\(y\\) by 1, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n  - Turn 2: \\(U\\) → \\(y = 1\\) at turn 3.\n  - Turn 3: \\(U\\) → \\(y = 2\\) at turn 4.\n  - Turn 4: \\(U\\) → \\(y = 3\\) at turn 5.\n  - Turn 5: \\(U\\) → \\(y = 4\\) at turn 6.\n  - Turn 6: \\(U\\) → \\(y = 5\\) at turn 7.\n  - Turn 7: \\(U\\) → \\(y = 6\\) at turn 8.\n  - Turn 8: \\(U\\) → \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9.\n  - Turn 9: \\(U\\) → \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10.\n  - Turn 10: \\(U\\) → \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n\n### Minimal Turns \\(H\\):\n- The sequence uses \\(H = 10\\) actions (from turn 1 to turn 10) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11. This is minimal because:\n  - A direct upward path from \\(y = 1\\) at turn 1 is impossible due to collision at \\(T = 2\\) on freeways 1–6.\n  - Any downward or staying action other than the initial \\(D\\) would increase \\(H\\).\n  - The net upward movement requires at least 8 up actions, but the detour to \\(y = 0\\) adds one extra action, resulting in \\(H = 10\\).\n\n### Verification:\n- Collisions are avoided at all turns:\n  - \\(T = 1\\): \\(y = 1\\), freeway 1 not covered.\n  - \\(T = 2\\): \\(y = 0\\), not a freeway.\n  - \\(T = 3\\): \\(y = 1\\), freeway 1 not covered (only at \\(T = 2\\)).\n  - \\(T = 4\\): \\(y = 2\\), freeway 2 not covered.\n  - \\(T = 5\\): \\(y = 3\\), freeway 3 not covered.\n  - \\(T = 6\\): \\(y = 4\\), freeway 4 not covered.\n  - \\(T = 7\\): \\(y = 5\\), freeway 5 not covered.\n  - \\(T = 8\\): \\(y = 6\\), freeway 6 not covered.\n  - \\(T = 9\\): \\(y = 7\\), freeway 7 not covered (covered only at \\(T = 6, 7, 8\\)).\n  - \\(T = 10\\): \\(y = 8\\), freeway 8 not covered.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 1: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,0) at turn t1=2 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: U for up (y+1), D for down (y-1), S for stay (y no change). y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I have its head, tail, direction, and speed at turn t1=2. I need to find where they are at future turns to avoid when the player is on that y-level.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that turn. Also, if the player moves to a new y at turn T, they are not on that new y until the next turn, so they only check collision for the y they are currently on.\n\nThe player position updates at each turn based on the action. For collision, at turn T, we look at y_T, and if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T at that exact turn.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars at t1=2.\n\nFor freeways 1,2,3: each has one car: (head=24, tail=-11, direction=right, speed=36). Since direction is right, the span is [tail, head] = [-11, 24], and it moves right, so at time T, span is [ -11 + 36*(T-2), 24 + 36*(T-2) ] because from turn 2 to T, it moves right.\n\nGeneral update: for a car, at turn t1, span is given. Then at turn T, the new span depends on direction.\n\nFor left-moving: span at T is [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] but in the rule, for left-moving, it says span(t1) = [h, τ] -> span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the car update, it says:\n\nFor left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] -> span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the notation, h is head, τ is tail, I think. For left-moving, if it's moving left, head should be on the left or right? I need to be careful with the span definition.\n\nLook at the example:\n\nFor left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] and it moves left, so at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] -> [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the problem:\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\n\"Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nSo for right-moving, at t1, the span is [τ, h] with τ ≤ h, I assume, since it's from tail to head.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h ≥ τ or something? In left-moving, [h, τ] and h - sΔT, τ - sΔT, so if moving left, both decrease.\n\nBut in terms of position, the span is a range, and we care if 0 is in that range.\n\nFor collision: at turn T, for freeway y_T, if there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in Span(T) for that car.\n\nNow, in this case, all cars are given at t1=2.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1: one car, (24, -11, right, 36)\n\nDirection is right, so at t1, span is [τ, h] = [-11, 24] because it says [τ, h] for right-moving.\n\nFrom above: \"Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" so here τ=-11, h=24, so span at t1 is [-11, 24].\n\nThen at turn T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-11 + 36(T-2), 24 + 36(T-2)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2 and 3, same thing: each has one car with same parameters, so for y=1,2,3, the car span at T is [-11 + 36(T-2), 24 + 36(T-2)]\n\nNow freeway 4: (0, -23, right, 24)\n\nRight-moving, so span at t1: [τ, h] = [-23, 0]\n\nAt T: [-23 + 24(T-2), 0 + 24(T-2)] = [-23 + 24(T-2), 24(T-2)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 5 and 6, same: so for y=4,5,6, car span at T is [-23 + 24(T-2), 24(T-2)]\n\nNow freeway 7: has three cars: (56,45,right,4), (20,9,right,4), (-16,-27,right,4)\n\nAll right-moving, so for each, span at t1 is [τ, h]\n\nFirst car: (56,45,right,4) → τ=45? Head and tail: it says (head h, tail τ, ...)\n\nIn the table: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor first car on y=7: (56,45,right,4) so h=56, τ=45? But for right-moving, span should be [τ, h], so if τ=45, h=56, then [45,56] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (20,9,right,4) → [9,20] at t1.\n\nThird car: (-16,-27,right,4) → τ=-27, h=-16, so span [-27,-16] at t1.\n\nAll moving right.\n\nAt turn T, each car's span moves right with speed 4.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same cars: (56,45,right,4), (20,9,right,4), (-16,-27,right,4), so identical to y=7.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn t1=2, position (0,0). y=0.\n\nWe need to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\nPlayer actions: U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, 0, clamped to [0,9].\n\nSince we start at y=0 and need to go to y=9, and y can't go below 0 or above 9, we probably want to go up most of the time, but we have to avoid collisions on y=1 to 8.\n\nAlso, since we need min turns, we should go up as fast as possible, but only if safe.\n\nNow, collision: at each turn T, when player is at position (0, y_T), we need that for freeway y_T, 0 is not in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNote that if player moves to a new y, say at turn T, they are at y_T, then after action, they move to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, they are only on y_T for collision check.\n\nThe collision is checked at the beginning of the turn or something? But from the description: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\".\n\nAnd y_T is the player's y-position at turn T.\n\nAlso, when player changes y, at turn T, they are on y_T, so for that turn, only cars on y_T matter.\n\nNow, since we start at turn 2, y=0.\n\ny=0 has no freeway, I think? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0, no cars, so always safe. Similarly, y=9 has no freeway? The freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe problem says: \"freeways y=1,…,8\" and \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,…,8\", so only when on y=1 to 8, we need to worry about collision.\n\nAt y=0 and y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,0) at turn 2, which is safe.\n\nWe need to reach (0,9), so y=9, safe.\n\nBut to get there, we need to pass through y=1 to 8, and at each turn, when on a freeway, avoid the cars.\n\nNow, min turns to go from y=0 to y=9. Since we can only change y by at most 1 per turn, min H is 9 turns: from turn 2 to turn 10, y from 0 to 9 in 8 steps? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nStart at turn 2, y=0.\n\nAfter one action, turn 3, y could be 0 or 1.\n\nAfter two actions, turn 4, y could be 0,1,2, etc.\n\nTo go from y=0 to y=9, we need at least 9 steps in y, but since we start at y=0, after k actions, y can be up to k, min k=9 to reach y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{t1 + H} or something.\n\nDefine the turns.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=2, player position is for turn t1, so at turn 2, y=0.\n\nThen we apply actions for t=0 to H-1, meaning actions at turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo action at time τ = t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter action at τ, position at τ+1.\n\nStart: at turn τ = t1, position y_{t1} = 0.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy, etc.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nAnd we want min H such that there is a sequence of actions that gets to y=9 at turn t1+H without collision during the path.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn from t1 to t1+H-1, I think, but at turn t1+H, if y=9, no collision since no freeway.\n\nAt each turn T from t1 to t1+H-1, when we are at y_T, if y_T between 1 and 8, we need no collision with cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nAt turn t1+H, we are at y=9, safe, so no need to check.\n\nNow, min H: since we start at y=0, to reach y=9, we need at least 9 actions, so min H=9 if possible, but we might need to wait or go down sometimes to avoid cars.\n\nBut let's see if H=9 is possible.\n\nWith H=9, we go from y=0 to y=9 in 9 turns, meaning we must go up every turn, all U actions, so y_t = t - t1 for t from t1 to t1+9.\n\nt1=2, so at turn 2: y=0\n\nturn 3: y=1\n\nturn 4: y=2\n\n...\n\nturn 10: y=8\n\nturn 11: y=9? Let's list:\n\nTurn T | y_T for all U\n\nT=2: y=0\n\nAfter a_2 (action at T=2), y_3 = y_2 + Δy = 0 +1 =1 if U\n\nSimilarly, action at T=3, y_4 = y_3 + Δy, etc.\n\nAfter action at T, position at T+1.\n\nSo:\n\nAt turn T: position y_T\n\nAction a_T applied, then position at T+1 is y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T\n\nFor min H, we want to reach y=9 at turn t1 + H.\n\nStart: turn t1=2, y_2=0\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, y_{t1+H} =9\n\nThe turns we need to check for collision are from T=2 to T= t1 + H -1, because at those turns, we are at y_T which might be between 1 and 8.\n\nAt T= t1 + H, we are at y=9, safe.\n\nSo for H=9, we want to be at y=9 at turn 2 + 9 =11.\n\nAnd collision checks at turns T=2 to T=10.\n\nT=2: y=0, safe.\n\nT=3: y=1, need to check freeway 1 at turn 3.\n\nT=4: y=2, freeway 2\n\n...\n\nT=10: y=8, freeway 8\n\nT=11: y=9, safe, no check.\n\nNow, for all U, y_T = T - 2 for T from 3 to 10? Let's list y_T:\n\nT=2: y=0\n\nT=3: y=1 (after first action)\n\nT=4: y=2\n\n...\n\nT=10: y=8\n\nT=11: y=9\n\nSo collision at T=3 (y=1), T=4 (y=2), ..., T=10 (y=8)\n\nNow, for each, check if 0 is in car span on that freeway at that turn.\n\nFirst, freeway y=1 at turn T.\n\nFor y=1, cars: one car with span at T: [-11 + 36(T-2), 24 + 36(T-2)] for T>=2.\n\nSimilarly for y=2 and y=3, same since all have same cars.\n\nNow, at turn T, for freeway k, we need 0 not in the span for any car on that freeway.\n\nFor y=1,2,3: one car, span [ -11 + 36(T-2), 24 + 36(T-2) ]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 36(T-2) <= 0 <= 24 + 36(T-2)\n\nSince the car is moving right, the span is increasing.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut let's compute for each T from 3 to 10.\n\nFirst, for T=3: y=1\n\nSpan on y=1 at T=3: [ -11 + 36(3-2), 24 + 36(3-2) ] = [ -11 + 36, 24 + 36] = [25, 60]\n\n0 in [25,60]? 0 < 25, so no, 0 not in span. Safe.\n\nSimilarly, for y=2 at T=4: same car, span [ -11 + 36(4-2), 24 + 36(4-2) ] = [ -11 + 72, 24 + 72] = [61, 96], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=5, y=3: span [ -11 + 36(3) , 24 + 36(3) ] T-2=3, [ -11+108, 24+108] = [97,132], 0 not in, safe.\n\nNow y=4 at T=6: freeway y=4 has car with (0, -23, right, 24) at t1=2.\n\nSpan at t1: for right-moving, [τ, h] = [-23, 0]\n\nAt T, [ -23 + 24(T-2), 0 + 24(T-2) ]\n\nT=6, T-2=4, span [ -23 + 24*4, 24*4 ] = [ -23 + 96, 96] = [73, 96]\n\n0 in [73,96]? No, 0<73, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=5 at T=7: T-2=5, span [ -23 + 24*5, 24*5] = [ -23 + 120, 120] = [97,120], 0 not in, safe.\n\ny=6 at T=8: T-2=6, span [ -23 + 24*6, 24*6] = [ -23 + 144, 144] = [121,144], safe.\n\nNow y=7 at T=9: freeway y=7 has three cars.\n\nAt turn T, we need to check all cars on that freeway.\n\nCars at t1=2:\n\nFirst car: (56,45,right,4) → span at t1: [τ, h] = [45,56]\n\nAt T, [45 + 4(T-2), 56 + 4(T-2)]\n\nSecond car: (20,9,right,4) → [9,20] at t1, at T: [9 + 4(T-2), 20 + 4(T-2)]\n\nThird car: (-16,-27,right,4) → τ=-27, h=-16, span [-27,-16] at t1, at T: [-27 + 4(T-2), -16 + 4(T-2)]\n\nFor T=9, T-2=7\n\nFirst car: [45 + 4*7, 56 + 4*7] = [45+28, 56+28] = [73,84]\n\nSecond car: [9 + 28, 20 + 28] = [37,48]\n\nThird car: [-27 + 28, -16 + 28] = [1,12]\n\nNow, 0 in any? First: [73,84], no. Second: [37,48], no. Third: [1,12], 1 to 12, 0 not in [1,12], since 0<1. So no, 0 not in span for any car. Safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at T=10: same as y=7, cars identical.\n\nT=10, T-2=8\n\nFirst car: [45 + 4*8, 56 + 4*8] = [45+32, 56+32] = [77,88]\n\nSecond car: [9 + 32, 20 + 32] = [41,52]\n\nThird car: [-27 + 32, -16 + 32] = [5,16]\n\n0 in any? [77,88] no, [41,52] no, [5,16] 5 to 16, 0<5, not in. Safe.\n\nSo for all U actions, from turn 3 to 10, all safe? T=3 to T=10, all y from 1 to 8, and at each, 0 not in car spans.\n\nAt T=9 y=7, third car span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly at T=10 y=8, [5,16], 0 not in.\n\nSo with all U, we reach y=9 at turn 11, with H=9 actions: actions at t=2 to t=10, positions at t=3 to t=11.\n\nActions: at turn 2: U, to y=1 at t=3\n\nTurn 3: U, to y=2 at t=4\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 10: U, to y=9 at t=11.\n\nAnd no collisions.\n\nBut is that right? At turn 9, y=7, car span [1,12], 0 not in, yes.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut let's confirm the starting point.\n\nPlayer at turn 2: position (0,0), no action yet? We need to apply actions starting from turn 2.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=0 to H-1 for the index, but relative to t1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, action at time t1 + t.\n\nSo for H=9, actions at times: t1+0 to t1+8, i.e., turn 2 to 10.\n\nAfter action at turn 10, position at turn 11 is y=9.\n\nCollision checked at turns when position is set, i.e., at turn T for T from 2 to 10.\n\nAt turn 2: y=0, safe.\n\nTurn 3: y=1, safe as above.\n\n...\nTurn 10: y=8, safe as above.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut the car on y=7 at turn 9 has span including [1,12], but 0 is not in it, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at turn 10, [5,16], no 0.\n\nSo min H=9 is possible with all U actions.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which is at turn 11.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nBut let's see if we can do it faster? H=9 is the minimum possible since we need to increase y by 9, each action can increase by at most 1, so yes, min H=9.\n\nBut we start at y=0, after 9 actions, y=9, so H=9 is min.\n\nAnd with all U, it seems safe.\n\nBut is there a problem at y=7 or something?\n\nAt turn 9, y=7, cars: third car span [1,12], which is from x=1 to 12, so at x=0, not covered, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut let's double-check the car spans.\n\nFor example, on y=4,5,6, at earlier turns, but we saw they were fine.\n\nPerhaps I should list the critical points.\n\nAnother thing: for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but in this case, at the turns we are there, 0 is not occupied.\n\nBut at turn 9, T=9, t1=2, ΔT=7, for third car: at t1, span [-27,-16], after 7 steps, move right by 4*7=28, so [-27+28, -16+28] = [1,12], yes.\n\n0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 10, [5,16], no.\n\nBut what if we were at y=7 earlier? But in this path, we are at y=7 only at turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, for the other freeways, no issue.\n\nBut let's confirm freeway 4 at T=6.\n\ny=4 at T=6, car span: [ -23 + 24*(6-2) , 24*(6-2) ] = [ -23 + 24*4, 96] = [ -23+96,96] = [73,96], 0 not in.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo with all U actions, we can reach in 9 turns.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nActions: from turn 2 to turn 10, all U.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, action at t1+t.\n\nH=9, so actions at t1+0 to t1+8, i.e., turn 2 to 10.\n\nEach action U.\n\nThen at turn 11, y=9.\n\nBut the position is reached at turn 11, which is after H actions.\n\nIn the output, we need to list the actions.\n\nBut let's see the format.\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for turn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\n...\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nThen done.\n\nBut is there any issue? The player is at (0,0) at turn 2, which is safe.\n\nThen after U, at turn 3, (0,1), safe, and so on.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 4,5,6, at t1=2, the car is at [-23,0], so at x=0, it is occupied? But at turn 2, we are not on y=4, we are on y=0.\n\nAt turn 2, player is on y=0, not on freeway, so no collision.\n\nThen at turn 3, we are on y=1, which has car at [25,60] for T=3, not at 0.\n\nSimilarly, only when we are on the freeway at that turn.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nBut let me check if at some turn, 0 is occupied.\n\nFor example, on y=7, the third car, at what turn is 0 in its span.\n\nThe car span at T: [-27 + 4(T-2), -16 + 4(T-2)]\n\nSet 0 in this: -27 + 4(ΔT) <= 0 <= -16 + 4(ΔT)\n\nWhere ΔT = T-2.\n\nSo -27 + 4ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= -16 + 4ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -27 + 4ΔT <= 0 => 4ΔT <= 27 => ΔT <= 6.75, so ΔT <=6 since integer.\n\nSecond: 0 <= -16 + 4ΔT => 4ΔT >=16 => ΔT >=4.\n\nSo for ΔT from 4 to 6 inclusive, 0 in span.\n\nΔT=4: T-2=4, T=6\n\nSpan: [-27 + 4*4, -16 + 16] = [-27+16, 0] = [-11,0]\n\n-11 <=0<=0, yes, 0 in.\n\nSimilarly ΔT=5: T=7, span [-27+20, -16+20] = [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nΔT=6: T=8, span [-27+24, -16+24] = [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nΔT=7: T=9, [-27+28, -16+28] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nBut on y=7, this car is present, so at turn T=6,7,8, if player is on y=7, there would be collision if 0 in span, which it is for this car.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=7 at turn 9, which is safe, as above.\n\nSimilarly, for y=8, same cars, so at T=6,7,8, on y=8 would be dangerous if present, but in our path, we are at y=8 at T=10, which is safe.\n\nIn all U path, we are at y=7 at T=9, safe, y=8 at T=10, safe.\n\nBut just to note, if we were at y=7 at T=6,7,8, it would be collision.\n\nBut we are not.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nFor example, on y=4, car span at T: [-23 + 24(ΔT), 24(ΔT)]\n\n0 in span if -23 + 24ΔT <= 0 <= 24ΔT\n\nSince 24ΔT >=0, always true for ΔT>=1? 0 <= 24ΔT always true for ΔT>=0.\n\n-23 + 24ΔT <=0 => 24ΔT <=23 => ΔT <= 23/24 <1, so for ΔT=0, T=2, span [-23,0], 0 in.\n\nBut at T=2, if on y=4, but we are not.\n\nFor ΔT>=1, -23 +24ΔT >=1>0, so 0 not <= left end, so 0 not in span except possibly at T=2.\n\nSimilarly for y=5 and 6, same.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus, with all U, we can reach in 9 turns safely.\n\nBut the player starts at turn 2, y=0.\n\nAfter 9 actions (at turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10), position at turn 11 is y=9.\n\nActions: turn 2: U, turn 3: U, ..., turn 10: U.\n\nIn the sequence, for t from 0 to 8, action at t1+t =2+t.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nThen at turn 11, y=9.\n\nH=9.\n\nBut is there a way with fewer? No, because from y=0 to y=9, min 9 steps.\n\nUnless we can move faster, but no, only +1 per turn max.\n\nSo min H=9.\n\nPerhaps with some S or D, but that would increase H, so worse.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n\nBut in the output, we need to list the actions.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbers.\n\nCurrent turn t1=2.\n\nWe need actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}, so for H=9, actions at t=2 to t=10.\n\nEach U.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, at turn 9 and 10, it was safe.\n\nBut at turn 9, y=7, third car [1,12], not at 0.\n\nBut what about the second car? At turn 9, [37,48], not 0.\n\nFirst car [73,84], no.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I should write the sequence.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", but in this case H=9 is min and achievable.\n\nBut let me see if we can reach earlier? No.\n\nStart y=0 at t=2, after 8 actions, at t=10, y=8 max, not 9.\n\nAfter k actions, y <= k, since start from 0.\n\nAfter 8 actions, y=8 at t=10, then need one more to y=9 at t=11.\n\nSo min H=9.\n\nThus, sequence all U.\n\nBut in the answer format.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nSince t1=2, and H=9, actions from turn 2 to turn 10.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut is there any mistake?\n\nAnother thing: for freeway 7 and 8, at turn t1=2, what is the car position.\n\nFor example, on y=7, at t=2, third car span [-27,-16], which includes negative, but x=0 is not in since -16 to -27, all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, at later turns, as before.\n\nIn our path, no issue.\n\nPerhaps the player could go faster, but cannot.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) is 9. This is achieved by moving up (U) at every turn from turn 2 to turn 10, resulting in the player reaching y=9 at turn 11.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- At each turn from turn 3 to turn 10, the player is on freeway y=1 to y=8, respectively. The car spans at these turns are checked to ensure 0 is not in any span on the respective freeway.\n- **Turn 3 (y=1)**: Car span on freeway 1 is \\([25, 60]\\), 0 not in span.\n- **Turn 4 (y=2)**: Car span on freeway 2 is \\([61, 96]\\), 0 not in span.\n- **Turn 5 (y=3)**: Car span on freeway 3 is \\([97, 132]\\), 0 not in span.\n- **Turn 6 (y=4)**: Car span on freeway 4 is \\([73, 96]\\), 0 not in span.\n- **Turn 7 (y=5)**: Car span on freeway 5 is \\([97, 120]\\), 0 not in span.\n- **Turn 8 (y=6)**: Car span on freeway 6 is \\([121, 144]\\), 0 not in span.\n- **Turn 9 (y=7)**: Car spans on freeway 7:\n  - First car: \\([73, 84]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Second car: \\([37, 48]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Third car: \\([1, 12]\\), 0 not in span (since 0 < 1).\n- **Turn 10 (y=8)**: Car spans on freeway 8:\n  - First car: \\([77, 88]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Second car: \\([41, 52]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - Third car: \\([5, 16]\\), 0 not in span (since 0 < 5).\n\nSince all positions from turn 3 to turn 10 are collision-free and the player reaches (0,9) at turn 11, the sequence is valid with minimal \\(H=9\\).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe actions are applied at turns \\(t_1 + t\\) for \\(t = 0\\) to \\(H-1 = 8\\), i.e., turns 2 to 10, all U.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,1) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 3, and the player starts at y=1.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). Moving up increases y by 1, down decreases by 1, and stay keeps it the same. y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars are on each freeway from y=1 to y=8. For each freeway, there are cars defined by their head, tail, direction, and speed. The direction is either left or right, but in the table, it's given as \"right\" for all, so all cars are moving right? Let me check the car update rules.\n\nThe car update says:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t), τ - s(T-t)]\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)]\n\nIn the table, for freeways 1 to 6, it says direction \"right\", and for 7 and 8, it also says \"right\". But for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars listed. Let me read carefully.\n\nFor freeway 1: (60, 25, right, 36) — that's one car.\n\nSimilarly for 2 and 3: same as 1, (60, 25, right, 36)\n\nFreeway 4: (24, 1, right, 24)\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4, (24, 1, right, 24)\n\nFreeway 6: same, (24, 1, right, 24)\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (60, 49, right, 4), (24, 13, right, 4), (-12, -23, right, 4)\n\nFreeway 8: same three cars as freeway 7.\n\nAll cars are moving right, since direction is \"right\".\n\nFor a right-moving car, at time t, the span is [τ, h], meaning from tail to head, and at time T, it becomes [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)].\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T and 0 is within the span of some car on that freeway at time T.\n\nImportant note: when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, if the player moves to y_{T+1}, they are still on y_T during turn T, and only on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe player position is updated after the action, so at the start of turn t, the player is at y_t, then they choose action a_t, and y_{t+1} is set based on that.\n\nBut for collision, it says: collision occurs at turn T if 0 is in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\n\nAnd y_T is the player's y position at turn T.\n\nAlso, the note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at time T.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nNow, the goal is to reach y=9 as soon as possible, starting from y=1 at t=3.\n\ny=9 is the top, and since the grid is from y=0 to y=9, and freeways are from y=1 to y=8, y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 might be the bottom, but we start at y=1.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions to move up to y=9 quickly without getting hit by cars.\n\nFirst, I need to understand where the cars are at each future turn, relative to x=0, since collision depends on whether 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nThe cars are moving right, so their position changes over time.\n\nLet me denote the current time as t_1 = 3.\n\nFor a car on a freeway, at time t, span is given.\n\nFor right-moving car, at time t, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume.\n\nIn the notation, for right-moving, it says Span(t) = [τ, h], and at time T, [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right-moving here.\n\nNow, collision at time T if player is on freeway k (y_T = k) and 0 is between τ + s(T-t) and h + s(T-t) for some car on that freeway.\n\nSince the car is moving right, the span is shifting to the right over time.\n\nt here is the initial time, which is t_1=3.\n\nIn the span update, it's from the state at t_1.\n\nFor each car, the span at time T is given based on t_1.\n\nLet's define for each car, the position at time T relative to t_1=3.\n\nSet Δt = T - t_1 = T - 3.\n\nThen for a right-moving car with initial head h, tail τ, speed s at t_1=3, at time T, the span is [τ + s(Δt), h + s(Δt)]\n\nCollision occurs at time T if y_T = k and for some car on freeway k, min(τ + s(Δt), h + s(Δt)) ≤ 0 ≤ max(τ + s(Δt), h + s(Δt))\n\nSince it's right-moving and τ < h, min is τ + s(Δt), max is h + s(Δt), so if τ + s(Δt) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(Δt)\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right-moving.\n\nNow, for freeway k, we need to know if at time T, for y_T = k, is there a car such that 0 is in [τ + s(Δt), h + s(Δt)]\n\nIf yes, and player is on that y, collision.\n\nNow, let's list all freeways and their cars.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car: (h=60, τ=25, d=right, s=36) at t=3\n\nSo at time T, span: [25 + 36(Δt), 60 + 36(Δt)] where Δt = T-3\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (60,25,right,36)\n\nFreeway 3: same, (60,25,right,36)\n\nFreeway 4: (h=24, τ=1, d=right, s=24)  so [1 + 24(Δt), 24 + 24(Δt)]\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4, (24,1,right,24)\n\nFreeway 6: same, (24,1,right,24)\n\nFreeway 7: three cars:\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,4) so [49 + 4(Δt), 60 + 4(Δt)]\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,4) so [13 + 4(Δt), 24 + 4(Δt)]\n\nThird car: (-12,-23,right,4) so [-23 + 4(Δt), -12 + 4(Δt)]\n\nFreeway 8: same three cars.\n\nNow, for collision, we care about when 0 is within these spans for each freeway at time T.\n\nSince the player starts at y=1 at t=3, and wants to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns to move from y=1 to y=9 is 8 moves up, but since we can stay or move down, it might be more, but we want minimal H, so probably we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nBut we might need to wait or move down to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each possible time, whether it is safe to be on that freeway, i.e., no car has 0 in its span.\n\nWe need to find for each k from 1 to 8, and for each T, if there is a collision risk.\n\nSince the cars move, the risk changes over time.\n\nAlso, since the player moves one step at a time, we need to simulate the path.\n\nBut to minimize H, we should go up directly unless blocked.\n\nNow, the distance is 8 steps up (from y=1 to y=9), so minimum H=8 turns? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, we take action a_t, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nStart at t=3, y_3 =1.\n\nWe take actions from a_3 to a_{3+H-1}, and after H actions, at turn t=3+H, y_{3+H} should be 9? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nAfter taking action a_{t_1 + H-1}, the position becomes y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nAt turn T, position is y_T, and we take action a_T to move to y_{T+1}.\n\nSo at the start of turn T, player is at y_T, takes a_T, moves to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nWe start at turn t_1=3, position (0, y_3) = (0,1)\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t= t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so H actions, and we reach y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, action at t=3, then y_4 should be 9, but from y=1, we can only go to y=0,1,2, not directly to 9. So H must be at least 8, since we need to increase y by 8.\n\nEach U action increases y by 1, so to go from 1 to 9, we need at least 8 U actions, but we can have S or D, which don't help, so minimal H is 8 only if we can go straight up without stopping or detouring.\n\nBut with cars, we might need to take more turns.\n\nFirst, let's see if going straight up is possible.\n\nWe need to check for each freeway from y=1 to y=8, when we are on it, if it is safe.\n\nBut since we move one y per turn, we will be on each y for one turn if we go straight up.\n\nStart at t=3, y=1.\n\nThen we take actions to go to y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nAt each step, when we are on y=k for some turn T, we need that at that time T, for freeway k, no car has 0 in span.\n\nAlso, when we move to y_{T+1}, we are not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1.\n\nLet's list the times when we would be on each y if we go straight up.\n\nSuppose we start at t=3, y=1.\n\nAction a_3: U, then y_4 =2\n\na_4: U, y_5=3\n\na_5: U, y_6=4\n\na_6: U, y_7=5\n\na_7: U, y_8=6\n\na_8: U, y_9=7\n\na_9: U, y_10=8\n\na_10: U, y_11=9\n\nSo after 8 actions, at turn 11, y=9.\n\nH=8 actions from t=3 to t=10.\n\nSequence: actions at t=3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, reach y_11=9.\n\nNow, we need to check for each of these turns, when player is on y=1 to 8, if there is collision.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt turn T=3, on y=1, need safe on freeway 1\n\nT=4, on y=2, freeway 2\n\nT=5, on y=3, freeway 3\n\nT=6, on y=4, freeway 4\n\nT=7, on y=5, freeway 5\n\nT=8, on y=6, freeway 6\n\nT=9, on y=7, freeway 7\n\nT=10, on y=8, freeway 8\n\nFor each, at time T, with Δt = T - 3, check if 0 is in any car span on that freeway.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1 at time T=3, Δt=0\n\nCar: [τ + s(0), h + s(0)] = [25, 60] for the car on freeway 1.\n\n0 is not between 25 and 60, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2 at T=4, Δt=1\n\nCar on freeway 2: same as freeway 1, [25 + 36(1), 60 + 36(1)] = [61, 96]\n\n0 not in, safe.\n\nFreeway 3 at T=5, Δt=2\n\n[25 + 36*2, 60 + 36*2] = [25+72=97, 60+72=132], 0 not in, safe.\n\nFreeway 4 at T=6, Δt=3\n\nCar on freeway 4: (τ=1, h=24, s=24)\n\n[1 + 24*3, 24 + 24*3] = [1+72=73, 24+72=96], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 at T=7, Δt=4\n\n[1 + 24*4, 24 + 24*4] = [1+96=97, 24+96=120], safe.\n\nFreeway 6 at T=8, Δt=5\n\n[1 + 24*5, 24 + 24*5] = [1+120=121, 24+120=144], safe.\n\nNow freeway 7 at T=9, Δt=6\n\nFreeway 7 has three cars:\n\nFirst: (τ=49, h=60, s=4) so [49 + 4*6, 60 + 4*6] = [49+24=73, 60+24=84]\n\n0 not in.\n\nSecond: (τ=13, h=24, s=4) [13 + 24, 24 + 24] = [37, 48], 0 not in.\n\nThird: (τ=-23, h=-12, s=4) [-23 + 24, -12 + 24] = [1, 12]\n\nNow, 1 to 12, is 0 in? 1 ≤ 0 ≤ 12? 0 < 1, so 0 not in [1,12], since min is 1, max 12, 0 < 1, not included. So safe.\n\n[1,12], 0 is less than 1, not in the interval.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 at T=10, Δt=7\n\nFirst car: [49 + 4*7, 60 + 4*7] = [49+28=77, 60+28=88], safe\n\nSecond: [13 + 28, 24 + 28] = [41, 52], safe\n\nThird: [-23 + 28, -12 + 28] = [5, 16], 0 not in.\n\nSo all seem safe? But that can't be right because for freeway 7 at T=9, third car [1,12], 0 not in, but let's confirm the span.\n\nFor the third car on freeway 7: at t=3, τ=-23, h=-12, so span at T=9, Δt=6, [ -23 + 4*6, -12 + 4*6] = [-23+24=1, -12+24=12], so [1,12]. Since it's a closed interval? I assume inclusive.\n\n0 is not >=1 and <=12, so 0 not in, no collision.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut the player is at y=9 at T=11, which is safe.\n\nIn this path, all positions are safe when we are on them.\n\nAt T=3, y=1, freeway 1 safe.\n\nT=4, y=2, freeway 2 safe.\n\n...\nUp to T=10, y=8, freeway 8 safe.\n\nAnd we reach y=9 at T=11.\n\nSo with H=8, we can go straight up: actions U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U at turns 3 to 10.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nThe sequence should be for turns starting from t_1=3.\n\nSo Turn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nThen at turn 11, y=9.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nI think I missed something. For freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, but I checked all, and 0 not in any span.\n\nBut let me double-check for freeway 7 at T=9, Δt=6.\n\nThird car: τ=-23, s=4, so τ + s*Δt = -23 + 24 =1\n\nh + s*Δt = -12 + 24 =12\n\n[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, at T=10 for freeway 8, same cars, Δt=7, third car: τ + s*Δt = -23 + 28 =5, h + s*Δt = -12 + 28 =16, [5,16], 0 not in.\n\nBut what about earlier times? For example, at current time t=3, for freeway 7.\n\nBut we are not on freeway 7 at t=3, we are on y=1.\n\nIn the straight up path, we are on freeway 7 only at T=9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 at T=10.\n\nNow, but let's see if at some point 0 is covered.\n\nFor example, on freeway 4 at T=6, Δt=3, [1+24*3,24+24*3]=[73,96], safe.\n\nBut is there a time when for some freeway, 0 is in the span?\n\nFor instance, let's see for freeway 4 car: at t=3, [1,24], so at Δt=0, [1,24], 0 not in.\n\nAs Δt increases, τ + s*Δt =1 +24Δt, which is increasing, so for Δt>=0, min is at least 1, so 0 never in the span for this car on freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 1,2,3 cars: at Δt=0, [25,60], min=25>0, increasing, so always safe.\n\nNow for freeway 7 cars:\n\nFirst car: τ=49, s=4, so τ + s*Δt =49 +4Δt >=49>0 for Δt>=0, so always min>0, safe.\n\nSecond car: τ=13, s=4, min=13+4Δt >=13>0, safe.\n\nThird car: τ=-23, s=4, min= -23 +4Δt\n\nThis min can be negative.\n\n-23 +4Δt <=0 when 4Δt <=23, Δt<=5.75\n\nAnd max= -12 +4Δt\n\n-12 +4Δt >=0 when 4Δt>=12, Δt>=3\n\nNow, 0 is in [min, max] when min <=0 and max>=0.\n\nmin <=0: -23 +4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=23 => Δt <=5.75, since Δt integer, Δt <=5\n\nmax >=0: -12 +4Δt >=0 => 4Δt >=12 => Δt >=3\n\nSo for Δt from 3 to 5 inclusive, min <=0 and max>=0, so 0 in span.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt Δt=3: min= -23 +12= -11, max= -12 +12=0\n\n[ -11, 0 ], and 0 is included? max=0, so 0 is in the interval.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=4: min= -23+16= -7, max= -12+16=4, [ -7,4], 0 in.\n\nΔt=5: min= -23+20= -3, max= -12+20=8, [ -3,8], 0 in.\n\nΔt=6: min= -23+24=1, max=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same cars.\n\nBut freeway 8 has the same cars as freeway 7.\n\nIn the straight up path, for freeway 7, we are at T=9, Δt=6, which is safe, as above.\n\nBut at earlier times, for example, if we were on freeway 7 at Δt=3,4,5, it would be unsafe.\n\nBut in our path, we are on freeway 7 only at T=9, Δt=6, safe.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8 at T=10, Δt=7.\n\nΔt=7: min= -23+28=5, max=16, [5,16], safe.\n\nSo in this case, straight up works with H=8.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we are starting from (0,1), and with 8 up actions, we get there.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 7 at T=9.\n\nPerhaps I should list for each freeway the unsafe times.\n\nSince the player moves, we need to avoid being on a freeway when it is unsafe.\n\nFor freeway 1: always safe, since min span >=25>0\n\nFreeway 2: same, min>=25>0\n\nFreeway 3: same\n\nFreeway 4: min=1+24Δt >=1>0, always safe\n\nFreeway 5: same\n\nFreeway 6: same\n\nNow freeway 7: unsafe when Δt from 3 to 5, i.e., T from 6 to 8 (since Δt=T-3, so T=6,7,8)\n\nΔt=3: T=6\n\nΔt=4: T=7\n\nΔt=5: T=8\n\nAt these times, if player is on y=7, collision.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same cars, unsafe at T=6,7,8\n\nIn the straight up path:\n\nAt T=6, we are on y=4 (since t=3 y=1, t=4 y=2, t=5 y=3, t=6 y=4)\n\ny=4 at T=6, which is freeway 4, not 7, so safe.\n\nT=7, y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\nT=8, y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nT=9, y=7, freeway 7, but T=9, Δt=6, which is safe for freeway 7.\n\nSimilarly T=10, y=8, freeway 8, Δt=7, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut why is freeway 7 unsafe at T=6,7,8? But in our path, we are not on it at those times.\n\nSo straight up seems fine.\n\nBut the initial position is y=1 at t=3, and we go to y=2 at t=4, etc.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 7, there is a car at (-12,-23) which is left of 0, moving right, so it covers 0 at certain times.\n\nBut in our case, we avoid it by being on y=7 only at t=9.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at t=10.\n\nBut is there a problem with other freeways?\n\nFreeway 4,5,6 have cars that are always to the right, so never cover 0.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3 same.\n\nSo with H=8, we can do it.\n\nBut the answer should be minimal H, and 8 is minimal.\n\nBut perhaps for some reason we need to wait, but in this case no.\n\nMaybe I misread the car on freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4: (24,1,right,24), at t=3, [1,24], min=1>0, so 0 never covered.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut let me check freeway 7 and 8 at other times.\n\nFor example, at t=3, freeway 7, third car: [-23,-12], which includes negative, so 0 not in? -23 to -12, 0 > -12? min=-23, max=-12, both negative, so 0 not in [-23,-12], since 0 > max? max=-12 <0, so 0 not less than or equal to max? The interval is [min,max], so if min and max both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, only when min <=0 and max>=0.\n\nAs I had for Δt=3,4,5.\n\nBut in path, no issue.\n\nPerhaps the player can reach faster? But from y=1 to y=9, minimum 8 steps up, so H=8 is minimal.\n\nUnless we can move faster, but no, only one step per turn.\n\nSo with actions U each turn from t=3 to t=10, we reach y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut in the sequence, the last action is at t=10, for y to be 9 at t=11.\n\nNow, but let me write the actions.\n\nTurn t_1=3: a_3 = U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nThen done.\n\nBut is there a car on freeway 1 at t=3? We are on it, but safe.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm if at t=3, for freeway 1, car [25,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly all good.\n\nBut the problem has multiple cars on 7 and 8, but I think I covered.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8 at t=8, if we were there, but we are not.\n\nIn the straight up, at t=8, we are on y=6.\n\nt=3: y=1\n\nt=4: y=2\n\nt=5: y=3\n\nt=6: y=4\n\nt=7: y=5\n\nt=8: y=6\n\nt=9: y=7\n\nt=10: y=8\n\nt=11: y=9\n\nAll safe as per above.\n\nBut let me explicitly check for t=9, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nAt t=9, Δt=6, freeway 7 cars:\n\nFirst: [49+24=73, 60+24=84], 0 not in\n\nSecond: [13+24=37, 24+24=48], 0 not in\n\nThird: [-23+24=1, -12+24=12], [1,12], 0 not in, since 0<1.\n\nSimilarly for t=10, y=8, freeway 8, same, Δt=7, third car [5,16], 0 not in.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=8 with all U actions.\n\nBut the answer format should be the sequence.\n\nBut perhaps I need to output it.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in this case H=8.\n\nBut let me see if H can be less? No, because we need to increase y by 8, each action can increase by at most 1, so minimum 8 actions.\n\nIf we start with down, but that would make y decrease, then we need more actions to come back, so H would be larger, not smaller.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=0, then we need to go up to 9, which is 9 actions, H=9>8.\n\nSimilarly, staying still doesn't help, we need to move up.\n\nSo H=8 is minimal.\n\nThus the sequence is all U from t=3 to t=10.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, there are cars, but as above, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I misread the direction or something.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 7, the cars are given as (60,49,right,4), but in the span, for right-moving, it says [τ, h] but τ=49, h=60, so τ=49, h=60, so at time t, span [τ,h] = [49,60], which is from 49 to 60.\n\nThen at T, [49 + s(T-t), 60 + s(T-t)]\n\nSimilarly, (24,13,right,4), τ=13, h=24, so [13,24] at t, etc.\n\nAnd (-12,-23,right,4), τ=-23, h=-12, so at t, [ -23, -12], which is from -23 to -12.\n\nMoving right.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is 8.\n\nBut let me see if we can reach faster by being on y=9 earlier, but no, we start at y=1, need 8 steps.\n\nUnless at t=3 we are at y=1, after action, at t=4 y=2, ..., t=11 y=9.\n\nCannot be earlier.\n\nSo H=8.\n\nThus the sequence should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U  (since t_1=3)\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1} = U  (t=4)\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + 7: a_{t_1 +7} = U  (t=10)\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so t=0: t_1, t=1: t_1+1, ..., t=7: t_1+7\n\nH=8, so t from 0 to 7.\n\na_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to 7.\n\nSo a_{3}, a_{4}, ..., a_{10}\n\nAll U.\n\nIn the output, it should be listed.\n\nBut in the answer format.\n\nPerhaps I need to box it.\n\nBut is there any mistake?\n\nAnother thing: the player position is (0,y), and cars are on freeways, but the collision is only when y_T is the freeway and 0 in span at that time.\n\nBut in the note, it says if you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so for example, when we move from y to y+1, at turn T we are on y, and only at T+1 on y+1.\n\nIn our case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps for y=9, there is no freeway, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be safe or not, but we don't go there.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps the cars on freeway 7 and 8 at earlier times are dangerous, but we avoid being there at those times.\n\nIn this path, we are on y=7 only at t=9, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I believe H=8 with all U is possible and minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the output, it should be with t_1.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimal number of turns required to move from \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 9\\) is \\(H = 8\\), as each \"up\" (U) action increases the y-coordinate by 1, and 8 such actions are needed to cover the 8-unit increase. Any deviation, such as moving down (D) or staying (S), would increase \\(H\\), so \\(H = 8\\) is optimal.\n\nThe sequence of actions to achieve this is all U actions from turn 3 to turn 10, resulting in the following path:\n- At turn 3, \\(y = 1\\), action U: moves to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 4.\n- At turn 4, \\(y = 2\\), action U: moves to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 5.\n- At turn 5, \\(y = 3\\), action U: moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 6.\n- At turn 6, \\(y = 4\\), action U: moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 7.\n- At turn 7, \\(y = 5\\), action U: moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 8.\n- At turn 8, \\(y = 6\\), action U: moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9.\n- At turn 9, \\(y = 7\\), action U: moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10.\n- At turn 10, \\(y = 8\\), action U: moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n\nCollision avoidance is verified for each turn when the player is on a freeway:\n- **Turn 3 (y=1, freeway 1)**: Car span at \\(\\Delta t = 0\\) is [25, 60]. 0 not in [25, 60], safe.\n- **Turn 4 (y=2, freeway 2)**: Car span at \\(\\Delta t = 1\\) is [61, 96]. 0 not in [61, 96], safe.\n- **Turn 5 (y=3, freeway 3)**: Car span at \\(\\Delta t = 2\\) is [97, 132]. 0 not in [97, 132], safe.\n- **Turn 6 (y=4, freeway 4)**: Car span at \\(\\Delta t = 3\\) is [73, 96]. 0 not in [73, 96], safe.\n- **Turn 7 (y=5, freeway 5)**: Car span at \\(\\Delta t = 4\\) is [97, 120]. 0 not in [97, 120], safe.\n- **Turn 8 (y=6, freeway 6)**: Car span at \\(\\Delta t = 5\\) is [121, 144]. 0 not in [121, 144], safe.\n- **Turn 9 (y=7, freeway 7)**:\n  - Car 1: [73, 84], 0 not in.\n  - Car 2: [37, 48], 0 not in.\n  - Car 3: [1, 12], 0 not in (0 < 1), safe.\n- **Turn 10 (y=8, freeway 8)**:\n  - Car 1: [77, 88], 0 not in.\n  - Car 2: [41, 52], 0 not in.\n  - Car 3: [5, 16], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt turn 11, \\(y = 9\\), which has no freeway and is safe.

The cars move predictably based on their speed and direction.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car positions over time. The current turn is t=4, and I need to find actions for turns starting from t=4.\n\nThe player position at turn t is (0, y_t). I start at y=2.\n\nThe car spans are given for turn t=4, and they move linearly. For left-moving cars, the span moves left as time increases, and for right-moving, it moves right. But all cars listed are right-moving, I think? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36) — direction is right, so it's moving right.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 2 and 3 are the same.\n\nFreeway 4: (48, 25, right, 24) — head 48, tail 25? That seems odd because if it's right-moving, head should be greater than tail? Let me read the span definition.\n\nFor right-moving cars, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume, and it moves right: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn freeway 4, it says (48, 25, right, 24). Head 48, tail 25? But 48 > 25, so if it's right-moving, head is 48, tail is 25, so span is [25,48] at t=4? Let's confirm the notation.\n\nThe car state is given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut in this case, all directions are right, so let's proceed.\n\nAlso, for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on that freeway at turn T, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nImportant: at turn T, if the player moves to a different y, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So when we say position at turn T, it's y_T, and we check collision on y_T at turn T.\n\nThe update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t based on action at t.\n\nSo at turn t, player is at y_t.\n\nAction a_t determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, player is at y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn t: if y_t = k for some k=1 to 8, and for some car on freeway k, 0 is in Span_k(t).\n\nSpan_k(t) is the span at turn t.\n\nIn this case, t1 = 4 is the current turn.\n\nSo let's denote the current time as t=4.\n\nI need to get to y=9 as soon as possible, with minimal H, meaning from t=4 to t=4+H-1, so after H actions, at time t=4+H-1, y=9.\n\nLet me set t=4 as the starting point.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t=4, y=2.\n\nAfter 1 action, at t=5, y changes based on a_4.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t=4+H, y is set.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn t, we perform action a_t, then move to y_{t+1}.\n\nStart: at t=4, y_4 = 2.\n\nAfter action a_4, y_5 is determined.\n\nAfter a_5, y_6, and so on.\n\nWe want y_{4+H} = 9 for some H, but since we start at t=4, after H actions, we are at turn t=4+H.\n\nThe position after H actions is y_{t1 + H}, I think.\n\nLet's see the problem:\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nt_1 + H - 1.\n\nt_1 = 4.\n\nAfter H actions: actions at t=t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter action at t, we have y_{t+1}.\n\nSo after action at t1+H-1, we have y_{t1+H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut the turn when we reach is t1+H.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nReach at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nAt turn t, position is (0, y_t).\n\nStart at turn t1=4, y_{t1} = y_4 = 2.\n\nAfter actions a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}, we have y_{t1+H}, but we want to reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nPerhaps I need to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nAt turn t1+H-1, y_{t1+H-1} should be 9.\n\nAnd actions from t= t1 to t1+H-2? Let's see the index.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo a_{t1+0}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}\n\nThese actions affect y from t1+1 to t1+H.\n\nAction at time tau: a_tau determines y_{tau+1}.\n\nSo:\n\n- At turn t1, we are at y_{t1}, no action yet.\n\n- Action a_{t1} determines y_{t1+1}\n\n- Action a_{t1+1} determines y_{t1+2}\n\n- ...\n\n- Action a_{t1+H-1} determines y_{t1+H}\n\nWe want to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1, which is y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nBut y_{t1+H-1} is determined by a_{t1+H-2}, and we set it to 9.\n\nThen the last action a_{t1+H-1} would determine y_{t1+H}, but we don't care about that, as long as at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nThe sequence has H actions, from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, and after these, at turn t1+H, we are at some position, but we want at turn t1+H-1 to be at 9.\n\nSo for example, if H=1, we have one action: a_{t1}, which determines y_{t1+1}, and we want y_{t1} =9, but at t1, we are at y_{t1}=2, not 9, so we need actions to change y.\n\nTo have y_{t1+H-1} =9, we need to apply actions from t1 to t1+H-2 to affect y up to t1+H-1.\n\nLet's clarify the turns.\n\nDenote the time when we are at position.\n\nAt turn tau, position y_tau.\n\nAction a_tau is taken at turn tau, which changes y to y_{tau+1} for the next turn.\n\nStart: turn t1=4, y4=2.\n\nWe want for some turn T, y_T =9, with T = t1 + H -1.\n\nThe actions are from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, which affect y from y5 to y_{t1+H}.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- a4 affects y5\n\n- a5 affects y6\n\n- ...\n\n- a_{t1+H-1} affects y_{t1+H}\n\nWe want y_T =9 with T = t1 + H -1.\n\nSo y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nThis is determined by the actions up to a_{t1+H-2}, which sets y_{t1+H-1}.\n\nThen a_{t1+H-1} is the last action, but it affects y_{t1+H}, which is after we have reached 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nFor the position at turn T= t1+H-1, it is set by a_{T-1} = a_{t1+H-2}.\n\nAnd the action at T= t1+H-1 affects the next turn, but for reaching 9 at T, we don't care about the action at T except that it must be valid, but since we are at 9, and we might move away, but the goal is to reach at that turn, so we can be at 9 and then move or stay.\n\nBut in this case, since we want to be at 9, and we can choose to stay or move, but moving might cause collision or something, but at y=9, there are no cars, since cars are on y=1 to 8, so y=9 is safe, no collision possible.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so safe.\n\nSo when we are at y=9, no collision, so we can be there and it's fine.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn T, we need to arrive there at that turn.\n\nNow, the minimal H such that with H actions, we can have y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nH is the number of actions, and T = t1 + H -1 is the turn when we are at 9.\n\nSince we start at y=2, and we need to go to y=9, the minimum number of actions needed is at least 7, because each action can change y by at most 1, so from 2 to 9, delta y=7, so H at least 7, and if we go up every time, H=7, at turn t1+6 =4+6=10, y10=9? Let's see.\n\nStart t=4, y4=2\n\nAfter a4, y5 = y4 + Δy4, if U, y5=3\n\na5 U, y6=4\n\n...\n\nAfter 7 Up actions, y_{4+7} = y11 = 2+7=9, but we want y_T =9 with T= t1+H-1.\n\nIf H=7 actions: a4 to a10\n\nThen y5 to y11 are set.\n\ny_{t1+H-1} = y_{4+7-1} = y10.\n\nWith 7 Up actions: y5=3, y6=4, ..., y10=8, y11=9.\n\ny10=8, not 9. y11=9.\n\nBut we want y10=9 for H=7? T= t1+H-1=4+7-1=10, y10 should be 9, but with Up actions, y10=8.\n\nTo have y10=9, we need to be at 9 at turn 10.\n\nFrom y4=2, after 6 actions, we can be at y10=8, then with a10, if we go up, y11=9, but that's turn 11.\n\nTo be at 9 at turn 10, we need to reach y=9 earlier.\n\nFor example, if we start at y4=2, after 6 actions: a4 to a9, y5 to y10.\n\ny10 = y4 + sum of Δy from t=4 to 9, 6 actions.\n\nEach Δy can be -1,0,1.\n\nTo maximize y, we can have y10 = 2 +6 =8 if all U.\n\nMin y10=2-6=-4, but bounded to 0-9.\n\nBut we want y10=9.\n\n2 + sum_{t=4 to9} Δy_t =9, so sum of 6 Δy_t =7, but each |Δy_t|<=1, so impossible to have sum=7 in 6 steps, max sum is 6, y10=8.\n\nSimilarly, min sum -6, y10=0 or negative, but clamped.\n\nSo to have y10=9, we need more actions or different.\n\nWith H actions, we affect y from y5 to y_{4+H}.\n\ny_{t1+H-1} = y_{4+H-1}\n\nWe want y_{4+H-1} =9.\n\nStarting from y4=2, so the change from y4 to y_{4+H-1} is over (H-1) steps? From turn 4 to turn 4+H-1, there are (H-1) actions that affect it.\n\nFrom turn tau to turn T, the number of actions between is T - tau.\n\nFrom turn 4 to turn T, the position at T depends on actions from t=4 to t=T-1.\n\ny_T = y4 + sum_{t=4 to T-1} Δy_t\n\nAnd there are (T-4) actions from t=4 to t=T-1.\n\nFor example, from t=4 to t=10, actions t=4 to9, 6 actions, y10 = y4 + sum_{t=4 to9} Δy_t\n\nWe want y_T =9 for T= t1+H-1 =4+H-1.\n\nAlso, the number of actions in the sequence is H, from a4 to a_{4+H-1}.\n\nThe actions are a4, a5, ..., a_{4+H-1}, total H actions.\n\nThese affect y5, y6, ..., y_{4+H}.\n\ny_T with T=4+H-1 is affected by actions up to a_{T-1} = a_{4+H-2}.\n\nFor y_T, it is affected by a_{T-1}, which is part of the sequence if T-1 <= 4+H-1.\n\nT =4+H-1, so T-1 =4+H-2.\n\na_{T-1} = a_{4+H-2} is in the sequence since actions from a4 to a_{4+H-1}, so a_{4+H-2} is included for H>=2.\n\nFor H=1, actions a4 only, affects y5, and T=4+1-1=4, we want y4=9, but y4=2, impossible.\n\nSo H must be at least such that we can reach y=9.\n\nFrom y4=2 to y_T=9, with T=4+H-1, so the number of actions to change y is from t=4 to t=T-1, which is (T-1) -4 +1 = T-4 actions? Actions from t=4 to t=T-1 inclusive, number is (T-1) -4 +1 = T-4.\n\nFor example, T=10, actions t=4 to9, number 6 =10-4.\n\nGenerally, from turn A to turn B, actions from t=A to t=B-1, number (B-1)-A+1 = B-A.\n\nAffecting y from y_{A+1} to y_B.\n\nBut y_A is given.\n\nWe want y_T =9, with T=4+H-1.\n\nThe change in y is from y4=2 to y_T=9, delta y=7.\n\nThis change is achieved by the actions from t=4 to t=T-1, number of actions: K = T-4.\n\nThen y_T = y4 + sum of K delta y_t, each in {-1,0,1}, so to have +7, we need K >=7, and K=7 only if all delta y_t =1.\n\nThen y_T =2 +7 =9 for K=7.\n\nK = T-4.\n\nT =4+H-1, so K = (4+H-1) -4 = H-1.\n\nSo K = H-1.\n\nThen y_T = y4 + sum of K actions =2 + sum from i=1 to K of delta y, with each |delta y|<=1.\n\nTo have y_T=9, we need 2 + S =9, S=7, so K>=7, and K=7 only if all delta y= +1.\n\nK=H-1, so H-1 >=7, H>=8.\n\nWith H-1 actions, we can increase by at most H-1.\n\nFrom y4 to y_T, with T=4+H-1, the number of actions applied is from t=4 to t=T-1, which is t=4 to t=(4+H-1)-1 = t=4 to t=4+H-2.\n\nNumber of actions: (4+H-2) -4 +1 = H-1.\n\nYes, K=H-1 actions.\n\ny_T = y4 + sum of K delta y_t.\n\nSet y_T=9, y4=2, so sum of K delta y_t =7.\n\nSince each delta y_t <=1, K >=7.\n\nIf K=7, all delta y_t must be +1.\n\nThen H-1=7, so H=8.\n\nThen T=4+8-1=11.\n\ny11=9.\n\nWith K=7 actions, all U, y5=3, y6=4, ..., y11=9.\n\nAnd at turn T=11, y11=9.\n\nH=8 actions: a4 to a11.\n\na4 to a11 is 8 actions: t=4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.\n\nAffect y5 to y12.\n\ny11 is affected by a10.\n\ny12 by a11.\n\nWe want y_T with T=11, which is affected by a10.\n\nWith all U actions: a4 U, y5=3; a5 U, y6=4; ... up to a10 U, y11=9.\n\nThen at turn 11, y11=9.\n\nAnd a11 can be anything, but since we have to specify actions up to a_{t1+H-1}=a_{4+8-1}=a11, and at that point, we are at y11=9, and a11 determines y12, but we don't care, as long as no collision at turn 11.\n\nBut at y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, for H=8, T=11.\n\nIf we want earlier, with K=7 actions all U, we reach in 7 actions to y11=9, but with H=8 actions including a11.\n\nBut the reaching turn is 11.\n\nCan we reach earlier with more aggressive moves? But since we can only move up by 1 each action, the earliest we can be at y=9 is after 7 up moves, from y4=2 to y11=9, at turn 11.\n\nTurn 4: y=2\n\nTurn 5: y=3 after a4 U\n\n...\n\nTurn 11: y=9 after a10 U (since a10 affects y11)\n\nYes.\n\nIf we could move faster, but we can only change by 1 each action, so minimum 7 steps up, so minimum turn to reach y=9 is turn 4+7=11, with y11=9.\n\nThen for that, H-1=7, H=8, actions from a4 to a11, but a11 is not needed for reaching, but in the sequence, we have to specify H actions, and for turn T=11, we need actions up to a10 to set y11=9, and a11 is extra.\n\nBut in the sequence for H=8, we have a4 to a11, 8 actions.\n\nFor the last action a11, it can be S or U or D, but since we are at y11=9, moving up would go to y12=10, but y=10 not exist, so probably clamped to 9, or invalid? The player update says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=9 and U, y_{t+1} = min(9,9+1)=9? Or max?\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, but constrained to [0,9], so if y_t=9 and U, y_{t+1} = min(9,9+1)=9? min or max?\n\nIt says \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\", so if y_t=9 and U, y_{t+1} =10, but 10>9, so it should be clamped to 9.\n\nSimilarly, if y_t=0 and D, y_{t+1}=0.\n\nSo at y=9, U or S both stay at 9, D goes down to 8.\n\nBut since we want to be at 9 at turn 11, and stay or whatever.\n\nBut for collision, at turn 11, y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nNow, back to the cars.\n\nWe need to go from y=2 to y=9, moving through y=3 to8, but avoiding collisions with cars on those freeways at the times we are there.\n\nThe minimum path in terms of moves is 7 Up moves, but we might need to wait or detour if there are cars blocking.\n\nBut since we can only move vertically, no horizontal, so detour means going down and up, which takes more turns, so for minimal H, we probably want to go directly up if possible, or with minimal waiting.\n\nSince cars move, we might time our movement to avoid them.\n\nFirst, let's model the car positions over time.\n\nCurrent turn t=4.\n\nFor each freeway, and for each car, we have the span at t=4, and speed, direction.\n\nAll cars are right-moving, from the data.\n\nFreeways:\n\ny=1: one car: head -48, tail -83, right, speed 36. Since right-moving, at time t, span is [τ + s(t-4), h + s(t-4)] = [-83 + 36(t-4), -48 + 36(t-4)]\n\nSimilarly for y=2: same car: (-48,-83,right,36), so same as y=1? No, freeway 2 has its own car.\n\nEach freeway has its own cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: h=-48, τ=-83, d=right, s=36\n\nAt time T, span: [τ + s(T-4), h + s(T-4)] = [-83 + 36(T-4), -48 + 36(T-4)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same: (-48,-83,right,36), so identical to freeway 1 car.\n\nFreeway 3: same.\n\nFreeway 4: (48,25,right,24) — head 48, tail 25? For right-moving, head should be larger, 48>25, so span at T: [25 + 24(T-4), 48 + 24(T-4)]\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4.\n\nFreeway 6: same as 4.\n\nFreeway 7: multiple cars: (-48,-59,right,4), (28,17,right,4), (-8,-19,right,4)\n\nFor each, at T: for first car: [-59 + 4(T-4), -48 + 4(T-4)]\n\nSecond car: [17 + 4(T-4), 28 + 4(T-4)]\n\nThird car: [-19 + 4(T-4), -8 + 4(T-4)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same cars as freeway 7.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway k at turn T, and for some car on k, 0 is in the span at T.\n\nThat is, for some car, min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nSince the car is present and covering x=0.\n\nNow, since the player is always at x=0, we only care if x=0 is occupied by a car on the current freeway.\n\nTo avoid collision, when we are on freeway k at turn T, we need that for all cars on k, 0 not in span at T.\n\nNow, for each freeway and time, we can compute if it is safe to be there, i.e., no car at x=0.\n\nSince the spans are intervals moving, we can find when x=0 is covered.\n\nFor simplicity, let's compute for each freeway the times when it is unsafe, i.e., some car covers x=0.\n\nThen for other times, safe.\n\nBut we need per turn.\n\nSince we move one y at a time, we need to plan the sequence.\n\nFirst, let's find the minimum H.\n\nFrom earlier, to reach y=9, we need to be at turn at least 11 with y=9.\n\nTurn 11: y=9.\n\nWe start at turn 4, y=2.\n\nWe need to go through y=3,4,5,6,7,8 to reach 9.\n\nEach step, we can move up, down, or stay.\n\nBut to minimize turns, we want to move up as much as possible, only stay or down to avoid collision.\n\nSince cars move, we might be able to go up continuously if the path is clear.\n\nSo let's check for each freeway and each turn around the time, whether it is safe.\n\nFirst, let's find the time range we care about.\n\nFrom turn 4 to, say, turn 11 or a bit later.\n\nTurn 11 is when we can first reach y=9.\n\nBut if there are delays, later.\n\nFirst, for each freeway, find the times when x=0 is covered.\n\nStart with freeway 1: car span at T: [ -83 + 36(T-4) , -48 + 36(T-4) ]\n\nSet min <= 0 <= max\n\nSo -83 + 36(T-4) <= 0 <= -48 + 36(T-4)\n\nFirst inequality: -83 + 36(T-4) <= 0 => 36(T-4) <= 83 => T-4 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so T-4 <= 2 since T integer, T-4 <= 2, T<=6\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 + 36(T-4) => 48 <= 36(T-4) => 36(T-4) >=48 => T-4 >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so T-4 >= 2? Since integer, T-4 >= 2, T>=6\n\nT-4 >= ceil(48/36) = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.333) = 2\n\nSo T-4 >= 2 and T-4 <=2 from above.\n\nFrom first: T-4 <= floor(83/36) = floor(2.305) =2\n\nFrom second: T-4 >= ceil(48/36) = ceil(1.333) =2\n\nSo T-4 =2, T=6\n\nThus for freeway 1, unsafe only at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same car, so also unsafe only at T=6.\n\nFreeway 3: same, unsafe only at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 4: car (48,25,right,24)\n\nSpan at T: [25 + 24(T-4), 48 + 24(T-4)]\n\nMin <=0 <= max\n\n25 + 24(T-4) <= 0 <= 48 + 24(T-4)\n\nFirst: 25 + 24(T-4) <=0 => 24(T-4) <= -25, but 24(T-4) >=0 for T>=4, -25<0, so always false? 24(T-4) <= -25, left side >=0 for T>=4, right negative, so impossible.\n\nSecond: 0 <= 48 + 24(T-4), which is always true since min is 25>0 at T=4, and increases.\n\nMin of span is 25 + 24(T-4) >=25 >0 for all T>=4, so 0 <= min, but for 0 to be <= max, it is true, but for 0 to be in [min,max], we need min <=0 and 0<=max.\n\nHere min =25 +24(T-4) >=25>0, so min >0, so 0 < min, not <=, so 0 not in [min,max] since min>0.\n\nThus for freeway 4, at all times T>=4, min span >0, so x=0 never covered, always safe.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 5 and 6, same, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,4) — head -48, tail -59? For right-moving, head should be larger, but -48 > -59, since -48 is right of -59? x-axis, left is negative, right positive.\n\nSo tail τ=-59, head h=-48, so span [τ, h] = [-59, -48] at t=4? But direction right, so moving right.\n\nAt time T, span: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-59 + 4(T-4), -48 + 4(T-4)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (28,17,right,4), span at T: [17 + 4(T-4), 28 + 4(T-4)]\n\nThird car: (-8,-19,right,4), span at T: [-19 + 4(T-4), -8 + 4(T-4)]\n\nNow, check for each when 0 in span.\n\nFirst car: min <=0<= max\n\n-59 +4(T-4) <= 0 <= -48 +4(T-4)\n\nFirst inequality: -59 +4(T-4) <=0 => 4(T-4) <=59 => T-4 <= 59/4=14.75, so T-4 <=14\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 +4(T-4) => 48 <=4(T-4) => 12 <= T-4, T-4 >=12\n\nSo T-4 >=12 and T-4 <=14, so T=16,17,18? T-4 from 12 to 14 inclusive.\n\nT-4 >=12, T>=16\n\nT-4 <=14, T<=18\n\nSo for first car, unsafe when T=16,17,18\n\nBut we care about turns around 4 to 11, so T=16 to 18 is later, not relevant for now.\n\nSimilarly, second car: min <=0<=max\n\n17 +4(T-4) <=0 <=28 +4(T-4)\n\nFirst: 17 +4(T-4) <=0 => 4(T-4) <= -17, impossible since left >=0 for T>=4.\n\nSecond: 0<=28+4(T-4) always true.\n\nBut min=17+4(T-4) >=17>0, so 0 not in span, always safe.\n\nThird car: min <=0<=max\n\n-19 +4(T-4) <=0 <= -8 +4(T-4)\n\nFirst: -19 +4(T-4) <=0 => 4(T-4) <=19 => T-4 <= 19/4=4.75, so T-4 <=4, T<=8\n\nSecond: 0 <= -8 +4(T-4) => 8 <=4(T-4) => 2 <= T-4, T-4 >=2, T>=6\n\nSo T-4 >=2 and T-4 <=4, so T=6,7,8\n\nThus for freeway 7, unsafe when third car covers x=0, at T=6,7,8\n\nNow for freeway 8: same cars as freeway 7, so also unsafe at T=6,7,8\n\nNow, freeway 1,2,3 unsafe only at T=6\n\nFreeway 4,5,6 always safe\n\nFreeway 7,8 unsafe at T=6,7,8\n\nWe need to go from y=2 at t=4 to y=9 at some turn.\n\nTo minimize time, aim for turn 11.\n\nPath: need to be on each y from 3 to 8 for at least one turn, but we can skip some if we move fast, but since we move one step at a time, we must visit each intermediate y at some point.\n\nSpecifically, from y=2 to y=9, we must be on y=3,4,5,6,7,8 at some turns.\n\nBut we might stay on a y for multiple turns or move through quickly.\n\nTo reach fast, we should not stay unnecessarily.\n\nNow, collisions: when we are on a freeway at a time when it is unsafe.\n\nFor example, at t=6, freeways 1,2,3,7,8 are unsafe.\n\nFreeways 1,2,3 unsafe only at t=6, and 7,8 unsafe at t=6,7,8.\n\nFreeways 4,5,6 always safe.\n\nWe start at t=4, y=2.\n\ny=2 is freeway 2? Freeways are y=1 to 8, y=2 is freeway 2.\n\nAt t=4, y=2.\n\nIs it safe? Freeway 2 at t=4: car span [-83 +36(0), -48+36(0)] = [-83,-48], min=-83<0, max=-48<0, so 0 not in [-83,-48], since both negative, so safe. Similarly, for other freeways.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nNow, let's plan the sequence to avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nFirst, target to be at y=9 at turn 11.\n\nThen we need to be at y=8 at turn 10, since from y=8, we can go up to y=9 at turn 11 with a10 U.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at turn 9, and so on.\n\nBut we can have stays or downs, but to minimize time, we prefer up.\n\nList the desired path with no waiting: all U actions.\n\na4 U: to y=3 at t=5\n\na5 U: to y=4 at t=6\n\na6 U: to y=5 at t=7\n\na7 U: to y=6 at t=8\n\na8 U: to y=7 at t=9\n\na9 U: to y=8 at t=10\n\na10 U: to y=9 at t=11\n\nNow, check collisions at each turn.\n\nAt each turn, we are on a certain y, and need no collision.\n\nt=4: y=2, freeway 2. At t=4, as above, safe.\n\nt=5: y=3, freeway 3. At t=5, freeway 3: car span [-83 +36(5-4), -48+36(1)] = [-83+36, -48+36] = [-47,-12], min=-47<0, max=-12<0, both negative, 0 not in interval, so safe.\n\nt=6: y=4, freeway 4. Freeway 4 is always safe, as min>0, so safe.\n\nIn the path: at t=6, we are at y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nt=7: y=5, freeway 5, always safe.\n\nt=8: y=6, freeway 6, always safe.\n\nt=9: y=7, freeway 7. At t=9, freeway 7 unsafe? Earlier, freeway 7 unsafe at t=6,7,8? t=9 is after.\n\nt=9: T=9\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe at T=6,7,8? From earlier, for third car, unsafe at T=6,7,8.\n\nT=9: let's compute.\n\nFor freeway 7, third car span at T=9: [-19 +4(9-4), -8 +4(5)] = [-19 +20, -8+20] = [1,12], min=1>0, so 0 not in [1,12], safe.\n\nFirst car at T=9: [-59+4(5), -48+20] = [-59+20, -48+20] = [-39,-28], both negative, safe.\n\nSecond car always safe.\n\nSo at t=9, freeway 7 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=10: y=8, freeway 8.\n\nAt T=10, freeway 8 same as 7.\n\nThird car span: [-19 +4(10-4), -8 +4(6)] = [-19+24, -8+24] = [5,16] >0, safe.\n\nFirst car: [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24] <0, safe.\n\nt=11: y=9, safe.\n\nIn this path, at t=6: y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nBut t=6 is unsafe for freeway 1,2,3,7,8, but we are on y=4, freeway 4, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=7: y=5, freeway 5, safe.\n\nt=8: y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nt=9: y=7, freeway 7, but at t=9, as above, safe.\n\nt=10: y=8, freeway 8, at t=10, safe.\n\nSo actually, in this direct up path, all positions are safe at the times we are there.\n\nWe don't even need to avoid anything; we can go straight up.\n\nBut let's confirm the unsafe times.\n\nAt t=6, freeways 1,2,3 are unsafe because covered, but we are on y=4, not on them.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 unsafe at t=6,7,8, but at t=6, we are on y=4; t=7 on y=5; t=8 on y=6; none of which are 7 or 8.\n\nAt t=9, we are on y=7, freeway 7, but at t=9, it is safe, as computed.\n\nSimilarly for t=10.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, we can reach at turn 11 with y=9, using 7 up moves.\n\nNow, H: number of actions.\n\nWe take actions from a4 to a10, that's 7 actions: a4 to a10.\n\nThen y5=3, y6=4, y7=5, y8=6, y9=7, y10=8, y11=9.\n\nAt turn 11, y11=9.\n\nNow, T = t1 + H -1 =4 + H -1 =3+H\n\nSet equal to 11, so 3+H=11, H=8.\n\nH actions: from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, so for H=8, a4 to a11.\n\nBut with a4 to a10, 7 actions, we have y11=9, so at turn 11, we are at 9.\n\nThen we need to include a11 as well for H=8.\n\nBut a11 can be anything, since at turn 11, we are at y=9, safe.\n\nThen at turn 12, if we do a11 U, y12=9 (clamped), or S, y12=9, or D, y12=8, but we don't care.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have to specify.\n\nFor minimal H, we can reach with H=7 actions? Let's see.\n\nIf H=7 actions: a4 to a10.\n\nThen y5 to y11 are set.\n\ny_{t1+H-1} = y_{4+7-1} = y10.\n\nWe want y10=9? But with all U, y10=8, not 9.\n\ny10 = y4 + sum of actions from t=4 to9 (6 actions) =2 +6=8.\n\nTo have y10=9, we need to be at 9 at turn 10.\n\nBut from y4=2, with 6 actions, max y10=8, cannot be 9.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=9 at turn 10 or earlier.\n\nEarliest is turn 11 with y11=9.\n\nThus minimal H=8, with actions a4 to a11, and with a4 to a10 all U, a11 can be S or U, say.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t1+H-1 =4+8-1=11, we are at y11=9.\n\nNow, in the answer, we need to output the actions for each turn.\n\nBut in this case, with the car positions, the direct path works.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nActions: all U from t=4 to t=10, and then a11, say S.\n\nBut a11 is at turn 11, but we reach at turn 11, so action at turn 11 is after we reach.\n\nBut we need to specify actions from t=4 to t=11 for H=8.\n\nIn the sequence: turn t1: a_{t1} = a4\n\nTurn t1+1: a5\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1} = a_{4+8-1} = a11\n\nFor each, the action.\n\nWith all U, except perhaps a11.\n\nBut a4 to a10: all U, to go up.\n\na11: we can set to S, for example.\n\nNow, but we need to check if at any point during the path, we might have collision, but in this case, as above, no.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter path, but impossible, since we need 7 up moves.\n\nOr with down, but that would take more turns, so H larger, not minimal.\n\nSo H=8 is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, for H=8, we have 8 actions, but only 7 are needed to move up, the last one is extra.\n\nBut we have to include it.\n\nPerhaps we can reach with H=7 if we are at y=9 at turn 10, but impossible.\n\nSo yes.\n\nNow, but let's confirm the car at freeway 7 and 8.\n\nFor example, at t=8, if we were on y=7, it would be unsafe, but in our path, at t=8, we are on y=6.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the direct path, we avoid the unsafe times naturally.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 4: U  (to y=3 at t=5)\n\nTurn 5: U  (to y=4 at t=6)\n\nTurn 6: U  (to y=5 at t=7)\n\nTurn 7: U  (to y=6 at t=8)\n\nTurn 8: U  (to y=7 at t=9)\n\nTurn 9: U  (to y=8 at t=10)\n\nTurn 10: U  (to y=9 at t=11)\n\nThen for turn 11: we need a11, say S or U.\n\nBut at turn 11, we are at y=9, and action a11.\n\nIn the sequence, actions are specified for each turn from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nFor turn t=11, we specify a11.\n\nNow, since we are already at y=9, a11 can be S, or U to stay, or D to go down, but to minimize, we can set S.\n\nBut in the output, we need to write.\n\nPerhaps we can have a11 as part of the sequence, but it doesn't affect reaching at turn 11.\n\nNow, but in the freeways, y=7 and 8 are unsafe at t=6,7,8, but we are not on them at those times.\n\nt=6: we on y=4\n\nt=7: y=5\n\nt=8: y=6\n\nt=9: y=7, safe\n\nt=10: y=8, safe\n\nYes.\n\nTo be thorough, let's check for each turn the position and safety.\n\nTurn 4: y=2, freeway 2, car span at t=4: [-83,-48], both <0, 0 not covered, safe.\n\nAction a4=U, so y5=3.\n\nTurn 5: y=3, freeway 3, car at t=5: [-83+36(1), -48+36(1)] = [-47,-12], both <0, 0 not covered, safe.\n\nAction a5=U, y6=4.\n\nTurn 6: y=4, freeway 4, always safe, as min span >0. Specifically at t=6: span [25+24(2),48+24(2)]=[25+48,48+48]=[73,96]>0, safe.\n\nAction a6=U, y7=5.\n\nTurn 7: y=5, freeway 5, similar, safe.\n\nAction a7=U, y8=6.\n\nTurn 8: y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nAction a8=U, y9=7.\n\nTurn 9: y=7, freeway 7. At t=9: as before, cars: first car [-59+4(5), -48+20]=[-39,-28]<0, safe; second car [17+20,28+20]=[37,48]>0, safe; third car [-19+20, -8+20]=[1,12]>0, 0 not in [1,12], since min=1>0, so safe. Thus no car covers x=0, safe.\n\nAction a9=U, y10=8.\n\nTurn 10: y=8, freeway 8. Similarly at t=10: first car [-59+4(6), -48+24]=[-59+24,-48+24]=[-35,-24]<0; second car [17+24,28+24]=[41,52]>0; third car [-19+24, -8+24]=[5,16]>0; all not covering 0, safe.\n\nAction a10=U, y11=9.\n\nTurn 11: y=9, safe. Action a11, say S, then y12=9.\n\nBut we don't care about y12.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we have actions from turn 4 to turn 11.\n\nIn the answer format, we need to list:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t1} = turn 4: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: turn 5: U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H -1 = turn 4 + 8 -1 = turn 11: action, say S.\n\nBut H=8, t1=4.\n\nSince we reach at turn 11, and a11 is after, but we have to include it.\n\nTo have exactly the actions to reach, but the sequence must have H actions.\n\nIn this case, with a4 to a10 all U, we reach at turn 11, so for H=7, we would have actions a4 to a10, but then y_{t1+H-1} = y_{4+7-1}=y10=8, not 9.\n\nSo we need H=8.\n\nThus the sequence:\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S  (or U, but S is fine)\n\nAnd minimal H=8.\n\nBut is there a way with H=7? No, as established.\n\nPerhaps if we start by staying or something, but that would delay, not help.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, at t=6,7,8 unsafe, but we are not on them, so ok.\n\nAnother thing: the player position when moving.\n\nThe note says: if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so not collided by cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nBut in our case, when we move, at turn T, we are on y_T, and we check collision on y_T at turn T.\n\nWhen we move, at turn T, we are on y_T, take action, go to y_{T+1}, then at turn T+1, on y_{T+1}.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nIn the direct path, no problem.\n\nSo I think we can output this sequence.\n\nBut let's write the answer.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\n}\n\nBut H=8, and actions from turn 4 to turn 11.\n\nIn the sequence, turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so t=0: turn 4, t=1: turn 5, ..., t=7: turn 11.\n\nActions: U,U,U,U,U,U,U,S\n\nBut the last action S is at turn 11, which is after we reached at turn 11.\n\nBut it's fine.\n\nTo save, but we need minimal H, and this is minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can have a10 as S at y=8, but then y11=8, not 9, so we need to go up later.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus this is the way.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The minimum number of turns to reach \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 2\\) is 7 upward moves, as each move changes \\(y\\) by at most 1. This requires reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11, with \\(H = 8\\) actions (from turn 4 to turn 11).\n- The car positions and movements were analyzed for each freeway and turn. Key findings:\n  - Freeways 1, 2, and 3 are unsafe only at turn 6.\n  - Freeways 4, 5, and 6 are always safe, as their car spans never cover \\(x = 0\\) for \\(T \\geq 4\\).\n  - Freeways 7 and 8 are unsafe at turns 6, 7, and 8 due to the third car covering \\(x = 0\\).\n- A direct upward path (all \"U\" actions from turn 4 to turn 10) avoids all unsafe states:\n  - At turn 6, the player is on \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4, safe), not on the unsafe freeways 1, 2, 3, 7, or 8.\n  - At turns 7 and 8, the player is on \\(y = 5\\) and \\(y = 6\\) (freeways 5 and 6, both safe), not on the unsafe freeways 7 or 8.\n  - At turns 9 and 10, freeways 7 and 8 are safe, so \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are safe.\n- At turn 11, \\(y = 9\\) is safe (no cars). The action at turn 11 can be \"S\" (stay) to remain at \\(y = 9\\), as the goal is reached at this turn.\n\n### Minimal Sequence:\n- \\(H = 8\\) actions from turn 4 to turn 11.\n- Sequence: All \"U\" for turns 4 to 10 to move upward, and \"S\" at turn 11 to stay at \\(y = 9\\).\n- This sequence reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11 (i.e., \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 4 + 8 - 1 = 11\\)) without any collisions.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- Turn 4: U (move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 5)\n- Turn 5: U (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 6)\n- Turn 6: U (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 7)\n- Turn 7: U (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 8)\n- Turn 8: U (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9)\n- Turn 9: U (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10)\n- Turn 10: U (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11)\n- Turn 11: S (stay at \\(y = 9\\))\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 5, and the player is at (0,3). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nImportant note: \n- The player moves vertically: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y unchanged).\n- The player is on the freeway corresponding to his y-coordinate at the time of the turn. \n- Collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T and at that turn, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nAlso note: when moving from y to y' at turn T, at the moment of turn T, the player is still on y (so only the car on freeway y at turn T matters). Then at turn T+1, the player will be on y'.\n\nWe are given the state at turn t1=5 for the cars. For each freeway and each car, we have (head, tail, direction, speed). Note that the direction and speed are given.\n\nLet me parse the car state:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-12, -47, right, 36)\n  Since direction is right, the car moves to the right. The initial span at t1=5 is [τ, h] = [-47, -12]? \n  But note: the problem says for right-moving: [τ, h] -> [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut wait, the representation is given as (head, tail, ...). We need to interpret head and tail.\n\nLooking at the update:\n- For left-moving: [h, τ] -> [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n- For right-moving: [τ, h] -> [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut the input gives (head, tail, direction, speed). How are head and tail defined?\n\nNote: the problem says for left-moving the span is [h, τ] and for right-moving [τ, h]. So in the input, the first two numbers are always (head, tail) but the meaning depends on direction.\n\nIn the update rule for right-moving, they use [τ, h] and then update by adding s*(T-t1) to both. Similarly, for left-moving, they use [h, τ] and subtract.\n\nSo for a right-moving car, the initial span at t1 is [tail, head] = [τ, h]? But the input gives (head, tail). \n\nWait, the input for freeway 1: (-12, -47, right, 36). So head = -12, tail = -47? But for a right-moving car, the car is oriented from tail to head? Actually, the problem states: \n- Right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" meaning the car spans from τ to h, with τ < h? \n\nBut here, head=-12, tail=-47, and -47 < -12, so if we take [τ, h] = [-47, -12] for a right-moving car, that makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car, the span is [h, τ] and we assume h > τ? But we don't have any left-moving in this problem.\n\nSo for each car, we can compute the span at any future turn T (>= t1) as:\n\nIf right-moving: \n  span(T) = [τ + s*(T-5), h + s*(T-5)]\n\nIf left-moving:\n  span(T) = [h - s*(T-5), τ - s*(T-5)]\n\nCollision on freeway k at turn T happens if the player is at (0, k) and 0 is in the span of any car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nOur plan: \n  We are at y=3 at turn 5. We want to get to y=9. We can move up, down, or stay. We must avoid being on a freeway (y from 1 to 8) at a turn when a car on that freeway covers 0.\n\nWe note:\n- The player must pass through y=4,5,6,7,8 to get to 9. But we can also go down? However, we start at 3 and need to go up to 9. So we will only go up? Or maybe we have to wait sometimes by going down? But note that going down might be necessary to avoid a collision and then come back.\n\nBut the minimal number of turns should be achieved by going up as much as possible, unless we have to wait.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence of actions.\n\nConstraints: \n  - The player cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe are at turn 5 at y=3. We want to reach y=9. The minimal number of moves if no cars would be 6 moves (all U: 3->4->5->6->7->8->9). But we have to avoid collisions.\n\nWe must check for each freeway (from 3 to 9) and for each turn from 5 onward, if we are at that freeway at that turn, whether there is a collision.\n\nBut note: we are going to plan a path. We can model this as a state-space search: state = (turn, y). We start at (5,3). We want to reach (any turn, 9). The cost is the number of turns (so we want minimal turns).\n\nWe can do a BFS in the state space (turn, y) but note that the turn can go to infinity? However, we can bound the turn because the car movements are linear and periodic? Actually, the car positions are linear in time. We might have to compute the car positions at the time when the player is on that freeway.\n\nBut note: the problem is that the cars move at different speeds. However, we note that the speeds are multiples of 4? and 36,24,4. We can compute the exact position at any integer turn.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k and for each car on it, the set of turns T (>=5) for which 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nThen, when the player is at (turn, y) and y is between 1 and 8, we must check that at that turn, there is no car on freeway y that covers 0.\n\nIf the player is at y=0 or y=9, then there are no cars (since cars are on freeways 1-8) so safe.\n\nSo we can do a BFS:\n\nLet state = (t, y) meaning at turn t, the player is at y.\n\nWe start at (5,3). We want to reach any state (t,9).\n\nActions: U, D, S. The next state would be:\n\nFor action a:\n  if a = U: y_next = y+1 (if y<9) -> state (t+1, y+1)\n  if a = D: y_next = y-1 (if y>0) -> state (t+1, y-1)\n  if a = S: y_next = y -> state (t+1, y)\n\nBut we must check the state (t, y) for collision? Actually, the collision check is done at the turn when the player is on a freeway. So when we are at state (t, y), if y is between 1 and 8, we check if at turn t, there is a car on freeway y that has 0 in its span.\n\nIf so, then that state is invalid.\n\nAlso, note that the initial state (5,3) must be checked: at turn 5, on freeway 3.\n\nWe are given the car state at turn 5. So we can compute for each freeway and each car the span at turn 5.\n\nBut note: the problem says the car state is given at turn t1 (which is 5). So we have the initial state.\n\nWe need to compute for any future turn T>=5, the span of each car.\n\nLet me precompute the dangerous times for each freeway.\n\nFirst, note that the freeways that have cars are:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-12, -47, right, 36) -> so at turn 5: [τ, h] = [-47, -12]? Actually, the input is (head, tail) and direction is right, so we use [tail, head] = [-47, -12]? But wait, the input says: (head, tail) = (-12, -47). So tail=-47, head=-12? Then the span at turn 5 is [tail, head] = [-47, -12]. \n\nBut the update for right-moving: \n  at turn T: [τ + s*(T-5), h + s*(T-5)] = [-47 + 36*(T-5), -12 + 36*(T-5)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 and 3: same car? They have the same data: (-12,-47,right,36). So same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 4,5,6: (72,49,right,24) -> but wait, head=72, tail=49? and direction right. But note: for a right-moving car, the span should be [tail, head]? But 49 < 72, so [49,72] at turn 5? Then at turn T: [49+24*(T-5), 72+24*(T-5)]\n\nBut wait, the input for freeway 4: (72,49,right,24). So head=72, tail=49. Then the initial span is [49,72]? But that doesn't make sense because the car is moving right and the head should be the front? The problem doesn't specify which is front, but the update rule uses [τ, h] for right and then adds s*(T-t1). So we must use the tail and head as given.\n\nBut note: in the update rule for right, they write: [τ, h] -> [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So τ and h are the numbers given? Actually, the input says: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, ...)\". So the first number is head, second is tail.\n\nTherefore, for a right-moving car: initial span = [tail, head] = [τ, h]? But in the input, we have (head, tail) so that would be [τ, h] = [given tail, given head]. \n\nSo for freeway 1: head=-12, tail=-47 -> so the span at turn 5 is [τ, h] = [-47, -12].\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: head=72, tail=49 -> span at turn 5: [49,72].\n\nBut wait, that means the car on freeway 4 at turn 5 is from 49 to 72? Then 0 is not in [49,72] and not in [-47,-12] for freeway1,2,3. So at turn 5, all are safe? \n\nNow freeway 7 and 8: each has three cars.\n\nFreeway 7: \n  car1: (-44,-55,right,4) -> [tail, head] = [-55, -44] at turn 5.\n  car2: (32,21,right,4) -> [21,32] at turn 5.\n  car3: (-4,-15,right,4) -> [-15,-4] at turn 5.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 has the same three cars.\n\nNow, we are at turn 5, y=3. We must check freeway 3 at turn 5: \n  freeway 3 has one car: (-12,-47,right,36) -> span at turn5: [-47,-12]. 0 is not in [-47,-12] -> safe.\n\nNow, we need to plan the next moves.\n\nWe can do BFS. Since we want minimal turns, we can use Dijkstra (but all moves cost 1) so BFS by time.\n\nWe'll consider states by increasing turn.\n\nWe start:\n\nTurn 5: (5,3) -> safe.\n\nFrom (5,3), we can do U, D, S.\n\nBut note: we want to go up to 9. However, we might have to wait or even go down to avoid a collision in the future.\n\nWe need to check for each action the next state and then check that state for collision.\n\nWe must precompute for each freeway and for each car the times when 0 is in the car's span? Actually, we can compute for each freeway the set of turns T (>=5) when there is at least one car on that freeway that covers 0.\n\nBut note: the cars move continuously? The span is a continuous interval? But we are at integer turns, and the positions are real? Actually, the problem doesn't specify integer positions? But the update uses linear movement with integer speed and integer time, so the positions are integers? \n\nLooking at the update: \n  For a right-moving car: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] -> but s and T-t1 are integers, so the endpoints are integers.\n\nTherefore, the span is an interval of integers? Actually, the problem says \"the car span\", and then collision occurs if 0 is in the span. Since 0 is an integer, we can compute the condition.\n\nFor a car, the span at turn T is [A, B] (if A<=B) meaning all integers x such that A <= x <= B? \n\nBut note: for a right-moving car, we have [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] and since τ <= h (because at turn5, we have [τ, h] and we assume τ<=h) then A = τ + s*(T-t1) and B = h + s*(T-t1). Then the condition is A <= 0 <= B.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] and since h>=τ, then A = h - s*(T-t1) and B = τ - s*(T-t1) and we have A>=B? Actually, wait: the problem says for left-moving: [h, τ] -> then updates to [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. But if originally h>τ, then after subtracting, we have [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] and since h>τ, then h - s*(T-t1) > τ - s*(T-t1) -> so the interval is [B, A] with A>B? That would be backwards.\n\nBut the problem says \"span\", and then in the collision condition, it says \"0 in Span(T)\". So we must interpret the span as the set of points from min to max? \n\nTherefore, regardless of the direction, the span at time T is the interval [min, max] where min is the smallest coordinate and max the largest.\n\nSo for a right-moving car: \n   min = min(τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)) \n   max = max(τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1))\nBut since τ <= h, then min = τ + s*(T-t1) and max = h + s*(T-t1).\n\nFor a left-moving car: \n   min = min(h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)) \n   max = max(h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1))\nBut since h>=τ, then h - s*(T-t1) >= τ - s*(T-t1) -> so min = τ - s*(T-t1) and max = h - s*(T-t1).\n\nBut wait, the update rule for left-moving: [h, τ] -> [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] and if originally h>τ, then h - s*(T-t1) > τ - s*(T-t1) -> so the interval is [τ - s*(T-t1), h - s*(T-t1)]? But that would be increasing? \n\nActually, the problem states: \"For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ\". Then for left-moving, the initial span is [h, τ] meaning from h to τ? But if the car is moving left, then the head is at the front? So if the car is moving left, then the head is the leftmost? Then the tail is behind? So the car spans from h (left) to τ (right) with h < τ? Then the update: moving left, so both endpoints decrease by s*(T-t1). Then the span becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] and if h < τ, then the min is h - s*(T-t1) and max is τ - s*(T-t1).\n\nBut in the input, we have for left-moving? Actually, in this problem, all cars are right-moving. So we don't have to worry about left-moving.\n\nTherefore, for every car in this problem, the span at time T is [min, max] where:\n   min = min(τ, h) + s*(T-t1)   ??? Not exactly.\n\nWait: for a right-moving car: \n   initial: [τ, h] at turn5 -> so min=τ, max=h? Then at T: min = τ + s*(T-5), max = h + s*(T-5)\n\nBut note: in the input, the first number is called \"head\", the second \"tail\". For a right-moving car, the head is the front? Then the head should be greater than the tail? \n\nIn freeway1: head=-12, tail=-47 -> then min=-47, max=-12. So the car covers from -47 to -12.\n\nSimilarly, freeway4: head=72, tail=49 -> min=49, max=72.\n\nBut for freeway7: \n  car1: head=-44, tail=-55 -> min=-55, max=-44.\n  car2: head=32, tail=21 -> min=21, max=32.\n  car3: head=-4, tail=-15 -> min=-15, max=-4.\n\nSo at turn5, the dangerous freeways (where 0 is in the span of any car) are:\n\nfreeway1: [-47,-12] -> 0 not in [-47,-12] -> safe.\nfreeway2: same -> safe.\nfreeway3: same -> safe.\nfreeway4: [49,72] -> safe.\nfreeway5: same as 4 -> safe.\nfreeway6: same as 4 -> safe.\nfreeway7: \n  car1: [-55,-44] -> 0 not in there.\n  car2: [21,32] -> 0 not in there.\n  car3: [-15,-4] -> 0 is in [-15,-4]? 0 is greater than -15 and less than -4? No, 0 is greater than -4? Actually, -4 is negative, so 0 is not in [-15,-4] because -15 <= x <= -4, and 0 is above -4. So safe.\nfreeway8: same as 7 -> safe.\n\nSo at turn5, all freeways are safe.\n\nNow, we need to compute for future turns.\n\nWe are going to simulate the moves.\n\nBut note: the minimal H is at least 6 (from 3 to 9: 6 moves). Let's check if we can go up every time without being caught.\n\nWe plan: \n  turn5: at y=3 -> safe.\n  turn6: we move U to y=4 -> then at turn6, we are at freeway4. Check freeway4 at turn6.\n\nFreeway4: one car: (72,49,right,24) -> at turn6: \n   min = 49 + 24*(6-5) = 49+24=73\n   max = 72 + 24 = 96\n   so [73,96] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nturn7: move U to y=5 -> check freeway5 at turn7.\n  freeway5: same car as freeway4? The input says freeway5 has the same car: (72,49,right,24) -> so at turn7: \n      min = 49 + 24*(7-5)=49+48=97\n      max = 72+48=120 -> safe.\n\nturn8: move U to y=6 -> check freeway6 at turn8.\n  freeway6: same -> at turn8: 49+24*3=49+72=121, 72+72=144 -> safe.\n\nturn9: move U to y=7 -> check freeway7 at turn9.\n\nFreeway7 has three cars. We must check each at turn9.\n\ncar1: (-44,-55,right,4) -> initial min=-55, max=-44 at turn5.\n  at turn9: min = -55 + 4*(9-5) = -55+16 = -39\n           max = -44 + 16 = -28\n  so [-39,-28] -> 0 not in.\n\ncar2: (32,21,right,4) -> min=21+4*4=21+16=37, max=32+16=48 -> [37,48] -> safe.\n\ncar3: (-4,-15,right,4) -> min=-15+16=1, max=-4+16=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not in? 1 to 12, 0 is below 1 -> safe.\n\nSo freeway7 at turn9 is safe.\n\nturn10: move U to y=8 -> check freeway8 at turn10.\n\nFreeway8: same cars as freeway7? \ncar1: min=-55+4*(10-5)= -55+20=-35, max=-44+20=-24 -> safe.\ncar2: min=21+4*5=21+20=41, max=32+20=52 -> safe.\ncar3: min=-15+20=5, max=-4+20=16 -> [5,16] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nturn11: move U to y=9 -> we reached. And at turn11, we are at y=9 -> no car on freeway9 (which doesn't exist) so safe.\n\nSo the sequence: \n  turn5: at (0,3) -> we are about to choose an action for turn5 that will lead to turn6.\n\nWait, note: the action at turn t1 (turn5) will determine the position at turn6.\n\nAt turn5, we are at y=3. We choose an action. We want to go up, so we choose U.\n\nThen at turn6, we are at y=4.\n\nSo the sequence would be:\n\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: (then we are at y=9 at turn11)\n\nBut the problem asks for actions from turn t1 to the turn when we reach 9. The last action is the one that brings us to 9. \n\nWe start at turn5 at y=3. We take an action at turn5, then at turn6 we are at y=4 (if U). Then we take an action at turn6, and so on.\n\nWe reach y=9 at turn11. How many actions? From turn5 to turn10: 6 actions. Then at turn11 we are at 9. But note: we don't take an action at turn11? \n\nThe problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that after these H actions, we are at (0,9). \n\nSo we take H actions, and the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then we are at turn t1+H, and at that turn we are at y=9.\n\nBut note: at turn t1+H, we are at y=9, but we don't take an action at that turn. The state at turn t1+H is (0,9).\n\nIn our case:\n  t1=5.\n  We take action at turn5 (t=0) -> then at turn6 we are at y=4.\n  ... \n  At turn10 (t=5) we take action U: then at turn11 we are at y=9.\n\nSo we took 6 actions: from t=0 to t=5 (i.e., H=6). The sequence: \n  a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10 -> all U.\n\nBut we must check the intermediate states: \n  turn5: we are at y=3 (safe) and we take U -> then at turn6 we are at y=4 (safe as computed above).\n  turn6: at y=4 -> safe? we computed at turn6 freeway4 safe -> then we take U -> turn7: y=5 -> safe? we computed freeway5 at turn7 safe? \n          freeway5 at turn7: min=49+24*(7-5)=49+48=97, max=72+48=120 -> safe.\n  turn7: at y=5 -> take U -> turn8: y=6 -> freeway6 at turn8: min=49+24*3=121, max=72+72=144 -> safe.\n  turn8: at y=6 -> take U -> turn9: y=7 -> freeway7 at turn9: \n        car1: [-55+4*4, -44+4*4] = [-55+16, -44+16] = [-39,-28] -> safe.\n        car2: [21+16,32+16]=[37,48] -> safe.\n        car3: [-15+16, -4+16]=[1,12] -> safe.\n  turn9: at y=7 -> take U -> turn10: y=8 -> freeway8 at turn10: \n        car1: [-55+4*5, -44+20]=[-35,-24] -> safe.\n        car2: [21+20,32+20]=[41,52] -> safe.\n        car3: [-15+20, -4+20]=[5,16] -> safe.\n  turn10: at y=8 -> take U -> turn11: y=9 -> done.\n\nSo H=6 and the actions are all U.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H\". Is H the number of actions? Yes, because the sequence has H actions.\n\nBut note: we start at turn5 and we do 6 actions: turns 5,6,7,8,9,10 -> and then at turn11 we are done.\n\nSo the minimal H is 6.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 5? That would require moving 6 steps (from 3 to 9) in 5 actions? But each action changes by at most 1. So 5 actions: maximum 5 moves -> we can get to 3+5=8. Then we would be at 8 at turn10, and we need one more action to get to 9. So minimal H is 6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut let me double-check freeway7 at turn9: car3: [1,12]. The player is at freeway7 at turn9? Yes. And 0 is not in [1,12]? Correct.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway7 at other turns? We are only at freeway7 at turn9. Similarly, freeway8 at turn10: car3: [5,16] -> safe.\n\nBut note: there is a car on freeway7 at turn9 that covers [1,12]. If we had been at freeway7 at a turn when the car was covering 0, that would be bad. But we are safe.\n\nBut wait: what if we had been at freeway7 at an earlier turn? For example, if we had moved faster? But we are moving as fast as possible.\n\nAlternatively, if we had started with two Ups in a row? But we did.\n\nBut note: at turn5 we are at y=3, then we go up to 4 at turn6, then 5 at turn7, then 6 at turn8, then 7 at turn9.\n\nIs there a chance that at turn8, if we had been at freeway7? But we are at freeway6 at turn8 and then we go to 7 at turn9.\n\nSo the sequence is safe.\n\nBut what about the car on freeway7 car3: at turn5: [-15,-4] -> then at turn6: [-15+4, -4+4] = [-11,0] -> so at turn6, the car3 on freeway7 covers [-11,0] -> which includes 0. So if the player is at freeway7 at turn6, it would be a collision.\n\nSimilarly, at turn5: [-15,-4] -> 0 not in? \n  turn5: [-15,-4] -> 0 is not in because 0 is greater than -4? No, -4 is negative? Actually, -15 <= x <= -4 -> so x=-15,-14,...,-4. 0 is not in that interval.\n\nBut at turn6: min=-15+4*(6-5)=-11, max=-4+4=0 -> so the interval is [-11,0]. 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, turn7: min=-15+8=-7, max=-4+8=4 -> [-7,4] -> 0 is in.\nturn8: min=-15+12=-3, max=-4+12=8 -> [-3,8] -> 0 in.\nturn9: min=-15+16=1, max=-4+16=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway7 is dangerous at turns 6,7,8? \n\nBut we are at freeway7 at turn9 -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8 has the same cars? Then freeway8 car3: \n  turn5: [-15,-4] -> safe.\n  turn6: [-11,0] -> dangerous: 0 is included.\n  turn7: [-7,4] -> dangerous.\n  turn8: [-3,8] -> dangerous.\n  turn9: [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway8 is dangerous at turns 6,7,8.\n\nBut we are at freeway8 at turn10? \n  turn10: min=-15+4*(10-5)=-15+20=5, max=-4+20=16 -> [5,16] -> safe.\n\nSo our plan avoids freeway7 and freeway8 during the dangerous turns.\n\nBut what if we had been at freeway7 at turn8? That would be dangerous. But we are at freeway6 at turn8 and then move to freeway7 at turn9.\n\nSo we avoided.\n\nBut is there a possibility that we need to wait? We did not wait, so we achieved in 6 moves.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in 6 moves by a different sequence? We don't need to.\n\nBut what if we had gone faster? We can't because we are going up as fast as possible.\n\nWhat if we go down? That would take more moves.\n\nSo the minimal H is 6.\n\nBut wait: we must check if the initial state at turn5 is safe? We did: freeway3 at turn5: [-47,-12] -> safe.\n\nAnd then we go up.\n\nBut note: we are at freeway4 at turn6: safe? freeway4 at turn6: [49+24,72+24]=[73,96] -> safe.\n\nfreeway5 at turn7: [49+48,72+48]=[97,120] -> safe.\n\nfreeway6 at turn8: [49+72,72+72]=[121,144] -> safe.\n\nfreeway7 at turn9: safe as above.\n\nfreeway8 at turn10: safe.\n\nSo the sequence is safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\".\n\nt1=5, so a_5, a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9, a_10.\n\nWe have 6 actions.\n\nBut the answer format: \nTurn 5: a_{5}\nTurn 6: a_{6}\n...\nTurn 10: a_{10}\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=6.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 5? We argued no because 3 to 9 requires 6 moves (each move up by 1) and we have 5 actions? Then we can only move 5 steps: 3->8, then we need one more to get to 9. So 6 is minimal.\n\nBut wait, what if we can move two at once? No, the moves are only +1, -1, 0 per action.\n\nSo 6 is minimal.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's see if we can get to 9 by turn10? That would be 5 actions: from turn5 to turn9 (5 actions) and then at turn10 we are at y=9. \n\nTo be at y=9 at turn10, we need to go from 3 to 9 in 5 moves: 3+5=8 -> so we would be at 8 at turn10? Then we need a sixth action to get to 9 at turn11.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 6.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at the turn after the last action. So if we take H actions, then the state after H actions is at turn t1+H. We want that state to be (0,9). \n\nWe start at turn t1=5 at (0,3). Then after H actions, we are at turn 5+H. We want y_{5+H}=9.\n\nWe need to achieve 9 = 3 + (number of U) - (number of D). The net moves up must be 6. Each U gives +1, D gives -1, S gives 0. So the minimal H is 6 (if we use 6 U).\n\nIf we use some D, then we need more moves.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6.\n\nSo the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) is 6. The sequence of actions is all \"U\" (up) moves, which is the most direct path.

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The current turn is t_1 = 6, and the player is at y=4.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to 8, each with their positions and movements. I need to avoid being on a freeway where a car covers position x=0 at the turn when I'm on that y-level.\n\nThe collision rule: collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn T.\n\nAlso, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9.\n\nCurrent state at turn t_1=6:\n\nPlayer at (0,4)\n\nCars:\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, (head=24, tail=-11, direction=right, speed=36)\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2 and 3.\n\nFreeway 4,5,6: each has one car (-48,-71, right, 24)\n\nFreeway 7 and 8: each has three cars: (-40,-51,right,4), (36,25,right,4), (0,-11,right,4)\n\nDirection is given, but for right-moving, span is [tail, head] I think, since head is larger for right-moving? Let me check the car update.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\nFor left-moving: span at t_1 is [h, τ], and at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span at t_1 is [τ, h], I think? It says: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it says (head=24, tail=-11, direction=right, speed=36)\n\nSo for right-moving, head is the front, so for right-moving, span is [tail, head] with tail < head, I assume.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, it would be [head, tail] with head > tail or something? But in this case, all cars are right-moving, I think.\n\nLet me confirm the directions.\n\nFor freeway 1: direction right, so span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-11, 24]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow for freeway 7 and 8, multiple cars.\n\nAlso, for collision, it happens only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car with 0 in its span at that exact turn T.\n\nAnd since I move after the car positions are updated, I think the car positions are updated at each turn based on t_1.\n\nt_1 is the current turn, which is 6.\n\nSo for any future turn T, car positions are based on T - t_1.\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - t_1, so at turn T = t_1 + t for some t.\n\nt_1=6, so T = 6 + t for t=0,1,2,... but t starts from 0.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, so turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAt turn T, the car span for a given car is:\n\nFor right-moving: [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left, but all are right here.\n\nAnd collision if player y_T = k, and for freeway k, there exists a car with 0 in [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nSince the player is at x=0 always, I think.\n\nThe player is at (0, y_t), so x=0 fixed.\n\nSo only care about when x=0 is covered by a car on the row y_t at turn t.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=4 to y=9, so I need to move up at least 5 times, but I can also move down or stay, but to minimize turns, I should move up as much as possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\ny from 0 to 9, and freeways y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, no cars mentioned, so probably safe.\n\nReach (0,9), which is y=9, no freeway, so safe.\n\nBut to get there, I need to pass through y=5,6,7,8 or stay, but must end at y=9.\n\nSince I start at y=4, and need to go to y=9, minimum 5 moves up, so H at least 5, if no cars, but there are cars, so I might need to wait or something.\n\nBut let's see the car positions.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway, when x=0 is covered by a car.\n\nFor a given freeway k, and for a car, at turn T, 0 in [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)] for right-moving.\n\nSince all right-moving.\n\nt_1=6.\n\nSet δ = T - 6, so at time δ after t_1.\n\nFor a car with tail τ, head h, speed s, 0 is in the span if min(τ + sδ, h + sδ) ≤ 0 ≤ max(τ + sδ, h + sδ)\n\nSince right-moving, τ < h, so τ + sδ < h + sδ, so the span is [τ + sδ, h + sδ], so 0 is covered if τ + sδ ≤ 0 ≤ h + sδ.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all right here.\n\nSo for each car, the times when it covers x=0.\n\nBut for collision, it's when the player is on that freeway at that turn.\n\nNow, for freeway 1: car (τ=-11, h=24, s=36, right)\n\nSo span at δ: [-11 + 36δ, 24 + 36δ]\n\n0 covered when -11 + 36δ ≤ 0 ≤ 24 + 36δ\n\nSince 24 + 36δ > 0 always for δ≥0, so only need -11 + 36δ ≤ 0, so 36δ ≤ 11, δ ≤ 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nSo for δ=0, -11 ≤0 ≤24, yes.\n\nδ=0: T=6, -11 +0 = -11 ≤0, 24+0=24≥0, yes.\n\nδ=1: T=7, -11+36=25, 24+36=60, 25≤0? 25>0, so 0 not in [25,60], no.\n\nSimilarly, for δ>0, τ + sδ = -11 +36δ, which for δ≥1, -11+36=25>0, so 0 not covered.\n\nFor δ=0, it is covered.\n\nδ=0 is T=6.\n\nNow for freeway 1, only one car, and at δ=0, T=6, it covers x=0.\n\nBut at turn T=6, player is at y=4, not on freeway 1, so no collision.\n\nPlayer is on freeway y at turn T.\n\nAt T=6, player at y=4, so for freeway 4, we need to check if collision at T=6.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway, at which δ, x=0 is covered.\n\nStart with freeway 1: car (τ=-11,h=24,s=36,right)\n\n0 covered when τ + sδ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + sδ, but since h+sδ >0 always for δ≥0, only τ + sδ ≤0.\n\nτ + sδ ≤0 ⇒ -11 +36δ ≤0 ⇒ 36δ ≤11 ⇒ δ ≤ 11/36 <1, so only for δ=0.\n\nSince δ integer, turns discrete.\n\nδ = T - t_1, integer.\n\nSo for freeway 1, only at δ=0, T=6, x=0 covered.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (24,-11,right,36), same as above, so only at δ=0 covered.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3: same, only δ=0.\n\nNow freeway 4: car (-48,-71,right,24) head and tail given.\n\nIn table: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nI think head and tail, for right-moving, tail should be less than head? But -48 and -71, -71 < -48, so tail τ=-71, head h=-48? But direction right, so span [τ, h] = [-71, -48]? But that seems odd.\n\nPerhaps I misread.\n\nIn the car state: \"(-48, -71, right, 24)\"\n\nAnd in the rule, for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so here τ=-71, h=-48? But -71 < -48, so [τ, h] = [-71, -48], which is from -71 to -48, so moving right.\n\nAt δ, span [τ + sδ, h + sδ] = [-71 + 24δ, -48 + 24δ]\n\nNow, 0 covered when -71 + 24δ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 24δ\n\nSince -48 + 24δ < 0 for small δ, and -71 +24δ <0, but we need both inequalities.\n\nFirst, -71 +24δ ≤ 0 ⇒ 24δ ≤ 71 ⇒ δ ≤ 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so δ ≤ 2 since integer.\n\nSecond, 0 ≤ -48 +24δ ⇒ 48 ≤ 24δ ⇒ δ ≥ 48/24 = 2\n\nSo δ ≥ 2 and δ ≤ 2.958, so for δ=2, 0 ≤ -48 +24*2 = -48+48=0, and -71+48= -23 ≤0, so yes, 0 in [-23, 0]\n\nFor δ=3, -71+72=1, -48+72=24, 1 ≤0? 1>0, so 0 not in [1,24], no.\n\nSimilarly, δ=1: -71+24= -47, -48+24= -24, both negative, 0 not in [-47,-24], no.\n\nδ=0: [-71,-48], 0 not in, no.\n\nSo only at δ=2, T=6+2=8, covered.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 5: same car, so only at δ=2 covered.\n\nFreeway 6: same, only δ=2 covered.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-40, -51, right, 4)  head and tail? τ and h.\n\nGiven (-40,-51,right,4), so τ=-51, h=-40? Since right, [τ,h] = [-51,-40]\n\nAt δ, span [-51 +4δ, -40 +4δ]\n\n0 covered when -51+4δ ≤0 ≤ -40+4δ\n\nFirst, -51+4δ ≤0 ⇒ 4δ ≤51 ⇒ δ ≤ 51/4=12.75\n\nSecond, 0 ≤ -40+4δ ⇒ 40 ≤4δ ⇒ δ ≥10\n\nSo δ ≥10 and δ ≤12.75, so δ=10,11,12.\n\nFor δ=10: -51+40= -11 ≤0, -40+40=0 ≤0, so 0 in [-11,0], yes.\n\nδ=11: -51+44= -7 ≤0, -40+44=4 ≥0, 0 in [-7,4], yes.\n\nδ=12: -51+48= -3 ≤0, -40+48=8≥0, 0 in [-3,8], yes.\n\nδ=13: -51+52=1>0, -40+52=12>0, 0 not in [1,12], no.\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway 7: (36,25,right,4) head and tail.\n\n36 and 25, but 25<36, so τ=25, h=36? Direction right, so [τ,h] = [25,36]\n\nAt δ, [25+4δ, 36+4δ]\n\n0 covered? 25+4δ ≥25>0, so min is 25+4δ >0 for all δ≥0, so 0 never covered. Because both ends positive.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (0,-11,right,4) head=0, tail=-11? τ=-11, h=0\n\n[τ,h] = [-11,0]\n\nAt δ, [-11+4δ, 0+4δ] = [-11+4δ, 4δ]\n\n0 covered when -11+4δ ≤0 ≤4δ\n\nFirst, -11+4δ ≤0 ⇒ 4δ ≤11 ⇒ δ ≤ 11/4=2.75\n\nSecond, 0 ≤4δ always for δ≥0.\n\nSo only need δ ≤2.75, so δ=0,1,2.\n\nδ=0: [-11,0], 0 in, yes.\n\nδ=1: [-11+4,4] = [-7,4], 0 in, yes.\n\nδ=2: [-11+8,8] = [-3,8], 0 in, yes.\n\nδ=3: [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 1>0, 0 not in, no.\n\nSo for freeway 7, cars:\n\n- First car: covers at δ=10,11,12\n\n- Second car: never covers 0\n\n- Third car: covers at δ=0,1,2\n\nSo overall for freeway 7, x=0 covered when at least one car covers, so at δ=0,1,2 and δ=10,11,12.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8: same cars, same as freeway 7, so covered at δ=0,1,2,10,11,12.\n\nNow, freeway 1,2,3: covered only at δ=0\n\nFreeway 4,5,6: covered only at δ=2\n\nFreeway 7,8: covered at δ=0,1,2,10,11,12\n\nδ=0 is turn T=6.\n\nPlayer starts at y=4 at turn T=6.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when x=0 is covered for that freeway at that turn.\n\nSince we start at y=4, and need to go to y=9, we must pass through y=5,6,7,8.\n\nEach freeway has dangerous times.\n\nLet me list for each y, at which δ it is dangerous, i.e., when x=0 covered.\n\ny=1: freeway 1, dangerous at δ=0 only\n\ny=2: freeway 2, dangerous at δ=0 only\n\ny=3: freeway 3, dangerous at δ=0 only\n\ny=4: freeway 4, dangerous at δ=2 only (T=8)\n\ny=5: freeway 5, dangerous at δ=2 only (T=8)\n\ny=6: freeway 6, dangerous at δ=2 only (T=8)\n\ny=7: freeway 7, dangerous at δ=0,1,2,10,11,12\n\ny=8: freeway 8, dangerous at δ=0,1,2,10,11,12\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nAt turn T=6, δ=0, player is at y=4.\n\nAt δ=0, freeway 4 is not dangerous? For y=4, dangerous at δ=2, not δ=0.\n\nAt δ=0, which freeways are dangerous?\n\ny=1,2,3,7,8 are dangerous at δ=0.\n\ny=4,5,6 not dangerous at δ=0.\n\ny=4 dangerous only at δ=2.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPlayer at T=6, y=4, and since y=4 not dangerous at δ=0, no collision.\n\nNow, we need to move to y=9.\n\nThe dangerous periods are around δ=0,1,2 for some y, and later at δ=10,11,12 for y=7,8.\n\nBut since we want minimal H, probably we can avoid the early danger and go up before δ=10.\n\nδ=10 is far, T=16, so we can reach y=9 before that.\n\nMinimum moves: from y=4 to y=9, need +5, so at least 5 turns if we go up every turn.\n\nBut we might need to wait if dangerous.\n\nNow, at δ=0, T=6: y=4 safe.\n\nNow, we can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf we go up, to y=5 at next turn.\n\nLet's think turn by turn.\n\nSet t such that at time t (after start), turn is T = 6 + t.\n\nSo at t=0, T=6, y=4.\n\nAction a_t for t=0,1,2,... determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAction at turn T affects y_{T+1}.\n\nFrom the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with a_t at turn t.\n\nSo at turn t, we choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nIn terms of the sequence.\n\nStart: at turn T=6, y=4.\n\nWe choose a_{t_1} = a_6 for turn 6, which will determine y_7.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nDefine the state at the beginning of each turn.\n\nAt turn T, player is at y_T.\n\nThen we choose action a_T, which sets y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy based on a_T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T based on y_T and car positions at T.\n\nFor turn T, if y_T between 1 and 8, and for freeway y_T, if x=0 covered at T, then collision.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nWe start at T=6, y=4.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, which at T=6, δ=0, not dangerous, as we saw, only dangerous at T=8 (δ=2).\n\nSo safe.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9 at some turn, say at turn T=6+H for some H.\n\nThe sequence of actions from turn 6 to turn 6+H-1, so H actions, and after H actions, y_{6+H} =9.\n\nAfter action at turn T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at T=6, y=4.\n\nAfter 1 action (at T=6), y_7 is set.\n\nAfter k actions, y_{6+k} is set.\n\nWe want y_{6+H} =9 for some H.\n\nSince we start at y=4, to reach y=9, we need net +5 in y, so H at least 5.\n\nNow, let's see the dangers around.\n\nFirst, at T=6 (δ=0), dangerous for y=1,2,3,7,8.\n\nBut we are at y=4, safe.\n\nIf we go up at T=6, a_6=U, then y_7=5.\n\nAt T=7, δ=1.\n\nNow, at T=7, which y are dangerous?\n\nFirst, for each freeway at δ=1.\n\ny=1: dangerous only at δ=0, not δ=1, so safe at T=7.\n\nSimilarly y=2 and y=3 safe at δ=1.\n\ny=4: dangerous at δ=2, not δ=1, safe.\n\ny=5: similarly, freeway 5 dangerous only at δ=2, not δ=1, safe.\n\ny=6: same.\n\ny=7: dangerous at δ=1, since freeway 7 covered at δ=1.\n\nSimilarly y=8 dangerous at δ=1.\n\nSo at T=7 (δ=1), dangerous for y=7 and y=8.\n\nIf we are at y=5 at T=7, y=5 is safe, since not dangerous.\n\ny=5 freeway dangerous only at δ=2.\n\nNow, if we go up again, a_7=U, then y_8=6.\n\nAt T=8, δ=2.\n\nNow at T=8, dangerous for:\n\ny=4,5,6: dangerous at δ=2, since freeways 4,5,6 covered.\n\ny=7 and y=8 also dangerous at δ=2.\n\ny=1,2,3 not dangerous at δ=2.\n\nSo at T=8, dangerous for y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nIf we are at y=6 at T=8, which is dangerous.\n\ny=6 freeway dangerous at δ=2, so collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nFrom above:\n\nAt T=6: y=4 safe\n\na_6=U, y_7=5\n\nAt T=7: y=5 safe (since δ=1, y=5 not dangerous)\n\na_7=U, y_8=6\n\nAt T=8: y=6, and δ=2, y=6 dangerous, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nWe could do something else.\n\nPerhaps stay or go down at some point.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nSince at T=8, y=4,5,6,7,8 are all dangerous except y=0,1,2,3,9.\n\ny=1,2,3 are safe at T=8, since not dangerous at δ=2.\n\nBut we are at y=5 or something.\n\nLet's list safe y at each turn.\n\nFor turn T=6 (δ=0):\n\nDangerous y: 1,2,3,7,8\n\nSafe y: 0,4,5,6,9\n\nBut y=9 is target, but we start at y=4.\n\nT=7 (δ=1):\n\nDangerous at δ=1: only y=7 and y=8, since freeway 7 and 8 covered at δ=1.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3 not covered at δ=1, freeway 4,5,6 not covered at δ=1.\n\nSo dangerous y: 7,8\n\nSafe y: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,9\n\nT=8 (δ=2):\n\nDangerous: y=4,5,6 (freeway 4,5,6 covered) and y=7,8 (freeway 7,8 covered)\n\nSo dangerous: 4,5,6,7,8\n\nSafe: 0,1,2,3,9\n\nT=9 (δ=3):\n\nNow, at δ=3, which y dangerous?\n\nFor freeway 1: not covered\n\nFreeway 2: not\n\nFreeway 3: not\n\nFreeway 4: only covered at δ=2, not δ=3\n\nFreeway 5: same\n\nFreeway 6: same\n\nFreeway 7: covered at δ=0,1,2,10,11,12 not δ=3\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nSo at δ=3, no freeway has x=0 covered, so all y safe except possibly, but y=1 to 8, but no car covers, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for δ=4 to 9, no coverage until δ=10.\n\nAt δ=10,11,12, y=7 and y=8 dangerous.\n\nBut for now, δ=3 to 9 safe for all rows.\n\nSpecifically, at T=9 (δ=3), all y safe.\n\nSimilarly up to T=15 (δ=9), since δ=10 is T=16.\n\nδ=10 is T=16.\n\nNow back to planning.\n\nWe start at T=6, y=4, safe.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nOne way: if we can be at y=3 or something at T=8 to avoid danger.\n\nBut y=3 is freeway 3, dangerous only at δ=0, not later.\n\nAt T=8, safe y are 0,1,2,3,9.\n\nBut we start at y=4.\n\nOption: at T=6, instead of going up, we go down to y=3.\n\nBut y=3 at T=6 might be dangerous.\n\nAt T=6, δ=0, y=3 is dangerous because freeway 3 covered at δ=0.\n\nIf we go to y=3 at T=7, but at T=7, y=3 is safe.\n\nLet's see actions.\n\nAt T=6: we can choose to stay or go down, but going down might not help.\n\nSince at T=8, y=4,5,6,7,8 dangerous, we need to not be on those rows at T=8.\n\nSo we should be on y=0,1,2,3 or 9 at T=8.\n\nBut y=9 is far, we are at y=4 at T=6.\n\nFrom T=6 to T=8, we have two actions: at T=6 and T=7.\n\nAt T=6, action affects y_7.\n\nAt T=7, action affects y_8.\n\nWe need y_8 to be safe at T=8.\n\nSafe at T=8 means y_8 in {0,1,2,3,9}\n\nBut y=9 not reachable in two steps from y=4, since max y=6 if both up.\n\ny_7 = y_6 + Δy from a_6\n\ny_8 = y_7 + Δy from a_7\n\ny_6=4\n\nIf both U, y_7=5, y_8=6, which is dangerous at T=8.\n\nIf a_6=U, a_7=S, then y_7=5, y_8=5, dangerous at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, a_6=U, a_7=D, y_7=5, y_8=4, dangerous.\n\na_6=S, a_7=U, y_7=4, y_8=5, dangerous.\n\na_6=S, a_7=S, y_7=4, y_8=4, dangerous.\n\na_6=S, a_7=D, y_7=4, y_8=3.\n\ny_8=3, which is safe at T=8, since y=3 not dangerous.\n\na_6=D, a_7=?, y_7=3, then if a_7=U, y_8=4, dangerous; a_7=S, y_8=3, safe; a_7=D, y_8=2, safe.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9 eventually.\n\nIf we go to y=3 at T=8, safe, but then we are at y=3, need to go to y=9, which is +6, so at least 6 more turns, but we can go up after.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=2 or y=1.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, to avoid danger at T=8, we can be at y=3 at T=8.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt T=6, action: D, so y_7 = y_6 + (-1) = 4 -1 =3\n\nAt T=7, y=3.\n\nNow at T=7, δ=1, y=3 is safe, as earlier.\n\nThen at T=7, we can choose action.\n\nIf we choose S, then y_8=3, which is safe at T=8.\n\nIf we choose D, y_8=2, safe.\n\nBut we need to go up, so perhaps S or U? If U, y_8=4, but y=4 dangerous at T=8.\n\nSo at T=7, if we do U, y_8=4, dangerous.\n\nSo to have y_8 safe, we must not go to y=4,5,6,7,8 at T=8.\n\nSo at T=7, after action, y_8 must be in {0,1,2,3}\n\nSince y_7=3, if we do S, y_8=3; if D, y_8=2; if U, y_8=4 not safe.\n\nSo only S or D.\n\nSay we do S at T=7, so y_8=3.\n\nThen at T=8, y=3, safe.\n\nNow, from there, we can start going up.\n\nBut T=8 is done, now T=9 and later are all safe until δ=10, which is far.\n\nT=9, δ=3, all safe.\n\nWe are at y=3 at T=8.\n\nThen at T=8, we can go up to y=4, since at T=9, y=4 is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's see the minimal path.\n\nSince we need to lose one or more to avoid danger, H might be more than 5.\n\nFor example, from above: at T=6: D, y_7=3\n\nT=7: S, y_8=3 (safe at T=8)\n\nThen at T=8: U, y_9=4\n\nT=9: U, y_10=5\n\nT=10: U, y_11=6\n\nT=11: U, y_12=7\n\nT=12: U, y_13=8\n\nT=13: U, y_14=9\n\nBut at T=13, y=9, reached.\n\nBut H: from turn 6 to turn 13? Let's count the turns.\n\nStart at T=6, y=4.\n\nAfter action at T=6: y_7=3 (after D)\n\nAfter action at T=7: y_8=3 (S)\n\nAfter action at T=8: y_9=4 (U)\n\nAfter T=9: y_10=5 (U)\n\nAfter T=10: y_11=6 (U)\n\nAfter T=11: y_12=7 (U)\n\nAfter T=12: y_13=8 (U)\n\nAfter T=13: y_14=9 (U)\n\nSo reached at T=14, with 8 actions? Actions from T=6 to T=13, 8 actions.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nAt T=8, we are at y=3, safe.\n\nThen we can go up multiple times.\n\nBut from y=3 to y=9, need +6, so 6 up actions, but we need to start from T=8.\n\nAfter y_8=3 at T=8, then actions at T=8 to T=13 to reach y_14=9.\n\nT=8: U, y_9=4\n\nT=9: U, y_10=5\n\nT=10: U, y_11=6\n\nT=11: U, y_12=7\n\nT=12: U, y_13=8\n\nT=13: U, y_14=9\n\nYes, 6 actions from T=8 to T=13, but we have actions from T=6 and T=7 as well.\n\nTotal actions: T=6: D, T=7: S, T=8: U, T=9: U, ..., up to T=13: U, that's 8 actions, H=8, reaching at T=14.\n\nBut we can reach faster.\n\nAt T=7, we are at y=3 (after a_6=D)\n\nAt T=7, instead of staying, we can go down to y=2.\n\nBut that might be worse.\n\nAfter T=8, we can go up faster, but no, we need to move step by step.\n\nAnother idea: at T=6, we go down to y=3, but at T=6, if we go down, y_7=3.\n\nBut at T=6, when we are at y=4, we choose a_6.\n\nIf a_6=D, y_7=3.\n\nAt T=7, y=3, safe as δ=1.\n\nNow, instead of staying at T=7, we can go up? But if we go up at T=7, y_8=4, which is dangerous at T=8.\n\nNot good.\n\nWe can go down to y=2 at T=7.\n\nThen y_8=2, safe at T=8.\n\nThen at T=8, y=2, we can go up to y=3 at T=9, and so on, but it takes more turns.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo better to stay at y=3 at T=8.\n\nBut earlier we used two turns to go from 4 to 3 and stay, but we were at 4, go to 3, then stay at 3, so we lost one in y, so need one extra move.\n\nBut we can perhaps go directly to a safe row at T=8.\n\nFor example, at T=6, if we go down to y=3, but y=3 at T=7, then at T=7 we can go down to y=2, so at T=8 y=2 safe.\n\nBut y=2 is lower, worse.\n\nAt T=6, stay: a_6=S, y_7=4\n\nThen at T=7, y=4, which is safe at T=7 (δ=1, not dangerous)\n\nThen at T=7, if we go down to y=3, so a_7=D, y_8=3, safe at T=8.\n\nSame as before: y_8=3.\n\nThen same path.\n\nIf at T=7, we go down to y=3, same.\n\nBut we cannot go up at T=7 because y_8 would be 5 if from y=4, which is dangerous.\n\ny_7=4, a_7=U, y_8=5 dangerous.\n\na_7=D, y_8=3 safe.\n\na_7=S, y_8=4 dangerous.\n\nSo only down to y=3 is safe for y_8.\n\nWe could go to y=0,1,2, but similar or worse.\n\nNow, another possibility: since at T=7, y=5 is safe, but if we go to y=5 at T=7, then at T=8 y_8 must be 4,5, or6 if actions, all dangerous, so we cannot be on y=5 at T=7 if we want to avoid T=8 danger, because from y=5, any action to y=4,5,6 all dangerous at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, if we are at y=6 at T=7, y_8=5,6,7 all dangerous.\n\nOnly if we are at y=3 or below at T=7, we can have y_8=2,3 safe.\n\ny=4 at T=7, we can go down to y=3.\n\nSo the only way to have safe y_8 is to be at y=3 or less at T=7, and choose action to stay or down to y=2 or1, but not up.\n\nSpecifically, at T=7, y_T must be in {2,3} to have y_{T+1} in {1,2,3} with down or stay, or if y=3, stay to y=3; if y=2, stay to y=2 or down to y=1; etc.\n\nBut to minimize, best to be at y=3 at T=7 and stay to y=3 at T=8.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut we start at y=4 at T=6.\n\nTo be at y=3 at T=7, we need a_6 = D.\n\nThen a_7 = S to stay at y=3 for T=8.\n\nThen from T=8 on, go up.\n\nNow, from T=8 to reach y=9.\n\ny_8=3\n\na_8=U, y_9=4\n\na_9=U, y_10=5\n\na_10=U, y_11=6\n\na_11=U, y_12=7\n\na_12=U, y_13=8\n\na_13=U, y_14=9\n\nSo actions from T=6 to T=13: 8 actions.\n\nBut T=13 action to y_14=9.\n\nNow, can we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, at T=8, y=3, we can go up multiple times, but each action only one step.\n\nUnless we can skip some, but no, must move one step per turn.\n\nPerhaps we don't need to go down, but wait at y=4 or something.\n\nBut at T=8, y=4 is dangerous, so we cannot be on y=4 at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, we could be at y=9 before T=8, but from y=4 to y=9 in two turns? Impossible, min 5 turns, T=6 to T=11.\n\nAt T=11, y=9.\n\nBut at T=8, we need to be safe.\n\nFrom T=6 to T=11, 5 turns: actions at T=6,7,8,9,10 to reach y_11=9.\n\ny_11=9.\n\nBut at T=8, we need y_8 to be safe.\n\ny_8 must be in {0,1,2,3} since at T=8 dangerous for 4-8.\n\nBut if we go up all the way, at T=8, we would be at y= something around 6 or7, which is not in 0,1,2,3.\n\nFor example, if start T=6 y=4, a_6=U, y_7=5; a_7=U, y_8=6; but y=6 dangerous at T=8.\n\nIf we go slower, but still, to reach y=9 by T=11, we need to be at least at y=4 at T=6, then after k up, y=4+k at T=6+k.\n\nAt T=8, y=4 + number of up from T=6 to T=7.\n\nLet k be number of up actions from T=6 to T=7 (two actions: T=6 and T=7).\n\nAfter two actions, y_8 = 4 + net moves.\n\nIf both U, y_8=6\n\nIf one U one S, y_8=5\n\nIf one U one D, y_8=4\n\nIf both S, y_8=4\n\nAll of which are dangerous at T=8 except if we have net down.\n\nIf a_6=D, y_7=3; then a_7, if U, y_8=4 dangerous; if S, y_8=3 safe; if D, y_8=2 safe.\n\nBut if we do net down, we are lower, so to reach y=9, it takes more turns.\n\nFor example, if at T=8 we are at y=3, then we need 6 up to y=9, by T=14.\n\nIf at T=8 we are at y=2, need 7 up, worse.\n\nSo minimal is to be at y=3 at T=8, then 6 up to y=9 at T=14.\n\nBut T=14 is turn 6+8=14, with 8 actions? Actions from T=6 to T=13, that's 8 actions.\n\nT=6 to T=13 inclusive is 8 turns, but actions at those turns affect next y.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 at an earlier turn if we go faster, but we cannot because of the danger at T=8.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=7 or 8 before T=8, but at T=7, y=7 and 8 are dangerous.\n\nAt T=7, δ=1, y=7 and 8 dangerous.\n\nSo if we go to y=7 at T=7, collision.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot be on high y at early turns.\n\nFor example, if we go up at T=6 to y=5, safe at T=7.\n\nBut then from y=5 at T=7, we cannot go to y=6 at T=8 because dangerous, and we cannot stay or down because y=5 or 4 dangerous at T=8.\n\nSo we are stuck; we must move down to y=4 or less, but y=4 dangerous at T=8.\n\nThe only escape is to go down at T=7 to y=4 or below, but y=4 dangerous at T=8, so must go to y=3.\n\nSimilarly, from y=5 at T=7, if we go down, y_8=4, dangerous; or to y=5, dangerous; only if we go down twice, but we can't in one action.\n\nFrom y=5, a_7=D, y_8=4, which is dangerous at T=8.\n\nNo way to be safe at T=8 from y=5 at T=7 except by going to y=3, but can't directly.\n\nSo indeed, the only way to be safe at T=8 is to be at y=3 or below at T=7 and choose action to stay or down.\n\nThus, we must have y_7 <=3, and since we start at y=4, we need a_6 = D to go to y_7=3.\n\nThen at T=7, y=3, we choose a_7 = S to go to y_8=3 (safe).\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut we can choose a_7 = D to go to y_8=2, but that is lower, worse.\n\nSo best is y_8=3.\n\nThen go up.\n\nNow, after T=8, all turns are safe until T=16 or so, but we can reach y=9 before that.\n\nSpecifically, from T=8 to T=13, we can go up every turn.\n\ny_8=3\n\na_8=U, y_9=4\n\na_9=U, y_10=5\n\na_10=U, y_11=6\n\na_11=U, y_12=7\n\na_12=U, y_13=8\n\na_13=U, y_14=9\n\nSo reached at T=14.\n\nActions from T=6 to T=13: a_6 to a_13.\n\nThat's 8 actions.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, I think, the minimal H such that after H actions, we are at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nt_1=6.\n\nSo after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H, after H actions.\n\nStart: before any action, at turn t_1, y=4.\n\nAfter first action (t=0), at turn t_1 +1, y updated.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nIn this case, at T=14, y=9, so t_1 + H =14, t_1=6, so H=8.\n\nActions from t=0 to 7? t from 0 to H-1.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nFor t=0, turn t_1 +0 =6, action a_6\n\nt=1, turn 7, a_7\n\n...\n\nt=H-1, turn t_1 + H-1, action.\n\nThen after that, at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, actions: a_6=D, a_7=S, a_8=U, a_9=U, a_10=U, a_11=U, a_12=U, a_13=U\n\nThen at turn 14, y=9.\n\nSo H=8 actions.\n\nBut can we do with less?\n\nPerhaps we can reach at T=13 or earlier.\n\nFor example, if we are at higher y at T=8.\n\nBut at T=8, we must be at y<=3 to be safe.\n\nSo y_8 <=3.\n\nThen from y_8 <=3, to y=9, need at least 6 steps, so y at turn T=8+6=14.\n\nMinimal.\n\nIf y_8=3, T=14.\n\nIf y_8=2, T=15, worse.\n\nSo H=8 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is a way to be at y=9 at T=11 or something.\n\nSuppose at T=6, we go up to y=5.\n\nThen at T=7, y=5, safe.\n\nBut at T=7, we cannot go up to y=6 because at T=8 y=6 dangerous; we cannot stay at y=5 dangerous T=8; down to y=4 dangerous.\n\nAll lead to danger at T=8.\n\nUnless we go down to y=3 at T=7, but from y=5, a_7=D, y_8=4, which is dangerous, and collision occurs at T=8 if we are on y=4 and covered.\n\ny_8=4, at T=8, y=4, and freeway 4 covered, so collision.\n\nNo.\n\nIf we go down at T=6 to y=3, then at T=7 y=3, then at T=7 go down to y=2, then at T=8 y=2 safe, then from y=2 to y=9, need 7 up, so at T=15, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo indeed, H=8 seems minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, at T=13, we go to y=8, then at T=13 action U to y_14=9.\n\nBut at T=13, δ=7, which is safe, no problem.\n\nNow, but we have later dangers at δ=10,11,12 for y=7,8, but at δ=10, T=16, which is after T=14, so we are already at y=9, no issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we used a_7=S, but we could use other actions, but S is fine.\n\nNow, to output the actions.\n\nBut the player is at (0,4) at t_1=6.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 6: D  (to y=3 at next turn)\n\nAfter a_6=D, y_7=3\n\nTurn 7: S  (stay, y_8=3)\n\nThen Turn 8: U (y_9=4)\n\nTurn 9: U (y_10=5)\n\nTurn 10: U (y_11=6)\n\nTurn 11: U (y_12=7)\n\nTurn 12: U (y_13=8)\n\nTurn 13: U (y_14=9)\n\nThen at turn 14, y=9.\n\nBut in the action sequence, we have actions from turn 6 to turn 13, which is 8 actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be listed.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nAnother thought: since at T=7, we are at y=3, and at T=7, δ=1, y=3 is safe, and we can go up at T=7 to y=4, but then at T=8 y=4, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=9 directly without waiting, but not possible due to T=8 danger.\n\nMaybe at T=6, we stay, y_7=4.\n\nAt T=7, y=4, safe (δ=1).\n\nThen at T=7, we go down to y=3, so a_7=D, y_8=3.\n\nThen same as before, y_8=3, then go up.\n\nSame number of actions: a_6=S, a_7=D, a_8=U, ..., same as above but a_6=S instead of D, but y_7=4 instead of 3, but then a_7=D to y_8=3, same as before.\n\nIn this case, at T=7, y=4, which is safe, then go down to y=3 at T=8.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nBut same H=8.\n\nIn the first sequence, we went down immediately, here we stayed then down.\n\nBut minimal H is the same.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we can choose.\n\nBut to minimize, it's the same.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 earlier if we go up at some point before.\n\nFor example, suppose at T=6, we go up to y=5.\n\nThen at T=7, y=5, safe.\n\nNow, instead of moving vertically, we have to move, but we can only change y.\n\nNo other actions.\n\nSo I think H=8 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car at freeway 7 and 8 at early times.\n\nFor example, at T=12, when we go to y=7, in the sequence above at T=12, y=7? In the sequence: at T=12, we have a_12=U to y_13=8, but at T=12, where are we?\n\nIn the sequence: after a_11=U at T=11, y_12=7? Let's list y at each turn.\n\nTurn T=6: y=4\n\na_6=D → y_7=3\n\nT=7: y=3\n\na_7=S → y_8=3\n\nT=8: y=3\n\na_8=U → y_9=4\n\nT=9: y=4\n\na_9=U → y_10=5\n\nT=10: y=5\n\na_10=U → y_11=6\n\nT=11: y=6\n\na_11=U → y_12=7\n\nT=12: y=7\n\na_12=U → y_13=8\n\nT=13: y=8\n\na_13=U → y_14=9\n\nT=14: y=9\n\nAt T=12, y=7, δ=12-6=6\n\nAt δ=6, is freeway 7 dangerous? Earlier, freeway 7 dangerous at δ=0,1,2,10,11,12.\n\nδ=6 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=13, y=8, δ=7, not dangerous.\n\nAt T=14, y=9, safe.\n\nIf we had reached earlier, but we couldn't.\n\nAnother thing: at the beginning, we could have gone to y=5 at T=7, but then stuck for T=8.\n\nUnless we can be at y=9 at T=8, but impossible.\n\ny=9 at T=8 from y=4 at T=6: min 5 steps, but only 2 actions, to T=8, y_8 max 6, not 9.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, minimal H=8.\n\nNow, the actions: for turn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nIn the sequence, turn 13 is the last action.\n\nTo write in the box.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nt_1=6.\n\nAlso, we need to make sure that when we go through other rows, no collision.\n\nFor example, when going up from y=3 to y=4 at T=9, etc., all should be safe.\n\nAt T=9, δ=3, all safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the freeway 7 and 8, at δ=10,11,12 dangerous, but we are at y=7 at T=12, δ=6, safe; y=8 at T=13, δ=7, safe; and at T=14, y=9.\n\nδ=10 is T=16, later.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster after T=8.\n\nBut no, we go up every turn.\n\nSince from y=3 to y=9, 6 steps, must take 6 turns after T=8.\n\nT=8 to T=14, 6 turns? From T=8 to T=13 actions, 6 actions to go to T=14.\n\nT=8: action to y_9\n\n...\n\nUp to T=13: action to y_14=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the action at turn 7, we used S, but we could use D to go to y=2, but then need more up, worse.\n\nOr, since at T=7, y=3, we could go up, but to y=4 at T=8, dangerous, not possible.\n\nSo S is fine.\n\nNow, to output.\n\nThe sequence should be for turns starting from t_1=6.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nBut that's 8 actions, H=8.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n\nThe answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nWith actions.\n\nt_1=6.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nAnd that should reach y=9 at turn 14.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=7?\n\nSuppose H=7, then at turn t_1 + H =6+7=13, y=9.\n\nBut y_13=9.\n\nNow, from y_6=4, to y_13=9, net +5 in 7 actions, so possible if we have 5 up and 2 other, but we need to avoid collision.\n\ny_13=9, but at T=8, we need to be safe.\n\ny at T=8 must be <=3.\n\nNow, from T=6 to T=8, two actions: a_6 and a_7.\n\ny_8 = 4 + net from a_6 and a_7.\n\nTo have y_8 <=3, net must be -1 or less.\n\nFor example, a_6=D, y_7=3; then a_7, if S, y_8=3; if D, y_8=2.\n\nThen y_8 <=3.\n\nThen from y_8 to y_13=9, in 5 actions: from T=8 to T=12 actions? Actions at T=8,9,10,11,12 to set y_9 to y_13.\n\ny_13 set by action at T=12.\n\nTo reach y_13=9 from y_8 <=3, need at least 6 steps, but only 5 actions (T=8 to T=12), so impossible to gain 6 in 5 actions.\n\ny_8 <=3, say 3, then y_9=4, y_10=5, y_11=6, y_12=7, y_13=8 with 5 up actions, but y_13=8, not 9.\n\nTo get to y_13=9, we need y_13=9, so after action at T=12, y_13=9, so from y_12, if U, y_13= y_12 +1.\n\nSo y_12 must be 8.\n\nSimilarly, y_11 must be 7 or less, but to reach y_12=8 from y_8=3, need 5 up actions: y_9=4, y_10=5, y_11=6, y_12=7, y_13=8? With actions:\n\nAfter a_8, y_9\n\na_9, y_10\n\na_10, y_11\n\na_11, y_12\n\na_12, y_13\n\nTo have y_13=9, need a_12=U and y_12=8.\n\ny_12=8 requires a_11=U and y_11=7, and so on.\n\nFrom y_8=3, to y_12=8, need 5 up actions, but only 4 actions: a_8 to a_11 set y_9 to y_12.\n\ny_12 set by a_11.\n\nSo with a_8, a_9, a_10, a_11, we can set y_9 to y_12.\n\nFrom y_8=3, after a_8=U, y_9=4\n\na_9=U, y_10=5\n\na_10=U, y_11=6\n\na_11=U, y_12=7\n\nThen to have y_13=9, need a_12=U, but y_13=8, not 9.\n\nIf we have more up, but we have only these actions.\n\nTo reach y_12=8, from y_8=3, need 5 steps, but only 4 actions, impossible.\n\nFor example, min y_12 = y_8 +4 if all up, y_12=3+4=7, or 8 if y_8=4, but y_8<=3, so y_12<=7.\n\nThen y_13<=8 if U, or less.\n\nCannot reach y_13=9 with y_8<=3.\n\nSimilarly, if y_8=2, worse.\n\nThus, with H=7, t_1+H=13, y_13=9 impossible if we must have y_8<=3.\n\nIf we don't have y_8<=3, but at T=8, if y_8=4,5,6,7,8, collision, so we must have y_8<=3.\n\nThus H=7 impossible.\n\nSimilarly, H=8 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, in the action at turn 7, we have S, but we can have D, but that would make y lower, requiring more up, so H larger, not better.\n\nSo S is fine.\n\nThus, the minimal sequence.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 8.

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 3) on turn t_1 = 7. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. Each turn, the player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn T. Importantly, when moving to a new row, you're not on that row until the next turn. So, if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and at turn T+1 you're on y+1. So, for collision, we care about the row you're on at the start of each turn.\n\nThe car spans move over time based on their direction and speed. For right-moving cars, the span increases to the right, and for left-moving, to the left. But in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving, based on the data.\n\nLet me list the car states for each freeway at turn t_1 = 7.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, head 60, tail 25, direction right, speed 36. Since it's right-moving, the head is the right end, tail is left end? No, in the span definition, for right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h], so τ is left, h is right. Similarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h left, τ right? Let's check the notation.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → moves left, so h decreases, τ decreases.\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → moves right, so τ increases, h increases.\n\nIn the right-moving case, [τ, h] with τ < h, and it moves right, so at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving.\n\nBut in this problem, all directions are \"right\", so all cars are right-moving.\n\nNow, for freeway 1: cars: (60, 25, right, 36). But it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\", and it's listed as (60, 25, right, 36). So h=60, τ=25? But for right-moving, span is [τ, h] = [25, 60], and it moves right.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars. Freeway 7 has three cars: (-36, -47, right, 4), (40, 29, right, 4), (4, -7, right, 4). Similarly for freeway 8.\n\nNow, the collision condition: at turn T, if player is on freeway k, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at time T.\n\nThat is, for some car, min(span) <= 0 <= max(span) at time T.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, span at time T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] for each car.\n\nt_1 is 7, so T - t_1 is the number of turns after t_1.\n\nSet δt = T - t_1, so at time T = t_1 + δt, the span for a car is [τ + s δt, h + s δt] for right-moving cars.\n\nCollision on freeway k at time T if player is on row k at time T, and for some car on row k, τ + s δt <= 0 <= h + s δt.\n\nSince the player is moving vertically, we need to plan a path from y=3 to y=9, row by row, and for each turn, when on a row, avoid the cars on that row at that time.\n\nThe player starts at turn t_1=7 on row y=3.\n\nNow, row y=3: but freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so row 3 is a freeway? Freeways are y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, so yes, y=3 has cars.\n\nIn the car state table, it lists freeway k, which I assume is row y=k.\n\nSo for row y=3, at turn t_1=7, what cars are there?\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n\n| 1 | (60,25,right,36) |  so y=1\n\n| 2 | (60,25,right,36) | y=2\n\n| 3 | (60,25,right,36) | y=3\n\n| 4 | (-24,-47,right,24) | y=4\n\n| 5 | (-24,-47,right,24) | y=5\n\n| 6 | (-24,-47,right,24) | y=6\n\n| 7 | (-36,-47,right,4), (40,29,right,4), (4,-7,right,4) | y=7\n\n| 8 | same as y=7? (-36,-47,right,4), (40,29,right,4), (4,-7,right,4) | y=8\n\nFor row y=3, there is one car: (h=60, τ=25, right, s=36)\n\nSo span at time T: [τ + s δt, h + s δt] = [25 + 36 δt, 60 + 36 δt]\n\nCollision if 25 + 36 δt <= 0 <= 60 + 36 δt\n\nBut since δt >=0, 25 + 36δt >=25 >0, so 0 <= 25 +36δt is always true for δt>=0, and 0 <= 60+36δt also true, but the condition is min <=0<= max, so 25+36δt <=0 <=60+36δt.\n\n25+36δt <=0 implies 36δt <= -25, which is impossible since δt>=0. Similarly, 0 <=60+36δt always true. But 25+36δt <=0 is never true for δt>=0, so this inequality 25+36δt <=0 <=60+36δt is never satisfied because left part false.\n\nFor row y=3, at any time T, the span [25+36δt, 60+36δt] since δt>=0, min is 25+36δt >=25>0, so 0 is less than min, so 0 not in [min,max] since min>0. So no collision possible on row y=3 at any time? Is that right?\n\nSimilarly for y=1 and y=2, same car: (60,25,right,36), so same thing, min=25+36δt >=25>0, so 0 not in span, so no collision on y=1,2,3 at any time.\n\nNow y=4,5,6: each has car (-24,-47,right,24)\n\nh=-24, τ=-47? Span [τ, h] = [-47, -24] at t_1, since right-moving.\n\nAt time T, [τ + s δt, h + s δt] = [-47 + 24 δt, -24 + 24 δt]\n\nCollision if -47 +24δt <= 0 <= -24 +24δt\n\nNow, -47+24δt <=0 when 24δt <=47, δt <= 47/24 ≈ 1.958, so δt <=1 since integer? δt is integer turn count.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -24 +24δt when 24δt >=24, δt >=1.\n\nSo -47+24δt <=0 <= -24+24δt\n\nLeft: -47+24δt <=0 iff 24δt <=47 iff δt <= 47/24 = 1.958, so for δt=0,1\n\nRight: 0 <= -24+24δt iff 24δt >=24 iff δt >=1\n\nSo both true only for δt=1: when δt=1, left: -47+24= -23 <=0, right: -24+24=0 <=0? 0<=0 true.\n\n0 <= -24 +24δt, for δt=1, -24+24=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nFor δt=0, left: -47 <=0 true, but right: 0 <= -24? 0 <= -24 false.\n\nFor δt=2, left: -47+48=1 <=0? 1<=0 false.\n\nSo only at δt=1, that is T = t_1 +1 =8, on row y=4,5,6, there is collision if player is on that row at time T=8.\n\nSpecifically, for each of y=4,5,6, at T=8 (δt=1), the span is [-47+24, -24+24] = [-23, 0], and 0 is in [-23,0], so yes, collision.\n\nAt other times, no collision for y=4,5,6.\n\nNow for y=7 and y=8, each has three cars.\n\nFirst, y=7: cars: (-36,-47,right,4), (40,29,right,4), (4,-7,right,4)\n\nAll speed 4, right-moving.\n\nFor each car, at time T, span [τ + s δt, h + s δt]\n\nCar1: τ=-47, h=-36? Head and tail, but for right-moving, span is [τ, h] with τ left, h right? In the tuple, it's given as (head h, tail τ), and direction right.\n\nIn the car state: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor right-moving, I think h is the right end, τ is left end, so span [τ, h].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all right.\n\nSo for car on y=7: first car: h=-36, τ=-47? That seems odd, but numerically, τ=-47, h=-36, so τ < h, span [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nAt time T, [ -47 + 4 δt, -36 + 4 δt ]\n\nCollision if -47 +4δt <= 0 <= -36 +4δt\n\n-47+4δt <=0 iff 4δt <=47 iff δt <= 11.75, so all δt\n\nBut 0 <= -36 +4δt iff 4δt >=36 iff δt >=9\n\nSo both: -47+4δt <=0 always for δt>=0? -47+0=-47<=0 true, but 0 <= -36+4δt only for δt>=9\n\nAnd -47+4δt <=0 for δt>=0 since min -47<0, but the inequality is min <=0<= max, so -47+4δt <=0 <= -36+4δt\n\nFor small δt, -47+4δt <=0 true, but 0 <= -36+4δt false if -36+4δt <0.\n\nSpecifically, -36+4δt <=0 when δt <=9, since 4δt <=36, δt<=9.\n\n0 <= -36+4δt only when -36+4δt >=0, δt>=9.\n\nAnd -47+4δt <=0 always true for integer δt>=0.\n\nBut we need both min <=0 and 0<= max.\n\nmin = -47+4δt <=0: for δt=0, -47<=0 true; δt=1, -43<=0 true; ... always true since -47+4δt increases but starts negative.\n\nmax = -36+4δt\n\n0 <= max iff -36+4δt >=0 iff δt >=9\n\nAlso, min <=0 iff -47+4δt <=0, which is true for all δt since at δt=0, -47<=0, and increases slowly.\n\nBut min <=0 is always true, so collision iff 0 <= max iff δt >=9\n\nFor this car, span [min,max], collision if min <=0<=max.\n\nmin <=0: -47+4δt <=0, which since δt>=0, 4δt>=0, -47+4δt <= -47 <0, so always true? -47+4δt <=0 for all δt, yes, since max at infinity but for finite, always negative or what.\n\nAt δt=0, min=-47<0, max=-36<0, so 0 not in [-47,-36], since both negative.\n\n0 <= max: max = -36+4δt, which is negative when δt<9, zero at δt=9, positive after.\n\nmin <=0: min=-47+4δt, at δt=0, -47<=0 true, but min <=0 means the left end is left of 0, but for 0 to be in span, we need min <=0 and max >=0.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nCollision if min <= 0 <= max.\n\nFor car1 on y=7: min = τ + s δt = -47 + 4 δt\n\nmax = h + s δt = -36 + 4 δt\n\nSo min <= 0 <= max iff -47+4δt <= 0 and 0 <= -36+4δt\n\nFirst inequality: -47+4δt <=0 iff 4δt <=47 iff δt <= 47/4 = 11.75, so δt <=11\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -36+4δt iff 4δt >=36 iff δt >=9\n\nSo for δt from 9 to 11 inclusive, min <=0<=max.\n\nFor example, δt=9: min=-47+36= -11, max=-36+36=0, so [-11,0], 0 in it.\n\nδt=10: min=-47+40= -7, max=-36+40=4, [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nδt=11: min=-47+44= -3, max=-36+44=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nδt=12: min=-47+48=1, max=-36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not >= min=1>0.\n\nSimilarly, δt=8: min=-47+32= -15, max=-36+32= -4, [-15,-4], both negative, 0 not <= max=-4<0.\n\nSo for car1, collision at δt=9,10,11.\n\nNow second car on y=7: (40,29,right,4) so h=40, τ=29? Span [τ,h] = [29,40] at t_1.\n\nAt T, [29 + 4 δt, 40 + 4 δt]\n\nmin=29+4δt >=29>0, max=40+4δt>40>0, so min>0, 0 not in span, no collision ever.\n\nThird car: (4,-7,right,4) h=4, τ=-7? τ=-7, h=4, span [τ,h] = [-7,4] at t_1.\n\nAt T, [-7 + 4 δt, 4 + 4 δt]\n\nmin = -7 +4δt, max=4+4δt\n\nCollision if min <=0<=max\n\nmin <=0: -7+4δt <=0 iff 4δt <=7 iff δt <=1.75, so δt=0,1\n\n0<=max: 0 <=4+4δt always true for δt>=0\n\nSo both: min <=0 and 0<=max when δt=0 or 1\n\nAt δt=0: min=-7, max=4, -7<=0<=4 true\n\nδt=1: min=-7+4= -3, max=4+4=8, -3<=0<=8 true\n\nδt=2: min=-7+8=1, max=4+8=12, 1<=0 false? min=1>0, 0< min, not in span.\n\nSo for third car, collision at δt=0 and δt=1, i.e., T= t_1 +0 and t_1 +1, so turns 7 and 8.\n\nNow for row y=7, collision occurs if at time T, for any car, the span contains 0.\n\nSo at T= t_1 + δt, for δt=0: car1: min=-47, max=-36, both <0, 0 not in; car2: min=29>0, not; car3: min=-7<=0<=4, yes, so collision at T=7 for y=7.\n\nAt T=8 (δt=1): car1: min=-43, max=-32, both <0? δt=1, min=-47+4= -43, max=-36+4= -32, both negative, 0 not in; car2: min=33>0, not; car3: min=-3, max=8, -3<=0<=8, yes, collision.\n\nAt T=9 (δt=2): car1: min=-47+8= -39, max=-36+8= -28, both neg; car2: min=37>0; car3: min=-7+8=1, max=4+8=12, min=1>0, 0 not in. So no collision.\n\nSimilarly, later only car1 causes collision at δt=9,10,11.\n\nBut for now, at T=7 and T=8, on y=7 there is collision due to car3.\n\nSpecifically, at T=7 and T=8, for y=7, car3 has 0 in span.\n\nNow for y=8, same cars: three cars identical to y=7: (-36,-47,right,4), (40,29,right,4), (4,-7,right,4)\n\nSo same as y=7, collision at δt=0 and δt=1, i.e., T=7 and T=8.\n\nAnd also at δt=9,10,11 from car1.\n\nBut we care about when we are on the row.\n\nNow, player starts at turn t_1=7 on row y=3.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, it's the goal, so no cars on y=9 or y=0, I assume. Freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nSo to reach (0,9), we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe vertical move: each action changes y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nFrom y=3 to y=9, we need to increase y by 6, so at least 6 moves up, but we can stay or move down, so H could be more than 6, but we want minimal H.\n\nSince we can only change by 1 per turn, minimal H is 6 if we go straight up with no delay.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions on the rows we visit.\n\nStart at t=7, y=3.\n\nFirst, row y=3: as we saw earlier, for y=3, the car span min is 25+36δt >=25>0, so no collision at any time. So we can be on y=3 safely at any time.\n\nSimilarly y=1 and y=2 same, no collision possible.\n\ny=4,5,6 have collision only at T=8 (δt=1), as we calculated.\n\ny=7 and y=8 have collision at T=7 and T=8 (δt=0 and 1), and also at later times δt=9,10,11 but those are far, we might not be there then.\n\nSince we start at t=7, and want minimal H, we should try to go up as fast as possible.\n\nLet me denote the turns: t=7,8,9,10,...\n\nAt t=7, player is on y=3.\n\nWe can choose action at t=7: U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, at t=8, y=4\n\nIf S, at t=8, y=3\n\nIf D, at t=8, y=2, but going down might not help, since we need to go up to 9.\n\nSimilarly, from y=2, we can go to y=3 or y=1, etc.\n\nBut since we need to go up, probably best to go up directly.\n\nBut we have to avoid rows at dangerous times.\n\nFirst, y=4,5,6 are dangerous only at t=8.\n\nSpecifically, at t=8, if on y=4,5, or 6, collision.\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are dangerous at t=7 and t=8.\n\nBut at t=7, we are on y=3, not on y=7 or 8.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible actions:\n\nSuppose at t=7, we do U, so to y=4 at t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, on y=4, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nIf we do S at t=7, stay on y=3, then at t=8, y=3, which is safe (no collision ever).\n\nThen at t=8, we can do U to y=4 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, on y=4, which is safe because for y=4, only dangerous at t=8, not at t=9.\n\nSimilarly, we can go up.\n\nLet's list the safe times for each row.\n\nFor row y:\n\n- y=1,2,3: always safe, no cars or cars not covering 0.\n\ny=1 has car, but min>0 always, so safe.\n\ny=4,5,6: safe except at t=8 (δt=1)\n\nThat is, unsafe at T=8.\n\nSafe at T=7,9,10,... etc.\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=7 and T=8 (δt=0,1) and also at T=16,17,18? δt=9,10,11, T=7+9=16, 17,18, but since we start at t=7 and go to y=9, we might not reach t=16, so for minimal H, we can ignore later times if H small.\n\nSimilarly y=8 same.\n\nBut for now, focus on early turns.\n\nWe need to go from y=3 to y=9.\n\nThe rows to cross: y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nEach must be visited at some safe time.\n\nSince we start at t=7 on y=3.\n\nWe want to minimize turns, so we should go up as fast as possible, but may need to delay to avoid bad times.\n\nOption 1: Go up immediately.\n\nAt t=7, action U: then at t=8, y=4. But at t=8, on y=4, which is unsafe (collision), so not good.\n\nAction S at t=7: at t=8, y=3. Safe.\n\nThen at t=8, action U: to y=4 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, on y=4. Now t=9, δt=2 for y=4? t=9, from t_1=7, δt=2.\n\nFor y=4, unsafe only at δt=1, t=8. At δt=2, t=9, safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can proceed.\n\nAt t=9, on y=4, we can do U to y=5 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, on y=5. For y=5, same as y=4, unsafe only at t=8, so at t=10 safe.\n\nSimilarly, U to y=6 at t=11, safe.\n\nThen U to y=7 at t=12.\n\nNow at t=12, on y=7.\n\nFor y=7, when is it safe?\n\nEarlier, unsafe at t=7,8, and t=16,17,18.\n\nAt t=12, δt=12-7=5.\n\nNow, for car1: min=-47+4*5= -47+20= -27, max=-36+20= -16, both neg, 0 not in.\n\nCar2: min=29+20=49>0, not.\n\nCar3: min=-7+20=13, max=4+20=24, min=13>0, not.\n\nSo at t=12, y=7 safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can do U to y=8 at t=13.\n\nOn y=8 at t=13.\n\nδt=6, t=13.\n\ny=8 same cars: car1 min=-47+4*6= -47+24= -23, max=-36+24= -12, both neg.\n\nCar2 min=29+24=53>0\n\nCar3 min=-7+24=17>0\n\nAll min>0 or span not cover 0, so safe.\n\nThen U to y=9 at t=14.\n\nAt t=14, y=9, which is goal, no freeway, safe.\n\nNow, sequence: starts t=7, y=3.\n\nt=7: S (stay, so at t=8 y=3)\n\nt=8: U (to y=4 at t=9)\n\nt=9: U (to y=5 at t=10)\n\nt=10: U (to y=6 at t=11)\n\nt=11: U (to y=7 at t=12)\n\nt=12: U (to y=8 at t=13)\n\nt=13: U (to y=9 at t=14)\n\nAt t=14, y=9, reached.\n\nH = number of actions? From t=7 to t=13, we have actions at t=7 to t=13, that's 7 actions, but we reach y=9 at t=14 after action at t=13.\n\nLet's see the turns.\n\nAt turn t, we choose action, which determines y for next turn.\n\nStart: turn t=7, position (0,3), so at beginning of turn t=7, on row y=3.\n\nAfter action, at beginning of turn t=8, y is updated.\n\nIn the sequence: at turn t=7, we do action, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nIn this case:\n\nTurn t=7: action S, so y_{8} = y_7 +0 =3\n\nTurn t=8: action U, so y_{9} =3+1=4\n\nTurn t=9: action U, y_{10}=4+1=5\n\nTurn t=10: action U, y_{11}=5+1=6\n\nTurn t=11: action U, y_{12}=6+1=7\n\nTurn t=12: action U, y_{13}=7+1=8\n\nTurn t=13: action U, y_{14}=8+1=9\n\nSo at turn t=14, y=9, reached.\n\nWe used actions from t=7 to t=13, that's 7 actions, H=7 turns of actions.\n\nBut is this minimal? We started at t=7, reached at t=14, so 7 turns later? From t=7 to t=14, it's 7 steps, but the position changes at t=8,9,...,14.\n\nt=7: start, after action, at t=8 y=3, etc., up to at t=14 y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=7 to t=13 inclusive, that's 7 actions, to reach at t=14.\n\nSince we need to change y from 3 to 9, delta y=6, so minimal actions if all up is 6 actions, reaching at t=7+6=13.\n\nBut in this case, with 6 actions: suppose all U from start.\n\nt=7: U, so at t=8 y=4\n\nBut at t=8, on y=4, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nt=7: S, then t=8: y=3\n\nThen if we do U at t=8, to y=4 at t=9, as before, but that takes one extra turn.\n\nCan we reach faster?\n\nSuppose we go up but skip the dangerous time.\n\ny=4,5,6 only dangerous at t=8.\n\nSo if we are not on them at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and 8 dangerous at t=7 and t=8, but t=7 we are on y=3, not on them.\n\nt=8 we can avoid being on them.\n\nNow, to go from y=3 to y=9 in fewer turns.\n\nMinimal 6 actions: actions at t=7 to t=12, to be at y=9 at t=13.\n\nAt t=13, y=9.\n\nNow, the path: at t=7, start y=3.\n\nAfter action at t=7, y at t=8.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nWe need to be on y=4 at some t not 8, similarly y=5 not at t=8, y=6 not at t=8.\n\ny=7 not at t=7 or t=8, etc.\n\nSince we start at t=7, y=3.\n\nIf we do U at t=7, y at t=8 is 4, but t=8 is bad for y=4.\n\nIf we do nothing at t=7, S, y at t=8 is 3.\n\nThen at t=8, if we do U, y at t=9 is 4, which is safe since t=9 not t=8.\n\nBut y at t=9 is 4, then we need to go to y=5 at t=10, y=6 at t=11, y=7 at t=12, y=8 at t=13, y=9 at t=14.\n\nSame as before, t=14.\n\nTo save time, can we be on multiple rows at different times.\n\nFor example, can we reach y=4 earlier? But at t=8, y=4 is bad, so we cannot be on y=4 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, the only safe times for y=4,5,6 are t<=7 or t>=9.\n\nt<=7: but at t=7, we are on y=3, not on y=4. And we start at t=7, so for t<7 not possible.\n\nSo for y=4, safe at t=7? At t=7, if we were on y=4, but at t=7 we are on y=3, so we cannot be on y=4 at t=7.\n\nSimilarly, at t=7, we are on y=3, so y=4 at t=7 is not possible for us.\n\nThe earliest we can be on y=4 is t=8, but t=8 is unsafe for y=4.\n\nNext possible: if we move at t=8 to y=4, but that would be at t=9? No.\n\nAt turn t=7: if we do U, then at t=8 y=4.\n\nBut unsafe.\n\nIf we do not go to y=4 at t=8, we must go later.\n\nThe next chance: at turn t=8, if we are still on y=3 (after S at t=7), then at t=8 we can do U, to y=4 at t=9.\n\nThen y=4 at t=9, safe.\n\nSimilarly, to y=5 at t=10, etc.\n\nWe cannot reach y=4 before t=8, and at t=8 it is unsafe, so we must reach at t=9 or later.\n\nSimilarly for y=5 and y=6, they can only be reached at t=9 or later, since from y=3, it takes at least one step to y=4 at t=8, but unsafe, so y=4 at t=9 earliest safe.\n\nThen y=5 at t=10 earliest, y=6 at t=11.\n\nThen y=7 at t=12, but we need to check y=7 safety.\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=7 and t=8, but t=12 is safe, as earlier.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at t=13, safe.\n\ny=9 at t=14.\n\nSo minimal H is 7 actions, reaching at t=14.\n\nBut perhaps we can go faster by not going straight.\n\nFor example, at t=7, instead of S, go down? But that seems worse, since we need to go up.\n\nOr, for y=7 and y=8, they are unsafe at t=7 and t=8, but we are not there then, and later they are safe except at distant times.\n\nIn this path, we are on y=7 at t=12, which is fine.\n\nAnother idea: since y=3 is always safe, we can stay there, but that would take more turns.\n\nBut we want minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 in fewer than 7 actions? 6 actions should be possible if no obstacles.\n\nBut with obstacles, we need to avoid t=8 for y=4,5,6.\n\nSuppose we go to y=4 at t=9, as before.\n\nBut to have y=4 at t=9, we need to be on y=3 or y=5 at t=8? Let's see.\n\nAt t=8, if we are on y=3, we can go to y=4 at t=9.\n\nIf we are on y=5 at t=8, but y=5 at t=8 is unsafe, collision, so we cannot be on y=5 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on y=4 or y=6 at t=8.\n\nSo the only safe rows at t=8 are y=0,1,2,3,9? y=0 and y=9 no freeway, so always safe, but y=0 is below.\n\nAt t=8, we can be on y=0,1,2,3, or y=9, but y=9 is goal, not yet.\n\ny=1,2,3 safe.\n\ny=7 and 8 unsafe at t=8.\n\nSo at t=8, we must be on y=0,1,2,3 to be safe.\n\nSince we start from y=3, and need to go up, we can be on y=3 at t=8 by doing S at t=7.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nIf we go down, to y=2 at t=8, but then we need to go up later, which takes more turns, worse.\n\nSo best to stay on y=3 at t=8.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nThus, the sequence I have seems optimal: S at t=7, then U each turn until y=9.\n\nIn the sequence: actions from t=7 to t=13.\n\nt=7: S\n\nt=8: U → y at t=9:4\n\nt=9: U → y10:5\n\nt10: U → y11:6\n\nt11: U → y12:7\n\nt12: U → y13:8\n\nt13: U → y14:9\n\nWe need to specify actions for t from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, and H minimal.\n\nHere H=7 actions.\n\nBut we can reach earlier? Suppose we go to y=7 faster.\n\nFor example, if we could be on y=7 at t=9 or something, but from y=3, to y=7, need 4 steps up.\n\nAt t=7: U → t=8 y=4, but unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt t=7: S → t=8 y=3\n\nt=8: U → t=9 y=4\n\nt=9: U → t=10 y=5\n\nt10: U → t11 y=6\n\nt11: U → t12 y=7\n\nThen to y=8 at t13, y=9 at t14.\n\nSame.\n\nPerhaps for y=7, it is safe at t=9, but we cannot reach y=7 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, where can we be?\n\nFrom start, after two actions: at t=7 action, then t=8 position.\n\nIf at t=7 U, t=8 y=4 (unsafe, not possible)\n\nIf t=7 S, t=8 y=3\n\nThen t=8 action: if U, t=9 y=4\n\nIf S, t=9 y=3\n\nIf D, t=9 y=2\n\nThen at t=9, we can be y=2,3, or4.\n\nTo reach y=7, need to go up from there.\n\nFor example, at t=9 y=4, then U at t9 to y5 at t10, etc., cannot reach y7 before t12.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=9 we are lower, it takes more turns.\n\nSo minimal is to reach y=9 at t=14 with 7 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the car positions for the rows we visit.\n\nIn the path: at t=9, on y=4: t=9, δt=2, for y=4 car: span [-47+24*2, -24+24*2]? For y=4, car is (-24,-47,right,24), so τ=-47, h=-24.\n\nAt δt=2, span [-47 +24*2, -24 +24*2] = [-47+48, -24+48] = [1,24], min=1>0, so 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=10, on y=5: same as y=4, δt=3, span [-47+72, -24+72]? -47+24*3= -47+72=25, -24+72=48, [25,48], min=25>0, safe.\n\nt=11, y=6, δt=4, span [-47+96, -24+96]= [49,72], min=49>0, safe.\n\nt=12, y=7, δt=5, as before, safe.\n\nt=13, y=8, δt=6, safe.\n\nNo collisions.\n\nNow, is there a way with 6 actions? Suppose actions at t=7 to t=12, reach y=9 at t=13.\n\nAt t=13, y=9.\n\nNow, from y=3 at t=7 to y=9 at t=13, must increase by 6 in 6 steps, so all U actions.\n\nBut then:\n\nt=7: U → t=8 y=4\n\nBut at t=8, on y=4, unsafe, collision.\n\nIf we do not all U, but some S or D, but if we do S or D, we don't progress, so at t=13, y would be less than 9 if not all U.\n\nFor example, if we do S at some point, y increases slower.\n\nSo with 6 actions, to reach y=9 at t=13, we must have exactly 6 U actions, no S or D, so y increases by 1 each turn from t=8 to t=13.\n\nt=7: y=3\n\nAfter action U at t=7: y at t=8=4\n\nAction U at t=8: y at t=9=5\n\nU at t=9: y10=6\n\nU at t10: y11=7\n\nU at t11: y12=8\n\nU at t12: y13=9\n\nBut at t=8, y=4, unsafe.\n\nAt t=9, y=5, but for y=5, at t=9, δt=2, safe, but at t=8 we have collision, so invalid.\n\nCannot avoid the collision at t=8 if we go through y=4 at t=8.\n\nSince we must pass y=4,5,6, and the only unsafe time is t=8, we must not be on any of them at t=8.\n\nTherefore, we must delay so that we are on them after t=8.\n\nThus, minimal is to start moving at t=8 to y=4 at t=9, etc., as before.\n\nHence H=7 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to output actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nt_1=7, H=7, so actions for t=7 to t=13.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t_7: S\n\nTurn t_8: U\n\nTurn t_9: U\n\nTurn t_10: U\n\nTurn t_11: U\n\nTurn t_12: U\n\nTurn t_13: U\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for y=7 and y=8, we have multiple cars, but in our path, we are on them at t=12 and t=13, which are safe.\n\nBut just to be thorough, are there any other dangerous times?\n\nFor example, y=7 unsafe at t=16,17,18, but t=12 is fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nBut the player position is vertical axis y=0 to 9, and we start at (0,3), reach (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, we never go to y=0,1,2, but they are safe anyway.\n\nSo minimal H=7.\n\nNow, output the actions.\n\nAnswer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 7: S Turn 8: U Turn 9: U Turn 10: U Turn 11: U Turn 12: U Turn 13: U }\n\nIn the format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nt_1 is 7.\n\nAnd H=7, so from t=7 to t=13.\n\nt=7 to t=13 is 7 turns.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we can write it clearly.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Hazards\n- **Rows \\(y = 1, 2, 3\\)**: The car on each row (e.g., for \\(y = 3\\), head \\(h = 60\\), tail \\(\\tau = 25\\), direction right, speed \\(s = 36\\)) has a span that never contains 0 at any time because the minimum span value is \\(25 + 36 \\delta t \\geq 25 > 0\\) for \\(\\delta t \\geq 0\\). Thus, these rows are always safe.\n- **Rows \\(y = 4, 5, 6\\)**: The car on each row (e.g., for \\(y = 4\\), head \\(h = -24\\), tail \\(\\tau = -47\\), direction right, speed \\(s = 24\\)) causes a collision only at turn \\(T = 8\\) (i.e., \\(\\delta t = 1\\)) because the span is \\([-23, 0]\\), containing 0. At other times (e.g., \\(T = 7, 9, 10, \\ldots\\)), the span does not contain 0, so these rows are safe.\n- **Rows \\(y = 7, 8\\)**: Each row has three cars. The third car (head \\(h = 4\\), tail \\(\\tau = -7\\), direction right, speed \\(s = 4\\)) causes a collision at turns \\(T = 7\\) and \\(T = 8\\) because the span contains 0. The first car (head \\(h = -36\\), tail \\(\\tau = -47\\), direction right, speed \\(s = 4\\)) causes collisions at later turns (\\(T = 16, 17, 18\\)), but these are not relevant for minimal-time paths starting at \\(T = 7\\). At turns \\(T \\neq 7, 8, 16, 17, 18\\), the rows are safe. For the minimal path considered, \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are safe at \\(T \\geq 9\\).\n\n### Path Planning\n- The player starts at turn \\(T = 7\\) on \\(y = 3\\), which is safe.\n- To minimize \\(H\\), the player should ascend to \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible, but must avoid being on \\(y = 4, 5, 6\\) at \\(T = 8\\) and on \\(y = 7, 8\\) at \\(T = 7\\) or \\(T = 8\\).\n- At \\(T = 8\\), the only safe rows are \\(y = 0, 1, 2, 3\\) (since \\(y = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\) are unsafe). Staying on \\(y = 3\\) at \\(T = 8\\) is optimal.\n- From \\(y = 3\\) at \\(T = 8\\), the player can ascend to \\(y = 4\\) at \\(T = 9\\) (safe, as \\(y = 4\\) is unsafe only at \\(T = 8\\)).\n- Continuing upward each turn:\n  - \\(T = 9\\): \\(y = 4\\) → safe\n  - \\(T = 10\\): \\(y = 5\\) → safe\n  - \\(T = 11\\): \\(y = 6\\) → safe\n  - \\(T = 12\\): \\(y = 7\\) → safe (not \\(T = 7\\) or \\(8\\))\n  - \\(T = 13\\): \\(y = 8\\) → safe (not \\(T = 7\\) or \\(8\\))\n  - \\(T = 14\\): \\(y = 9\\) → goal reached.\n- This path requires 7 actions (turns \\(T = 7\\) to \\(T = 13\\)) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at \\(T = 14\\).\n\n### Minimal \\(H\\) and Action Sequence\n- Minimal \\(H = 7\\) turns.\n- Action sequence:\n  - Turn 7: Stay (S) to remain on safe \\(y = 3\\) at \\(T = 8\\).\n  - Turns 8 to 13: Up (U) each turn to ascend directly to \\(y = 9\\) by \\(T = 14\\), avoiding all hazards.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- Turn 7: S\n- Turn 8: U\n- Turn 9: U\n- Turn 10: U\n- Turn 11: U\n- Turn 12: U\n- Turn 13: U\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 7: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. The vertical axis goes from 0 to 9, and freeways are from y=1 to y=8. I start at y=3, so I need to move up to y=9.\n\nThe player moves based on actions: U for up (increase y by 1), D for down (decrease y by 1), or S for stay (y doesn't change). But y must stay between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway y=1 to y=8, and they move left or right with a certain speed. Collision happens only if at some turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span is the position range it occupies.\n\nThe key point is that when I move, at turn T, I'm on y_T, and I decide an action that changes y for the next turn. But for collision, it's checked at each turn based on where I am at that turn.\n\nThe note says: if I move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, I'm not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I only care about cars on y_T at turn T for collision at T.\n\nAlso, collision occurs only if 0 is in the car's span at that exact turn.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to know when a car is at position 0, because that's where I cross the road horizontally, I think. Since I'm at (0, y), so when y is the freeway level, and x=0 is covered by a car, I collide.\n\nThe player is at (0, y_t) at turn t, so for each turn, I have a y position, and I need that for the freeway at that y (if y between 1 and 8), there is no car whose span includes 0 at that turn.\n\nFor y=0 and y=9, there are no cars, since cars are only on freeways y=1 to 8. So at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible, which makes sense.\n\nI start at y=3, which is a freeway, so I need to check if at turn t1=8, on freeway 3, is there a car at position 0?\n\nSimilarly for other positions I might be at.\n\nt1=8 is the current turn, and I need to find actions starting from t1.\n\nFirst, let's list the car states at turn t1=8.\n\nFor each freeway, we have cars defined with head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nDirection: right or left. In the span, for left-moving, head is the left end? Let's see the update.\n\nFor left-moving car: at turn t1, span is [h, τ], and at turn T, it becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, decreasing position, so if h and τ are positions, with h > τ I assume for left-moving? Let's see.\n\nIn the example, for freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\n-48 and -83, with direction right. But for right-moving, it says: [τ, h] for span at t1? No.\n\nLook back:\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIt says for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head? And since it's moving right, positions increase.\n\nIn the notation, for right-moving, at t1, span is [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end, I think, and both increase with time.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)], so h is the right end, τ is the left end, decreasing.\n\nBut in the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nWhat is head and tail?\n\nIn the freeway 1: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, head should be the front, which is the right end, tail is left end.\n\nIn the span definition for right-moving, it's [τ, h], with τ tail, h head, so τ ≤ h, and positions increase.\n\nHere, tail = -83, head = -48, so τ = -83, h = -48, so span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-83, -48], since moving right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, τ] with h > τ, decreasing.\n\nBut in this case, all directions are right, I think.\n\nLet's list all:\n\nFreeway 1: cars: (-48, -83, right, 36) — only one car? It says \"Cars\", but for freeway 1, it's one entry: (-48, -83, right, 36), similarly for 2 and 3.\n\nFor 7 and 8, multiple cars: e.g., freeway 7: (-32,-43,right,4), (44,33,right,4), (8,-3,right,4)\n\n(44,33,right,4) — 44 and 33, but if tail and head, for right-moving, tail should be less than head? 33 to 44, yes tail=33, head=44.\n\nSimilarly, (8,-3,right,4): tail=-3, head=8.\n\nAnd (-32,-43,right,4): tail=-43, head=-32.\n\nNow for freeway 4,5,6: (0,-23,right,24)\n\nSo tail=-23, head=0.\n\nAt turn t1=8.\n\nI need to find for each freeway, when a car is at position 0.\n\nCollision if at some turn T, for freeway y_T, there is a car with 0 in its span at T.\n\nSince the player is at (0, y_T) at turn T.\n\nNow, for a given freeway, the span of a car at time T is:\n\nLet t1 = 8.\n\nFor a car with initial (at t1) tail, head, dir, speed.\n\nIf dir = right, span at T is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSince [τ, h] at t1, so at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] where ΔT = T - t1\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nBut all cars here are right-moving, so only right case.\n\n0 is in span if min(τ + sΔT, h + sΔT) ≤ 0 ≤ max(τ + sΔT, h + sΔT)\n\nSince for right-moving, τ ≤ h, so τ + sΔT ≤ h + sΔT, so 0 in span iff τ + sΔT ≤ 0 ≤ h + sΔT\n\nSimilarly for left, but no left here.\n\nSo for each car, we can find when 0 is covered.\n\nSpecifically, for a car, at time T, 0 in span iff τ + sΔT ≤ 0 ≤ h + sΔT with ΔT = T - t1\n\nSince t1=8, ΔT = T - 8\n\nT is the turn number, starting from t1=8.\n\nNow, for freeway y, we have multiple cars, so we need to know for each y, at which T there is a car covering 0.\n\nBut since we care about when we are on that y, we need for each possible y and T, whether it is occupied.\n\nFirst, let's list all freeways and their cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: tail τ = -83, head h = -48, s=36, dir=right\n\nAt time T, span [ -83 + 36(ΔT), -48 + 36(ΔT) ] with ΔT = T-8\n\n0 in span if -83 + 36(ΔT) ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 36(ΔT)\n\nWhich is 36(ΔT) ≤ 48 and 36(ΔT) ≥ 83? Let's solve.\n\n-83 + 36ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 36ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -83 + 36ΔT ≤ 0 => 36ΔT ≤ 83 => ΔT ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so ΔT ≤ 2 since integer? ΔT is integer, turns are discrete.\n\nT and ΔT are integers, since turns are discrete.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 ≤ -48 + 36ΔT => 48 ≤ 36ΔT => 36ΔT ≥ 48 => ΔT ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so ΔT ≥ 2\n\nThus, for ΔT=2, both: ΔT ≥ 2 and ΔT ≤ 2.305, so ΔT=2\n\nΔT ≥ 2 from second, and ΔT ≤ 2 from first? First: ΔT ≤ 83/36≈2.305, so ΔT≤2 since integer? 2.305, so ΔT=0,1,2 possible? No.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom -83 + 36ΔT ≤ 0: 36ΔT ≤ 83, ΔT ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so since ΔT integer, ΔT ≤ 2\n\nFrom 0 ≤ -48 + 36ΔT: 36ΔT ≥ 48, ΔT ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so ΔT ≥ 2\n\nThus only ΔT=2\n\nSo at ΔT=2, T = t1 + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10\n\nAt T=10, on freeway 1, this car covers 0.\n\nFor other ΔT, no.\n\nΔT=0: -83 +0 = -83 ≤0, but 0 ≤ -48? 0 <= -48 false, so not.\n\nΔT=1: -83+36= -47 ≤0 true, 0<= -48+36= -12? 0<= -12 false.\n\nΔT=2: -83+72= -11 ≤0 true, 0<= -48+72=24 true, so yes.\n\nΔT=3: -83+108=25 ≤0? 25<=0 false, so no.\n\nSo only at T=10, freeway 1 has a car at 0.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-48,-83,right,36) identical, so same, only at T=10, car at 0.\n\nFreeway 3: same, (-48,-83,right,36), so only T=10.\n\nNow freeway 4: (0,-23,right,24)\n\nτ = -23, h = 0, s=24\n\nAt T, span [ -23 + 24ΔT, 0 + 24ΔT ] = [ -23 + 24ΔT, 24ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if min ≤0≤ max, but min is -23+24ΔT, max=24ΔT\n\nSince τ <= h, -23+24ΔT <= 24ΔT always.\n\n0 in span if -23+24ΔT <= 0 <= 24ΔT\n\nFirst: -23+24ΔT <=0 => 24ΔT <=23 => ΔT <= 23/24 <1, so ΔT <=0 since integer? ΔT integer, 23/24<1, so ΔT <=0\n\nBut ΔT = T-8, T>=8, so ΔT >=0\n\nSecond: 0 <= 24ΔT always true for ΔT >=0? 0 <= 24ΔT, for ΔT=0, 0<=0 true, but first part.\n\n-23+24ΔT <=0 <= 24ΔT\n\nFor ΔT=0: -23 +0 = -23 <=0 true, and 0 <= 0 true, so yes.\n\nFor ΔT=1: -23+24=1 <=0? 1<=0 false, so no.\n\nSo only at ΔT=0, T=8, on freeway 4, car at 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as 4, (0,-23,right,24), so at T=8, car at 0.\n\nFreeway 6: same, at T=8.\n\nNow freeway 7: multiple cars.\n\nFirst car: (-32,-43,right,4) so τ=-43, h=-32, s=4\n\nAt T, span [ -43 +4ΔT, -32 +4ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -43+4ΔT <=0 <= -32+4ΔT\n\nFirst: -43+4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=43 => ΔT <= 43/4=10.75, so ΔT <=10\n\nSecond: 0 <= -32+4ΔT => 4ΔT >=32 => ΔT >=8\n\nSo for ΔT=8,9,10\n\nT= t1 + ΔT =8 +8=16, 17,18\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: (44,33,right,4) τ=33, h=44, s=4\n\nSpan at T: [33+4ΔT, 44+4ΔT]\n\n0 in span: 33+4ΔT <=0 <=44+4ΔT? But 33+4ΔT >=33>0 for ΔT>=0, so min is at least 33, which is >0, so 0 not <= min, so never covered, since positions positive.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (8,-3,right,4) τ=-3, h=8, s=4\n\nSpan at T: [ -3 +4ΔT, 8 +4ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -3+4ΔT <=0 <= 8+4ΔT\n\nFirst: -3+4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=3 => ΔT <= 3/4=0.75, so ΔT <=0\n\nSecond: 0 <= 8+4ΔT always true for ΔT>=0\n\nSo for ΔT=0, -3+0 <=0? -3<=0 true, 0<=8 true, so at T=8, covered.\n\nNow freeway 8: same cars as freeway 7? Let's see.\n\nFreeway 8: (-32,-43,right,4), (44,33,right,4), (8,-3,right,4) same as freeway 7.\n\nSo identical to freeway 7.\n\nSo for freeway 7 and 8:\n\n- At T=8: car (8,-3,right,4) covers 0? For freeway 7, at T=8, car with τ=-3, h=8, so span [-3,8] at ΔT=0, so -3<=0<=8, yes.\n\nSimilarly, car (-32,-43) at T=8: [-43,-32], min -43, max -32, both negative, 0 not in between.\n\nCar (44,33) at [33,44], 0 not.\n\nSo only the (8,-3) car at T=8 covers 0 for freeway 7.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8 at T=8.\n\nAlso, for the first car, at later times, but for now at T=8.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, at which turns position 0 is occupied (i.e., some car covers it).\n\ny=1: occupied at T=10 only\n\ny=2: occupied at T=10 only (same as y=1)\n\ny=3: occupied at T=10 only\n\ny=4: occupied at T=8 only (from car (0,-23))\n\ny=5: occupied at T=8 only\n\ny=6: occupied at T=8 only\n\ny=7: occupied at T=8 (from car (8,-3)) and also at T=16,17,18? From first car (-32,-43), but at T=16,17,18\n\ny=8: same as y=7, occupied at T=8 and T=16,17,18\n\nFor y=7 and 8, at T=8: occupied\n\nAlso, for the car (-32,-43,right,4): at ΔT=8, T=16, span [-43+4*8, -32+4*8] = [-43+32, -32+32] = [-11,0]\n\n-11 <=0<=0? 0<=0 true, so yes, covered.\n\nAt ΔT=9, T=17: [-43+36, -32+36] = [-7,4], -7<=0<=4 true.\n\nΔT=10, T=18: [-43+40, -32+40] = [-3,8], -3<=0<=8 true.\n\nThen ΔT=11, [-43+44, -32+44]= [1,12], 1<=0? false, not.\n\nSo y=7 occupied at T=8,16,17,18\n\nSimilarly y=8 same.\n\nNow, back to the player.\n\nI start at turn t1=8, position y=3.\n\nAt turn T=8, I am on y=3.\n\nNow, for y=3, is it occupied at T=8? From above, y=3 is occupied only at T=10, not at T=8. At T=8, y=3 is free? Let's check.\n\ny=3: freeway 3, car (-48,-83,right,36), at ΔT=0, T=8, span [-83,-48], both negative, 0 not in, so not occupied at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, y=4,5,6 occupied at T=8, but I am at y=3 now.\n\nAt turn T=8, I am at y=3, and for freeway 3, at T=8, no car at 0, so no collision.\n\nI need to move to y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so once I reach y=9, I'm safe.\n\nBut I need to be at y=9 at some turn, and stay or something, but the goal is to reach (0,9), so as soon as I am at y=9, I'm done, I think.\n\nThe position is (0,y_t), and I need y_{t1+H-1} =9 for some H.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the current? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, where t is offset from t1.\n\nDefine: at time t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAt t=0, time t1, position (0,y_{t1})\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, we move to y_{t1+1} at time t1+1, and so on, up to at time t1 + H -1, we have position after action, so y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1 + H-1, I think.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t1: a_{t1}, Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, ..., up to Turn t1 + H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAnd after H actions, at time t1+H, position y_{t1+H}, but we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9? Let's clarify.\n\nThe player update: at turn t, position y_t, after action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at the start of turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, we move to y_{t+1} at the start of turn t+1.\n\nWe need to have at some turn, y_t =9 for t >= t1.\n\nSpecifically, we need to find minimal H such that for some sequence, y_{t1 + H} =9? No.\n\nThe position at turn t1 + t for t=0,1,2,...\n\nAt t=0, time t1, y_{t1}\n\nAfter first action, at time t1+1, y_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H} =9 for some H, but the turn when we reach 9 is t1 + H.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from t1 to t1 + H -1, since last action a_{t1+H-1} leads to y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nNumber of actions is H, from turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAnd at time t1+H, we are at y=9.\n\nNow, collision is checked at each turn when we are at y between 1 and 8.\n\nSpecifically, at each turn T from t1 onwards, when we are at y_T, if 1<= y_T <=8, we need that for freeway y_T, at turn T, no car covers position 0.\n\nIf y_T=0 or 9, no collision.\n\nI start at T=8, y=3.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nThe minimal number of moves: since I start at y=3, to y=9, I need to increase y by 6, so at least 6 moves up, but I might need to stay or go down to avoid collisions, but going down might not help since I need to go up.\n\nBut I can stay to wait for cars to pass.\n\nMinimal H is at least 6, if I go up every time.\n\nBut I need to avoid collisions at each step.\n\nLet me denote the turns starting from T=8.\n\nAt T=8, I am at y=3.\n\nNow, y=3 at T=8: from above, not occupied, so safe.\n\nI can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go up, to y=4 at T=9.\n\nIf down, to y=2 at T=9.\n\nIf stay, still y=3 at T=9.\n\nI need to reach y=9 asap.\n\nFirst, try to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut I need to check when each freeway is occupied.\n\nList for each freeway y, the turns when it is occupied, i.e., when 0 is covered by a car on that y.\n\ny=1: occupied only at T=10\n\ny=2: occupied only at T=10\n\ny=3: occupied only at T=10\n\ny=4: occupied only at T=8\n\ny=5: occupied only at T=8\n\ny=6: occupied only at T=8\n\ny=7: occupied at T=8,16,17,18\n\ny=8: occupied at T=8,16,17,18\n\nT=8 is current turn.\n\nNow, at T=8, I am at y=3, which is not occupied, so safe.\n\nIf I go up at T=8, action U, then at T=9, I will be at y=4.\n\nNow, at T=9, y=4: is it occupied?\n\ny=4 occupied only at T=8, not at T=9, so should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=5 at T=10, etc.\n\nPlan a path.\n\nI need to be at y positions at each turn.\n\nStart: T=8, y=3\n\nAfter action a8, to y9 at T=9\n\na9 to y10 at T=10, and so on.\n\nI want to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nSuppose I go up every turn.\n\nThen:\n\nAt T=8: y=3, safe\n\na8=U, so y9=4 at T=9\n\nAt T=9: y=4, is it occupied? y=4 occupied only at T=8, not T=9, so safe.\n\na9=U, y10=5 at T=10\n\nAt T=10: y=5, is occupied? y=5 occupied only at T=8, not T=10, so safe.\n\na10=U, y11=6 at T=11\n\nAt T=11: y=6, occupied? Only at T=8, not T=11, safe.\n\na11=U, y12=7 at T=12\n\nAt T=12: y=7, occupied? y=7 occupied at T=8,16,17,18. Not at T=12, so safe.\n\na12=U, y13=8 at T=13\n\nAt T=13: y=8, occupied? y=8 occupied at T=8,16,17,18. Not at T=13, safe.\n\na13=U, y14=9 at T=14\n\nAt T=14: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nSo in 6 moves, I reach y=9 at T=14.\n\nActions: from T=8 to T=13: U each time.\n\nSequence: a8=U, a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=U\n\nThen at T=14, y=9.\n\nH=6 actions.\n\nBut is there a problem at T=10?\n\nAt T=10, I was at y=5, which is not occupied.\n\nBut y=1,2,3 are occupied at T=10, but I am not on them at that time.\n\nAt T=10, I am at y=5, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut can I do better? For example, reach earlier.\n\nBut I start at y=3, need to go to y=9, difference 6, so minimum 6 moves if all up.\n\nIs there a way with 5 moves? That would require going down or something, but going down would make it longer, not shorter. Since I need to increase by 6, each U increases by 1, S or D don't help to increase, so minimum 6 U actions, and no S or D, so H=6 is minimal.\n\nBut I need to avoid collisions, which in this case I did.\n\nIn the above, at T=10, y=1,2,3 are occupied, but I am at y=5, not on them.\n\nBut is there any turn where I might be on a occupied freeway?\n\nIn this path: T=8: y=3 safe\n\nT=9: y=4 safe\n\nT=10: y=5 safe\n\nT=11: y=6 safe\n\nT=12: y=7 safe (since occupied at 8,16,17,18, not 12)\n\nT=13: y=8 safe (not occupied)\n\nT=14: y=9 safe\n\nAll good.\n\nBut let me confirm the occupation times.\n\ny=7 occupied at T=8,16,17,18.\n\nT=12 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8.\n\nSo H=6 seems possible.\n\nBut the problem is to find minimal H, and sequence.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? With H=5, I would need to reach y=9 at T=13, meaning y_{t1 + H} =9 with H=5 actions? Let's see.\n\nActions from t1=8 to t1+4=12? Actions a8 to a12, then at T=13, y13=9.\n\nNow, y13=9, so before that, at T=12, I must be at y=8 or something.\n\nIf I start at T=8 y=3.\n\nAfter 5 actions, at T=13, y=9.\n\nSo I need to increase by 6 in 5 steps, which requires net +6 in 5 moves, but each U is +1, S=0, D=-1, so to have net +6, I need at least 6 U, so with 5 actions, maximum I can increase is 5, to y=8, not to y=9.\n\nImpossible to reach y=9 in 5 actions from y=3.\n\nWith actions: after k actions, y_{t1+k} = y_{t1} + sum of Δy for t from t1 to t1+k-1.\n\nAt time t1, y_t1.\n\nAfter action a_t1, y_{t1+1} = y_t1 + Δy_t1\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t1+H-1}, y_{t1+H} = y_t1 + sum_{i=0}^{H-1} Δy_{t1+i}\n\nSet this to 9.\n\ny_t1=3, so sum_{i=0}^{H-1} Δy_{t1+i} = 6\n\nEach Δy is -1,0, or +1.\n\nSo to have sum=6, I need at least 6 steps where Δy=+1, and no negative, so minimal H=6 with all U.\n\nIf I have S, H larger, if D, even larger.\n\nSo minimal H is 6, with all U actions.\n\nAnd in this case, as above, no collisions.\n\nBut in the sequence above, I used 6 actions: a8 to a13, all U, to reach y14=9.\n\nIn terms of turn: actions at t=8,9,10,11,12,13, and at t=14, y=9.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=8 to t=13, H=6.\n\nAnswer should be Turn t1: a_t1, etc.\n\nt1=8.\n\nBut in the car states, for y=7 and y=8, there are cars at later times, but not affecting this path.\n\nBut I think I missed something.\n\nAt T=8, when I am at y=3, it is safe.\n\nBut for freeway 3, it is occupied at T=10, but at T=10 I am at y=5, not y=3.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, y=4,5,6 are occupied, but at T=8, I am not on them, I am on y=3.\n\nIn my action, I go to y=4 at T=9, when y=4 is not occupied.\n\ny=4 occupied only at T=8, not at T=9.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let me double-check for y=7 at T=12.\n\ny=7 at T=12: freeway 7, occupied at T=8,16,17,18. T=12 not in, so no car at 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I can consider if I stay or something, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo minimal H=6.\n\nBut the car on freeway 7 and 8 have cars at T=16,17,18, but since I reach before, no issue.\n\nIn the beginning, for freeway 4,5,6 at T=8, but I am not on them.\n\nAnother thing: at T=8, when I start, I am at y=3, and for freeway 3, at T=8, not occupied.\n\nBut for the cars on freeway 7 and 8, at T=8, there is a car covering 0, but I am not on y=7 or 8 at T=8.\n\nSo all fine.\n\nPerhaps I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut let me see if I can start with S or something, but that would delay.\n\nNo need.\n\nSo sequence: from turn 8 to turn 13, all U.\n\nBut turn 13 action leads to y=9 at turn 14.\n\nNow, in the answer format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  // which is U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}  // U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + 5: a_{t_1 + 5}  // since H=6, actions from t=0 to 5 offset.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so for H=6, t=0 to 5.\n\nTurn t1 + t for t=0 to 5.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 14, y=9.\n\nNow, but in the car list, for freeway 7 and 8, there is a car at T=8 covering 0, but only for that freeway.\n\nBut I am not on it.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm if at any point I might be on a freeway when occupied.\n\nIn this path, no.\n\nBut let me see the freeway 7 cars: at T=8, car (8,-3,right,4) covers 0, but I am at y=3 at T=8.\n\nAt T=12, I am at y=7, but y=7 not occupied at T=12.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut for y=8 at T=13, not occupied.\n\nAnother thing: the note about moving.\n\nFor example, when I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at that turn T, I am on y, and I am not considered on y+1 until turn T+1.\n\nBut in collision, at turn T, I am on y_T, and we check cars on that freeway.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps for y=10, but y=10 not exist, y max 9.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach earlier with different actions, but impossible as per sum.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster, but no.\n\nAnother thought: since y=9 is safe, I can go directly, but in 6 steps.\n\nBut in the sequence above, I used 6 actions.\n\nBut let me list the turns:\n\nTurn 8: at y=3, action U, go to y=4 at turn 9.\n\nTurn 9: at y=4, action U, go to y=5 at turn 10.\n\nTurn 10: at y=5, action U, go to y=6 at turn 11.\n\nTurn 11: at y=6, action U, go to y=7 at turn 12.\n\nTurn 12: at y=7, action U, go to y=8 at turn 13.\n\nTurn 13: at y=8, action U, go to y=9 at turn 14.\n\nAt each of these turns, when I am at y, it is not occupied at that turn.\n\ny=3 at T=8: not occ\n\ny=4 at T=9: occ only at T=8, not T=9\n\ny=5 at T=10: occ only at T=8, not T=10\n\ny=6 at T=11: occ only at T=8, not T=11\n\ny=7 at T=12: occ at T=8,16,17,18, not 12\n\ny=8 at T=13: occ at T=8,16,17,18, not 13\n\nAll safe.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=6 with all U actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", but H is the number of actions, I think.\n\nIn the task: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nAnd \"turns\" might refer to the actions or the time.\n\nIn the sequence, it says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so H is number of actions.\n\nAnd after H actions, at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1+H}.\n\nIn this case, at turn 14, y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is safe immediately, no issue.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose I reach y=9 earlier, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 at turn 13, but to be at y=9 at turn 13, I need to be at y=8 at turn 12, and action U at turn 12.\n\nBut from start, at turn 8 y=3, to turn 13 y=9, that is 5 turns later, but 5 actions: actions at turn 8,9,10,11,12.\n\nThen y_{t1 + H} = y_{8+H} =9.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t1+H.\n\ny_{t1} at time t1.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t1+H.\n\nSet y_{t1+H} =9.\n\ny_{t1} =3, so need to increase by 6 in H steps.\n\nEach action changes y by at most +1, so H >=6.\n\nEquality when all U.\n\nSo minimal H=6.\n\nThus the sequence is as above.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to write it.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 7 and 8 with multiple cars.\n\nFor example, at T=8, on freeway 7, car (8,-3) covers 0, but I am not there.\n\nSimilarly, later times not relevant.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I stay at some point, but no need.\n\nAnother thing: for freeway 3, it is occupied at T=10.\n\nIn my path, at T=10, I am at y=5, not y=3.\n\nBut if I were to be at y=3 at T=10, I would collide, but I am not.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6, with actions all U.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + 5: a_{t_1 + 5} = U\n\nSince t1=8, so:\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nIn the sequence, it should be from t=0 to t=5, so turns 8 to 13.\n\nH=6.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me write it.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm the initial position.\n\nAt turn t1=8, position (0,3), so I am on freeway 3 at turn 8.\n\nAs above, not occupied.\n\nNow, I think that's the answer.\n\nBut the problem has cars on freeway 7 and 8 with different speeds, but in this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can do with less by going down, but that would require more steps.\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=2, but y=2 is occupied at T=10, so I need to avoid that.\n\nBut in direct path, I don't need to.\n\nSuppose at T=10, I am at y=2, it would collide, but I am not.\n\nSo I think fine.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 6.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player must increase their \\(y\\)-coordinate from 3 to 9, a net change of +6. Each \"U\" action increases \\(y\\) by 1, so at least 6 \"U\" actions are required. With fewer than 6 actions, it is impossible to reach \\(y = 9\\). Thus, the minimal \\(H\\) is 6.\n- The collision condition is checked at each turn \\(T\\) based on the player's \\(y_T\\):\n  - If \\(1 \\leq y_T \\leq 8\\), collision occurs if position 0 is within the span of any car on freeway \\(y_T\\) at turn \\(T\\).\n  - Positions \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) have no cars and are safe.\n- Car spans and occupancy at position 0 for each freeway and turn are derived from the initial state at \\(t_1 = 8\\):\n  - **Freeway 1**: Occupied only at \\(T = 10\\).\n  - **Freeway 2**: Occupied only at \\(T = 10\\).\n  - **Freeway 3**: Occupied only at \\(T = 10\\).\n  - **Freeway 4**: Occupied only at \\(T = 8\\).\n  - **Freeway 5**: Occupied only at \\(T = 8\\).\n  - **Freeway 6**: Occupied only at \\(T = 8\\).\n  - **Freeway 7**: Occupied at \\(T = 8, 16, 17, 18\\).\n  - **Freeway 8**: Occupied at \\(T = 8, 16, 17, 18\\).\n\n### Path to Minimize \\(H\\):\n- With \\(H = 6\\), the player can move directly upward (\"U\") at every turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 14.\n- Turn-by-turn path:\n  - **Turn 8 (\\(y = 3\\))**: Freeway 3 is not occupied at \\(T = 8\\) (occupied only at \\(T = 10\\)), so no collision. Action: U → \\(y = 4\\) at turn 9.\n  - **Turn 9 (\\(y = 4\\))**: Freeway 4 is not occupied at \\(T = 9\\) (occupied only at \\(T = 8\\)), so no collision. Action: U → \\(y = 5\\) at turn 10.\n  - **Turn 10 (\\(y = 5\\))**: Freeway 5 is not occupied at \\(T = 10\\) (occupied only at \\(T = 8\\)), so no collision. Action: U → \\(y = 6\\) at turn 11.\n  - **Turn 11 (\\(y = 6\\))**: Freeway 6 is not occupied at \\(T = 11\\) (occupied only at \\(T = 8\\)), so no collision. Action: U → \\(y = 7\\) at turn 12.\n  - **Turn 12 (\\(y = 7\\))**: Freeway 7 is not occupied at \\(T = 12\\) (occupied at \\(T = 8, 16, 17, 18\\), not \\(T = 12\\)), so no collision. Action: U → \\(y = 8\\) at turn 13.\n  - **Turn 13 (\\(y = 8\\))**: Freeway 8 is not occupied at \\(T = 13\\) (occupied at \\(T = 8, 16, 17, 18\\), not \\(T = 13\\)), so no collision. Action: U → \\(y = 9\\) at turn 14.\n- At turn 14, \\(y = 9\\), which is safe (no cars).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H = 6\\) turns, the minimum possible, with no collisions.\n\n### Sequence of Actions:\nThe actions are for turns \\(t_1 + t\\) where \\(t = 0\\) to \\(H-1 = 5\\), so turns 8 to 13.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U\n}",

The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the span of that car at that turn. The span moves based on the car's direction and speed.\n\nImportant note: if the player moves to a different y at turn T, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, they are on y_T, and if they move, at T+1 they are on y_{T+1}. So for collision, at turn T, we only care about cars on freeway y_T at that exact turn.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars there. y=0 and y=9 are safe, but we start at y=4 and need to get to y=9.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements for each freeway at future turns relative to t_1=9.\n\nLet τ = T - t_1 = T - 9, so τ is the number of turns after the current turn.\n\nFor a car, at time T, span is based on initial at t_1 and speed.\n\nLet me list all cars for each freeway with their positions at t_1=9.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head -12, tail -47, right, speed 36. Since it's right-moving, span at t_1: [τ, h] but the notation says for right: [τ, h] at t_1, and then at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] where Δt = T - t_1\n\nRight-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-12, -47, right, 36)\n\nI think the first number is head, second is tail? But for right-moving, it says head and tail, but in the span, it's [τ, h] for right, meaning tail to head, since it moves right.\n\nLet's clarify the notation.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for direction, left or right.\n\nThen for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] which is from head to tail? But [h, τ] might not be ordered, since h and τ could be such that h > τ or h < τ.\n\nIn the example, for freeway 1: head -12, tail -47, right direction.\n\nSince it's right-moving, tail should be less than head, I assume.\n\n-47 < -12, so tail at -47, head at -12, so at t_1, the car is from x= -47 to x= -12, I think? But the span is given as [τ, h] for right, which would be [-47, -12], so positions from -47 to -12 inclusive? But the collision is if 0 is in the span, so at t_1, for freeway 1, span [-47, -12], 0 is not between -47 and -12, since both negative, so no collision at t_1.\n\nSimilarly, for movement.\n\nGeneral: for a car, at time T, the span is:\n\nIf left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nIf right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nAnd collision if player is on that freeway at turn T and 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on that freeway.\n\nNow for freeway 1 at t_1: head h = -12, tail τ = -47, direction right, speed s=36.\n\nAt time T, Δt = T - 9, Span(T) = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-47 + 36 Δt, -12 + 36 Δt]\n\n0 ∈ Span(T) if -47 + 36 Δt <= 0 <= -12 + 36 Δt\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI need for each freeway and each possible turn, whether there is a car covering x=0 at that time.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, the x-position is always 0, so we care only when 0 is in the span for a car on the player's current y.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=4 at t=9.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so once there, no collision, but we need to reach it.\n\nThe freeways with cars are y=1 to 8, but not all have cars at all times.\n\nList each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car, right, s=36, h=-12, τ=-47 at t_1=9.\n\nSpan at T: [ -47 + 36 Δt, -12 + 36 Δt ] with Δt = T-9\n\n0 in span: -47 + 36 Δt <= 0 <= -12 + 36 Δt\n\nWhich is:\n\n-47 + 36 Δt <= 0 => 36 Δt <= 47 => Δt <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305, so Δt <=1 since integer\n\n0 <= -12 + 36 Δt => 12 <= 36 Δt => Δt >= 12/36 = 1/3, so Δt >=1\n\nThus for Δt=1, 0 in span? Let's check:\n\nAt Δt=1, lower bound: -47 + 36 = -11\n\nUpper bound: -12 + 36 = 24\n\nSo span [-11, 24], 0 is between -11 and 24, yes, so at T=10, freeway 1 has a car covering x=0.\n\nAt Δt=0, T=9, span [-47,-12], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=2: lower -47+72=25, upper -12+72=60, [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=10 (Δt=1), freeway 1 has collision at x=0.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1? \"2 | (-12, -47, right, 36)\" same as freeway 1.\n\nSo identical, so only at T=10, collision on y=2.\n\nFreeway 2: cars same, so same as above, only collision at T=10.\n\nNow freeway 3: also \"3 | (-12, -47, right, 36)\" same as 1 and 2.\n\nSo all freeways 1,2,3 have collision only at T=10.\n\nNow freeway 4: \"(24, 1, right, 24)\"\n\nhead=24, tail=1, right, s=24.\n\nAt t_1=9, span [τ, h] = [1,24] since right-moving.\n\nSpan(T) = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [1 + 24 Δt, 24 + 24 Δt]\n\n0 ∈ span if 1 + 24 Δt <= 0 <= 24 + 24 Δt\n\nBut 1 + 24 Δt <=0? Since Δt >=0, 1 + 24 Δt >=1 >0, so never <=0, so 0 never in span. Because the car is at positive x, moving right, so always to the right, x>0, so 0 never covered.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5 and 6: same as 4, \"(24, 1, right, 24)\" for both, so no collision ever on y=4,5,6.\n\nFreeway 4,5,6 all have cars but at x>0 moving right, so no issue.\n\nNow freeway 7: multiple cars: \"(-28, -39, right, 4), (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4)\"\n\nThree cars, all right-moving, speed 4.\n\nFirst car: head=-28, tail=-39, right, s=4.\n\nAt t_1, span [τ, h] = [-39, -28]\n\nSpan(T) = [-39 + 4 Δt, -28 + 4 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -39 + 4 Δt <= 0 <= -28 + 4 Δt\n\nWhich is:\n\n-39 + 4 Δt <= 0 => 4 Δt <= 39 => Δt <= 39/4 = 9.75, so Δt <=9\n\n0 <= -28 + 4 Δt => 28 <= 4 Δt => Δt >= 7\n\nSo for Δt from 7 to 9 inclusive, 0 in span.\n\nSecond car: (48, 37, right, 4) head=48, tail=37, span at t_1 [37,48]\n\nSpan(T) = [37 + 4 Δt, 48 + 4 Δt]\n\n0 in span? 37 + 4 Δt <=0 <=48 + 4 Δt? Left part 37 +4Δt >=37>0, so never <=0, so no.\n\nThird car: (12, 1, right, 4) head=12, tail=1, span [1,12] at t_1\n\nSpan(T) = [1 + 4 Δt, 12 + 4 Δt]\n\n1 + 4 Δt <=0? >=1>0, no, so never.\n\nSo for freeway 7, only the first car can cover x=0, when Δt=7,8,9.\n\nThat is, at T=9+7=16, T=17, T=18.\n\nΔt=7: T=16, span lower: -39 +4*7= -39+28= -11, upper: -28+28=0? -28 + 28=0, so [ -11, 0 ], 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=8: -39+32= -7, -28+32=4, [ -7,4], 0 in.\n\nΔt=9: -39+36= -3, -28+36=8, [ -3,8], 0 in.\n\nNow freeway 8: same as freeway 7? \"8 | (-28, -39, right, 4), (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4)\" identical to freeway 7.\n\nSo same, collision at T=16,17,18 on y=8.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, when collision at x=0:\n\n- y=1: collision only at T=10\n\n- y=2: collision only at T=10\n\n- y=3: collision only at T=10\n\n- y=4: no collision ever\n\n- y=5: no collision ever\n\n- y=6: no collision ever\n\n- y=7: collision at T=16,17,18\n\n- y=8: collision at T=16,17,18\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nPlayer starts at y=4 at t=9.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nPossible actions: U (up), D (down), S (stay).\n\ny from 0 to 9, so from y=4, can go to 5,4, or 3.\n\nBut we need to go up to 9, so probably up is better, but need to avoid collisions at certain times.\n\nFirst, the minimal number of turns: since we need to go from y=4 to y=9, that's 5 steps up, so at least 5 turns if we go up every time, but we might need to wait or go down if necessary to avoid collisions.\n\nBut going down might not help since we need to go up eventually.\n\nAlso, we can stay in place.\n\nNow, the dangerous times are when we are on y=1,2,3 at T=10, or on y=7 or 8 at T=16,17,18.\n\nBut since we start at t=9, and need to reach y=9.\n\nFirst, let's consider going straight up.\n\nIf we do U at every turn starting from t=9.\n\nAt t=9: y=4, position (0,4). y=4 has no cars, so safe.\n\nAction a9: U, so y10 = 5.\n\nAt t=10: y=5, position (0,5). y=5 has no cars (since freeway 5, no collision ever), so safe.\n\nBut at t=10, on which y? At turn t=10, player is on y_{10} =5.\n\ny=5 is freeway, but no cars ever, so safe.\n\nThen action a10: U, y11=6.\n\nt=11: y=6, no cars, safe.\n\na11: U, y12=7.\n\nt=12: y=7, position (0,7). Now, freeway 7 has cars, but at t=12, what is the car position?\n\nt=12, Δt =12-9=3.\n\nFor freeway 7, first car: span at T: [-39 +4*3, -28+4*3] = [-39+12, -28+12] = [-27,-16], not including 0.\n\nOther cars not near 0, so no collision at t=12.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 safe at t=12.\n\nAction a12: U, y13=8.\n\nt=13: y=8, position (0,8). Freeway 8.\n\nΔt=13-9=4.\n\nSpan for first car: [-39 +4*4, -28+16] = [-39+16, -28+16] = [-23,-12], not 0.\n\nNo collision.\n\nAction a13: U, y14=9.\n\nt=14: y=9, which is not a freeway, so safe, and we reached y=9.\n\nAt turn t=14, we are at y=9, which is the goal.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=9 to t=14, that's 6 turns? Let's see the sequence.\n\nStart at t=9: y=4\n\nAfter action at t=9, we go to y=5 at t=10.\n\nThe position at turn T is after the action? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nThe player update: at turn t, we choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAnd at turn t, the player is at (0, y_t).\n\nCollision at turn T if at that position y_T, there is a car collision.\n\nIn this case:\n\nt=9: position (0,4), y=4, no collision.\n\nWe choose a9 = U, so y_{10} = 4 +1 =5.\n\nNow t=10: position (0,5), y=5, no collision.\n\nChoose a10=U, y11=6.\n\nt=11: position (0,6), no collision.\n\na11=U, y12=7.\n\nt=12: position (0,7), freeway 7. At t=12, as above, no collision.\n\na12=U, y13=8.\n\nt=13: position (0,8), freeway 8. At t=13, Δt=4, span [-23,-12], no 0, safe.\n\na13=U, y14=9.\n\nt=14: position (0,9), not a freeway, so no collision, and we are at y=9.\n\nSo in 5 actions: from t=9 to t=13, actions at t=9,10,11,12,13, and at t=14 we are at y=9.\n\nNumber of turns: we start at turn t=9 with y=4.\n\nAfter H turns, we are at turn t=9 + H -1? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t= t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, we are at y=9.\n\nIn this case, actions at t=9,10,11,12,13 (5 actions), then at t=14, y=9.\n\nSo H=5, and we reach at turn t=9 + 5 =14? t_1 + H.\n\nt_1 =9, after H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H.\n\nThe player position at turn T is after the action? At turn t, before action, position is y_t, we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} is set for next turn.\n\nBut at turn t, we are at y_t, and collision is based on y_t at that turn.\n\nThen after action, we move to y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\nTo reach y=9 at some turn, say at turn T, we have y_T =9.\n\nWe start at t=9, y9=4.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for some T.\n\nThe minimal T.\n\nWith actions, each action changes y by at most 1, so from 4 to 9, at least 5 steps up, so minimal T is 14 if we go up every turn.\n\nIn the above, with U every turn from t=9 to t=13, we have:\n\nt=9: y=4, safe\n\na9=U\n\nt=10: y=5, safe (y=5 no cars)\n\na10=U\n\nt=11: y=6, safe\n\na11=U\n\nt=12: y=7, at t=12, Δt=3, freeway 7: span [-27,-16] no 0, safe\n\na12=U\n\nt=13: y=8, at t=13, Δt=4, freeway 8: span [-23,-12] no 0, safe\n\na13=U\n\nt=14: y=9, safe, goal.\n\nNow, is there any issue? At t=10, y=5, which is freeway 5, but no cars ever, so safe. Similarly for y=6.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=1,2,3 have collision at t=10, but we are not on them.\n\nAlso, y=7 and 8 have collisions at t=16,17,18, but we are at t=12 and 13, which are before, so no problem.\n\nSo this seems to work in 5 turns.\n\nBut H is the number of actions? The minimal H such that we reach in H turns.\n\nIn the answer, it should be a sequence from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, actions at t=9,10,11,12,13.\n\nH=5.\n\nBut let me confirm if at t=12 on y=7 is safe.\n\nt=12, Δt=12-9=3\n\nFreeway 7 cars:\n\nFirst car: (-28,-39,right,4) → span at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-39 +4*3, -28 +4*3] = [-39+12, -28+12] = [-27,-16], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (48,37,right,4) → [37+12,48+12]=[49,60], no\n\nThird car: (12,1,right,4) → [1+12,12+12]=[13,24], no\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at t=13, Δt=4\n\nFirst car: [-39+16, -28+16] = [-23,-12], no\n\nOthers similarly not near.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut is there a faster way? From y=4 to y=9, minimum 5 moves up, so H=5 is minimal.\n\nBut can we reach earlier? Start at t=9 y=4, after one action at t=9, y10=5, t=10 y=5, ..., t=13 y=8, t=14 y=9. So cannot reach before t=14.\n\nt=14 is the earliest possible.\n\nAnd with the actions above, no collisions.\n\nBut the problem is to avoid collisions, and in this path, we never are on a freeway when there is a collision at that time.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- At t=10, collisions on y=1,2,3, but we are on y=5, safe.\n\n- At t=16,17,18, collisions on y=7 and 8, but we are on y=7 at t=12, which is fine, and y=8 at t=13, fine, and at t=14 we are at y=9.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut just to be thorough, is there a reason to go slower? For example, if we were to be on y=7 or 8 later, but we don't need to.\n\nPerhaps we can go down to avoid something, but in this case, not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: the player can stay or go down, but that would only delay reaching y=9, so not beneficial for minimal H.\n\nSo H=5 should be achievable.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway 4,5,6: they are present but never cover x=0, so always safe.\n\nFreeway 4,5,6 have cars but at positive x moving right, so x=0 never covered, yes.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, at t=9, we start at y=4, which is freeway 4, but no collision, as established.\n\nThen we move up.\n\nBut the action sequence: a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=U.\n\nThen at t=14, y=9.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} which is a9\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a10\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H -1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nSince H=5, actions from t=9 to t=13, so t_1 to t_1 +4.\n\nt_1=9, so turns: 9,10,11,12,13.\n\nActions: U for all.\n\nBut the player is at (0,4) at turn t_1=9, and after action, moves to new position.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be fine.\n\nBut is there any constraint I missed?\n\nThe note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but not Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut in our case, we don't have that issue because we are moving vertically, and we only care about the current y at each turn.\n\nFor example, when we move from y=7 to y=8 at turn t=12, action U, so at t=12 we are on y=7, and cars on y=7 at t=12, no collision.\n\nThen at t=13 we are on y=8.\n\nNo problem.\n\nSimilarly elsewhere.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me see if at any point we might have collision.\n\nFor instance, at t=10, if we were on y=1,2, or 3, there is collision, but we are on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, later.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster, but impossible since 5 steps needed.\n\nUnless we start moving earlier, but we start at t=9.\n\nAnother thing: y=0 and y=9 are safe, but we start at 4, end at 9.\n\nIf we go down to 0, it might be safe, but then we have to come up, taking more turns, so worse.\n\nSimilarly, staying would delay.\n\nSo minimal H is 5.\n\nBut in the car states, freeway 7 and 8 have multiple cars, but we are not there at dangerous times.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm the dangerous times.\n\nFor y=7 and 8, collision at t=16,17,18.\n\nt=16 is Δt=7, etc.\n\nBut we are at t=12 and 13, which are earlier.\n\nt=12 is Δt=3, t=13 Δt=4, both before 7.\n\nSimilarly, for y=1,2,3, collision only at t=10.\n\nNow, in our path, we are at y=5 at t=10, which is fine.\n\nBut what if we were to go through y=3 or something.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=9, we do S, stay at y=4.\n\nThen t=10: y=4, safe, but we wasted a turn.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9, so from t=10 y=4, need 5 ups, so reach at t=15, worse.\n\nOr if we go down, say to y=3 at t=10, but at t=10, y=3 has collision, so if we are on y=3 at t=10, we collide.\n\nAt t=9, if we do D, to y=3 at t=10.\n\nt=9: y=4, safe, action D, then y10=3.\n\nAt t=10, position (0,3), and freeway 3 has collision at t=10, since as above, span [-11,24] includes 0, so collision, cannot.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=2 or y=1 at t=10, same issue.\n\nSo we must not be on y=1,2,3 at t=10.\n\nIn our straight up path, we avoid that by being at y=5.\n\nWe could be at y=4 at t=10, but y=4 is safe, no cars, but then we need to go up later.\n\nBut staying at y=4 at t=10 is possible, but then we start from there, still need 5 ups to reach y=9, so arrive at t=15, later than t=14.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=6 or something, but in straight up, we go through y=5 and 6 quickly.\n\ny=5 and 6 are always safe, so no need to avoid.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5, with all U actions.\n\nBut let me write the sequence.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=9.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nThen at turn 14, y=9.\n\nIn the answer, it should be from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nH=5, so turns: t_1, t_1+1, t_1+2, t_1+3, t_1+4.\n\nThat is turns 9,10,11,12,13.\n\nEach with action U.\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn this case, H=5.\n\nBut is there a way with H=4? That would mean reaching y=9 at t=13.\n\nBut from y=4 at t=9, after 4 actions: at t=10,11,12,13 actions.\n\nAfter 4 actions, y at t=13.\n\nStart: t=9 y=4\n\nAfter a9, y10\n\nAfter a10, y11\n\nAfter a11, y12\n\nAfter a12, y13\n\nWe want y13=9.\n\nBut y13 = y9 + sum of Δy from t=9 to t=12, 4 actions.\n\nEach Δy <=1, so y13 <= 4 +4 =8 <9, cannot reach y=9 in 4 actions.\n\nMaximum y after 4 ups: y13 = y9 +4 =8.\n\nThen at t=14, with another action, to y=9.\n\nSo indeed, minimal H is 5 actions, reaching at t=14.\n\nThus, the sequence is all U.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose we want to avoid y=7 or 8 at certain times, but in this case, we are there early, no issue.\n\nPerhaps if there was a collision at t=12 or something, but there isn't.\n\nFor y=7, at t=12, no collision, as calculated.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother thing: the car on freeway 7 and 8, at t=12 and 13, are they moving? But we calculated the span, no problem.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5, with sequence U,U,U,U,U.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut let me see the car state again.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have three cars each, but only the first one could be near zero, but not at t=12 or 13.\n\nFor example, at t=13 on y=8, Δt=4, first car: [-39+16, -28+16] = [-23,-12], which is left of zero, not covering.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus, the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 9: U \\\\ Turn 10: U \\\\ Turn 11: U \\\\ Turn 12: U \\\\ Turn 13: U }\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., and t_1=9.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nAnd H=5.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, which is 5.\n\nIn the box, I think just the sequence, and H is implied.\n\nThe task says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the answer format, it shows the sequence with turns, so probably H is clear from the sequence.\n\nSince it says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\", so with H=5, t from 0 to 4.\n\nSo for t=0: a9, t=1: a10, etc.\n\nBut in the box, it's written as above.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut just to make sure, is there a shorter path? No, as above.\n\nPerhaps by going down first, but that would take more turns or cause collision.\n\nFor example, at t=9, go down to y=3, but then at t=10, on y=3, collision.\n\nIf go down to y=3 at t=10, but at t=10 collision.\n\nIf we stay at y=4 for some turns, but then we delay, so later arrival.\n\nFor instance, suppose we stay at y=4 until after t=10, but at t=10, y=4 is safe, no issue, but we can move up earlier.\n\nIn our case, we move up immediately.\n\nSuppose we go to y=5 at t=10, which we do.\n\nBut y=5 is safe at all times.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think no better way.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5 with all U actions.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Collisions:\n- **Freeways 1, 2, and 3**: Collision occurs only at turn \\(T = 10\\) (i.e., \\(\\Delta t = 1\\) where \\(\\Delta t = T - 9\\)). At other times, these freeways are safe.\n- **Freeways 4, 5, and 6**: No collision at any time, as the cars are always at positive x-coordinates and moving right, never covering x=0.\n- **Freeways 7 and 8**: Collision occurs at turns \\(T = 16, 17, 18\\) (i.e., \\(\\Delta t = 7, 8, 9\\)). At other times, these freeways are safe.\n- **y = 0 and y = 9**: Always safe, as there are no cars.\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9) Minimally:\n- The minimal vertical distance to cover is from y=4 to y=9, requiring at least 5 upward moves (each U action increases y by 1). Thus, the earliest possible arrival is at turn 14, after 5 actions starting from turn 9.\n- A sequence of U actions (up) from turn 9 to turn 13 achieves this:\n  - Turn 9: Start at (0,4), which is safe (freeway 4 has no collision).\n  - Action U: Move to (0,5) for turn 10.\n  - Turn 10: Position (0,5), safe (freeway 5 has no collision).\n  - Action U: Move to (0,6) for turn 11.\n  - Turn 11: Position (0,6), safe (freeway 6 has no collision).\n  - Action U: Move to (0,7) for turn 12.\n  - Turn 12: Position (0,7), safe (freeway 7 at \\(\\Delta t = 3\\): car spans are [-27,-16], [49,60], [13,24]; 0 not in any span).\n  - Action U: Move to (0,8) for turn 13.\n  - Turn 13: Position (0,8), safe (freeway 8 at \\(\\Delta t = 4\\): car spans are [-23,-12], [53,64], [17,28]; 0 not in any span).\n  - Action U: Move to (0,9) for turn 14, reaching the goal safely.\n\nThis sequence avoids all dangerous turns:\n- At turn 10, collisions occur on y=1,2,3, but the player is on y=5 (safe).\n- At turns 16,17,18, collisions occur on y=7,8, but the player has already passed these freeways by turn 13.\n\n### Minimal Turns \\(H\\):\n- \\(H = 5\\) turns (actions) are required, as fewer turns (e.g., 4) cannot reach y=9 from y=4 due to the step limit (each action changes y by at most 1).\n- The sequence reaches y=9 at turn 14 (\\(t_1 + H = 9 + 5\\)).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 9\\) to \\(13\\) is all U (up).\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,5) at turn t1=10 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The player moves vertically: U for up (+1 in y), D for down (-1 in y), or S for stay (no change). y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where for that freeway, 0 is within the span of some car at that turn. The span moves with time based on the car's speed and direction.\n\nCars are on specific freeways, and for each freeway, there might be multiple cars. I need to check for each turn whether, if the player is on a freeway y, 0 is covered by any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe note says: if you move to a different y at turn T, you're not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, you're on y_T, and you decide action a_T, which affects y_{T+1}. So during turn T, you're on y_T, and you might collide with cars on y_T if 0 is in their span at time T.\n\nThen after moving, at turn T+1, you're on y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nStart at turn t1=10, position y=5.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y increases when going up, and we start at 5, we need to go up to 9, so probably mostly U actions, but I have to avoid the freeways when cars are covering position 0.\n\nThe grid is vertical, with y from 0 to 9, and freeways are at y=1 to 8, each with cars moving horizontally.\n\nPosition 0 is where the player is, I think. Let me read carefully.\n\nThe player is at (0, y_t), so x=0 is the position we care about for collisions. Cars are on freeways, which are horizontal lanes at different y levels, and they move left or right.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, y_T = k for some freeway k, and 0 is within the span of some car on that freeway at time T.\n\nSo for each freeway and each turn, I need to know if 0 is covered by a car on that freeway.\n\nThen, for the player path, at each turn, if y_t is between 1 and 8, I need to ensure that no car on that freeway covers 0 at time t.\n\nIf y_t is 0 or 9, there are no freeways, so no collision possible. y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since no cars there.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe zones.\n\nWe start at y=5, which is a freeway, and end at y=9, which is safe.\n\nGoal is to minimize H, the number of turns, so I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when a car covers x=0.\n\nSince we need to go from 5 to 9, that's 4 steps up, so minimum H=4 if we can go U,U,U,U and no collisions.\n\nBut probably not, because of cars.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the starting turn? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so at turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAt t=0, we are at turn t1, position given.\n\nAfter H turns, we reach at turn t1 + H - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nThe player update: at turn t, we are at y_t, we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo from turn t, we move to turn t+1 with new position.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} means actions from turn t1 to turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter applying action a_{t1 + H - 1}, we have y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} = 9? No.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1 + H - 1? Let's read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nIn the task: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAnd the actions are from t=0 to H-1, so for turns t1 to t1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1 + H, but we want to be at position at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nLet's index carefully.\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t chosen at time t affects y_{t+1}.\n\nWe start at time t1, y_{t1} = 5.\n\nWe apply actions a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., up to a_{t1 + H - 1}.\n\nThen after a_{t1 + H - 1}, we have y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9? That seems inconsistent.\n\nThe problem says: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} is the position at time t1 + H - 1.\n\nAt time t1 + H - 1, we are at y_{t1 + H - 1}, and we want this to be 9.\n\nBut to achieve that, we need to have moved there by previous actions.\n\nThe actions are applied from t1 to t1 + H - 1, meaning:\n\n- At turn t1, we are at y_{t1}, we choose a_{t1}, which sets y_{t1+1}\n\n- At turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}, choose a_{t1+1}, sets y_{t1+2}\n\n- ...\n\n- At turn t1 + H - 2, we are at y_{t1 + H - 2}, choose a_{t1 + H - 2}, sets y_{t1 + H - 1}\n\n- At turn t1 + H - 1, we are at y_{t1 + H - 1}, choose a_{t1 + H - 1}, which would set y_{t1 + H}\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9, so at the turn t1 + H - 1, we must be at position 9, before choosing the action for that turn? No.\n\nAt turn t, we are at position y_t, and we choose action a_t, which determines where we will be at the next turn, y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position y_t is where we are during turn t.\n\nWe want that at some turn T, y_T = 9.\n\nSpecifically, we want y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nThat means at turn t1 + H - 1, we are at position 9.\n\nTo be at position 9 at turn t1 + H - 1, that could be because we moved there from turn t1 + H - 2, or we were there already.\n\nBut since we start at 5, we need to move.\n\nThe last action that affects this is a_{t1 + H - 2}, which sets y_{t1 + H - 1} from y_{t1 + H - 2}.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H - 1, we are at y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9, and we don't need to do anything else? But we have to choose an action for that turn, but since we are already at 9, we can choose S, or U or D, but U or D might take us out, so probably S to stay, but since we only care about reaching at that turn, and we can choose action, but the position is what matters for the goal.\n\nThe goal is to have y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9, regardless of what action we choose at that turn, as long as we are there.\n\nBut we need to specify the action for that turn too.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to output actions for turns t1 to t1 + H - 1.\n\nFor the last turn, when we are at 9, we can choose S to stay, or even U or D, but U would take us to 10, which is invalid since y max 9, or to 9 if at 8, but we are at 9, so U would try to go to 10, which should be clipped to 9, I think.\n\nThe player update says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if y_t=9 and a_t=U, y_{t+1} = min(9,10) =9, similarly for D at 0.\n\nBut for collision, at y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=0.\n\nBack to the point.\n\nFor the turn when we reach y=9, we can be at y=9 and choose any action, but since we are already at the goal, choosing S is fine.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we want the smallest H such that we can reach y=9 at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nSince we start at t1, y=5, and need to get to 9, the minimum possible H is 4, if we go up every turn: after 4 ups, we are at 9.\n\nBut we might be blocked by cars.\n\nH=4 means actions at t1, t1+1, t1+2, t1+3, and position at t1+3 should be 9.\n\nPositions: at t1: y=5\n\nAfter a_t1, y_{t1+1} = y_t1 + Δy\n\nSet t1 = 10 for simplicity, since all times are relative to t1.\n\nDefine τ = t - t1, so at τ=0, turn t1, y=5.\n\nWe apply actions a_{τ} for τ=0 to H-1.\n\nThen y_{τ} for τ=0 to H, but we want y_{H-1} = 9? Let's see.\n\nAt time relative to t1: at step τ, we are at turn t1 + τ.\n\nPosition y_{t1 + τ}.\n\nWe start at τ=0, y=5.\n\nAfter action a_τ, we have y_{t1 + τ +1} = y_{t1 + τ} + Δy_τ\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} is the position at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nFor that to be 9, it must be set by the action at turn t1 + H - 2.\n\nFrom τ=0 to τ=H-1, we have H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, we have positions from τ=0 to τ=H.\n\nPosition at τ=0: y=5\n\nAfter a_0: y at τ=1\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{H-2}: y at τ=H-1\n\nAfter a_{H-1}: y at τ=H\n\nBut we want y at τ=H-1 to be 9.\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} corresponds to τ = (t1 + H - 1) - t1 = H - 1.\n\nSo at τ = H-1, y=9.\n\nTo have y at τ=H-1 be 9, it is determined by the action at τ=H-2.\n\nSpecifically, y_{τ} = y_{τ-1} + Δy_{τ-1} for τ >=1.\n\ny_0 = 5\n\ny_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\ny_2 = y_1 + Δy_1\n\n...\n\ny_{H-1} = y_{H-2} + Δy_{H-2}\n\nWe want y_{H-1} = 9.\n\nSo the action at τ=H-2 sets it, but we also have actions at τ=0 to τ=H-1, so for τ=H-1, we choose an action, but it doesn't affect y_{H-1}, it affects y_H.\n\nFor the position at τ=H-1, it is affected by actions up to τ=H-2.\n\nAction at τ=H-1 is chosen, but only affects future position.\n\nSo for reaching y_{H-1}=9, we need actions from τ=0 to τ=H-2 to get there, and at τ=H-1, we can choose any action, say S.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, no issue.\n\nNow, back to the cars.\n\nFirst, I need to model the car positions over time.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=10.\n\nFor each freeway, we have cars with their states at t1=10.\n\nCar spans are given at t1, and we need to compute at time T > t1, the span.\n\nTime T is absolute turn number.\n\nFor a car, at time T, span is:\n\nIf left-moving: [h - s(T - t1), τ - s(T - t1)]? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T - t1), τ - s(T - t1)]\n\nIn the table, for each car, it's (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (24, -11, right, 36)\n\nDirection: right or left.\n\nIn the update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] but [h, τ] with h and τ, but for left-moving, head and tail, I think head is the front, tail is the back.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, it says Span(t1) = [h, τ], and for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h]\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nCar update rules:\n\nFor car k on freeway i, at turn t1, head at h, tail at τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nThen at turn T > t1:\n\nIf left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T - t1), τ - s(T - t1)]\n\nIf right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)]\n\nAnd collision if 0 in Span(T) for the freeway at y_T.\n\nAlso, note that the player is on freeway y_t at turn t.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when 0 is covered by any car on that freeway.\n\nSince there might be multiple cars, I need to check for each car if 0 is in its span at time T.\n\nBut for a given freeway and time, if any car covers 0, then it's occupied.\n\nNow, let's list all freeways and their cars.\n\nFreeway 1: y=1, cars: one car: (24, -11, right, 36)\n\nSince right-moving, at time T, span = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-11 + 36(T-10), 24 + 36(T-10)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: y=2, same as freeway 1: (24, -11, right, 36) so same span.\n\nFreeway 3: y=3, same: (24, -11, right, 36)\n\nFreeway 4: y=4, (48, 25, right, 24) so span at T: [25 + 24(T-10), 48 + 24(T-10)]\n\nFreeway 5: y=5, same as 4: (48, 25, right, 24)\n\nFreeway 6: y=6, same: (48, 25, right, 24)\n\nNow freeway 7: y=7, multiple cars: (-24, -35, right, 4), (52, 41, right, 4), (16, 5, right, 4)\n\nAll right-moving, speed 4.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8: y=8, same cars: (-24, -35, right, 4), (52, 41, right, 4), (16, 5, right, 4)\n\nNow, for each, I need to find for which T, 0 is covered.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when x=0 is occupied.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, for each turn T, if the player is on a freeway y, we need to check that freeway at time T.\n\ny_t is the freeway level at turn t.\n\nNow, for freeway 1 (y=1): car span at T: [ -11 + 36(T-10) , 24 + 36(T-10) ] since right-moving.\n\n0 is in this interval if:\n\n-11 + 36(T-10) <= 0 <= 24 + 36(T-10)\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nLeft: -11 + 36(T-10) <= 0 => 36(T-10) <= 11 => T-10 <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so T <= 10 + 0.305 = 10.305, since T integer, T <= 10\n\nRight: 0 <= 24 + 36(T-10) => 0 <= 24 + 36(T-10), since 24>0, this is true for T-10 >= ? 24 + 36(T-10) >=0 always true because min when T-10 negative, but T>t1=10, so T>=11, 36(T-10) >=0, so 24 + something non-negative, so 0 <= that is always true for T>=10.\n\nBut T>t1, so T>=11.\n\nNow, 0 <= 24 + 36(T-10) is true for all T since right side >=24 for T>=10.\n\nAnd -11 + 36(T-10) <=0 when T-10 <= 11/36, so for T=10, but T>t1, so T=10 not considered? T>t1, so T>=11.\n\nAt T=11, -11 +36(1) = -11+36=25 >0, so left end is 25, right end 24+36=60, so [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for T>11, left end increases, so 0 never in for T>=11.\n\nAt T=10, if we consider, but T>t1 for future, so for T>=11, freeway 1 never occupied at x=0.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2 and 3, same cars, so never occupied for T>=11.\n\nNow freeway 4: y=4, car (48,25,right,24), span at T: [25 +24(T-10), 48 +24(T-10)]\n\n0 in [left, right] if left <=0 and right >=0.\n\nBut left =25 +24(T-10) >=25>0 for T>=10, so left>0, so 0 < left, not <=, so 0 not in interval since left>0.\n\nSimilarly for all T, left >=25, so 0 never covered on freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5 and 6, same.\n\nNow freeway 7: y=7, three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,4), span at T: since right-moving, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-35 +4(T-10), -24 +4(T-10)]\n\nSecond car: (52,41,right,4), span [41 +4(T-10), 52 +4(T-10)]\n\nThird car: (16,5,right,4), span [5 +4(T-10), 16 +4(T-10)]\n\nNow, 0 is covered if in any of these spans.\n\nFirst car: [-35 +4(T-10), -24 +4(T-10)]\n\n0 in this if -35 +4(Δt) <=0 and -24 +4(Δt) >=0, where Δt = T-10.\n\nSo -35 +4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=35 => Δt <= 35/4=8.75, so Δt <=8\n\nAnd -24 +4Δt >=0 => 4Δt >=24 => Δt >=6\n\nSo for Δt between 6 and 8 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, second car: [41 +4Δt, 52 +4Δt], both min 41>0 for Δt>=0, so always >0, 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [5 +4Δt, 16 +4Δt], min 5>0, so always >0, 0 not in.\n\nSo only first car can cover 0, for Δt=6,7,8.\n\nThat is T=10+6=16, T=17, T=18.\n\nAt T=16: span first car: [-35+4*6, -24+4*6] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0]\n\n-11 <=0<=0? 0<=0 is true, so yes, 0 in [-11,0]\n\nSimilarly T=17: [-35+28, -24+28] = [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nT=18: [-35+32, -24+32] = [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nT=19: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 1>0, not <=0, so 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 7, occupied at T=16,17,18.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same cars, so occupied at same times T=16,17,18.\n\nNow, freeways 1 to 6 are never occupied for T>=11, as we saw.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 occupied only at T=16,17,18.\n\nBut T is absolute turn number.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn t1=10, y=5.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimum steps: if we go up each turn, we can be at y=6 at τ=1 (turn 11), y=7 at τ=2 (turn 12), y=8 at τ=3 (turn 13), y=9 at τ=4 (turn 14).\n\nτ relative to t1.\n\nAt τ=0, turn t1=10, y=5\n\nAfter action a0 at τ=0 (turn 10), y at τ=1 (turn 11) = y0 + Δy0\n\nSimilarly, at τ=1, turn 11, y=y1, choose a1, set y2, and so on.\n\nWe want y at τ=H-1 to be 9.\n\nFor minimum H, let's try H=4.\n\nThen we want y at τ=3 to be 9? τ=H-1=3.\n\ny_{τ=3} =9.\n\nNow positions:\n\nAt τ=0, turn 10, y=5\n\nAt τ=1, turn 11, y = y0 + Δy0, want to go to 6, so a0=U\n\nAt τ=2, turn 12, y = y1 + Δy1, want 7, a1=U\n\nAt τ=3, turn 13, y = y2 + Δy2, want 8, a2=U\n\nThen at τ=3, turn 13, y=8? We want y at τ=3 to be 9.\n\ny_{τ=3} = y at turn 13.\n\nTo have y_{τ=3} =9, it must come from y_{τ=2} and a_{τ=2}.\n\ny_{τ=3} = y_{τ=2} + Δy_{τ=2}\n\nSimilarly, y_{τ=2} = y_{τ=1} + Δy_{τ=1}\n\ny_{τ=1} = y_{τ=0} + Δy_{τ=0}\n\ny_{τ=0} =5\n\nFor y_{τ=3} =9, we need to increase by 4 from y0.\n\nWith actions at τ=0,1,2.\n\nActions at τ=0,1,2 affect y at τ=1,2,3.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nSet Δy for each step.\n\ny1 = y0 + Δy0\n\ny2 = y1 + Δy1 = y0 + Δy0 + Δy1\n\ny3 = y2 + Δy2 = y0 + Δy0 + Δy1 + Δy2\n\nWe want y3 =9, y0=5, so Δy0 + Δy1 + Δy2 =4\n\nEach Δy is +1, -1, or 0.\n\nTo minimize time, we should use U as much as possible.\n\nWith 3 actions, we need to gain 4 in y, but each U gives +1, so maximum gain is 3 with three U, y3 =5+3=8, not 9.\n\nProblem.\n\ny_{τ=3} is after 3 actions? Let's count.\n\nAt τ=0, position y0=5\n\nAfter action a0, y1 = y0 + Δy0\n\nAfter a1, y2 = y1 + Δy1\n\nAfter a2, y3 = y2 + Δy2\n\nSo after 3 actions, we have y3.\n\nBut we want y_{H-1} for H=4.\n\nH=4, τ from 0 to 3, y at τ=3.\n\nWith actions at τ=0,1,2, we can set y1,y2,y3.\n\ny3 = y0 + Δy0 + Δy1 + Δy2 =5 + sum_{k=0}^2 Δy_k\n\nSet equal to 9, so sum Δy =4 over three actions.\n\nBut each |Δy| <=1, so maximum sum is 3, so impossible to reach y=9 in 3 steps from y=5.\n\ny3 = y at τ=3, which requires 3 changes.\n\nFrom y0 to y1: one action, gain at most 1\n\ny1 to y2: gain at most 1\n\ny2 to y3: gain at most 1\n\nSo after 3 actions, y can be at most 8.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need at least 4 actions? Let's see.\n\nWith 4 actions: actions at τ=0,1,2,3\n\nThen y at τ=1,2,3,4\n\nWe want y at τ=H-1.\n\nFor H=4, τ=H-1=3, so y at τ=3.\n\nBut with actions at τ=0,1,2,3, y at τ=3 is set by actions up to τ=2.\n\ny_{τ} for τ>=1 is set by previous actions.\n\ny0 =5\n\ny1 = y0 + Δy0  (affected by a0)\n\ny2 = y1 + Δy1 = y0 + Δy0 + Δy1  (a0 and a1)\n\ny3 = y2 + Δy2 = y0 + Δy0 + Δy1 + Δy2  (a0 to a2)\n\ny4 = y3 + Δy3  (a3)\n\nFor y3 to be 9, we need y0 + Δy0 + Δy1 + Δy2 =9, so 5 + sum_{k=0}^2 Δy_k =9, sum Δy_k =4 for k=0,1,2.\n\nBut each Δy_k <=1, so sum <=3, impossible.\n\nTherefore, for H=4, it is impossible to reach y=9 at τ=3.\n\nWe need a larger H.\n\nWith H actions, we want y_{H-1} =9.\n\ny_{H-1} = y0 + sum_{k=0}^{H-2} Δy_k\n\nBecause y_{H-1} = y_{H-2} + Δy_{H-2} = [y_{H-3} + Δy_{H-3}] + Δy_{H-2} = ... = y0 + Δy0 + ... + Δy_{H-2}\n\nSo y_{H-1} = 5 + sum_{k=0}^{H-2} Δy_k\n\nSet equal to 9, so sum_{k=0}^{H-2} Δy_k =4\n\nThe sum is over H-1 terms? From k=0 to H-2 inclusive, that's (H-2)-0+1 = H-1 terms.\n\nk from 0 to M, number of terms is M-0+1 = M+1.\n\nk from 0 to H-2 inclusive, number of terms: (H-2) - 0 + 1 = H-1 terms.\n\nEach Δy_k can be -1,0,1, so to sum to 4, we need at least 4 terms if all +1.\n\nThe minimum number of terms to sum to 4 is 4, with all +1.\n\nSo H-1 >=4, so H>=5.\n\nThen with H=5, H-1=4 terms, sum of 4 Δy can be 4, if all U.\n\nThen y_{4} =5 +4 =9.\n\nSimilarly, for H=5, τ from 0 to 4, y at τ=4 should be 9.\n\ny_{4} =5 + sum_{k=0}^{3} Δy_k? y_{H-1} for H=5, τ=H-1=4.\n\ny_{4} = y0 + sum_{k=0}^{3} Δy_k? Let's see.\n\ny_{4} = y_{3} + Δy_{3} = [y_{2} + Δy_{2}] + Δy_{3} = [y_{1} + Δy_{1} + Δy_{2}] + Δy_{3} = [y_{0} + Δy_{0} + Δy_{1} + Δy_{2}] + Δy_{3} = y0 + sum_{k=0}^{3} Δy_k\n\nFor τ=4, y4 = y0 + sum_{k=0}^{3} Δy_k\n\nSet y4=9, y0=5, so sum_{k=0}^{3} Δy_k =4\n\nWith 4 actions: a0 to a3, each can contribute Δy=1 for U.\n\nSo possible with all U: Δy0=1, Δy1=1, Δy2=1, Δy3=1, then y4=5+4=9.\n\nNow, the turns: τ=0, turn t1=10, action a0\n\nτ=1, turn 11, a1\n\nτ=2, turn 12, a2\n\nτ=3, turn 13, a3\n\nThen at τ=4, turn 14, y=9.\n\nWe need to output actions for τ=0 to H-1=4, so a0 to a3.\n\nBut at τ=4, we are at turn 14, y=9, and we need to choose action a4 for τ=4, but since we want y at τ=4 to be 9, and we are there, we can choose S.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=5, actions from τ=0 to 4, but a4 affects y5, not y4.\n\nBut for the position at τ=4, it is already set before a4.\n\nIn the output, we need to specify actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1, which for H=5, turns 10 to 14.\n\nAt turn 10, action a_{t1} = a0\n\nTurn 11, a1\n\nTurn 12, a2\n\nTurn 13, a3\n\nTurn 14, a4\n\nNow, at turn 14, we are at y_{14}, and we choose a4, which sets y_{15}.\n\nBut we want y_{14} =9, which is set by previous actions.\n\nWith a0 to a3 all U, y11=6, y12=7, y13=8, y14=9.\n\nThen at turn 14, we can choose a4=S, for example.\n\nNow, we need to check for collisions during the path.\n\nAt each turn T from 10 to 14, when the player is on a freeway, i.e., y_T between 1 and 8, we need to ensure that no car on that freeway covers x=0 at time T.\n\nNow, turns: T=10,11,12,13,14\n\ny_T:\n\nAt T=10, y=5 (freeway 5)\n\nT=11, y=6 (freeway 6)\n\nT=12, y=7 (freeway 7)\n\nT=13, y=8 (freeway 8)\n\nT=14, y=9 (safe, no freeway)\n\nNow, check for each:\n\nFirst, freeways 1-6 are never occupied for T>=11, as we saw earlier.\n\nAt T=10, but T=10 is the current turn, and we are at y=5.\n\nFor collision at turn T, we need to check if at that turn, for y_T, 0 is covered.\n\nAt T=10, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5: at T=10, what is the span?\n\nCars are given at t1=10.\n\nFor freeway 5: car (48,25,right,24) at T=10.\n\nSince right-moving, span at T=10: [τ + s(0), h + s(0)] = [25,48], since T-t1=0.\n\nSo [25,48], 0 not in, since 25>0.\n\nSimilarly, at T=10, for freeway 5, not occupied.\n\nNow, for T=11: y=6, freeway 6, same as freeway 5, at T=11, span [25+24(1), 48+24(1)] = [49,72], 0 not in.\n\nT=12: y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 at T=12.\n\nT=12, Δt= T-t1=12-10=2\n\nNow, freeway 7 occupied only at T=16,17,18, as before.\n\nAt T=12, Δt=2, first car span: [-35 +4*2, -24+4*2] = [-35+8, -24+8] = [-27,-16], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [41+8,52+8]=[49,60], >0\n\nThird car: [5+8,16+8]=[13,24]>0\n\nSo not occupied.\n\nT=13: y=8, freeway 8, similar to freeway 7, at T=13, Δt=3\n\nFirst car: [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12], <0\n\nNot 0.\n\nT=14: y=9, safe.\n\nSo in this path, no collisions, and we reach y=9 at turn 14 (τ=4).\n\nBut H=5, with actions all U for first four actions? Let's list.\n\nFor H=5, actions:\n\nAt turn 10 (τ=0): a_{10} = U, so y11 = y10 +1 =5+1=6\n\nTurn 11 (τ=1): a_{11} = U, y12 =6+1=7\n\nTurn 12 (τ=2): a_{12} = U, y13 =7+1=8\n\nTurn 13 (τ=3): a_{13} = U, y14 =8+1=9\n\nNow at turn 14 (τ=4), y14=9, and we need action a_{14}, which can be S, for example.\n\nThen y15=9+0=9, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, we output actions for turns 10 to 14.\n\nBut is this minimal H? H=5.\n\nEarlier we thought H min is 5, since with fewer actions we can't reach y=9.\n\nWith H=4, y_{3} max 8, as sum of 3 Δy <=3, y3<=8.\n\nSo H=5 is minimum possible.\n\nAnd in this case, no collisions, so it should work.\n\nBut we need to confirm the car at T=12 for freeway 7.\n\nT=12, Δt=2, first car: h=-24, τ=-35? For freeway 7, first car: (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nAt T=10, span: since right-moving, [τ, h] = [-35, -24]? No.\n\nThe span is given as (head, tail), and for right-moving, at t1, span is [τ, h]?\n\nIn the car state: for example, freeway 1: (24, -11, right, 36), and span at t1 for right-moving is [τ, h] = [-11, 24]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 7, car (-24,-35,right,4), so at t1, span is [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nAt time T, for right-moving, span [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAt T=12, Δt=2, span = [-35 + 4*2, -24 + 4*2] = [-35+8, -24+8] = [-27, -16], so from x=-27 to x=-16, all negative, so x=0 not in this interval.\n\nSimilarly, other cars not near zero.\n\nSo yes, safe.\n\nSimilarly for T=13, freeway 8, same cars, Δt=3, span [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12], still negative.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, with H=5, sequence: U, U, U, U, S for turns 10 to 14.\n\nBut in the action sequence, for turn 14, we can choose S.\n\nSince we reach at turn 14, and y=9, but the action at turn 14 doesn't affect reaching, but we have to specify it.\n\nNow, but in the problem, we start at turn t1=10, and we need to reach at turn t1 + H -1 =10 +5 -1=14, y=9.\n\nWith actions above.\n\nBut is there a way with H=5 but different actions? But this seems fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the end.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier, but with H=5, we reach at turn 14.\n\nH=5 turns: actions at turns 10,11,12,13,14, but position at turn 14 is set.\n\nSince we can stay or move, but in this case, with 4 U, we go directly.\n\nBut at turn 14, we are at y=9, so action can be S.\n\nIn the output, we need to list the actions.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, they are occupied at T=16,17,18, which are later, not in this short path.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut the player is at y=5 at turn 10, and we move immediately.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if we can reach in fewer than 5, but we can't, as established.\n\nH=5 is minimum.\n\nPerhaps with going down or staying, but that would take more turns, not fewer.\n\nFor example, if we go down, it takes longer to reach 9.\n\nSo minimum H=5 with all up.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have five actions, but the last one is at turn 14, where we are already at 9.\n\nIn the answer format, we need to output for each turn.\n\nNow, but in the car list, for freeway 7 and 8, there is a car (16,5,right,4) at t1.\n\nAt T=10, span [5,16], which is positive, not covering 0.\n\nBut at some point, it might, but we saw only the first car covers 0 at later times.\n\nAnyway, not relevant.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nTurn t1=10: action U\n\nThen y at turn 11: 6\n\nTurn 11: action U, y at turn 12:7\n\nTurn 12: action U, y at turn 13:8\n\nTurn 13: action U, y at turn 14:9\n\nTurn 14: action S (or U or D, but S to stay)\n\nNow, for turn 14, since y=9, no collision possible.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify actions for turns 10 to 14.\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so for t from 0 to H-1, that is t1 +0 to t1 + H-1.\n\nHere H=5, so turns 10,11,12,13,14.\n\nActions: U, U, U, U, S\n\nBut in the output, it should be like:\n\nTurn 10: a_{10}\n\nTurn 11: a_{11}\n\netc.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, at turn 12 and 13, y=7 and 8, but no cars covering 0, as we checked.\n\nBut let me double-check turn 12, freeway 7.\n\nT=12, Δt=2, car 1: [-35+8, -24+8] = [-27,-16]\n\ncar 2: [41+8,52+8]=[49,60]\n\ncar 3: [5+8,16+8]=[13,24]\n\nNone include 0.\n\nSimilarly turn 13, freeway 8: same, Δt=3\n\ncar1: [-35+12, -24+12]=[-23,-12]\n\ncar2: [41+12,52+12]=[53,64]\n\ncar3: [5+12,16+12]=[17,28]\n\nAll not covering 0.\n\nAnd earlier turns, freeways 5 and 6, no issue.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=5, sequence: U, U, U, U, S for turns 10 to 14.\n\nBut in the sequence, the last action S is not necessary, but we have to include it since we need actions up to turn t1+H-1=14.\n\nWe could choose U or D, but S is fine.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", but in the box, we need to output the sequence, not H.\n\nBut we have H.\n\nIn the answer, we just list the actions.\n\nNow, but let me see if there is any issue.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 10, we are at y=5, and we choose action immediately.\n\nBut at turn 10, position is given, and we need to choose action for that turn.\n\nIn the collision check, at turn 10, we are on freeway 5, and as we saw, no car covers 0, so safe to stay or move.\n\nWe moved up.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster, but we can't.\n\nSuppose we start by staying or something, but that would delay, not faster.\n\nSo I think H=5 is minimal and achievable.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nNow for the box.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 7 and 8, there is a car (16,5,right,4) at t1=10.\n\nAt some time, it might cover 0, but let's see when.\n\nSpan [5 +4(Δt), 16+4(Δt)]\n\nSet left <=0 <= right.\n\nLeft=5+4Δt >0 for all Δt>=0, so never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, other cars only the first one can cover 0 at later times.\n\nBut not in this path.\n\nSo fine.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 5, and the sequence as above.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\nThe minimum number of turns \\(H\\) required to reach \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 5\\) is 5, as it takes exactly 4 upward moves to increase \\(y\\) from 5 to 9, and the position at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 10 + 5 - 1 = 14\\) must be \\(y = 9\\). With \\(H = 5\\), the actions are applied from turn 10 to turn 14, and the position at turn 14 is \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions to achieve this with no collisions is:\n- At turn 10, move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\).\n- At turn 11, move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\).\n- At turn 12, move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\).\n- At turn 13, move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\).\n- At turn 14, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nCollision checks for each turn:\n- **Turn 10 (\\(y = 5\\))**: Freeway 5 has a car with span \\([25, 48]\\) at \\(T = 10\\), which does not contain 0.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,6) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1 = 11.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For each freeway, there are cars with positions that change over time based on their speed and direction. The collision happens only if at the turn when I'm on a freeway, the x=0 is within the span of a car on that freeway at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nThe player position is updated after the action. Let me read that carefully.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy depends on action U, D, S.\n\nSo at turn t, I take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nBut for collision, at turn T, I'm at position (0, y_T), and collision occurs if for that y_T, at turn T, there is a car on freeway y_T such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nAnd if I take an action to change y, at turn T I'm on y_T, and the action affects y_{T+1}, so I won't be on the new row until the next turn.\n\nNow, the cars: for each freeway, there is a list of cars with head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nDirection: right or left. In the car update, for left-moving, span moves left, for right-moving, span moves right.\n\nIn the description, left-moving: span [h, τ] becomes [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] after Δt turns.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ, h] becomes [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt], but I think the span is given as (head, tail), but head and tail depend on direction.\n\nIn the car state table, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor direction, if it's right, head is the front, so span is from tail to head, I think. But in the update, for right-moving, it says [τ, h] → [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt], so if direction is right, head is the right end, tail is left end, so span is [tail, head].\n\nSimilarly, for left, head is left end, tail is right end? Let's see.\n\nIn left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nIf h is head and direction left, head is the front when moving left, so if moving left, head is left, tail is right? But in the span [h, τ], if h is left, τ is right, then as it moves left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right, direction right, head is right, tail is left, span [τ, h] with τ left, h right, so [τ, h] → [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt], both increase.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, there are multiple cars, so I need to handle each car separately.\n\nCollision if at turn T, for the freeway y_T, any car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nNow, current turn t1 = 11, player at y=6.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe actions are U (up, y increases), D (down, y decreases), S (stay, y same).\n\ny from 0 to 9, so at y=0, I can't go down, similarly at y=9, can't go up, but since I'm going to 9, I need to stop there.\n\nIn this case, start at y=6, target y=9, so I need to increase y by 3.\n\nMinimal turns would be 3 turns, if I can go up three times without collision.\n\nBut I need to check if at each step, when I'm on a freeway, there is no car at x=0.\n\nSince I start at y=6 at turn t1=11, and I take action at turn t, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nLet's define the turns.\n\nAt turn t=11, I am at position (0, y_11) = (0,6).\n\nI take action a_11, which determines y_12.\n\nThen at turn t=12, I am at (0,y_12), and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T if when I am at (0, y_T), for freeway k=y_T, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nThen I need to reach y_{t1 + H -1} =9, so for some T, y_T =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=11 to t=11+H-1, and after H actions, I reach y_{11+H} =9? Let's see.\n\nStart: at turn 11, y_11 =6.\n\nAfter action a_11, y_12 = y_11 + Δy_11\n\nAt turn 12, position is (0, y_12)\n\nSimilarly, after a_{12}, y_{13} = y_{12} + Δy_{12}, and so on.\n\nI reach y=9 at some turn T, meaning that at turn T, y_T =9.\n\nAnd I need to minimize the number of turns to reach that state, so minimize H such that y_{t1 + H} =9? t1=11, so y_{11+H} =9.\n\nThe turn indices: at turn 11, y=6.\n\nAfter H turns, meaning after H actions, I have taken actions from t=11 to t=11+H-1, so I have y_{11}, y_{12}, ..., up to y_{11+H}.\n\nAnd y_{11+H} =9.\n\nThe number of actions is H, so from turn 11 to turn 11+H-1, I take H actions, and at turn 11+H, I am at y=9.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at time t1 + t.\n\nt1=11, so actions at time 11 + t for t=0 to H-1, so actions at time 11, 12, ..., up to 11 + H -1.\n\nThen after these actions, at time (11 + H -1) +1 = 11 + H, position is y_{11+H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{11+H} =9.\n\nSo the turn when we reach y=9 is turn T = 11 + H.\n\nAnd we need to minimize H.\n\nSince we start at y=6, and y=9 is 3 above, minimum H is 3 if we can go up three times: U,U,U, then at turn 14, y=9.\n\nBut need to check for collisions at each freeway during the path.\n\nWhen I go from y to y+1, I take action U at turn t, so y_{t+1} = y_t +1.\n\nThen at turn t, I am on y_t, and at turn t+1, I am on y_{t+1} = y_t +1.\n\nFor collision, at each turn, when I am on a freeway, it must be clear at x=0.\n\nIn this case, from y=6 to y=9, I need to be on freeways 7 and 8 if I go up directly.\n\nI start at y=6 at turn 11.\n\ny=6 is a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think no cars there.\n\nThe player position is (0,y), with y=0 to 9, but cars only on y=1 to 8, so at y=0 and y=9, no cars, so no collision possible there.\n\nSimilarly, when moving, if I am at y=0 or y=9, no issue.\n\nBut I start at y=6, which is a freeway, and end at y=9, not a freeway.\n\nFor minimal path, I should go directly up if possible.\n\nSo let's check if I can go U,U,U: actions at t=11,12,13: U,U,U, then y12=7, y13=8, y14=9.\n\nNow, collision at each turn when on freeway.\n\nAt turn 11: I am at y=6. Is there a car on freeway 6 at turn 11 with 0 in span?\n\nFreeway 6: from table, freeway k=6: cars (72,49,right,24)\n\nOnly one car? For k=6, it says (72,49,right,24)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut for k=7 and 8, multiple cars.\n\nFirst, freeway 6 at turn 11.\n\nCar: head=72, tail=49, direction=right, speed=24.\n\nSince direction right, span at time t is [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)]? t1=11.\n\nGeneral: at time T, span for right-moving car: [τ + s (T - t1), h + s (T - t1)]\n\nWith τ=49, h=72, s=24.\n\nAt T=11, span = [49 + 24(11-11), 72 + 24(0)] = [49,72]\n\n0 is not in [49,72], so no collision at turn 11 on y=6.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, if I take U at turn 11, at turn 12 I am at y=7.\n\nAt turn 12, on freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 has multiple cars: (-20,-31,right,4), (56,45,right,4), (20,9,right,4)\n\nAll right-moving, speed 4.\n\nAt turn T=12, which is t1 +1, Δt = T - t1 =12-11=1.\n\nFor each car, span at T=12:\n\nFirst car: h=-20, τ=-31? Head and tail.\n\nDirection right, so span [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nτ is tail, h is head.\n\nFirst car: τ=-31, h=-20, s=4\n\nΔt=1, so span at T=12: [ -31 + 4*1, -20 + 4*1 ] = [-27, -16]\n\n0 not in [-27,-16], ok.\n\nSecond car: τ=45? Head=56, tail=45? In the table: (56,45,right,4), so head=56, tail=45, direction right.\n\nSpan at T=12: [45 + 4*1, 56 + 4*1] = [49, 60]\n\n0 not in [49,60], ok.\n\nThird car: (20,9,right,4), head=20, tail=9\n\nSpan at T=12: [9 + 4*1, 20 + 4*1] = [13, 24]\n\n0 not in [13,24], ok.\n\nSo no collision at turn 12 on y=7.\n\nNow, at turn 12, I take action U, so at turn 13 I am at y=8.\n\nAt turn 13, on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7? Cars: (-20,-31,right,4), (56,45,right,4), (20,9,right,4)\n\nAll right-moving, speed 4.\n\nAt T=13, Δt = T - t1 =13-11=2\n\nSpans:\n\nFirst car: τ=-31, h=-20, s=4\n\nSpan: [ -31 + 4*2, -20 + 4*2 ] = [ -31+8, -20+8] = [-23, -12]\n\n0 not in, ok.\n\nSecond car: τ=45, h=56, s=4\n\nSpan: [45 + 8, 56 + 8] = [53, 64]\n\n0 not in, ok.\n\nThird car: τ=9, h=20, s=4\n\nSpan: [9 + 8, 20 + 8] = [17, 28]\n\n0 not in, ok.\n\nSo no collision at turn 13 on y=8.\n\nThen at turn 13, I take action U, so at turn 14, y=9, which is not a freeway, no collision.\n\nSo in three turns, I can reach y=9 at turn 14.\n\nH=3, actions at t=11,12,13: U,U,U.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, so t=11,12,13 with actions U,U,U.\n\nThen at turn 14, y=9.\n\nBut is this minimal? H=3, which is the minimum since I need to increase by 3.\n\nBut I should confirm if there is any issue.\n\nIn the car states, for freeway 7 and 8, at turn 12 and 13, no car at x=0.\n\nBut let me check for other turns or positions.\n\nAnother thing: when I am at y=7 at turn 12, I took U to go to y=8, but at turn 12, I am on y=7, and I take action U, so I will be on y=8 at turn 13.\n\nBut at turn 12, I am on y=7, which we checked.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nBut let me see the cars on freeway 7 at turn 12: spans [-27,-16], [49,60], [13,24], all not containing 0.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8 at turn 13: spans [-23,-12], [53,64], [17,28], no 0.\n\nBut is freeway 8 the same as 7? In the table, for k=7 and k=8, both have the same cars: (-20,-31,right,4), (56,45,right,4), (20,9,right,4)\n\nYes, identical.\n\nBut in reality, they might be different, but here same.\n\nNow, but at turn 13, I am on freeway 8, and we have no collision.\n\nBut let me check if at turn 11, when I am at y=6, is there any car? We have freeway 6: car [49,72] at T=11, no 0.\n\nBut freeway 6 has only one car, right? (72,49,right,24), span [49,72] at T=11.\n\nBut 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but I don't care if I'm not on them.\n\nBut just to be thorough.\n\nNow, but the problem is to reach (0,9), which we do at turn 14.\n\nBut is there a reason I cannot do this in 3 turns?\n\nPerhaps I should check for earlier or later.\n\nAnother thing: the cars are moving, so at different times, x=0 might be occupied.\n\nBut in this case, for the freeways I am on, at the times I am there, it's clear.\n\nBut let me see for freeway 7, when is x=0 occupied.\n\nFor example, freeway 7, cars:\n\nFirst car: span at T: [ -31 + 4(T-11), -20 + 4(T-11) ]\n\nSet 0 in span: -31 + 4Δt <= 0 <= -20 + 4Δt, with Δt = T-11\n\nSo -31 + 4Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -20 + 4Δt\n\nFirst: -31 + 4Δt <= 0 => 4Δt <= 31 => Δt <= 31/4 = 7.75, so Δt <=7 since integer.\n\nSecond: 0 <= -20 + 4Δt => 4Δt >=20 => Δt >=5.\n\nSo for Δt=5,6,7.\n\nΔt=5: T=16, span [ -31+20, -20+20] = [-11,0], 0 is included? -11 <=0<=0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly Δt=6: [ -31+24, -20+24] = [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nΔt=7: [-31+28, -20+28] = [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nSo at T=16,17,18, x=0 is occupied by first car on freeway 7.\n\nBut at turn 12, T=12, Δt=1, [-27,-16], not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, second car: span [45 + 4Δt, 56 + 4Δt]\n\n0 in: 45 + 4Δt <=0 <=56 + 4Δt? But 45 + 4Δt >=45>0, so 0 <= 45 + 4Δt always true since min 45, but 0 <= lower bound? Lower bound is 45 + 4Δt >=45>0, so 0 is less than lower bound, so never in span.\n\n45 + 4Δt >=45>0, so span starts from at least 45, so 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, third car: [9 + 4Δt, 20 + 4Δt] >= [9,20] >0, so 0 not in.\n\nSo only first car can have 0 at x, which at T=16,17,18.\n\nBut we are at turn 12, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same cars, so same situation.\n\nNow for freeway 6: car [49 + 24Δt, 72 + 24Δt], all positive, so 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways not relevant.\n\nSo with U,U,U at t=11,12,13, I reach y=9 at t=14 in 3 turns.\n\nBut the answer should be minimal, so H=3.\n\nBut let me see if I can do it faster? No, because from 6 to 9, minimum 3 steps.\n\nI could go down or something, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nSo H=3 should be fine.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 4,5,6, they have different cars, but I didn't go there.\n\nFor example, freeway 4: (72,49,right,24), same as 5 and 6? k=4,5,6 all have (72,49,right,24) or different?\n\nk=4: (72,49,right,24)\n\nk=5: (72,49,right,24)\n\nk=6: (72,49,right,24)\n\nAll identical? But in the table:\n\n| 4 | (72, 49, right, 24) |\n\n| 5 | (72, 49, right, 24) |\n\n| 6 | (72, 49, right, 24) |\n\nYes, all same car? But on different freeways, so separate.\n\nBut since I don't go to y=4 or5, not relevant.\n\nSimilarly, k=1,2,3: (60,25,right,36)\n\nAll same.\n\nBut again, not relevant.\n\nk=7 and 8 have multiple cars as above.\n\nSo with the plan, it seems collision-free.\n\nBut in the problem, for freeway 7 and 8, at turn 12 and 13, we are fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the position at each turn.\n\nTurn 11: position y=6, freeway 6, car span [49,72] at T=11, 0 not in.\n\nAction U.\n\nTurn 12: position y=7, freeway 7, cars: as above, spans at T=12: first [-27,-16], second [49,60], third [13,24], all not contain 0.\n\nAction U.\n\nTurn 13: position y=8, freeway 8, cars at T=13: first [-23,-12], second [53,64], third [17,28], no 0.\n\nAction U.\n\nTurn 14: position y=9, not a freeway, done.\n\nSo H=3.\n\nBut the sequence is actions from t=11 to t=13.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t1: a_{t1}, etc.\n\nSo for t1=11.\n\nBut in the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so for H=3, t=0,1,2, actions at t1+0=11, t1+1=12, t1+2=13.\n\nActions: U at 11, U at 12, U at 13.\n\nBut let me write it.\n\nThe problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nBut in this case, it seems H=3 is possible.\n\nBut I feel like I might be missing something because the cars on 7 and 8 have a car that will be at 0 later, but not at the time I am there.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8, same as 7.\n\nBut another thing: at turn 13, when I am on y=8, and I take U to go to y=9, at turn 13 I am on y=8, which we checked.\n\nBut is there a car on y=8 at turn 13 that has 0? No.\n\nPerhaps I should check if going up is the only way, but it is minimal.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach faster? No, impossible to reach in less than 3 turns.\n\nFor example, if I could go directly, but no, each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo H=3 is minimum.\n\nPerhaps with staying or down, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if I go U,U,S or something, but that would be H=4 or more, worse.\n\nSo U,U,U is best.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 7, at turn 12, it is clear, but let me see if at turn 11 or 13 for other freeways, but not necessary.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8 at turn 12, but I am not on it at turn 12.\n\nAt turn 12, I am on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, only when on the freeway.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on freeway 7 at turn 12.\n\nT=12, Δt=1.\n\nFirst car: head=-20, tail=-31, direction right, so tail τ=-31, head h=-20.\n\nSpan: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-31 + 4*1, -20 + 4*1] = [-27, -16], yes.\n\n-27 to -16, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if the span includes the endpoints, but since it says \"0 in span\", and at the boundary, it should be included, I think.\n\nFor example, if span [a,b], and a<=0<=b, then collision.\n\nIn the case above, for first car at Δt=5, [-11,0], 0<=0, so included.\n\nBut at Δt=1, [-27,-16], 0 not <= -16? -16 <0, so no.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo for our case, no issue.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=3 with actions U,U,U at turns 11,12,13.\n\nBut the sequence should be written for turns starting from t1.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\n}\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbers.\n\nt1=11, actions at t=11,12,13 for H=3.\n\nThen at turn 14, y=9.\n\nThe problem says \"reach (0,9)\", which is at turn 14.\n\nAnd H=3.\n\nPerhaps I need to output only the actions, not the position.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the box.\n\nBut I think I should make sure that at turn 13, after action U, y=9 at turn 14, but at turn 13 I am at y=8, which is freeway, and we have no collision.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8, the cars are the same, but let me see freeway 8 cars at turn 13.\n\nT=13, Δt=2.\n\nFirst car: τ=-31, h=-20, s=4, span [-31+8, -20+8] = [-23,-12]\n\n-23 to -12, 0 not in.\n\nSecond: [45+8,56+8]=[53,64], no.\n\nThird: [9+8,20+8]=[17,28], no.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut why do I feel like it might be too straightforward? Perhaps I misread the car states.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 7 and 8, there are three cars each, but we covered.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 6, but we are only at turn 11.\n\nOr maybe at turn 11, when I start, but y=6 is clear.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to wait or something, but no need.\n\nAnother point: the player cannot go outside y=0 to 9, but in this case, from 6 to 7,7 to8,8 to9, all within.\n\nSo I think H=3 is possible.\n\nBut let me see the initial state again.\n\nCurrent turn t1=11, player at (0,6)\n\nCars:\n\nFreeway 1: (60,25,right,36) → at T=11, span [25 + 36*0, 60 + 0]? Δt=0, [25,60], no 0.\n\nSimilarly, all.\n\nBut not relevant.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8, at some other time.\n\nBut I think I should proceed.\n\nSo the minimal sequence is three U actions.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\n}\n\nBut in the sequence, it's for turns 11,12,13.\n\nAnd H=3.\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so for t=0,1,2, actions at 11,12,13.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I need to write it in the box.\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me see if for turn 13, when I am at y=8, and I go to y=9, but at turn 13 I am on y=8, which is freeway, and we have no collision, so it should be ok.\n\nPerhaps the car on freeway 8 at turn 13, but we checked.\n\nAnother thought: the multiple cars on 7 and 8, but all are covered.\n\nPerhaps I should list the spans explicitly.\n\nAt turn 12, freeway 7:\n\nCar 1: (-20,-31,right,4) → at T=12, Δt=1, [ -31 +4, -20 +4] = [-27,-16]\n\nCar 2: (56,45,right,4) → [45+4,56+4]=[49,60]\n\nCar 3: (20,9,right,4) → [9+4,20+4]=[13,24]\n\nNone contain 0.\n\nAt turn 13, freeway 8:\n\nSame as above but at Δt=2:\n\nCar1: [-31+8, -20+8]=[-23,-12]\n\nCar2: [45+8,56+8]=[53,64]\n\nCar3: [9+8,20+8]=[17,28]\n\nNo 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 6)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 11\\) is 3, achieved by moving up (U) in each turn.\n\n- At turn 11, the player is at \\(y = 6\\).

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,7) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0. The grid has y from 0 to 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each freeway has cars moving left or right with given speeds. A collision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that y, the x-position 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe key point is that when you move to a new y, you're not on that new y until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, you're still on y at turn T, and you arrive at y+1 at turn T+1. Therefore, you only check for collision on the freeway you're currently on at the beginning of the turn.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t_1 = 12.\n\nPlayer starts at y=7.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns would be if I could go directly up, but I have to avoid cars on y=7 and y=8.\n\nFirst, let's look at the car states for freeways 7 and 8, since those are the ones I might be on.\n\nFreeway 7 has three cars: (-16, -27, right, 4), (60, 49, right, 4), (24, 13, right, 4)\n\nFreeway 8 has the same: (-16, -27, right, 4), (60, 49, right, 4), (24, 13, right, 4)\n\nAll cars are moving right, meaning they're increasing in position.\n\nFor right-moving cars, the span at time t is [τ + s(t - t_1), h + s(t - t_1)] where τ is tail, h is head? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor freeway 7, cars: (-16, -27, right, 4), but head is -16, tail is -27? That seems odd because if it's moving right, head should be greater than tail, I think.\n\n-16 is greater than -27, since -16 > -27, so head is at -16, tail at -27, which is left of head? If it's moving right, and positions increase to the right, then tail should be left, head right, so if head is -16 and tail is -27, that means tail is at -27, head at -16, so the car is from x=-27 to x=-16? But -27 is less than -16, so if x increases to the right, -27 is left of -16, so from left to right, tail at -27, head at -16, so span [τ, h] = [-27, -16]?\n\nBut in the state it's written as (head, tail) or (h, τ)? The table says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor the first car: head h = -16, tail τ = -27, direction right, speed 4.\n\nSince direction is right, and head is greater than tail ( -16 > -27), so the car is from τ to h, i.e., from -27 to -16.\n\nAt time t_1=12, span is [τ, h] = [-27, -16] for this car.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (60, 49, right, 4) — head 60, tail 49, so span [49,60]? τ=49, h=60.\n\nThird car: (24,13,right,4) — head 24, tail 13, span [13,24].\n\nIn the list, it's given as (h, τ), so for first car: h=-16, τ=-27, so span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-27, -16] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, (60,49) -> [49,60], (24,13) -> [13,24].\n\nBut for the first car, [ -27, -16 ], and direction right.\n\nNow, for freeway 8, same cars: (-16,-27,right,4), etc., so same spans.\n\nNow, I need to find when x=0 is covered by any car on the freeway at time T.\n\nCollision if 0 is in Span(T) for any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSince the player is at x=0 always, I think, since it's (0,y), so we care about whether 0 is in the car's span.\n\nNow, for a right-moving car, Span(T) = [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all are right-moving.\n\nt_1 = 12.\n\nLet me define time relative to t_1. Let t = T - t_1, so at t=0, current time.\n\nThen for a car, Span at time t (relative) is:\n\nFor right-moving: [τ + s t, h + s t]\n\nWhere t is the number of turns after t_1.\n\nNow, collision on freeway i at time t if there is a car on i such that 0 is in [τ + s t, h + s t]\n\nThat is, τ + s t <= 0 <= h + s t\n\nSince h > τ for right-moving.\n\nNow, for freeway 7:\n\nCars:\n\n1. τ=-27, h=-16, s=4\n\n2. τ=49, h=60, s=4\n\n3. τ=13, h=24, s=4\n\ns=4 for all.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same.\n\nFirst, for freeway 7:\n\nCar 1: τ + s t = -27 + 4t, h + s t = -16 + 4t\n\n0 in [-27 + 4t, -16 + 4t] if -27 + 4t <= 0 <= -16 + 4t\n\nWhich is 4t <= 27 and 4t >= 16, so t <= 27/4 = 6.75, t >= 16/4 = 4\n\nSince t integer, t=4,5,6\n\nSimilarly, car 2: τ=49, h=60, s=4, [49+4t, 60+4t]\n\n0 in [49+4t, 60+4t] only if 49+4t <=0 and 60+4t >=0, but 49+4t >=49>0 for t>=0, so never <=0, so 0 not in, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, car 3: τ=13, h=24, s=4, [13+4t, 24+4t], both positive for t>=0, so 0 not in, no collision.\n\nSo for freeway 7, only car 1 causes collision when t=4,5,6.\n\nt relative to t_1, so turns T = t_1 + t = 12 + t\n\nAt t=4, T=16; t=5,T=17; t=6,T=18.\n\nSo on freeway 7, collision at turns 16,17,18.\n\nNow for freeway 8, same cars, so same thing, collision at t=4,5,6, i.e., turns 16,17,18.\n\nNow, the player is starting at y=7 at turn t_1=12.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U (up), D (down), S (stay).\n\nIf I go up from y=7, I move to y=8 at the next turn.\n\nBut when I move, at turn T, I am at y_T, and I choose action, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nAt turn T, I am on freeway y_T.\n\nIf I choose action at turn T, I move to new position at turn T+1.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T based on y_T.\n\nSpecifically, at turn T, if y_T between 1 and 8, then check if 0 in span of cars on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nIf I am moving to a new freeway, I am not on it until T+1.\n\nNow, I start at turn 12, y=7.\n\nAt turn 12, I am on y=7. Need to check for collision at turn 12 on freeway 7.\n\nAt t=0 (relative), turn 12.\n\nFor freeway 7, at t=0, car spans:\n\nCar1: [-27 +4*0, -16 +4*0] = [-27,-16], 0 not in, since -16 <0? -16 is less than 0, so 0 not in [-27,-16], since -27 <= x <= -16, and 0 > -16, so not included.\n\nSimilarly, other cars, all spans away from 0.\n\nAt t=0, no car covers x=0 on freeway 7.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8.\n\nSo at turn 12, no collision on y=7.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, no freeway, so no cars, so once I reach y=9, I'm safe.\n\nBut I need to be at (0,9) at some turn, meaning that at turn T, y_T =9.\n\nAnd I need minimal H such that after H actions, I am at y=9.\n\nLet's define the sequence.\n\nAt turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, actions.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nSet y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nt_1=12, so after H turns, at turn 12+H, y=9.\n\nBut the actions are from turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1, so after H actions, turn is t_1 + H.\n\nFor example, at turn t_1, I take action a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nStart: turn 12, position y=7.\n\nAfter action a_{12}, I go to y_{13} = y_{12} + Δy_{12}\n\nThen at turn 13, I am at y_{13}, and so on.\n\nI need y_{12 + H} =9 for some H.\n\nMinimal H is at least 2, since from 7 to 9, need to go up twice.\n\nBut I might need to go around if there are collisions.\n\nNow, on freeway 7, collisions at turns 16,17,18.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8.\n\nTurns 16,17,18 are t=4,5,6 relative.\n\nNow, I start at turn 12.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nBut y=9 has no cars, so no issue.\n\nThe issue is when I am on y=7 or y=8 during the path.\n\nSince I need to go from 7 to 9, I must pass through y=8 or go directly, but I can only change by ±1 or 0 per turn.\n\nSo possible paths: go up to 8, then up to 9.\n\nOr stay at 7 for some turns, then go up, etc.\n\nBut minimal H=2 if I can go directly.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 when there is a collision at that turn.\n\nSpecifically, at turn T, if I am on y=7 or 8, and for that y, at that T, there is a car covering x=0.\n\nNow, for y=7, collision at T=16,17,18.\n\nSimilarly for y=8, same collision times.\n\nNow, at turn 12, I am at y=7, no collision.\n\nIf I go up at turn 12, then at turn 13, I am at y=8.\n\nThen if I go up at turn 13, at turn 14 I am at y=9.\n\nNow, check for collisions:\n\nAt turn 12: on y=7, T=12, t=0, no collision as above.\n\nAt turn 13: on y=8, T=13, t=1 relative to t_1.\n\nt=1, freeway 8: car spans at t=1:\n\nCar1: [-27 +4*1, -16 +4*1] = [-23, -12], 0 not in.\n\nCar2: [49+4, 60+4]= [53,64], not near 0.\n\nCar3: [13+4,24+4]=[17,28], not near 0.\n\nSo no collision at T=13 on y=8.\n\nThen at turn 14, I am at y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nSo with H=2, actions: at turn 12, U; turn 13, U.\n\nThen at turn 14, y=9.\n\nBut is turn 14 within the collision times? Collision at 16,17,18, so 14 is fine.\n\nBut I need to confirm for other freeways? No, only when I am on them.\n\nIn this path, I am on y=7 only at turn 12, and on y=8 at turn 13, both no collision.\n\nAnd y=9 at turn 14.\n\nSo minimal H=2 should be possible.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I do at turn 14.\n\nBut let me double-check the car positions.\n\nAt turn 12 (t=0), on y=7:\n\nCar1: [-27, -16], 0 not in.\n\nAt turn 13 (t=1), on y=8: same cars, spans [-27+4= -23, -16+4= -12], so [-23,-12], 0 not in, since -12 < 0? -12 is less than 0, so x=0 is to the right, not in the span.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut the player is at (0,y), so x=0.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should check if I need to be careful with other turns.\n\nBut in this case, no issue.\n\nBut let me see the other freeways. I have freeways 1 to 6, but I don't go there, so no need to worry.\n\nThe player starts at y=7 and goes to y=8 and y=9, so only freeways 7 and 8 matter.\n\nFreeways 1-6 have cars, but since I don't go to y=1-6, no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 and y=9 have no cars.\n\nSo only y=7 and y=8 when I am on them.\n\nIn the direct path, at turn 12 on y=7 safe, turn 13 on y=8 safe.\n\nBut at turn 13, I am on y=8, and cars on y=8 at T=13.\n\nAs above, safe.\n\nBut let me confirm the time.\n\nt_1=12.\n\nAt T=12, t=0: y=7, freeway 7 cars: car1 [-27,-16], not cover 0.\n\nAction: U, so y_{13} = 7+1=8.\n\nAt T=13, y=8, on freeway 8? Freeway y=8.\n\nCars on y=8 at T=13: t=1 relative, spans as above [-23,-12], etc., no cover 0.\n\nAction: U, y_{14}=8+1=9.\n\nAt T=14, y=9, no freeway, done.\n\nH=2 turns: actions at turn 12 and turn 13.\n\nSequence: turn 12: U, turn 13: U.\n\nThen at turn 14, position (0,9).\n\nBut the answer should be the actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nH is the number of actions, so after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position reached.\n\nHere H=2, actions at turn 12 and 13, position at turn 14.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1.\n\nSo a_{12}, a_{13}.\n\nNow, but the problem mentions cars on other freeways, like freeways 1-6, but I don't go there, so should be fine.\n\nBut let me see why it might not be direct.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car positions.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 7 has three cars, but only car1 is near negative x, others are positive.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in the state, freeway 4,5,6 have different cars.\n\nFreeway 4: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nh=-48, τ=-71? For right-moving.\n\nDirection right, so span at t_1: [τ, h] = [-71, -48] since τ=-71, h=-48.\n\ns=24.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 same, freeway 6 same.\n\nBut I'm not on these, so irrelevant.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3: (-48,-83,right,36), span [ -83, -48] s=36.\n\nAgain, not relevant.\n\nBut since I stay at y=7 and move up, no issue.\n\nPerhaps at some point if I stay longer, I might hit the collision times.\n\nBut in this case, I don't need to.\n\nBut let me see if there is a reason I cannot go directly.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider when I am on the freeway.\n\nAnother point: the collision at turn T only if on freeway y_T and 0 in span.\n\nIn my path, at T=12, on y=7, safe; T=13 on y=8, safe.\n\nT=14 on y=9, safe.\n\nBut what about turn 16,17,18? I am not on y=7 or 8 at that time, since I am at y=9.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier? But from y=7 to y=9, minimum 2 actions, so H=2 is minimal.\n\nUnless I can go in one action, but I can only change by 1, so no.\n\nSo H=2 should be fine.\n\nBut let me check the answer format.\n\nIt says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nBut in this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nBut why are there cars on other freeways? Maybe to tempt going down or something, but I don't need to.\n\nPerhaps I misread the player position.\n\nPlayer at (0,7), need to (0,9).\n\ny=7 to y=9.\n\nBut freeway 7 and 8 have collisions only at t=4,5,6, which is turns 16,17,18, after I have left.\n\nAt turn 12, I can leave immediately.\n\nPerhaps if I start later, but no, t_1=12 is now.\n\nAnother thing: the car on freeway 7, car1, at t=0, span [-27,-16], which is left of 0, and moving right, so at t=4, it reaches [-27+16, -16+16] = [-11,0], so at t=4, [ -11, 0], so 0 is included, since tail is at -11, head at 0? Span [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-27+16, -16+16] = [-11, 0] at t=4.\n\nNow, is 0 included? [ -11, 0 ], since it's a closed interval, I assume, so -11 <= x <= 0, so x=0 is included, yes, collision.\n\nSimilarly at t=5, [-27+20, -16+20] = [-7,4], 0 in it.\n\nt=6, [-27+24, -16+24]= [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nt=7, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in my path, I am not on y=7 or 8 at these times.\n\nAt turn 16, t=4, if I were on y=7 or 8, collision, but I am not.\n\nSo direct path should work.\n\nBut let me see the freeway 7 has multiple cars, but only car1 matters.\n\nSimilarly for 8.\n\nBut in the state, freeway 7 has three cars, but car2 and car3 are at positive x, moving right, so they are at [49+4t,60+4t] etc., which for t>=0, min 49>0, so 0 never covered.\n\nSimilarly car3 min 13>0.\n\nSo only car1 can cover 0.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nBut since I don't go there, fine.\n\nPerhaps the player could go down to avoid something, but no need.\n\nMaybe to reach faster, but H=2 is minimal.\n\nUnless I can reach in one turn, but impossible.\n\nSo I think the sequence is simple.\n\nBut let me confirm the initial position.\n\nPlayer at (0,7) at turn t_1=12.\n\nAction at turn 12: U, go to y=8 at turn 13.\n\nAt turn 13, on y=8, no collision, action U, go to y=9 at turn 14.\n\nDone.\n\nBut the answer should be for turns starting from t_1.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nBut H=2, and sequence for t=0 to H-1, which is t=0: turn12, t=1: turn13.\n\nThen position at turn 14.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", which is at turn 14.\n\nBut in the action sequence, it ends at turn 13.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I need to include the turn when I arrive, but no, the actions are up to when I set the position.\n\nAnother thing: when I am at y=9, I don't need to take action, I have arrived.\n\nSo H=2 actions.\n\nBut let me see if there is a constraint I missed.\n\nThe note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in Span(T) but not Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut in this case, not relevant.\n\nFor example, if I were moving to y=8 at turn T, I am on y=7 at turn T, so if cars on y=7 cover 0 at T, collision, but if cars on y=8 cover 0 at T, but I am not on y=8 yet, so no collision from y=8 cars at turn T.\n\nIn my case, no issue.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut why are there cars on freeway 4,5,6 with high speed? For example, freeway 4: car with τ=-71, h=-48, s=24, right-moving.\n\nSpan at t: [-71 +24t, -48 +24t]\n\n0 in this when -71+24t <=0 and -48+24t >=0.\n\n24t >=48 and 24t <=71? t >= 48/24=2, t <= 71/24≈2.958, so t=2? t=2: -71+48= -23, -48+48=0, so [ -23, 0], 0 included.\n\nt=3: -71+72=1, -48+72=24, [1,24], 0 not in.\n\nSo at t=2, T=14, if on freeway 4, collision.\n\nBut I am not on freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways have collisions at various times, but I don't care.\n\nSo back to my path.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut let me see the freeway 7 and 8 cars.\n\nAnother car: on freeway 7, there is a car at (24,13,right,4), which at t=0 [13,24], moving right, so it covers 0 only if it moves left, but it's moving right, so never.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think I'm overcomplicating.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, same as y=7.\n\nBut at turn 13, t=1, span for car1 on y=8: [-23,-12], not cover 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo sequence should be:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nBut the answer format should be boxed.\n\nBut H=2.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, it includes the actions.\n\nPerhaps I need to write it.\n\nBut let me see if I can do it in H=1? Impossible, from y=7 to y=9, must go through y=8, so at least two actions.\n\nUnless I can jump, but no, only ±1 or 0.\n\nSo H=2 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps if I go down, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=6, then I have to come back, H larger.\n\nNot minimal.\n\nSo I think direct up is best.\n\nBut why are there cars on freeway 1-3 and 4-6 with different speeds? Maybe if I had to go through them, but here not.\n\nPerhaps the player could be forced to go down if there was immediate collision, but at turn 12, no collision.\n\nAt turn 12 on y=7, safe.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car positions.\n\nFreeway 7: cars include (60,49,right,4), but that's [49,60] at t=0, far right.\n\nAnd (24,13,right,4) [13,24], also positive.\n\nOnly (-16,-27,right,4) which is [-27,-16], negative.\n\nAt t=0, not cover 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think the sequence is:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut in the answer format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for t_1=12.\n\nBut in the box.\n\nPerhaps I need to write the actions only.\n\nSince it says \"a_{t_1 + t}\", with t from 0.\n\nBut in text.\n\nI think that's it.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", but in the answer, it's the sequence, H is implied.\n\nIn the box, only the sequence.\n\nBut let me see the instruction.\n\n\"Answer Format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\"\n\nAnd H is not separately stated, but from the sequence.\n\nIn this case, two lines.\n\nBut for completeness.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to stay or something, but no.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 12, if I stay, y=7, then at turn 13, still y=7, no collision since t=1, spans [-23,-12] for car1, not cover 0.\n\nThen I can go up later, but H larger, not minimal.\n\nSimilarly, not necessary.\n\nSo I think H=2 with U,U is correct.\n\nBut let me check freeway 8 at turn 13.\n\nt=1, car1: [-27+4= -23, -16+4= -12], so [-23,-12], 0 not in, since -12 < 0.\n\nIf the span includes the endpoints, 0 not less than or equal to -12? -12 <= x <= -23? No.\n\n[ -23, -12 ] means x from -23 to -12, so x <= -12 and x >= -23.\n\nSince -23 <= x <= -12.\n\n0 > -12, so x=0 not in the interval.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis\n- The minimal path from \\(y = 7\\) to \\(y = 9\\) requires at least two upward moves (actions \\(U\\)), as each move changes the y-coordinate by at most \\(+1\\).\n- Collision occurs only if the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y \\leq 8\\)) at turn \\(T\\), and the x-position 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at \\(T\\).\n\n#### Car Collision Times for Relevant Freeways\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Cars are \\((-16, -27, \\text{right}, 4)\\), \\((60, 49, \\text{right}, 4)\\), and \\((24, 13, \\text{right}, 4)\\).\n  - Only the car with tail \\(\\tau = -27\\) and head \\(h = -16\\) (speed \\(s = 4\\)) can cover x=0.\n  - Span at time \\(T\\): \\([\\tau + s(T - 12), h + s(T - 12)] = [-27 + 4(T-12), -16 + 4(T-12)]\\).\n  - Collision when \\(0 \\in [-27 + 4(T-12), -16 + 4(T-12)]\\), which occurs for \\(T = 16, 17, 18\\).\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Cars are identical to freeway 7, so collision also occurs for \\(T = 16, 17, 18\\).\n- At turn \\(T = 12\\) (relative \\(t=0\\)):\n  - Freeway 7: Span for the relevant car is \\([-27, -16]\\), which does not contain 0. No collision.\n- At turn \\(T = 13\\) (relative \\(t=1\\)):\n  - Freeway 8: Span for the relevant car is \\([-23, -12]\\), which does not contain 0. No collision.\n\n### Path to Reach (0,9) in Minimal Turns\n- At turn 12, player is at (0,7). Action \\(U\\) moves to y=8 at turn 13.\n  - Turn 12: On freeway 7, no collision (as spans do not cover 0).\n- At turn 13, player is at (0,8). Action \\(U\\) moves to y=9 at turn 14.\n  - Turn 13: On freeway 8, no collision (as spans do not cover 0).\n- At turn 14, player is at (0,9), which has no cars and is the target.\n\nThis path achieves the goal in \\(H = 2\\) turns (actions at turns 12 and 13), with the position reached at turn 14. Since \\(H = 2\\) is the minimal possible (as moving from y=7 to y=9 requires at least two upward moves), and no collisions occur, this sequence is optimal.\n\n### Action Sequence\n- Turn 12: \\(U\\) (move up to y=8)\n- Turn 13: \\(U\\) (move up to y=9)\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\end{array} }",

Since y=9 is the top, and there are no freeways above it, I think y=9 is safe; no cars there. But I need to make sure that when I move to y=9, I don't get hit on the way or something.\n\nThe collision rule: collision occurs at turn T if, for the freeway y_T, 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T. And importantly, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. Let me read that carefully.\n\n\"if you decide to move to \\( y_{T+1} \\neq y_{T} \\) at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on \\( y_{T+1} \\) at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on \\( y_{T+1} \\) if \\( 0 \\in \\text{Span}(T) \\) but \\( 0 \\notin \\text{Span}(T+1) \\).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, I am on freeway y_T. If I stay (S), I remain on y_T for that turn. If I move up or down, I start on y_T and end on y_{T+1}, but during turn T, I am only on y_T for collision purposes. Then at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}.\n\nNow, the goal is to reach (0,9), so I need to be at y=9 at some turn, and since y=9 has no cars, once I'm there, I'm safe. But I need to get there without colliding on the way.\n\nCurrently at y=8, turn t1=13.\n\nI need to go to y=9. Since I'm at 8, to go to 9, I can just move up once, with action U. Then at the next turn, I'll be at y=9.\n\nBut I have to make sure that when I do that, I don't collide with cars on y=8 or something.\n\nWhen I move from y=8 to y=9, at turn T, I start on y=8, and during that turn, I am on y=8 for collision. Then after moving, at turn T+1, I am on y=9.\n\nBut y=9 has no cars, so no collision there. The only risk is during the move, when I'm on y=8 at turn T.\n\nSo, for turn T when I am at y=8 and I take action U, I need that at that turn, for freeway y=8, 0 is not in any car's span.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay or move down, but I need to go up, so moving up is direct.\n\nBut I need to check the car state on freeway 8 at turn t1=13.\n\nFirst, list the car states at turn t1=13.\n\nFreeway 8 has cars: (-12, -23, right, 4), (-48, -59, right, 4), (28, 17, right, 4)\n\nDirection is right, so these are right-moving cars.\n\nFor right-moving cars, the span is [tail, head] or [head, tail]? The notation says:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] meaning from tail to head, I think, since it moves right, tail is left, head is right.\n\nIn the update: for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left, but here all are right-moving.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but for right-moving, head should be greater than tail, I assume.\n\nLook: for freeway 8, cars: (-12, -23, right, 4), (-48, -59, right, 4), (28, 17, right, 4)\n\nFor the first one: head = -12, tail = -23? -12 > -23, so if right-moving, head is right, tail left, so from tail to head, it should be increasing.\n\n-23 to -12, which is from left to right, since numbers decrease to the left, I assume the x-axis, 0 is the point, left is negative, right positive.\n\nSo car at position, say, x from left to right.\n\nSo for a car, tail is left end, head is right end.\n\nFor right-moving car: at time t, span [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nThen at time T, span [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all right.\n\nNow, collision if at turn T, for freeway y_T, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nHere for freeway 8 at turn T.\n\nPlayer is at (0, y_T), so x=0 always.\n\nNow at current turn t1=13, player is at (0,8), so y_T=8.\n\nFor freeway 8, we need to check if 0 is in any car's span at turn 13.\n\nFirst, for each car on y=8:\n\nCar 1: head = -12, tail = -23, dir=right, s=4, at t=13.\n\nSpan at t=13: [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\n0 is between -23 and -12? -23 to -12, 0 is not in there since -12 > 0? -12 is negative, so -23 to -12, all negative, 0 is greater, so 0 not in [-23, -12].\n\nSimilarly, car 2: head = -48? tail = -59, so span [-59, -48], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nCar 3: head=28, tail=17, so span [17,28], all positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo at turn 13, on y=8, no car has span containing 0. So it's safe to be here.\n\nNow, I want to move to y=9. So I can take action U at turn 13.\n\nThen at turn 14, I will be at y=9.\n\nAt turn 13, when I take U, I am on y=8 during turn 13, which is safe as above.\n\nThen at turn 14, I am on y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nAnd I've reached y=9 in one action: from turn 13 to turn 14.\n\nH should be the number of turns, I think H is the number of actions or turns taken.\n\nLet's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so for H actions, from time t to t+H-1.\n\nAt turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nStart at t1, which is 13.\n\nAfter H turns, I reach at turn t1 + H.\n\nLet's see the position.\n\nPlayer update: at turn t, I take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo at turn t, I am at position y_t.\n\nI take action a_t, which sets y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}.\n\nIn terms of collision, at turn t, I am on y_t, and collision depends on cars on y_t at time t.\n\nFor the goal, I need to be at (0,9) at some turn, say at turn T, y_T =9.\n\nSince y_{t+1} is set at turn t.\n\nI start at turn t1=13, y=8.\n\nI want to reach a state where y_t =9 for some t >= t1.\n\nMinimal t - t1.\n\nWith actions from t=t1 to t=t1 + H -1, so H actions, and after H actions, I am at turn t1 + H, with y_{t1+H}.\n\nAfter H actions, I have executed H actions, starting from turn t1, after k actions, I am at turn t1 + k, position y_{t1+k}.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn t1, position y_{t1}.\n\nAfter one action at turn t1, I go to turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}.\n\nSo to be at y=9, I need y_{t1 + H} =9 for some H.\n\nAnd H is the number of turns from start, I think.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to H-1, that's H actions.\n\nThen after these, at time t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nAlso, during the actions, no collision.\n\nIn this case, at turn t1=13, y=8.\n\nI can take a_{13} = U, then y_{14} = 8 +1 =9.\n\nAt turn 13, I am on y=8, which is safe as we saw.\n\nAt turn 14, I am on y=9, safe.\n\nSo H=1, and action at turn 13: U.\n\nBut let me confirm if at turn 13, y=8 is safe.\n\nCars on y=8:\n\nCar1: span at t=13: [τ, h] = [-23, -12] for the first one? Head and tail.\n\nIn the state: (-12, -23, right, 4), so head=-12, tail=-23? But for right-moving, tail should be left, so if tail=-23, head=-12, so span from x=-23 to x=-12.\n\n0 is not in [-23,-12].\n\nSimilarly, second car: (-48, -59, right, 4), head=-48, tail=-59, so span [-59,-48], 0 not in.\n\nThird car: (28,17,right,4), head=28, tail=17, so span [17,28], 0 not in.\n\nYes, all clear at t=13.\n\nNow, when I take U at t=13, I am on y=8 at t=13, safe.\n\nThen at t=14, on y=9, no cars.\n\nBut is y=9 a freeway? The freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think.\n\nThe vertical axis y=0,1,2,...,9.\n\nFreeways are for y=1 to 8, as per \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,…,8.\"\n\nAnd y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there.\n\nSo when on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nIn this case, from y=8, move up to y=9.\n\nBut in the action, I need to specify for turn t1.\n\nBut let me see if there is any reason I cannot do this immediately.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider future turns if I delay, but since I can go directly, H=1 should be minimal.\n\nBut let me check if at turn 13, if I take U, is there any issue?\n\nAnother thing: when I move to y=9, at turn 13, I take action U, so during turn 13, I am on y=8, and after action, at turn 14, on y=9.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut let me confirm the car positions at turn 13 for y=8.\n\nThe cars are moving, but at exactly turn 13, we have the spans as above.\n\nNow, for other freeways, but since I'm only on y=8 at that turn, I don't care about others.\n\nSo it seems straightforward.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I can do it in one move.\n\nBut let me look at the car states; there are multiple freeways, but I don't need to go through them since I start at y=8.\n\ny=8 is freeway, and I need to leave it to y=9.\n\nPerhaps I should check if for some reason I cannot move up immediately.\n\nMaybe at the next turn, but no.\n\nAnother thought: when I move to y=9, it might be that at the same turn, but no.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the position at the beginning of turn.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, at future turns, but since I'm moving now, I only care about turn 13.\n\nBut let me see the car updates to be thorough.\n\nThe cars are moving, but at turn 13, it's safe.\n\nFor example, car on y=8, first car: at t=13, span [-23,-12], moving right at speed 4.\n\nAt turn 14, span [-23 +4(1), -12 +4(1)] = [-19, -8], still negative, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, others, but I don't care for turn 14 if I'm not on y=8.\n\nIn this case, I'm moving away.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways have cars, but I'm not on them.\n\nSo I think H=1, action U at turn 13.\n\nBut the player is at (0,8), which is on freeway 8.\n\nNow, the answer should be just one action.\n\nBut let me see the format.\n\n\"minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nH is the number of actions, I think.\n\nIn the sequence, for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nSo for H=1, only one action: at t1 + 0 = t1.\n\nSo Turn t1: a_{t1}\n\nWhich is U.\n\nBut the turn is t1=13, so Turn 13: U\n\nThen done.\n\nBut is there a possibility that I need to wait or something?\n\nSuppose that at turn 13, if I take U, but if 0 was in some span, but it's not.\n\nPerhaps for other y, but I'm not moving to other y.\n\nAnother thing: the goal is to reach (0,9), and I start at (0,8), so moving up is direct.\n\nBut let me check if y=9 is reachable, but it is.\n\nPerhaps I need to be at (0,9) at a turn where it's safe, but since no cars, always safe.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut why are there other freeways listed? Maybe for other positions, but here not needed.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I were at a different y, but here I'm at y=8.\n\nBut let me read the task again.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions to reach (0,9)\"\n\nCurrent position (0,8), turn 13.\n\nCars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nBut freeway 8 has cars, but at turn 13, safe.\n\nPerhaps I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut H=1 seems too small, or am I missing something?\n\nAnother point: the car states for freeway 7 and 8 are similar, but freeway 7 is not relevant since I'm not on it.\n\nFreeway 7: same cars as 8? No, freeway 7 has: (-12,-23,right,4), (-48,-59,right,4), (28,17,right,4) same as freeway 8.\n\nIn the table:\n\nFreeway 7: (-12,-23,right,4), (-48,-59,right,4), (28,17,right,4)\n\nFreeway 8: same.\n\nBut for y=7, I don't care.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 1 to 6 have different cars, but all with large negative spans, so 0 not in, but since I'm not on them, irrelevant.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-12,-47,right,36), span at t=13: [-47,-12], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly all.\n\nBut at turn 13, I'm on y=8, which is safe.\n\nSo I think moving up immediately is fine.\n\nBut let me think if there is a constraint I missed.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with y in [0,9], so from y=8, U to 9, D to 7, S to 8.\n\nAll possible.\n\nAnd collision only when on freeway y=1 to 8.\n\nAt y=0 or 9, no collision.\n\nSo from y=8 to y=9, with U, should work.\n\nPerhaps the issue is that when I am at y=8 and take U, I leave y=8 during the turn, but the collision is checked at the beginning or during?\n\nThe collision rule says: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"at turn T\", I think it's discrete, so at each turn, we check if the player is on a freeway and if 0 is in some car span on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAnd for the action, when I take action at turn T, it affects y_{T+1}, but the position during turn T is y_T for collision.\n\nIn this case, at turn T=13, y_T=8, and I take action, which sets y_{14}, but during turn 13, I am on y=8, so collision depends on cars on y=8 at turn 13.\n\nAs above, no collision.\n\nThen at turn 14, y=9, no cars, no collision.\n\nSo I reach at turn 14.\n\nH is the number of actions, so from turn 13 to 14, one action, H=1.\n\nSequence: only a_{t1} = a_{13} = U.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\" for each turn.\n\nFor H=1, only one line.\n\nBut let me see if H can be 0, but no, I need to reach y=9, I'm at y=8, so at least one action.\n\nH=1 is minimal.\n\nBut perhaps there is a problem with the cars at turn 13 for y=8.\n\nCar 3: (28,17,right,4), span [17,28], which is positive, but 0 is not in, so safe.\n\nUnless the span includes 0, but it doesn't.\n\nPerhaps the direction: all right-moving, so positions increasing.\n\nAnother thing: in the car state, for the third car, (28,17,right,4), but 28 and 17, if head=28, tail=17, and right-moving, so at t=13, span [17,28], yes.\n\nAt t=14, [17+4,28+4]=[21,32], still not 0.\n\nBut irrelevant.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8, the cars are such that at turn 13, 0 is not covered, but if I stay, it might be covered later, but I'm not staying.\n\nSo I should just go.\n\nBut let me calculate the position for other turns to see.\n\nSuppose I don't move immediately, but that would take more turns, so H larger, not minimal.\n\nSo H=1 should be minimal.\n\nPerhaps I need to avoid when moving, but no.\n\nAnother idea: when I take action U at turn 13, I move to y=9, but during the move, if there is a car at the boundary or something, but the collision is only at the turn, discrete, not during the move.\n\nThe problem says \"collision occurs at turn T\", and it's based on the span at that exact turn.\n\nSo I think it's discrete, no issue with moving between.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut why are the other freeways listed? Maybe for other starting positions, but here not.\n\nPerhaps I misread the position.\n\nPlayer position: (0,8), and freeway y=8.\n\ny=8 is a freeway, yes.\n\nFreeways y=1 to 8, so y=8 is included.\n\nAnd I need to reach y=9, which is not a freeway.\n\nSo from freeway to non-freeway.\n\nBut in this case, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps for y=9, since it's not freeway, no cars, but when I am at y=9, I am at the position, but no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly for y=0.\n\nSo I think no issue.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=1, action U at turn 13.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: U\n}\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so for t1=13.\n\nAnd H=1.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbering.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=13, player at (0,8).\n\nAction at turn 13: U, then at turn 14, at (0,9).\n\nReached in one action.\n\nPerhaps the sequence includes the turns from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nFor H=1, only turn t1.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n\nBut I feel like it might be a trick, because the cars on other freeways are given, and speeds, but not needed.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8, the cars are moving, but at t=13, safe.\n\nAnother thing: the car with (28,17,right,4), but 28 and 17, if tail=17, head=28, so [17,28], but 17 to 28, 0 not in.\n\nBut is there a car that covers 0 at some other time?\n\nFor example, if I were to stay on y=8, at turn 14, span [21,32], still not 0.\n\nTurn 15, [25,36], etc., never covers 0, since min x=17 increasing.\n\nSimilarly, other cars are negative, moving away or towards, but car1: [-23,-12] at t=13, moving right, at t=14 [-19,-8], etc., approaching 0 but from left, and since speed 4, it will take several turns to reach positive, but let's see when it covers 0.\n\nCar1: span [ -23 +4(t-13), -12 +4(t-13) ]\n\nSet left end = -23 +4(t-13) =0 when 4(t-13)=23, t-13=23/4=5.75, so at t=18.75, but discrete, at t=19, left= -23+4(6)= -23+24=1, right= -12+24=12, so at t=19, span [1,12], contains 0? 1 to 12, 0 not in, since 1>0.\n\nAt t=18, left= -23+4(5)= -23+20=-3, right=-12+20=8, span [-3,8], which includes 0, since -3<=0<=8.\n\nAt t=18, span [-3,8], yes, 0 in there.\n\nSimilarly, car2: [-59,-48] at t=13, moving right, left= -59+4(t-13), set to 0: -59+4(t-13)=0, 4(t-13)=59, t-13=14.75, so at t=28, left= -59+4(15)= -59+60=1, right=-48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nAt t=27, left= -59+4(14)= -59+56=-3, right=-48+56=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nBut for y=8, at t=18, car1 has span [-3,8], so 0 in, so if player on y=8 at t=18, collision.\n\nSimilarly, car3 never near 0.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm moving away at t=13, not staying, no problem.\n\nSo for immediate move, it's fine.\n\nThus, I think H=1 is correct.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that to reach y=9, I need to be there at some turn, and with one action I can.\n\nSo I should go with that.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 13\\).
