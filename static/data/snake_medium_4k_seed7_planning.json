        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 0, and the snake is at position (3,3) with direction L, meaning it's moving left. The snake has only one segment, which is the head, since it's just [(3,3)]. So the length is 1.\n\nThe walls are defined: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). I should list all wall cells:\n\n- Border: all x=0, all x=7, all y=0, all y=7. So cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), and (0,7) to (7,7). Since it's the borders, it's the outer edges.\n\n- Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). Note that (1,4) and (1,5) are listed, but (1,2) is also there. So for x=1, y=2,4,5 are obstacles.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (1,1) with value 1, life span 10\n\n- (5,5) with value 1, life span 10\n\n- (4,3) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food has value +1, so positive food. Life span 10 means they disappear after 10 turns, including the current turn, so countdown decreases each turn.\n\nSnake head is at (3,3), moving left. Since it's only one segment, there's no body to worry about except that if it grows, it will have a body.\n\nCurrent possible moves: since head direction is L (left), I can move L, U, or D, but not R because that would be instant reverse. Rule says: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So from left, I can go left, up, or down, but not right.\n\nDirections:\n\n- U: (x, y+1)\n\n- D: (x, y-1)\n\n- L: (x-1, y)\n\n- R: (x+1, y)\n\nHead at (3,3), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Left: to (2,3)\n\n- Up: to (3,4)\n\n- Down: to (3,2)\n\nCannot go right to (4,3) because that's opposite direction.\n\nBut (4,3) has food! (4,3) is a food position with value 1, life span 10.\n\nSince the snake is at (3,3), and food is at (4,3), but I can't move right because it's opposite direction. So I can't get that food directly this turn.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls:\n\n- Borders: so cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n\n- Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n\nAlso, for x=1, y=2,4,5 are obstacles, so (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) are walls.\n\nFood at: (1,1), (5,5), (4,3)\n\nSnake at (3,3), head direction L.\n\nNow, possible actions this turn (turn 0):\n\n- Move L to (2,3)\n\n- Move U to (3,4)\n\n- Move D to (3,2)\n\nI need to consider the food at (4,3). Since I can't move to it directly, and the snake is on (3,3), but (4,3) has food, but it's not under the snake body because snake is only at (3,3), so (4,3) is free. But I can't move there because I can't reverse direction.\n\nAccording to the food mechanics, food can spawn under snake body, but here it's not under, it's adjacent. But I can't eat it now.\n\nIf I move away and come back later, I might eat it, but it has life span 10, so it will disappear after 10 turns if not eaten.\n\nSimilarly, other foods.\n\nNow, let's think about safety and pathing.\n\nSince the snake is length 1, moving to any adjacent cell is safe as long as not wall or obstacle.\n\nCheck possible moves:\n\n- L to (2,3): what is at (2,3)? Is it wall? x=2, y=3. Borders are x=0,7; y=0,7, so (2,3) is not border. Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). (2,3) not in list, so free. But is there food? Food at (1,1), (5,5), (4,3), so (2,3) no food.\n\n- U to (3,4): (3,4) - not border, not obstacle (obstacles at x=1 or x=5,4, etc., (3,4) x=3,y=4 not in obstacles), no food.\n\n- D to (3,2): (3,2) - not border, obstacles: (5,2) is obstacle, but (3,2) x=3,y=2, not (5,2), so free. No food.\n\n(4,3) has food, but I can't go there.\n\nIf I move L to (2,3), then from there, I can go L, U, D, but not R (since if I moved L, direction is L, so can't go R).\n\nSimilarly, if I go U to (3,4), direction U, then can go U, L, R, not D.\n\nIf go D to (3,2), direction D, can go D, L, R, not U.\n\nNow, I need to eat food to grow and score points.\n\nFood at (1,1), (5,5), (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is right next to me, but I can't reach it this turn.\n\nLife span is 10 for all, so I have time.\n\nBut let's see the grid layout to avoid dead ends.\n\nInternal obstacles at (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), so for x=1, y=2,4,5 are walls, meaning the column x=1 has walls at y=2,4,5, so it's partially blocked.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) and (4,4) are obstacles.\n\n(4,4) is obstacle, and (5,2) obstacle.\n\nFood at (1,1): (1,1) is not an obstacle, since obstacles are (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), so (1,1) is free and has food.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) free, (4,3) free.\n\nNow, to reach (4,3), since I can't go directly, I need to move away and come back later, but after moving, the direction changes.\n\nFor example, if I move up to (3,4), then from (3,4), I can move right to (4,4), but (4,4) is an obstacle! (4,4) is an internal obstacle, wall.\n\nSo from (3,4), moving R to (4,4) is invalid, wall.\n\nSimilarly, moving L to (2,4), or U to (3,5), or D to (3,3), but (3,3) is where I came from, but since snake is short, it might be empty now, but when I move, the tail moves, but here snake length 1, so after move, old position is empty.\n\nCurrent turn, snake at (3,3), after move, say to (3,4), then new position is [(3,4)], and (3,3) is free.\n\nBut for moving back, it might be possible, but with direction.\n\nSimilarly, if I move down to (3,2), from there I can go L to (2,2), R to (4,2), or D to (3,1), etc.\n\n(4,2) is not obstacle? Obstacles: (5,2) is wall, but (4,2) is not listed, so free.\n\n(5,2) is wall, but (4,2) is not, so ok.\n\nBack to (4,3): I need to get to (4,3) to eat the food there.\n\nSince I can't go directly, I can go to a neighboring cell and then to (4,3).\n\nFor example, from (3,3), I can go up to (3,4), but from (3,4), I can go right to (4,4), but (4,4) is wall, so not possible.\n\nI can go down to (3,2), then from (3,2) I can go right to (4,2), then from (4,2) I can go up to (4,3), which has food.\n\n(4,2) to (4,3) is up.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,3), I could go left to (2,3), then from (2,3) I can go down to (2,2), then right to (3,2), etc., but that might not help for (4,3).\n\nBut (4,3) is close, so going to (3,2) then (4,2) then (4,3) might be a way.\n\nBut that takes two moves to get to (4,3) from now.\n\nTurn 0: move to (3,2) down\n\nThen turn 1: from (3,2), move to (4,2) right? Direction: if I move down to (3,2), new direction is D, so I can move right to (4,2), since from down, right is not opposite.\n\nThen turn 2: from (4,2), direction now R (since I moved right), I can move up to (4,3) to eat the food.\n\n(4,3) has food, so on turn 2, I can eat it.\n\nLife span is 10, so it will be there for 10 turns, from turn 0, so after 10 moves, it disappears. Since countdown decreases each turn including current, at turn 0, life span 10, after turn 0, it becomes 9, and so on, until turn 10 it disappears, I think.\n\nTurn t, food has life span L, after turn t, L decreases by 1, so at turn t, if L=10, it will be gone after turn t+9? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, if life_span is L, after this turn, it becomes L-1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or after? It says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns have passed, it is removed.\n\nFor example, at turn t, L=10, after turn t (t+0), L=9; after turn t+1, L=8, ..., after turn t+9, L=0, and it disappears before turn t+10 or after? The countdown decreases every turn including current, so at the start of turn t, L is the remaining life.\n\nAt the beginning of turn 0, food has life span 10. After turn 0 is processed, life span decreases to 9. Similarly, after turn 9, it decreases to 0, and then it disappears, so it is not available on turn 10.\n\nFor food at (4,3), life span 10 at turn 0, so it will be available until after turn 9? Let's see:\n\n- Start of turn 0: life span 10\n\n- After turn 0: life span 9 (still there)\n\n- ...\n\n- After turn 9: life span 0, then it disappears, so not available for turn 10.\n\nSo it can be eaten from turn 0 to turn 9 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow back to the plan.\n\nI could go directly towards other food.\n\nBut (4,3) is very close, only two moves away if I go down then right then up.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nFrom (3,3), move D to (3,2) on turn 0.\n\nThen at turn 1, snake at (3,2), direction D, can move R to (4,2) (since not opposite).\n\nThen at turn 2, snake at (4,2), direction R, can move U to (4,3) to eat the food.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows to length 2, with head at (4,3), and tail at (4,2)? Positions: before eating, at turn 2, before move, snake is at [(4,2)] if we moved to (4,2) on turn 1.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 0 start: snake [(3,3)], head dir L.\n\nTurn 0: move D to (3,2). After move, snake is [(3,2)], new dir D.\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,2). After move, snake is [(4,2)], new dir R.\n\nTurn 2: move U to (4,3). (4,3) has food, so eat it, snake grows, so positions become [(4,3), (4,2)]? When you move to a food cell, you eat it and grow, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nRule: when head moves onto food, it eats it, length increases by 1, and the new segment is added at the tail, so the tail stays in place that turn.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: when you eat, you grow, so after moving to food, the head is on food, and the tail remains, so length increases.\n\nFor example, turn 1: snake at [(4,2)], no food there.\n\nTurn 2: move to (4,3), which has food, so eat it, now snake has head at (4,3), and the previous position (4,2) becomes body, so snake is [(4,3), (4,2)], length 2.\n\nDirection now U.\n\nNow, after eating, I have a body at (4,2).\n\nNow, I need to avoid colliding with body.\n\nAlso, there is a danger with tail if food is on tail and head adjacent, but here not the case.\n\nNow, other foods: (1,1) and (5,5).\n\n(1,1) is at bottom-left, (5,5) at top-right.\n\nWith obstacles, let's see the grid to find a path.\n\nFirst, let's list all wall cells for clarity.\n\nBorder walls: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n\nSo for x=1, y=1 is free (food), y=2 wall, y=3 free? (1,3) not listed, so free, but no food mentioned, just empty.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) wall, (1,5) wall.\n\nx=4, y=4 is wall (obstacle).\n\nx=5, y=2 is wall.\n\nNow, free cells.\n\nAfter eating (4,3), I am at (4,3) with body at (4,2).\n\nI need to go to other food.\n\n(1,1) or (5,5).\n\n(5,5) might be easier, or (1,1).\n\nBut with obstacles, let's see paths.\n\nFirst, from (4,3), I can move U, D, L, R, but direction is U now? After moving U to (4,3), direction is U.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (4,4), but (4,4) is obstacle, wall, so cannot.\n\nD to (4,2), but (4,2) is the body! Snake body at (4,2), so if I move down to (4,2), head touches body, collision, death.\n\nCannot.\n\nL to (3,3), which should be free now, since only snake is at (4,3) and (4,2).\n\n(3,3) was previous position, but empty.\n\nR to (5,3), which is free, I think. x=5,y=3, not border, not obstacle (obstacles (5,2) but y=3, so free).\n\n(5,3) is free.\n\nSo from (4,3), direction U, possible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,4) wall, invalid\n\n- D: to (4,2) body, collision, invalid\n\n- L: to (3,3) free\n\n- R: to (5,3) free\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nNow, moving L to (3,3) or R to (5,3).\n\nIf I move L to (3,3), then snake moves, head to (3,3), tail from (4,2) moves? After eating, the tail doesn't move that turn, but on subsequent moves, when not eating, tail moves.\n\nAt turn 2, after eating, snake is at [(4,3), (4,2)]\n\nTurn 3: I move to a new cell, say (3,3).\n\nThen head moves to (3,3), and since no food there, tail moves, so the tail at (4,2) is removed, and new positions: head (3,3), body (4,3)? Let's see: positions before move: head (4,3), body (4,2)\n\nAfter moving head to (3,3), tail moves to the previous body position? Standard snake: the head moves to new cell, and each segment moves to the next position, so the body segment at (4,3) moves to where the head was? Positions: indices.\n\nSnake segments: position 0: head, position 1: body.\n\nAfter moving head to new cell, the body segment moves to the previous head position.\n\nSo from [(4,3), (4,2)] move head to (3,3), then new positions: head at (3,3), and body at (4,3) because the body moves to where head was.\n\nThen the tail (4,2) is gone, so snake is [(3,3), (4,3)], length 2.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (5,3), head to (5,3), body to (4,3), snake [(5,3), (4,3)].\n\nNow, back to turn 0, I need to decide the first move.\n\nI was thinking of going to (4,3) via down then right then up.\n\nBut let's see if that is the best.\n\nThere is food at (1,1) and (5,5).\n\n(1,1) might be tricky because of obstacles at x=1, y=2,4,5, so to reach (1,1), I can go from (1,0) but y=0 is wall, so only from above or right, but (1,1) has neighbors: (1,0) wall, (1,2) wall, (0,1) wall, (2,1) free.\n\n(2,1) is free, not wall.\n\nSo I can approach from (2,1).\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) has neighbors: (5,4), (5,6) but y=6, y=7 is border? y from 0 to 7, so y=7 is wall.\n\n(5,5): left (4,5), right (6,5), up (5,6), down (5,4).\n\n(6,5) not wall, (5,6) not wall, etc., but (4,4) is obstacle, but (4,5) is free, I think.\n\n(4,5): x=4,y=5, not border, obstacles: (4,4) is obstacle, but (4,5) not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) free, (5,6) free if y=6 not border, y=6 is not y=0 or7, so free.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=1 to6 are free except obstacles.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are walls, so for y, cells with y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n\nSimilarly for x.\n\nSo for (5,5), possible approaches.\n\nBut let's think long term.\n\nPerhaps I should consider going for (1,1) first, since (4,3) is close but I can't get it immediately.\n\nAnother idea: from (3,3), I can move left to (2,3), then from there, I can go to (1,3) or other, to reach (1,1) eventually.\n\nBut (1,1) has a life span of 10, so I have time.\n\nSimilarly for (5,5).\n\nBut (4,3) will disappear after 10 turns, but it's close, so I should eat it soon.\n\nIn the path I thought, I can eat it on turn 2.\n\nIf I do something else, it might be gone or I might not get it.\n\nFor example, if I move up or left first, I might not be able to get back in time.\n\nLife span 10, from turn 0, available until turn 9, so I have 10 turns to eat it.\n\nBut since it's only 2 moves away, easy to get.\n\nMoreover, after eating, I grow, which might help or hinder, but since grid has space, should be ok.\n\nNow, after eating (4,3), I am at (4,3) with body at (4,2), and I can only move left or right, as I saw earlier.\n\nIf I move left to (3,3), then I can go towards (1,1) or other.\n\nIf I move right to (5,3), towards (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), and there is obstacle at (5,2), but (5,3) is free.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can go up to (5,4), then to (5,5), but (5,5) has food, so I can eat it.\n\nBut from (4,3), if I move right to (5,3) on turn 3, then turn 4 move to (5,4), turn 5 move to (5,5) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I go left, to (1,1).\n\nBut (1,1) is farther.\n\nLet's simulate the sequence if I go for (4,3) first.\n\nTurn 0: move D to (3,2)\n\nThen snake at (3,2), dir D\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,2)\n\nSnake at (4,2), dir R\n\nTurn 2: move U to (4,3) — eat food, grow to length 2, positions [(4,3), (4,2)], dir U\n\nNow turn 3: from (4,3), dir U, possible moves:\n\nU to (4,4) wall, invalid\n\nD to (4,2) body, invalid\n\nL to (3,3) free\n\nR to (5,3) free\n\nSay I move L to (3,3)\n\nThen head to (3,3), no food, tail moves to (4,3), so snake now [(3,3), (4,3)]\n\nDir now L (since moved left)\n\nFrom (3,3), I can go to (1,1) or other.\n\n(1,1) is at (1,1), I need to go left and down.\n\nFrom (3,3), dir L, can move L, U, D.\n\nMove L to (2,3)\n\nThen to (1,3), but (1,3) is free? Not obstacle, but no food.\n\nThen from (1,3), I can go down to (1,2), but (1,2) is obstacle! (1,2) is internal obstacle, wall.\n\nSo cannot go to (1,2).\n\nFrom (1,3), I can go down? (1,2) is wall, so cannot go down.\n\nLeft to (0,3) but x=0 wall.\n\nRight to (2,3), back.\n\nUp to (1,4), but (1,4) is obstacle, wall.\n\nSo (1,3) is a dead end! Because all adjacent except (2,3) are walls or obstacles.\n\n(1,3) neighbors: left (0,3) wall, right (2,3) free, up (1,4) wall (obstacle), down (1,2) wall (obstacle). So only accessible from (2,3), and once there, only way out is back to (2,3). So if snake goes to (1,3), it can only go back, and if body is behind, it might collide.\n\nBut since I have body, if I go to (1,3), and then must go back, but the body might be at (2,3) or something, causing collision.\n\nFor example, from (3,3) move L to (2,3), snake [(2,3), (4,3)]? Positions: before move, [(3,3), (4,3)], move head to (2,3), no food, so tail moves to (3,3), snake [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\nDir L.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can move L to (1,3), since possible.\n\nMove to (1,3), no food, so tail moves to (2,3), snake [(1,3), (2,3)]\n\nNow at (1,3), as above, only possible move is back to (2,3), but (2,3) is now the body, so if I move to (2,3), head touches body, collision, death.\n\nTherefore, (1,3) is a dead end and should be avoided when snake has body.\n\nSo I cannot go to (1,3) at all if I have a body, or even if not, but since I will have body, it's dangerous.\n\nBetter to avoid that area.\n\nTo reach (1,1), I need to go through (2,1) or (1,0) but (1,0) y=0 wall, so only (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is free.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can go down to (3,2), then left to (2,2), then down to (2,1), then left to (1,1).\n\n(2,1) to (1,1) is left.\n\nNow, (2,2) is free? x=2,y=2, not border, not obstacle, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) free.\n\n(1,1) free with food.\n\nBut from (1,1), after eating, I need to be able to get out.\n\n(1,1) neighbors: (1,0) wall, (1,2) wall, (0,1) wall, (2,1) free. So only exit is to (2,1).\n\nSo if I eat at (1,1), I must immediately go to (2,1) to avoid being trapped, but since I grow, it might be ok, but I need to have a path.\n\nAfter eating at (1,1), snake head at (1,1), body at previous position, say (2,1), then I can only move to (2,1)? No, from (1,1), I can move to (2,1), but (2,1) is the body, so collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf I move to (1,1) to eat, and previous head was at (2,1), then after eating, snake is [(1,1), (2,1)]? Positions: before move to (1,1), say head at (2,1), I move to (1,1) to eat, so after eating, head at (1,1), and body at (2,1), since I grew, tail stays, so positions [(1,1), (2,1)].\n\nThen from (1,1), the only possible move is to (2,1), but (2,1) is body, so collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat (1,1) if I approach from (2,1), because after eating, I am trapped and collide on next move.\n\nI must approach (1,1) from a different direction, but (1,1) only has one neighbor, (2,1), since others are walls. So impossible to eat (1,1) without colliding later?\n\nUnless the snake is longer and I have a way to move, but with only one way in, after eating, I must move back, but the body is there, so collision is inevitable.\n\nFor example, if I come from (2,1) to (1,1), eat, grow, then next move I have to go back to (2,1), but it's occupied by body, so die.\n\nIf I have a longer snake, same issue, the body is behind.\n\nSo (1,1) is a dead end for eating; I cannot eat it safely because after eating, I have no escape.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nThe only adjacent cell is (2,1), and after eating, that cell has the body segment, so moving to it causes collision.\n\nTherefore, I should avoid (1,1) entirely; it's impossible to eat without dying immediately after.\n\nSimilarly, for any food in a dead end with only one access.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\n(1,1) neighbors:\n\n- North: (1,2) — obstacle, wall\n\n- South: (1,0) — y=0, border wall\n\n- West: (0,1) — x=0, border wall\n\n- East: (2,1) — free cell\n\nSo yes, only one neighbor, (2,1).\n\nTherefore, to eat (1,1), I must move from (2,1) to (1,1), eating it, then head at (1,1), body at (2,1), and I can only move to (2,1), which is body, collision.\n\nSo I cannot eat (1,1) safely. It's a trap.\n\nTherefore, I should ignore (1,1) and not go for it.\n\nSimilarly, for other such positions.\n\nNow, what about (5,5)?\n\n(5,5) neighbors:\n\n- North: (5,6) — y=6, not border, no obstacle, free\n\n- South: (5,4) — free\n\n- West: (4,5) — free, but (4,4) is obstacle, but (4,5) is different\n\n- East: (6,5) — free\n\n(4,5) is free, since obstacles only (4,4), not (4,5).\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) free, (5,6) free, (6,5) free.\n\nSo (5,5) has multiple exits: to (5,6), (5,4), (4,5), (6,5).\n\nAll free, so I can eat it safely and move away.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) has multiple neighbors: (4,2), (4,4) but (4,4) wall, (3,3), (5,3), etc., so not dead end.\n\nBut (4,4) wall, so from (4,3), north is blocked, but south, east, west are possible except when body is there.\n\nBut in general, not dead end.\n\nSo for (1,1), it's impossible to eat safely, so I should not attempt it.\n\nTherefore, I can ignore (1,1).\n\nFood at (5,5) and (4,3) are both safe to eat.\n\n(4,3) is closer.\n\nNow, back to turn 0.\n\nSnake at (3,3), dir L.\n\nI want to eat (4,3) soon.\n\nAs before, move down to (3,2) on turn 0.\n\nThen move right to (4,2) on turn 1.\n\nThen move up to (4,3) on turn 2 to eat.\n\nAfter that, at turn 2, snake at [(4,3), (4,2)] dir U.\n\nThen on turn 3, I need to move, and I can go left to (3,3) or right to (5,3).\n\nIf I go left to (3,3), then I might go towards (5,5) or something, but (5,5) is at (5,5), so from (3,3), it's farther.\n\nIf I go right to (5,3), closer to (5,5).\n\nFrom (5,3), I can go up to (5,4), then to (5,5).\n\nBut (5,4) is free, yes.\n\nAlso, there is obstacle at (5,2), but we are at y=3 and above.\n\nNow, after eating (4,3), at turn 2, I am at (4,3) with body at (4,2).\n\nOn turn 3, if I move right to (5,3), then head to (5,3), no food (food at (5,5)), so tail moves to (4,3), snake [(5,3), (4,3)] dir R.\n\nThen turn 4: from (5,3), dir R, can move U to (5,4), D to (5,2), but (5,2) is obstacle! (5,2) is internal obstacle, wall.\n\nOr L to (4,3), but (4,3) is body now, collision.\n\nOr R to (6,3).\n\nSo possible: U to (5,4) or R to (6,3).\n\nSay move U to (5,4), then snake head to (5,4), tail to (5,3)? Positions: before move [(5,3), (4,3)], move head to (5,4), no food, tail moves to (5,3), so snake [(5,4), (5,3)] dir U.\n\nThen turn 5: from (5,4), dir U, move U to (5,5) to eat food.\n\n(5,5) has food, so eat, grow, snake now [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3)]? After eating, tail stays, so head at (5,5), body at (5,4) and (5,3), so positions [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3)] dir U.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut life span is 10 for (5,5), so I can eat it around turn 5.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) eaten at turn 2.\n\nNow, what about the other food? (1,1) is not safe, so ignore.\n\nBut there might be other options.\n\nAt turn 0, I could move left to (2,3), but then I might not get (4,3) easily.\n\nFor example, turn 0 move L to (2,3), then dir L.\n\nTurn 1, from (2,3), can move L to (1,3), but as we saw, (1,3) is dead end, dangerous.\n\nOr move U to (2,4), or D to (2,2).\n\nIf move D to (2,2), then to (2,1), but (2,1) is near (1,1), but I cannot eat (1,1) safely, so better not.\n\nMove U to (2,4), then I can go to other areas.\n\nBut (4,3) might expire before I get back.\n\nLife span 10, so from turn 0 to turn 9, I have time.\n\nFor example, from (2,3) move U to (2,4), then to (3,4), but (3,4) to (4,4) wall, cannot, so to (3,5) or something.\n\nBut it might take more turns to reach (4,3).\n\nSince (4,3) is close, and I can eat it in 2 moves, I should do that.\n\nMoreover, after eating, I grow, which might be useful for score.\n\nBut I need to maximize score, so eating all possible food.\n\nBut (1,1) is not possible, so only two foods: (4,3) and (5,5).\n\nBoth can be eaten.\n\nIn the sequence above, I can eat (4,3) at turn 2 and (5,5) at turn 5.\n\nNow, are there any risks?\n\nAfter eating (4,3) at turn 2, and moving to (5,3) on turn 3, then to (5,4) on turn 4, then to (5,5) on turn 5.\n\nAt turn 4, when at (5,4), I moved up to (5,5).\n\nBut from (5,3) on turn 4, I could have moved right to (6,3), but that might not help for (5,5).\n\nBut going to (5,5) is fine.\n\nNow, on turn 5, after eating (5,5), I am at (5,5) with body at (5,4) and (5,3).\n\nThen I need to move somewhere.\n\nPossible moves from (5,5), dir U (since I moved up).\n\nCan move U to (5,6), L to (4,5), R to (6,5), D to (5,4) but (5,4) is body, collision.\n\nSo U, L, or R.\n\n(5,6) is free, (4,5) free, (6,5) free.\n\nI can go to explore, but no more food, so just survive.\n\nBut since no time limit, I can just move around safely.\n\nBut for now, I think the plan is good.\n\nNow, back to turn 0.\n\nI need to output actions for multiple turns? The answer format is to list actions for several turns.\n\n\"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"answer format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns to output, but since the state might change, I should output a sequence.\n\nIn this case, from turn 0 to turn 5 or so.\n\nSince after eating both foods, I can just move safely.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nTurn 0: move D (down) to (3,2)\n\nTurn 1: move R (right) to (4,2)\n\nTurn 2: move U (up) to (4,3) eat food\n\nNow turn 3: from (4,3), move R (right) to (5,3)\n\nTurn 4: from (5,3), move U (up) to (5,4)\n\nTurn 5: from (5,4), move U to (5,5) eat food\n\nOn turn 5, I move to (5,5) from (5,4), which is up.\n\nIn turn 4, I am at (5,4), and move to (5,5).\n\nIn the sequence above, turn 4: at (5,3) move U to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 5: at (5,4) move U to (5,5)\n\nYes.\n\nNow, after that, I can continue, but since no more food, I might stop or just keep moving.\n\nBut for the answer, I should output at least until I eat both or something.\n\nPerhaps output 5 turns or so.\n\nBut turn 0 to turn 5 is 6 actions? Turns: turn 0,1,2,3,4,5.\n\nActions: for turn t, action is chosen at that turn.\n\nSo for turn 0: action\n\nTurn 1: action\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 5.\n\nIn turn 5, I eat the second food.\n\nNow, is there a better way?\n\nAt turn 0, I could move down to (3,2), as above.\n\nBut what if I move up instead?\n\nTurn 0 move U to (3,4)\n\nThen snake at (3,4), dir U.\n\nNow from (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5), L to (2,4), R to (4,4) but (4,4) wall, invalid, D to (3,3).\n\nBut (3,3) was previous, now empty.\n\nSo move U to (3,5), or L to (2,4), or D to (3,3).\n\nBut I want to get to (4,3), which is below.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move D to (3,3), then to (3,2), then to (4,2), then to (4,3), but that takes more turns.\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: move D to (3,3) — but moving down from up, is that instant reverse? Current direction after turn 0 is U, moving D is opposite, so instant reverse not allowed? Rule: \"cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n\nAfter moving U on turn 0, direction is U, so on turn 1, I cannot move D, because opposite.\n\nSimilarly, I can only move U, L, or R, but R to (4,4) wall, so only U or L.\n\nMove U to (3,5) or L to (2,4).\n\nSay move L to (2,4), then at (2,4), dir L.\n\nThen I can move to other places, but (4,3) is farther.\n\nAnd life span, I might not reach (4,3) in time if I delay.\n\nFor example, from (2,4), I need to go down to (2,3), then to (3,3), then to (3,2), etc., multiple turns.\n\nWhereas with the first plan, I eat at turn 2.\n\nSimilarly, if I move down at turn 0, I eat at turn 2.\n\nSo first plan is efficient.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: but in this case, no food on tail, so no issue.\n\nAlso, food under body: but here no body initially.\n\nSo I think the sequence is good.\n\nNow, output the actions.\n\nTurn 0: move D (down)\n\nTurn 1: move R (right)\n\nTurn 2: move U (up)\n\nTurn 3: move R (right)\n\nTurn 4: move U (up)\n\nTurn 5: move U (up)\n\nIn turn 5, I move to (5,5) to eat.\n\nAfter that, I can stop or continue, but since the answer might need multiple turns, I can add more.\n\nBut perhaps up to turn 5 is fine, as I ate both foods by turn 5.\n\nTurn 0 to turn 5 is 6 actions.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", outputting 5 turns of actions might be sufficient, but from turn 0.\n\nThe current turn is t1=0, so actions for turn 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nBut at turn 4, I am at (5,4), and on turn 5 I eat.\n\nBut to include eating both, I should go to turn 5.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I can list as many as I want.\n\nTo be safe, I'll list from turn 0 to turn 5.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 3, I move R to (5,3), which is fine.\n\nIs there a shorter path to (5,5)?\n\nFor example, after eating (4,3) at turn 2, on turn 3 I move R to (5,3), then on turn 4 I could move directly to (5,5)? But (5,5) is two steps up, I need to go through (5,4).\n\nUnless I move diagonally, but no, only orthogonal moves.\n\nSo must go through (5,4).\n\nFrom (5,3) to (5,4) to (5,5).\n\nYes.\n\nI could have gone to (5,5) directly from (3,3) but with obstacles, not direct.\n\nFor example, from (3,3) move R? But I can't, because direction L, cannot reverse to R.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nThus, the plan is optimal.\n\nNow, write the answer.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 0: D\n\nTurn 1: R\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nBut in turn 5, I move U to (5,5), eat.\n\nTo be precise, in the boxed format.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned a sequence of moves 5+ turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n\n- **Food Safety and Accessibility**: \n  - (1,1) is in a dead end with only one adjacent cell (2,1), making it impossible to eat without immediate collision afterward. Avoid this food entirely.\n  - (4,3) is highly accessible and can be eaten in 2 turns with minimal risk.\n  - (5,5) is safe to eat with multiple exit paths and can be reached after eating (4,3).\n- **Movement Constraints**: \n  - Current head direction is left (L), so reverse move (R) is forbidden on turn 0. \n  - After eating (4,3), the snake grows, requiring careful pathing to avoid body collisions.\n- **Life Span Management**: All food has a life span of 10, disappearing after turn 9. The plan eats both (4,3) and (5,5) well before then (by turn 5).\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - Avoid the (1,1) dead end and internal obstacles (e.g., (1,3) is a trap). \n  - After eating (4,3), move away from the body at (4,2) to prevent collisions.\n\n**Optimal Sequence (Turns 0-5):**\n- **Turn 0 (t1=0)**: Move down (D) to (3,2). This avoids the reverse move restriction and positions the snake to reach (4,3) efficiently.\n- **Turn 1 (t1+1=1)**: Move right (R) to (4,2). From (3,2) with direction down, right is allowed and brings the snake closer to (4,3).\n- **Turn 2 (t1+2=2)**: Move up (U) to (4,3) to eat the positive food (+1 score, length increases to 2). Snake positions: head (4,3), body (4,2). Direction is now up.\n- **Turn 3 (t1+3=3)**: Move right (R) to (5,3). From (4,3) with direction up, right is allowed and avoids the wall at (4,4) and body at (4,2). This starts the path to (5,5).\n- **Turn 4 (t1+4=4)**: Move up (U) to (5,4). From (5,3) with direction right, up is allowed and avoids the obstacle at (5,2).\n- **Turn 5 (t1+5=5)**: Move up (U) to (5,5) to eat the positive food (+1 score, length increases to 3). Snake positions: head (5,5), body (5,4) and (5,3).\n\n**Outcome by Turn 5**:\n- Both accessible foods are eaten, maximizing the score (+2 total).\n- Snake length is 3, with positions [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3)] and direction up.\n- No collisions or risks encountered; the snake can safely navigate the grid afterward (e.g., move to (5,6), (4,5), or (6,5)).\n\nThis sequence ensures efficient food collection while avoiding all hazards. Thinking beyond turn 5, the snake should explore open areas (e.g., toward (6,5) or (5,6)) to survive long-term, but no more food is present.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 0\\text{: D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 1\\text{: R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 2\\text{: U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 3\\text{: R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4\\text{: U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5\\text{: U}\n}",
