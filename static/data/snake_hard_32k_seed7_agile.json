But in snake movement, moving into tail is allowed only if the tail moves away. Since the tail will move when I move, it might be ok, but I need to see.\n> \n> Rule: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, from (3,2), moving up to (3,3) is possible because tail is there, but after I move head to (3,3), tail might move or not depending on if I eat.\n> \n> If I move to (3,3) without eating, tail moves away, so head is at (3,3) and tail moves to the next segment, but since only one tail segment, it moves to where head was or something.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves, if not eating, tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is vacated.\n> \n> If eating, tail stays, so head grows into new position, tail doesn't move.\n> \n> In this case, from [(3,2), (3,3)], if I move to (3,3), that's where tail is. If I move there, and if I eat food, then tail doesn't move, so head and tail would be at same position, collision. But (3,3) has no food, I think? Food was at (3,2) which I ate, so (3,3) is just body, no food.\n> \n> Food positions: (3,1), (3,2), (1,6). After I eat (3,2), it's gone, so (3,3) is empty.\n> \n> So if I move from (3,2) to (3,3), I'm moving to the tail position. Since no food there, I don't eat, so tail should move forward. But where? Snake positions: head at (3,2), tail at (3,3). If I move head to (3,3), then head is at (3,3), and tail must move. But the tail was at (3,3), and head moves to (3,3), but since no new food, tail should move to the previous position or something? I think it's impossible for head to move to tail if no food, because tail is there and won't move until after head moves.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, when head moves to the tail cell, since tail moves away at the same time, it's not a collision. The head occupies the cell, and tail moves to the next position in the body.\n> \n> In this case, with only two segments: positions [(3,2), (3,3)]. Head at (3,2), tail at (3,3).\n> \n> If head moves to (3,3), which is tail, then after move, head is at (3,3), and since no food eaten, tail moves to where it was going, but it was the end, so tail disappears? No, tail moves forward to the next segment, but there is no next; it's only one segment.\n> \n> Typically, the body follows the head. When head moves to a new cell, the tail moves off its cell if not growing.\n> \n> So from [(3,2), (3,3)], if head moves to (3,3), that cell is occupied by tail. But since tail will move, the cell is vacated, so head can move there. After move, head is at (3,3), and tail was at (3,3) but since head moved there and no eat, tail moves to the previous position of the segment before it, but since it's only two, the tail segment moves to where the head was, so to (3,2)? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard: the body segments shift. When head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So positions: segment 0: head, segment 1: tail.\n> \n> Head moves to new position, say to (3,3). But (3,3) was position of segment 1. After head moves to (3,3), segment 1 (tail) needs to move to where segment 0 was, which is (3,2). But (3,2) is now empty, so tail moves to (3,2). So new positions: head at (3,3), tail at (3,2). So snake is now [(3,3), (3,2)].\n> \n> Effectively, the snake has reversed direction, but in terms of positions, it's fine, no collision.\n> \n> If there was food at (3,3), but there isn't.\n> \n> In this case, from (3,2), moving to (3,3) is possible.\n> \n> Similarly, other directions.\n> \n> But back to turn 0.\n> \n> At turn 0, from (3,3), I can go D to (3,2) or L to (2,3).\n> \n> Option 1: Go D to (3,2), eat food. Snake becomes [(3,2), (3,3)], length 2. Head direction now D.\n> \n> Then at turn 1, from (3,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (3,3): tail is there, but as above, it's allowed, no food, so move to (3,3), tail moves to (3,2)? After move, head at (3,3), tail at (3,2).\n> \n> But (3,3) has no food, so no eat.\n> \n> - D to (3,1): (3,1) has food, so I can eat it. (3,1) is within grid, not wall or obstacle.\n> \n> - L to (2,2): (2,2) is free? x=2,y=2, not border, not in obstacles. Obstacles are (1,2), not (2,2), so free.\n> \n> - R to (4,2): (4,2) not obstacle, not border. But (4,4) is obstacle, but (4,2) is different.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: since current direction is D, I cannot go U (up) because it's reverse. So U is invalid for turn 1 if I moved down.\n> \n> So from (3,2), I can go D, L, R. Not U.\n> \n> If I go D to (3,1), I eat the food there, snake grows to length 3: head at (3,1), body at (3,2), tail at (3,3). Positions: [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3)]\n> \n> Then from there, I can move to other places.\n> \n> But (3,1) is near bottom, y=1, and borders y=0 is wall, so I have to be careful.\n> \n> If from (3,2) I go L to (2,2), no food, so snake stays length 2, positions [(2,2), (3,2)] or after move: head to (2,2), tail to (3,2)? Positions: original [(3,2), (3,3)], head to (2,2), so new head at (2,2), segment 1 moves to where head was, (3,2), so positions [(2,2), (3,2)].\n> \n> Similarly.\n> \n> But let's think long term.\n> \n> There is food at (1,6), which is far, and life span 10, so I have time, but I need to get there without dying.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacles block the way.\n> \n> First, let's list all free cells or something.\n> \n> Grid:\n> \n> Rows y=7 to y=0, but usually y=0 bottom, y=7 top? Not specified, but from food, (1,6) might be x=1,y=6, and (3,1) etc.\n> \n> In coordinates, (x,y), probably x horizontal, y vertical, but direction: U is y+1, so y increasing up or down? U is (x,y+1), so if y+1 is up, then y=0 bottom, y=7 top.

Let me confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so yes, the grid is from (1,1) to (6,6), but there are also internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)]. So these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,2), body at (3,3). So the snake is only 2 segments long right now. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning moving towards decreasing y, I assume. Since y=0 is bottom? Let's define the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically, in grids, (0,0) might be top-left or bottom-left, but here walls are y=0 and y=7, so let's see: snake head at (3,2) and direction D, which is down. If D is (x,y-1), and snake is at (3,2), moving down would be to (3,1). But food is at (3,1) with value 1 and life span 9.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (3,1): value 1, life span 9\n> \n> - (1,6): value 1, life span 9\n> \n> - (6,3): value 1, life span 10? Wait, the input says: (3,1,9,1), (1,6,9,1), (6,3,10,1). I think it's (x,y,life_span,value). Let me check: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (3, 1, 9, 1)\" so it's (x, y, life_span, value). Value is 1 for all, so all positive food? But it says value1, which is 1, positive.\n> \n> In the core rules, positive food has value +1, negative has -1.

No, when snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when moving, head goes to new cell, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So after moving down to (3,1), the new positions: head at (3,1), the segment that was head (3,2) becomes body, and the tail (3,3) is removed if no growth, but since I eat food, length increases, so tail doesn't move, new segment added.\n> \n> Core rules: when eating positive food, length increases by one, so after eating, the tail stays, and a new segment is added at the tail position?

It's turn 2. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). I should list them to avoid: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,1), then (3,2), (3,3). So the snake is vertical, head down at (3,1), with body at (3,2) and tail at (3,3). Head direction is D, meaning down, which matches the positions since (3,1) to (3,2) is down, so last move was down.\n> \n> Food: two items. First is (1,6) with life span 8 and value 1, so positive food. Second is (6,3) with life span 9 and value 1, also positive food. Both are positive, so eating either gives +1 score and increases length.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,1), direction down. Possible moves: since head is facing down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up because that would be instant reverse. Rule: no instant reverse, so from down, I can go D, L, or R, not U.\n> \n> If I move down to (3,0), but y=0 is a wall, so that's invalid. Walls include y=0, so (3,0) is out of bounds. Moving left to (2,1)? Or right to (4,1). Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. (0,0) bottom left? Usually in coordinates, (x,y), but in grids, y might increase up or down. Here, since head is at (3,1) and direction down to (3,2), that suggests y increases upwards? Let's see: snake positions [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3)]. If head is at (3,1) and moved down to (3,2), that means moving down increased y? That might be counterintuitive.\n> \n> Typically in such games, (0,0) is top-left, y increases downward. But here, positions: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) with head direction down. If direction is down and it went from (3,1) to (3,2), that means y=2 is below y=1? So y increases as you go down? I think I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> Look at the walls: border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. And internal obstacles. Also, food at (1,6) and (6,3).\n> \n> Perhaps y=0 is the bottom or top? In the context, since moving down from (3,1) to (3,2) suggests that y=2 is lower than y=1 if down is decreasing y? But positions are (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), so if head was at (3,3) and moved down to (3,2), that would make sense, but here head is at (3,1), and direction down, so it must have come from above.\n> \n> Snake positions are listed head first: (3,1) is head, then (3,2) is first body, (3,3) is tail. So the snake was previously at (3,0) or something? But y=0 is wall, so (3,0) is invalid. Contradiction?\n> \n> Head direction is D, down, meaning the last move was down. So before turn 2, at turn 1, head was at (3,2), and it moved down to (3,1)? But (3,2) to (3,1) is decreasing y, so if y decreases down, then (3,1) is below (3,2).\n> \n> I think I need to define the coordinate system. Let me assume that (0,0) is the bottom-left corner, so y increases upward, x increases right. Then moving down decreases y.\n> \n> In that case: head at (3,1), last move down to (3,1) from (3,2) at turn 1? Positions: [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3)]. Since head is first, at turn 2, head is at (3,1), body at (3,2), tail at (3,3). Since head direction is down, it came from above, so at turn 1, head was at (3,2), and it moved down to (3,1). But (3,2) to (3,1) is decreasing y, so if (0,0) is bottom-left, (3,1) is below (3,2), so moving down decreases y.\n> \n> Similarly, walls: y=0 is bottom row, y=7 top row; x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> Food at (1,6): x=1,y=6, which is near top since y=7 top.

Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), etc., not (2,1), so free? But snake body is at (3,2) and (3,3), not (2,1), so (2,1) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1): not border, not internal obstacle, not snake body, so free.\n> \n> Also, (3,0) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves: L to (2,1) or R to (4,1). U is reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> But U would be to (3,2), which is the body, but in snake, you can't move into body except the tail, but here (3,2) is the first body segment, not tail. Tail is (3,3). Rule: head can move to tail cell because tail will move, so no collision if head moves to where tail was, as tail moves away.\n> \n> But in this case, moving up to (3,2) is the body segment, which is not the tail. Tail is (3,3). So moving to (3,2) would cause collision with body, since it's not the tail.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

It's turn 3, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) etc. are walls, so playable area is (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)]. So these are also walls.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,1), then (3,1), then (3,2). So the snake has three segments. Head direction is R, meaning right, so it was moving right to (4,1) from previous position. Since positions are given as [(4,1), (3,1), (3,2)], head is (4,1), and it came from left, since (3,1) is left of (4,1). Direction is R, which matches.\n> \n> Food: two items:\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1 and life span 7\n> \n> - (6,3) with value 1 and life span 8\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,6), it disappears after 7 turns, including current turn? The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 3, life span 7 means it will disappear after turn 3 + 7 - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If life span is N, it appears at some turn, and disappears after N turns from appearance, meaning it exists for N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including the current one.\n> \n> In the input, it's given as (x,y, life_span, value), so at turn 3, for (1,6), life_span=7, so it will disappear after turn 3 + 7 - 1? No.\n> \n> Standard way: if life_span is L at turn T, it will be gone after T + L - 1 turns? Let's think.\n> \n> Rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn T, if life_span is L, the countdown is L. After this turn, countdown becomes L-1, and so on, until countdown=0, then it disappears. So it disappears when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> At turn T with life_span L, countdown = L. After turn T, countdown = L-1. After turn T+1, countdown = L-2, ..., after turn T + L - 1, countdown=1, and after that turn, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten up to and including turn T + L - 1.\n> \n> For example, turn 3, life_span=7, countdown=7. After turn 3, countdown=6; after turn 4, countdown=5; ... after turn 9, countdown=0, so it disappears before turn 10? Let's define turns.\n> \n> At the start of turn T, the countdown is C. After the snake moves and actions are processed, the countdown decreases by 1 for that turn.\n> \n> Typically, at the beginning of turn T, food has remaining life. When the snake moves, if it eats food, it consumes it; then after the move, life span decreases.\n> \n> But for planning, I need to know when it disappears.\n> \n> From the rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> In the state, at turn t1, the life_span given is the current countdown.\n> \n> For food at (1,6): at turn 3, life_span=7, so it can be eaten from turn 3 to turn 3 + 6 = turn 9? Countdown starts at 7 on turn 3.\n> \n> After turn 3 is processed, countdown becomes 6, so at start of turn 4, countdown=6.\n> \n> After turn 4, countdown=5, and so on, until after turn 9, countdown=0, so it disappears before turn 10. So it exists on turns 3 to 9 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,3), life_span=8 at turn 3, so exists from turn 3 to 10 inclusive.\n> \n> Now, snake: head at (4,1), direction R.

But since the grid is 8x8, cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x.\n> \n> But for movement, we only care about cells the snake can move to, so x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 except obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are at: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Note that (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) are all at x=1, y=2,4,5.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,1). Possible moves: since head direction is R, it can move U, D, R, but not L because L is opposite to R?

Internal obstacles: (5,2) is wall, (4,4) is wall, (3,4) is wall, but (4,2) not listed, so not an obstacle. Borders: y=2 is not border, x=4 not border, so (4,2) is free.\n> \n> - D: to (4,0).

Snake body: (3,1) and (3,2), not (5,1). So (5,1) should be free? But internal obstacles include (6,1), which is (6,1), not (5,1). So (5,1) is free.\n> \n> But (5,1) is adjacent to (6,1) which is wall, but (5,1) itself is not wall.\n> \n> Similarly, L: but cannot move L because opposite direction.\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,1): U to (4,2), R to (5,1).

It's turn 4, and I'm the snake AI. My goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, and I must think at least 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> **Grid Setup:**\n> \n> - The grid has walls. Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7). Internal obstacles are at: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). I need to list all obstacles to know where I can't move.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1). That's eight points.\n> \n> **Snake Position:**\n> \n> - Head at (4,2), then body at (4,1), and tail at (3,1). So the snake is three segments long. Head direction is Up, meaning it moved to (4,2) from below, probably from (4,1) since the body is there.\n> \n> Head direction U means last move was Up, so from (4,1) to (4,2). Current head at (4,2).\n> \n> **Food Items:**\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (6,3) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (2,3) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value 1, so positive food. No negative food mentioned here.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,6), life span 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including this turn? Current turn is 4, so it will disappear after turn 4 + 6 = turn 10? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 4, life span 6 means it has 6 turns left including turn 4, so it will be gone after turn 9? Let me clarify.\n> \n> Life span: at turn t, food has life span N, it will disappear after N turns. Since countdown decreases every turn including current, if at turn t life span is N, then after turn t, it has N-1 left, and it disappears when countdown reaches 0. So for food at turn t with life span L, it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L.\n> \n> Standard: if life span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so it exists until turn t + N - 1, and is gone at turn t + N.\n> \n> For example, turn 4, life span 6: exists from turn 4 to turn 9 (4+6-1=9), gone at turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) life span 7: exists turn 4 to 10 (4+7-1=10)\n> \n> (2,3) life span 10: exists turn 4 to 13 (4+10-1=13)\n> \n> All good.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,2), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> Current direction is U, so I cannot move opposite, which is D, immediately. So I cannot move Down on this turn.\n> \n> Also, walls and obstacles: I need to know where I can move.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Borders are walls, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Snake: head (4,2), body (4,1), tail (3,1)\n> \n> Food: (1,6), (6,3), (2,3)\n> \n> I should list all blocked cells:\n> \n> - Borders: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n> \n> - Internal: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Snake occupies (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), so these are also blocked for movement except that I can move to the tail position if it moves, but for collision, head cannot touch body except tail under certain conditions.\n> \n> Movement: I can move to a cell if it's not a wall or obstacle, and not occupied by body except the tail segment, because when I move, the tail moves.\n> \n> Specifically: if I move to a cell that is the current tail, and I eat food, I grow, so new tail is added, but since I move to tail, and tail moves away, it should be fine unless it causes collision.\n> \n> But in general, for a move, the head can move to a cell that is:\n> \n> - Not a wall\n> \n> - Not an obstacle\n> \n> - Not occupied by any body segment except the tail, because the tail will move.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (3,1).\n> \n> Now, from head (4,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up (U): to (4,3)\n> \n> - Down (D): but opposite direction, not allowed since current dir U.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (3,2)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (5,2)\n> \n> But check cells:\n> \n> (4,3): is it free? Let's see what's there.\n> \n> No food mentioned, not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1) — (4,3) not in list, and not border, so should be free.\n> \n> But snake body: positions are (4,2) head, (4,1) body, (3,1) tail. So (4,3) not occupied, so free.\n> \n> (3,2): not wall, not obstacle, not occupied (snake at (3,1), (4,1), (4,2)), so free.\n> \n> (5,2): but (5,2) is an internal obstacle! From list: (5,2) is obstacle, so I cannot move there.\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,2): U to (4,3), L to (3,2), R to (5,2) but (5,2) is obstacle, so not possible. D not allowed.\n> \n> So only U or L.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score.\n> \n> First, what about food? Food at (1,6), (6,3), (2,3)\n> \n> (2,3) is close, at x=2,y=3.\n> \n> Current head (4,2), so (2,3) is left and up a bit.\n> \n> (1,6) is far left and up, (6,3) is far right and up.\n> \n> Also, life spans: (2,3) has life 10, so plenty of time. (1,6) life 6, (6,3) life 7.\n> \n> Now, snake is short, only 3 segments, so eating food will grow.\n> \n> But I need to avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's consider the two possible moves: U to (4,3) or L to (3,2)\n> \n> If I go U to (4,3):\n> \n> Then head at (4,3). Snake moves: head to (4,3), body segments follow: the segment that was at (4,2) moves to where head was? Snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So positions: current: head (4,2), body (4,1), tail (3,1)\n> \n> After move U to (4,3): new head (4,3), then body segments: first body segment moves to old head position (4,2), second body segment moves to old first body position (4,1), and tail was at (3,1), but since no food eaten, tail moves away to where? The last segment was at (3,1), and since no growth, the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> After move: new positions: head at (4,3), body at (4,2), and the segment that was at (4,1) moves to where? The body segment that was at (4,1) will move to the position of the previous head, which is (4,2), but (4,2) is now occupied by the new body? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a new cell, the neck (first body segment) moves to the old head position, the next body segment moves to the old neck position, and so on, and the tail segment is removed if no growth.\n> \n> So here: head moves to (4,3). The body segment at (4,1) will move to the position of the head, which was (4,2). The tail segment at (3,1) will move to the position of the first body segment, which was (4,1).\n> \n> So new positions: head (4,3), body (4,2), and tail (4,1)? Body segments: after head, the first body is at (4,2), which was head, and the second body is at (4,1), which was the first body.\n> \n> Positions: [ (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) ]? But the tail was at (3,1), and it moves to where the first body was, (4,1).\n> \n> So new snake: head (4,3), then body (4,2), then tail (4,1). So all in a vertical line at x=4, y=3,2,1.\n> \n> But y=1,2,3 all at x=4.\n> \n> Now, if I go L to (3,2):\n> \n> Head moves to (3,2). Then new head (3,2), body moves to old head (4,2), tail moves to old body (4,1).\n> \n> So new positions: head (3,2), body (4,2), tail (4,1).\n> \n> Now, direction: after move, the head direction will be set to the move direction.\n> \n> For thinking ahead, I need to consider sequences.\n> \n> I also need to consider food eating.\n> \n> Food at (2,3) is close. (2,3) from current head (4,2), it's left and up, so to reach it, I might go left then up or up then left, but paths.\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> But (2,3) has high life span, so not urgent.\n> \n> (1,6) has life 6, so if I don't eat soon, it might disappear.\n> \n> Turn 4 now, (1,6) disappears at turn 10 (since turn 4 + 6 life, present until turn 9).\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) until turn 10.\n> \n> (2,3) until turn 13.\n> \n> Now, risks: where are the obstacles.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n> \n> But currently, no food on tail or body, I think. Food positions: (1,6), (6,3), (2,3), none on snake.\n> \n> (2,3) is free.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the grid layout to avoid dead ends.\n> \n> List all blocked cells for reference.\n> \n> Borders: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> So blocked cells:\n> \n> - x=0 all y, x=7 all y, y=0 all x, y=7 all x\n> \n> - (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Free cells except snake and food.\n> \n> Snake occupies (4,2), (4,1), (3,1) currently.\n> \n> After move, it changes.\n> \n> Food at (1,6), (6,3), (2,3)\n> \n> Now, from (4,2), if I go U to (4,3):\n> \n> Then head at (4,3), and positions as above.\n> \n> From (4,3), possible moves: direction will be U, so I can go U, L, R (not D, opposite).\n> \n> U to (4,4): but (4,4) is obstacle!

It's turn 5, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). I should plot this out mentally.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,2), then body at (4,2), and tail at (4,1). Head direction is left (L), so it was moving left to (3,2) from (4,2), I assume. Positions are given as [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...] with head first, so from (3,2) to (4,2) to (4,1). Since head direction is L, it moved from (4,2) to (3,2) on the previous turn.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (1,6) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,3) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,3) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, and life span decreases each turn.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,6), life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including this one? The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so on turn 5, it has life span 5, which means it will disappear after turn 5 + (5 - 1) = turn 9? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food with life span N at turn t, it disappears at the end of turn t + N - 1? Or at the beginning of turn t + N?\n> \n> It says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, countdown is N. After turn t, countdown becomes N-1.

No, that would be the same as moving without eating, but with an extra segment.\n> \n> Usually, when eating, the head moves to food, the body segments move to previous positions, but the tail does not move, so the segment that was tail remains in place, and the new head position is added, so the length increases by one.\n> \n> For example: positions [A, B, C] head A, tail C.\n> \n> Move to D without eating: new positions [D, A, B] tail B.\n> \n> Move to D with eating: new positions [D, A, B, C] so tail C remains, head to D, body to A and B.\n> \n> In this case, the tail position doesn't change when eating.\n> \n> Similarly in our earlier: after turn 6, ate at (2,3), positions [ (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) ] so head (2,3), body (2,2), (3,2), tail (4,2)\n> \n> Then move to (2,4) without eating: positions [ (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) ] tail (3,2)\n> \n> In turn 7 move to (2,4) no food, so positions [ (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2) ]\n> \n> Then turn 8 to (2,5) no food, positions [ (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2) ]\n> \n> Turn 9 to (2,6) no food, positions [ (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) ] tail (2,3)\n> \n> Now turn 9, move to (1,6) which has food, so eat.\n> \n> Head to (1,6), body: first segment to where head was (2,6), second to where first body was (2,5), third to where second body was (2,4), and tail remains at (2,3)?

It's turn 6, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There are also internal obstacles at: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). I should list these to visualize.\n> \n> Internal obstacles:\n> \n> - (1,2)\n> \n> - (1,4)\n> \n> - (1,5)\n> \n> - (3,4)\n> \n> - (4,4)\n> \n> - (5,2)\n> \n> - (5,5)\n> \n> - (6,1)\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,2), then body at (3,2), and tail at (4,2). So the snake is three segments long, all on row y=2, from x=2 to x=4. Head direction is left, which makes sense since it's moving from (3,2) to (2,2), so direction L.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - At (1,6) with value 1 and life span 4\n> \n> - At (6,3) with value 1 and life span 5\n> \n> - At (2,3) with value 1 and life span 8\n> \n> All food is positive since value is +1.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for the next 5+ turns to maximize score while avoiding risks. Think long-term.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid to understand positions.\n> \n> Grid size: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls are the borders, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacles as listed.\n> \n> Snake: head (2,2), body (3,2), tail (4,2). Head direction L, so last move was to the left.\n> \n> Possible moves: Since head is facing left, I can move left (L), up (U), or down (D), but not right (R) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Current direction is L, so opposite is R, so I cannot move right on this turn. Valid moves: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (1,6): value 1, life span 4. Since current turn is 6, it will disappear after 4 more turns? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 6, life span 4 means it will be gone after turn 9? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: it disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for food at (1,6) with life span 4 on turn 6, after turn 6, life span becomes 3, then 2 on turn 7, 1 on turn 8, 0 on turn 9, so it disappears at the start of turn 10 or after turn 9? I think it's better to think that at the end of each turn, life span decreases, and if it reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food with life span L on turn T, it will disappear after T + L - 1 turns or something? Let's define.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so after N turns, it will be gone. But since it decreases on the current turn, at turn t, it has N turns left including t.\n> \n> After turn t, life span becomes N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0.\n> \n> So for (1,6): life span 4 on turn 6. After turn 6, life span 3; after turn 7, life span 2; after turn 8, life span 1; after turn 9, life span 0, so it disappears before turn 10. So it can be eaten from turn 6 to turn 9 inclusive? On turn 9, life span is 1, after eating or after turn, it decreases to 0 and disappears.\n> \n> The food can be eaten when the head moves onto it during a turn. So as long as life span > 0 when the head moves to that cell.\n> \n> On turn when life span is 1, if head moves to it, it can be eaten, then after that turn, life span would be 0, but since it's eaten, it's gone anyway.\n> \n> Similarly, if not eaten, after turn, life span decreases to 0 and disappears.\n> \n> For (1,6): life span 4 on turn 6. So it can be eaten on turns 6,7,8,9. After turn 9, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3): life span 5 on turn 6, can be eaten on turns 6 to 10.\n> \n> (2,3): life span 8 on turn 6, can be eaten on turns 6 to 13.\n> \n> Now, (2,3) is very close to the head at (2,2). It's directly above the head.\n> \n> Current head position: (2,2)\n> \n> Food at (2,3) is adjacent up.\n> \n> Also, there's an obstacle at (1,2), which is left of head, but (1,2) is an obstacle, so I cannot move left to (1,2) because it's blocked.\n> \n> Head at (2,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up (U) to (2,3)\n> \n> - Down (D) to (2,1)\n> \n> - Left (L) to (1,2) but (1,2) is an obstacle, so cannot move left.\n> \n> - Right (R) to (3,2) but (3,2) is the body segment, but rule says: body collision if head touches any body segment except that you can move into the tail cell because tail will move.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (4,2)]\n> \n> If I move right to (3,2), which is the first body segment. But after move, the tail will move, so let's see.\n> \n> When I move, the head moves to a new position, and the body follows.\n> \n> If I move to (3,2), which is currently occupied by the body, but after the move, the head is at (3,2), and the body segments shift: the old head (2,2) becomes new body, and the tail (4,2) moves away? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, that becomes the new head, and the tail cell is removed unless food is eaten. If no food eaten, snake moves, head to new position, tail is removed, so the cell that was tail becomes empty.\n> \n> If food eaten, head moves to food, tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> In terms of collision: during the move, if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment (except the tail, because tail will move), it's a collision.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, for a move to be valid, the new head position must not be a wall, not be a body segment except the tail.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (3,2): (3,2) is currently the first body segment, not the tail. Tail is at (4,2). So moving to (3,2) would be collision with body, since it's not the tail.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (1,2) is obstacle, cannot.\n> \n> Moving down to (2,1): let's check if that's valid. (2,1) - is it a wall or body? Walls: borders, y=0 is wall, so (2,1) is not border, since y=1, not 0. Internal obstacles: listed, (2,1) not in the list, so should be free. Body: snake is at (2,2),(3,2),(4,2), so (2,1) is empty. So moving down to (2,1) is possible.\n> \n> Moving up to (2,3): (2,3) has food? Food at (2,3) is present, so if I move there, I eat it. But is it safe? (2,3) position: not wall, not body? Body positions: y=2, (2,3) is above, not occupied. Obstacles: (2,3) not in internal obstacles list. Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1). So (2,3) is free. So moving up to (2,3) is possible and I eat the food there.\n> \n> But there's a warning: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (4,2). Head is at (2,2), not adjacent to tail. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (2,2) and (4,2) are not adjacent; they are two apart horizontally.\n> \n> So no issue.\n> \n> If I move up to (2,3), I eat the food, snake grows to length 4, positions: new head (2,3), then (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) as body.\n> \n> Then life span of that food decreases or it's eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, other moves.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's list possible actions for turn 6.\n> \n> Current head: (2,2), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (2,3) - eat food, safe.\n> \n> - D: to (2,1) - no food, safe.\n> \n> - L: to (1,2) - but (1,2) is obstacle, cannot move.\n> \n> - R: to (3,2) - but (3,2) is body segment (not tail), so collision, cannot.\n> \n> So only possible moves: U or D.\n> \n> I can move up or down.\n> \n> If I move up, I eat the food at (2,3) immediately.\n> \n> If I move down, I go to (2,1), no food.\n> \n> Now, need to think about future turns.\n> \n> Also, other food: (1,6) and (6,3).\n> \n> (1,6) is at top-left, with life span 4, so must be eaten by turn 9.\n> \n> (6,3) is at bottom-right, life span 5, by turn 10.\n> \n> (2,3) is right above head, life span 8, plenty of time.\n> \n> But if I eat (2,3) now, snake grows, which might be good for score, but I need to avoid risks.\n> \n> After eating, snake is longer, so more body to avoid.\n> \n> But (2,3) is very close, easy to get.\n> \n> If I don't eat it now, I can come back later, but it might be risky or I might forget.\n> \n> Life span is long, 8 turns, so I can leave it for now.\n> \n> But let's see the board.\n> \n> Grid: let's sketch mentally.\n> \n> y=7 top, y=0 bottom, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles:\n> \n> (1,2) - left of head\n> \n> (1,4), (1,5) - on x=1, y=4 and 5\n> \n> (3,4), (4,4) - around center\n> \n> (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Snake at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) on y=2.\n> \n> Food at (1,6), (6,3), (2,3)\n> \n> (2,3) is above snake head.\n> \n> Also, head direction L, but I can't move left because obstacle.\n> \n> Now, for long-term, I need to plan how to get to other food.\n> \n> (1,6) is at (1,6), which is near top-left.

Let me confirm.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Internal obstacles are given: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). So these are also walls.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,3), then (2,3), (2,2), (3,2). So the snake has 4 segments.

Tail is at (3,2).\n> \n> If I move down to (3,2), that's where the tail is. Since the tail will move when I eat or not, but if I move to (3,2), and the tail is there, but after I move, the tail will move to the next position, so if I move to the tail cell, it should be safe, because the tail leaves that cell as I enter it.\n> \n> Standard snake rules: if head moves to a cell that was occupied by the tail at the start of the turn, and the tail moves away, it's not a collision.

No food there, so no growth.\n> \n> - L: to (2,3). But (2,3) is the second segment of the body. Since it's not the tail, if I move there, it would be a collision because the body doesn't move away immediately; only the tail moves when we don't eat. But in snake, when you move, the head moves to new position, and each segment moves to the previous position of the next segment. So if I move to (2,3), which is currently occupied by the second segment, after moving, the head would be at (2,3), but the second segment moves to where the third segment was, and so on. So the cell (2,3) is vacated by the body and occupied by the head, but since it happens simultaneously, it might not be a collision? I need to check the rules.\n> \n> The rules say: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> It specifies that moving into tail is allowed, but for other body segments, it's a collision.\n> \n> In this case, (2,3) is the second segment, not the tail.

Is (4,3) free? Let's see: walls? x=4,y=3. Border walls are x=0,7 y=0,7, so no. Internal: (4,4) is wall, but (4,3) not listed, so should be free. Snake positions: (4,3) not occupied, since snake is at (3,3),(2,3),(2,2),(3,2). So (4,3) is empty? But let's confirm if there's food or something. Food at (1,6),(6,3),(1,3), not (4,3).

It's turn 9, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so that's an 8x8 grid? Let me clarify the grid size. The borders are given as x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells are from (0,0) to (7,7), but since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x coordinates from 1 to 6 are playable, similarly y from 1 to 6. But let's confirm: \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" means all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacles are listed: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). So these are additional walls.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,3), then (3,3), (2,3), (2,2). So the snake is 4 segments long. Head direction is right, so moving east.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1 and life span 1. So it disappears after this turn or next? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 9, life span 1 means it will disappear after this turn? Let me read the rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food with life span L at turn t, it will be there for L more turns, including turn t. So at turn t, life span L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, and countdown decreases every turn including current, then:\n> \n> - At turn t: countdown N, so it has N turns left including this one.\n> \n> - After turn t: countdown N-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - When countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn.\n> \n> For example, if life span is 1 at turn t, it will disappear after turn t, meaning it can be eaten on turn t but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, life span 2 at turn t: can be eaten on turn t and t+1, disappears after t+1.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 9:\n> \n> - Food at (1,6): value 1, life span 1. So it will disappear after turn 9, meaning it can only be eaten on turn 9, if possible.\n> \n> - Food at (6,3): value 1, life span 2. So it can be eaten on turn 9 or 10, disappears after turn 10.\n> \n> - Food at (1,3): value 1, life span 8. So it can be eaten for many turns.\n> \n> All food has value 1, positive, since no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, and it says \"Value1, life_span1\" etc., so all are +1 food.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose an action sequence starting from turn 9, thinking 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but walls at borders and internal obstacles.\n> \n> Playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except where there are obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> List them:\n> \n> - (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) — these are on x=1, y=2,4,5\n> \n> - (3,4)\n> \n> - (4,4)\n> \n> - (5,2), (5,5)\n> \n> - (6,1)\n> \n> Snake: head at (4,3), body: (3,3), (2,3), tail at (2,2)\n> \n> Head direction: right, so from (4,3), moving right would be to (5,3).\n> \n> But let's see possible moves from current position.\n> \n> Current head at (4,3), direction right.\n> \n> Possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1)\n> \n> But cannot move opposite to current direction instantly.

So down to (4,2) is possible.\n> \n> - Left: (3,3) — but (3,3) is the body segment. Moving left to (3,3), which is the second segment of the snake. But (3,3) is occupied by body, so if I move there, it's collision, unless it's the tail and tail moves.\n> \n> (3,3) is not the tail; tail is at (2,2). The snake is [(4,3) head, (3,3) segment, (2,3) segment, (2,2) tail]. So (3,3) is a body segment, not tail. Moving to (3,3) would cause head to collide with body, which is deadly.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So only tail is safe to move into, but (3,3) is not tail, so moving left to (3,3) is invalid, collision.\n> \n> - Right: (5,3) — what is at (5,3)? Walls: not border, not internal obstacle listed. Internal obstacles: (5,2) is wall, but (5,3) not listed. Snake: not occupied. Food: (6,3) is food but not here. So (5,3) should be free. So right to (5,3) is possible.\n> \n> But current direction is right, so moving right is allowed, not opposite.\n> \n> Also, cannot move left because opposite and also blocked.\n> \n> Now, down to (4,2): is (4,2) safe? Yes, as above.\n> \n> Up is blocked by wall at (4,4).\n> \n> So possible actions at turn 9: Down (D) or Right (R)\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (1,6): life span 1, so must be eaten this turn (turn 9) or it disappears. But can I reach it this turn? Head is at (4,3), (1,6) is at x=1,y=6. Distance: |4-1|=3 in x, |3-6|=3 in y, so Manhattan distance 6, cannot reach in one turn. So impossible to eat (1,6) on turn 9. Since life span 1, it disappears after this turn, so it will be gone, no chance to eat. So ignore (1,6).\n> \n> - (6,3): at (6,3), value 1, life span 2. So can be eaten on turn 9 or 10. Head at (4,3), so (6,3) is two steps right: (5,3) then (6,3). So if I move right to (5,3) on turn 9, I can reach (6,3) on turn 10.\n> \n> - (1,3): at (1,3), value 1, life span 8, so plenty of time. Head at (4,3), so to reach (1,3), need to go left, but currently direction right, and cannot move left instantly? Turn 9, I can choose to move, but since current direction is R, moving L would be opposite, which is not allowed on the next turn? Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> \"on next turn\" – let's read: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> The rule says: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> So for turn 9, current direction is R, so I cannot move L on turn 9, because it would be instant reverse.\n> \n> But for future turns, I can change direction gradually.\n> \n> At turn 9, from (4,3), moving L is not possible anyway because it's blocked by body, as we saw.\n> \n> So for (1,3), I need to go left, but I have to do it carefully.\n> \n> Now, also, the food at (1,3) might be under something? But it's listed separately, so I think it's not under snake.\n> \n> Snake body: (3,3) and (2,3) are on y=3, x=3 and x=2. (1,3) is at x=1,y=3, which is adjacent to (2,3), but not occupied, I think. Since food is listed, it should be present.\n> \n> But the rule about food under body: but here, no food is under body currently.\n> \n> Now, back to actions.\n> \n> At turn 9, I can move D or R.\n> \n> If I move R to (5,3), then on turn 10, I can move to (6,3) to eat the food, since (6,3) has life span 2, so on turn 10, it should still be there? Life span 2 at turn 9: after turn 9, life span becomes 1, then after turn 10, it disappears. So on turn 10, it can be eaten.\n> \n> If I move to (5,3) on turn 9, then turn 10 to (6,3), I eat the food, snake grows to length 5.\n> \n> Now, if I move D to (4,2) on turn 9, then I'm away from (6,3), and might not reach it in time.\n> \n> (6,3) life span 2, so if not eaten by turn 10, it disappears.\n> \n> From (4,2), to reach (6,3), I need to go right and up, but not direct.\n> \n> For example, turn 9: D to (4,2)\n> \n> Then turn 10: from (4,2), possible moves: U to (4,3) but (4,3) was head, now after move, the body segments move.\n> \n> After each move, the snake moves: head to new position, each body segment to previous position of the segment ahead, tail moves away or stays if food eaten.\n> \n> But when no food eaten, snake moves forward, tail leaves its position.\n> \n> In this case, if no food eaten, snake length same.\n> \n> After turn 9 move:\n> \n> If move R to (5,3): new head (5,3), body: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), tail (2,2) moves? When head moves to (5,3), the segment that was at (4,3) moves to where head was? Standard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So positions: old head (4,3), segments (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)\n> \n> After move right to (5,3): new head (5,3), then body: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) — tail is now (2,3), and (2,2) is no longer part of snake, since no growth.\n> \n> Similarly, if move down to (4,2): new head (4,2), body: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) — tail (2,3), and (2,2) free.\n> \n> Now, for food at (6,3): if I am at (5,3) on turn 10, I can move to (6,3) to eat it.\n> \n> If I am at (4,2) on turn 10, I can move to (5,2) or (4,3) or (3,2), etc.\n> \n> (5,2) is an internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> From (4,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (4,3): but (4,3) is now body segment? After turn 9, if I moved D to (4,2), the body is at (4,3), (3,3), (2,3). So (4,3) is the first body segment. Moving to (4,3) would collide with body.\n> \n> - D to (4,1): is (4,1) free? Walls: y=0 wall, but y=1 is not border? Borders y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to y=6 are playable except obstacles. Obstacles: (6,1) but not (4,1), so (4,1) should be free. Snake: after move, not there. So possible.\n> \n> - L to (3,2): (3,2) free? Walls: not listed, not border. Snake: not there. So possible.\n> \n> - R to (5,2): but (5,2) is internal obstacle, wall. Cannot.\n> \n> So from (4,2) at turn 10, possible moves: D to (4,1), L to (3,2), or U but U to (4,3) is body, collision, so only D or L.\n> \n> To reach (6,3) from (4,2) on turn 10: (6,3) is at x=6,y=3, (4,2) is x=4,y=2, so need to go up and right, but directly, from (4,2) to (5,2) is wall, to (4,3) is body, so cannot move directly. Must go via other cells, e.g., to (3,2) or (4,1), then later to (5,3) etc. But (6,3) must be eaten by turn 10; on turn 11 it disappears? Life span 2 at turn 9: after turn 9, life span 1; after turn 10, life span 0, disappears. So must be eaten on turn 10 at latest.\n> \n> On turn 10, if I am not at (6,3), I cannot eat it. From (4,2) on turn 10, I cannot reach (6,3) in one move, since |4-6|=2 in x or |2-3|=1, but not adjacent. (4,2) to (6,3) is not adjacent; adjacent cells differ by 1 in one coordinate.\n> \n> So impossible to eat (6,3) if I don't move towards it on turn 9.\n> \n> Therefore, to eat (6,3), I must move right to (5,3) on turn 9, then to (6,3) on turn 10.\n> \n> If I move down on turn 9, I miss (6,3).\n> \n> Now, there is also (1,3) with long life span.\n> \n> But (1,3) is at left, and snake is currently at right.\n> \n> Moreover, the grid has many obstacles.\n> \n> I should consider the risks.\n> \n> First, let's think about moving right to eat (6,3).\n> \n> Turn 9: move R to (5,3)\n> \n> Then turn 10: move R to (6,3) to eat the food. Snake grows to length 5.\n> \n> After eating, new tail is added, so positions: head at (6,3), then body: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) — and the segment that was at (2,2) is gone? When head moves to food, snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; instead, a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> Rule: when eating positive food, length +1, so when head moves to food, the tail stays, and a new segment is added where the tail was or something.\n> \n> Standard: after moving head to food, the body moves, but tail doesn't advance, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> So after turn 10: head at (6,3), body: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) — and the old tail (2,3) is now part of body, and since no tail movement, the previous last segment stays, but it's extended.\n> \n> Positions: before move, head at (5,3), body (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) — tail (2,3)? After turn 9, if moved to (5,3), positions: head (5,3), body (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) — tail at (2,3).\n> \n> On turn 10, move to (6,3) which has food, so eat: head to (6,3), body: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), and tail remains at (2,3), but since growth, a new segment is added where the tail was? No.\n> \n> When food is eaten, the head moves to food cell, and a new body segment is added at the previous tail position, so the tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Sequence:\n> \n> - Before move: snake segments S0 (head), S1, S2, ..., St (tail)\n> \n> - Move head to new cell.\n> \n> - If no food, each segment moves to previous position of the segment before it, so tail position is free.\n> \n> - If food, head moves to food, each segment moves to previous position, but the tail position is not freed; instead, it stays, and the new head position is added, so length increases.\n> \n> In terms of positions:\n> \n> After move to food: new head position = food cell, new body segments: the old head position becomes the first body segment, and so on, up to the old tail position, which is now the second last, and a new tail segment is added at the old tail position? No.\n> \n> Standard: when eating food, the snake moves forward, head to new cell, each body segment to the position of the previous segment, but since food is eaten, the tail does not move, so the last segment stays, effectively adding a segment at the tail.\n> \n> For example, positions before: [H, B1, B2, T]\n> \n> After move to food: [new H (food), old H, B1, B2, T] — so T is still there, and length increased by one.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> In this case, after turn 9: positions [ (5,3) head, (4,3) B1, (3,3) B2, (2,3) tail ]\n> \n> Turn 10: move to (6,3) which has food, so after: head (6,3), body: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) tail? (2,3) is now part of body, and tail is (2,3), but since growth, the tail remains, so positions: head (6,3), segment1 (5,3), segment2 (4,3), segment3 (3,3), segment4 (2,3) tail. So tail at (2,3).\n> \n> Now, at (6,3), head position.\n> \n> Now, what next? I need to think beyond.\n> \n> After turn 10, head at (6,3), with body behind: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,3):\n> \n> - U to (6,4)\n> \n> - D to (6,2)\n> \n> - L to (5,3) — but (5,3) is the body segment directly behind, so moving left to (5,3) would collide with body.\n> \n> - R to (7,3) — but x=7 is border wall, cannot.\n> \n> Also, cannot move opposite?

It's turn 10, and the grid has walls and obstacles. The borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,3), then (4,3), (3,3), (2,3).

Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 10, life span 2, after turn 10 it becomes 1, after turn 11 it becomes 0 and disappears.

Life span N means it disappears after N turns from now, so after N turns it's gone. For example, life span 2 at turn 10: after turn 11, it's gone, so can be eaten on turn 10 or 11.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) life span 10, so available until turn 19.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (5,3), moving right. Possible moves: U, D, L, R. But cannot move left because that's opposite to current direction R, and no instant reverse. So cannot move L.

When snake eats food, the head moves to the food cell, and since it's positive food, length increases, so the tail stays in place for this turn? No.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when snake eats food, it moves head to food cell, and the body follows, but since length increases, the tail doesn't move, so the new segment is added at the head position after moving.\n> \n> Recall: when head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, so the snake grows: the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added there, but since the head is moving, the body follows, but the tail doesn't advance because of growth.\n> \n> In terms of positions: before move, positions: head (5,3), body (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)\n> \n> If I move right to (6,3), which has food, so after move: head is now at (6,3), and since food is eaten, the new segment is added, so the body includes the previous head position. So positions become: head (6,3), then (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) — (2,3) is still there because tail didn't move? No.\n> \n> When snake moves, all segments shift: the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> When no food eaten: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> When food eaten: head moves to food cell, but instead of the tail moving away, a new segment is added at the position where the head was, so the tail stays, and length increases.\n> \n> In this case, before move: positions [ (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) ] length 4.\n> \n> Move head to (6,3), eat food, so new positions: head at (6,3), then add a new segment at the previous head position (5,3), so body is (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), and tail (2,3) remains? No.\n> \n> The body segments: after head moves to (6,3), the segment that was at (5,3) stays as body, so positions: head (6,3), body (5,3), then (4,3), (3,3), and since length increases, (2,3) is still part of the snake? No.\n> \n> Standard: the tail doesn't move when food is eaten. So the segments are: new head at (6,3), then the previous head (5,3) becomes the first body segment, then (4,3), (3,3), and the tail (2,3) stays, but since length increases, we add a segment, so the tail is now (2,3), and it doesn't move this turn.\n> \n> So positions after eating: [ (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) ] length 5.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> If no food, moving to empty cell: head to new position, body follows, tail leaves its position.\n> \n> But here, (6,3) has food, so eating it.\n> \n> Now, is (6,3) safe?

(6,3) is not an obstacle.\n> \n> Now, after moving to (6,3), the snake body: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3). Head is at (6,3), so no collision with body because body is at (5,3) etc., which are not (6,3) except that (5,3) is adjacent but not the same cell.\n> \n> Collision if head touches any body segment. Here, after move, head at (6,3), body segments are (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3).

It's turn 11, and the grid has walls and obstacles. The border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. That means any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall, so the grid is 6x6 from (1,1) to (6,6), but with internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)]. So these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (6,3), then body at (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3). So the snake is horizontal, moving right, since head direction is R. Head at (6,3), which is on the right edge? x=6, but x=6 is not a wall? Border walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is within bounds. y=0 to y=7, so y=3 is fine.\n> \n> x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7 walls. So playable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Head at (6,3), moving right. But x=6 is the rightmost column, so moving right would hit x=7 wall? x=7 is wall, so from (6,3) moving right to (7,3) is invalid, wall collision. But the head direction is given as R, which might be the current direction, but I need to choose the next move.\n> \n> Snake Head Direction: R – this is the direction it was moving to get to current position, I think. For the next move, I can choose U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Since it's moving right, I cannot move left immediately, so possible moves from here: U, D, R? But R to (7,3) is wall, so not possible. L is reverse, not allowed. So only U or D possible.\n> \n> Current head position: (6,3). Directions:\n> \n> - Up: (6,4)\n> \n> - Down: (6,2)\n> \n> - Left: (5,3) – but that's where the body is? Body segments: after head (6,3), next is (5,3), which is the first body segment. But when I move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves away, so moving left to (5,3) might be possible if that cell becomes empty, but currently it's occupied.\n> \n> In snake, when you move, the head goes to a new cell, and the tail leaves the last cell, so if I move left to (5,3), that cell is currently occupied by the first body segment, but after the move, the tail will move, so it might be safe, as long as it's not colliding with other body parts.\n> \n> The rules say: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" Here, the tail is at (2,3), so (5,3) is not the tail, it's the neck or something.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)] so head at (6,3), body at (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), tail at (2,3).\n> \n> If I move left to (5,3), that cell is occupied by the first body segment. After moving, the head moves to (5,3), but that cell was just vacated? No, when the head moves to (5,3), at that moment, (5,3) is still occupied by the body, so it would be a collision.\n> \n> I need to think carefully about the movement.\n> \n> At turn t, snake occupies certain cells. When I choose a direction, the head moves to the adjacent cell in that direction. If that cell is empty or has food, it might be ok, but if it has a body segment, it's collision, except for the tail cell, because the tail moves away at the same time.\n> \n> The rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell that will be the tail after movement is ok, because the tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, the tail is at (2,3). If I move left to (5,3), which is currently occupied by the first body segment, not the tail. The tail is at (2,3). So (5,3) is a body segment, not the tail. Moving there would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving right to (7,3) is wall, impossible.\n> \n> Moving up to (6,4) or down to (6,2).\n> \n> (6,4) and (6,2) need to be checked for obstacles or walls.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (6,4) is within bounds, y=4, x=6. Similarly (6,2).\n> \n> Internal obstacles: list includes (6,1), but not (6,4) or (6,2), so they should be free.\n> \n> (6,1) is obstacle, but (6,2) and (6,4) are not listed, so ok.\n> \n> So from current position, possible moves: U to (6,4) or D to (6,2).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (1,3) with life span 6, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (6,5) with life span 9, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> Food format: (x,y, life_span, value)\n> \n> So (1,3,6,1) and (6,5,9,1)\n> \n> Both are positive food, value 1.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,3) it's 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns including current? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn 11, life span 6, so it will disappear at turn 11 + 6 - 1? Let's see.\n> \n> If life span is N, it disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases each turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be gone after turn t + L - 1? For example, at turn t, L=1, it disappears after this turn, so can be eaten only on turn t.\n> \n> At turn t, L=2, it can be eaten on turn t or t+1, disappears after t+1.\n> \n> Generally, food with life span L at turn t will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> Here turn t=11.\n> \n> Food at (1,3): L=6, so disappears at end of turn 11 + 6 - 1 = 16? t + L - 1 = 11 + 6 - 1 = 16. So available from turn 11 to 16 inclusive? At turn 11, L=6, after turn 11, L becomes 5, and so on, until L=1 at turn 16, after which it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 11,12,13,14,15,16?

Snake positions: [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)], so (1,3) is not occupied by snake, it's free, I think. (1,3) is a cell, and snake is from (2,3) to (6,3), so (1,3) is empty and has food.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) is empty, has food.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, possible moves from (6,3): U to (6,4) or D to (6,2).\n> \n> If I go U to (6,4), then from there, I can go to (6,5) to eat the food there, but (6,5) has food, so if I move to (6,5), I eat it, snake grows to length 6, new tail added.\n> \n> But let's see the risks.\n> \n> After moving to (6,4), the snake positions would be: head at (6,4), body at (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), tail at (2,3) still? When head moves to new cell, the tail moves away, so if no food eaten, tail is removed.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a cell without food, tail is removed, so snake moves forward.\n> \n> If food eaten, tail not removed, snake grows.\n> \n> Here, moving to (6,4) has no food, so if I move U to (6,4), new head at (6,4), body: the previous head (6,3) becomes new first body, then (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), and tail (2,3) is removed? Positions: after move, snake is at [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)] since tail moved away from (2,3).\n> \n> Length was 5, no food eaten, so new length 5, positions: head at (6,4), then segments at (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3).

Value +1, length increases by 1.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows, so new positions: head moves to (6,5), and the tail doesn't move? No, when snake moves, head goes to new cell, each segment moves to the next position, but when eating, a new segment is added at the tail, so tail stays in place.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so after move, head is at new position, body follows, and tail remains or adds a segment.\n> \n> Specifically: when you move without eating, head to new, each body to previous position, tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> When eating, head to new, body follows, but tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added, length increases.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (6,5) which has food, so I eat it.\n> \n> So new snake positions: head at (6,5), then previous head (6,4) becomes body, then (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), and tail (3,3) stays, but since I ate, a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move, meaning the snake grows to length 6.\n> \n> Positions: after move to (6,5), head is (6,5), then the rest: since I ate, the tail doesn't advance, so positions: [ (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) ] so now 6 segments.\n> \n> Direction: after moving U, head direction is now U.\n> \n> But (6,5) is at y=5, and grid y=7 is wall, so y=5 is not wall, but let's see the position.\n> \n> Life span of food: food at (6,5) has life span 8, current turn 12, so it will disappear at turn 12 + 8 = 20? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Food life span: it says \"life_span\" and \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> In the state, food is given with life span, e.g., (1,3,5,1) meaning position, life_span, value.\n> \n> At turn t1=12, life span is 5 for (1,3), so it has 5 turns left including turn 12? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 12, life span is 5, meaning it will disappear after 5 more turns? Let's clarify.\n> \n> It says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> For example, at turn t, if life span is L, then after turn t, L decreases by 1, and when L=0, it disappears at the end of that turn? But since we move and eat on the turn, we need to know when it exists.\n> \n> Typically, if countdown decreases each turn including current, and disappears when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> But for eating, on a turn, if head moves to food cell, it eats it before it disappears or after?\n> \n> The rule doesn't specify timing, but I think it's standard: on a turn, snake moves, and if it moves to a food cell, it eats it and the food is consumed, regardless of life span, as long as it exists at the start of the turn.\n> \n> The rule: \"Food can be eaten if head moves onto the food cell\" and it exists.\n> \n> Since life span decreases each turn, including current, I think at the start of turn, if life span >0, food is there, and if head moves to it, it is eaten.\n> \n> Then after eating or not, at end of turn, life span decreases.\n> \n> But for disappearance, it says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from now.\n> \n> For (1,3): life span 5 at turn 12, so it will disappear after turn 16? Let's see.\n> \n> \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, then:\n> \n> - At start of turn t, food exists if L > 0\n> \n> - After the turn, L decreases by 1\n> \n> - When L reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn.\n> \n> For (1,3) at turn 12, L=5, so exists at turn 12 start.\n> \n> After turn 12, L decreases to 4.\n> \n> After turn 13, L=3, and so on, until after turn 16, L=0, so it disappears after turn 16, meaning not present at turn 17.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) L=8 at turn 12, so exists until after turn 19, disappears at turn 20.\n> \n> But for eating, if snake moves to it on turn t, and food exists at start of t, it can be eaten.\n> \n> In this case, both foods exist at turn 12.\n> \n> Back to moves.\n> \n> Option 1: Move U to (6,5)\n> \n> - Eat food at (6,5), value +1, snake grows to length 6.\n> \n> - New positions: head (6,5), body (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)\n> \n> - Head direction now U.\n> \n> Now, from (6,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but current direction U, so cannot move D (down).\n> \n> U to (6,6): y=6, but y=7 is wall, y=6 is not border?

So, I should sketch this grid to visualize.\n> \n> The grid is 8x8 since x from 0 to 7 and y from 0 to 7. But walls are at the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells like (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. Also, internal obstacles are given, so those cells are blocked.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1).

Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse instantly. Since direction is U, reverse is D, so cannot go D. Also, cannot go into walls or body, but body collision: head can move to tail position because tail moves, but need to be careful.\n> \n> Current snake positions: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)\n> \n> So, the tail is at (3,3), and the body segments are in between.\n> \n> From (6,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (6,6) — is this valid? y=6, but y=7 is wall, so y=6 should be ok? Borders: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is within 1 to 6? x and y from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Therefore, playable cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are free, except for internal obstacles.\n> \n> Similarly, x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> So (6,5) to U: (6,6) — y=6 is within 1-6, so ok, but is there a wall? Internal obstacles: (6,1) is an obstacle, but (6,6) is not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> But (6,6) is at x=6,y=6, which is not a border wall, and not in internal obstacles list: internal obstacles are (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). (6,1) is obstacle, but (6,6) is not, so free.\n> \n> Now, is (6,6) occupied by snake? Snake positions: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) — so (6,6) is not occupied. So moving U to (6,6) should be possible.\n> \n> D: (6,4) — but (6,4) is the second segment of the snake. If I move down to (6,4), which is currently occupied by the body, but after move, the tail will move, so (6,4) will be free? Let's think.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves off its current position, so each body segment shifts.\n> \n> If head moves to (6,4), which is currently occupied by the second segment, but after the move, that cell will be occupied by the head, and the segment that was there moves to where the head was, but it's messy.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, all body segments follow, so the cell that was tail is vacated, except if a food is eaten, tail doesn't move, length increases.\n> \n> But in terms of collision, the head cannot move to a cell that will be occupied by the body after the move, except for the tail cell, because the tail moves away.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves, so after move, head is there, tail is gone.\n> \n> But moving to any other body cell is deadly because head touches body.\n> \n> From (6,5), moving D to (6,4): (6,4) is currently occupied by the second segment (index 1, since head is 0). After move, if head moves to (6,4), the body will be: head at (6,4), then the old head (6,5) becomes the new neck, so (6,4) has head, then (6,5), then (6,3), (5,3), etc. But (6,4) was occupied, and now head is there, but the segment that was at (6,4) moves to (6,5), so the cell (6,4) is occupied by head after move, and (6,5) by the first body segment.\n> \n> But at the time of move, (6,4) has a body segment, not the tail. The tail is at (3,3), so (6,4) is not the tail; it's a body segment. Therefore, moving to (6,4) would cause head to collide with body, which is deadly. So cannot move down to (6,4).\n> \n> Similarly, moving L to (5,5): (5,5) is not in snake positions? Snake: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3). So (5,5) is free? But internal obstacles: (5,5) is listed as an internal obstacle. (5,5) is in the list: (5,5) is an obstacle. So (5,5) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Moving R to (7,5): but x=7 is border wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> x=7 is wall, so (7,5) is invalid.\n> \n> Therefore, from (6,5), with head direction U, possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (6,6) — seems possible, as above.\n> \n> - D: not possible, because reverse and also collision.\n> \n> - L: (5,5) — but (5,5) is obstacle, so no.\n> \n> - R: (7,5) — x=7 wall, no.\n> \n> So only possible move is U to (6,6).\n> \n> Is that right? What about other directions? L is to (5,5), which is obstacle, R is wall, D is reverse and collision, so yes, only U is possible?

When head moves to (6,6), the snake positions become: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)] and tail (3,3) is gone, so length 6, no food eaten.\n> \n> So at turn 14, snake positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)]\n> \n> Head at (6,6), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (6,7) - y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> - D: (6,5) - now (6,5) is the first body segment.

After move, head at (6,5), and the body: (6,6) becomes segment 1, (6,5) was segment 1, now head is there, so segment 1 moves to (6,6), etc. But (6,5) is currently body, not tail, so moving to it would cause collision. Tail is at (4,3), so (6,5) is not tail. Therefore, cannot move to (6,5).\n> \n> - L: (5,6) - what is (5,6)? x=5,y=6. Is it free? Not wall, not obstacle?

(5,6) is a food position with value 1, life span 10.\n> \n> Head is moving to (5,6), so it will eat the food.\n> \n> Food at (5,6) is positive, so snake eats it, length increases by 1, so tail does not move.\n> \n> Therefore, after eating, snake positions: head at (5,6), then the body: since food eaten, the tail stays, so positions: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)]? Let's see.\n> \n> Original before move: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)]\n> \n> Head moves to (5,6), which is food, so the head occupies (5,6), and the body remains, but since food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail, so tail stays.\n> \n> So snake becomes: head (5,6), then previous head (6,6) becomes segment 1, then (6,5) segment 2, (6,4) segment 3, (6,3) segment 4, (5,3) segment 5, and (4,3) segment 6 (tail), but since length increases, a new tail is added? No.\n> \n> When food is eaten, the snake grows, so after moving head to new cell (with food), the tail does not move, so the new position has head at food cell, and all body segments follow, but since tail doesn't move, the length increases by one.\n> \n> So positions: new head at (5,6), then the previous positions minus the tail? No.\n> \n> Standard: after move, if no food, head to new, each segment to previous position, tail removed.\n> \n> If food eaten, head to new, each segment to previous position, but tail not removed, so the last segment stays, and a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> In this case, before move: segments [ (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ] with head (6,6).\n> \n> Move head to (5,6), which has food, so new head (5,6), then the body: the first segment moves to where head was (6,6), second to where first was (6,5), and so on, but since food eaten, the tail does not move, so the last segment (4,3) stays, and a new segment is added at the end? No.\n> \n> Typically, the tail remains in place, so the snake gains one segment.\n> \n> So after move: head at (5,6), then the previous head position (6,6) becomes the new second segment, then (6,5) becomes third, (6,4) fourth, (6,3) fifth, (5,3) sixth, and the tail (4,3) remains as seventh segment.\n> \n> So positions: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)]\n> \n> Length 7 now.\n> \n> And food at (5,6) is eaten, so removed.\n> \n> Now, head direction: since moved left from (6,6) to (5,6), direction is L.\n> \n> Now turn 15, head at (5,6), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (5,7) - y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> - D: (5,5) - but (5,5) is internal obstacle, cannot.\n> \n> - L: (4,6) - what is (4,6)? x=4,y=6. Not wall, not obstacle? Internal obstacles: (4,4) is obstacle, but (4,6) not listed. Snake positions: head (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), etc., not (4,6). So (4,6) should be free.\n> \n> - R: (6,6) - but (6,6) is the second segment. If I move right to (6,6), which is currently occupied by the body. After move, head to (6,6), which was segment 1, but it will be head, and segment 1 moves to where? But (6,6) is body, not tail. Tail is at (4,3). So moving to (6,6) would be collision with body.\n> \n> Cannot move to body except tail.\n> \n> So possible moves: L to (4,6) or D, but D to (5,5) obstacle, U wall, R to (6,6) body, not possible.\n> \n> So only L to (4,6).\n> \n> Thus for turn 15, move L to (4,6).\n> \n> No food there, so snake moves normally: head to (4,6), body: (5,6) becomes segment 1, (6,6) segment 2, etc., tail (4,3) moves off? Since no food, tail moves.\n> \n> After turn 14: positions [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)]\n> \n> Move head to (4,6), no food, so new positions: head (4,6), then (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), and tail (4,3) removed? Length 7, no food, so tail moves off.\n> \n> Thus: [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)] and (4,3) gone.\n> \n> Now head at (4,6), direction L (since moved left).\n> \n> Turn 16, head at (4,6), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (4,7) - y=7 wall, no.\n> \n> - D: (4,5) - what is (4,5)?

Since borders are walls, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Also, internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)].

Last move was up, so from turn 13 to 14, head moved from (6,5) to (6,6), I assume, since positions are head first: [(6,6), (6,5), ...] so head is at (6,6), and it was at (6,5) before, so direction U makes sense.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,3) with value 1 and life span 3?

Let's see: not wall, not occupied by snake? Snake positions after turn 14: head (5,6), body (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3). So (4,6) is empty.\n> \n> Food: there is food at (1,3) with life span 3, value 1.\n> \n> At turn 14, we ate (5,6), so it's gone.\n> \n> Now, at turn 15, move to (4,6).\n> \n> Now, head at (4,6), direction from (5,6) to (4,6) is left, so direction L.\n> \n> Turn 16: from (4,6), possible moves: L (to (3,6)), U (to (4,7) wall), D (to (4,5)), R not allowed (reverse).\n> \n> U to (4,7): y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> D to (4,5): is (4,5) free? Walls: internal obstacles include (4,4), but (4,5) not listed, so should be free. Snake positions: head (4,6), body (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3). (4,5) not occupied.\n> \n> L to (3,6): similarly, should be free.\n> \n> So possible moves: L to (3,6) or D to (4,5).\n> \n> Now, we need to think about the food at (1,3) with life span 3. At turn 14, life span 3, so after turn 14, it becomes 2? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> At turn 14, when we consider the food, life span is 3, meaning it can be eaten on turn 14,15,16? At turn 14, countdown is 3; after turn 14 (before turn 15), countdown 2; after turn 15, countdown 1; after turn 16, countdown 0, disappears.

When we move, the head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so tail is removed unless we eat food.\n> \n> At turn 15, we moved from (5,6) to (4,6), no food, so snake becomes: head (4,6), then body (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), and tail (4,3) is removed?

So, I should visualize this.\n> \n> Let me sketch a grid. It's 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so the playable area might be from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, the borders are walls, so cells like (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x. Also internal obstacles.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3). Head direction is L, which is left, so moving towards decreasing x.\n> \n> Food: only one piece at (1,3) with value 1 and life span 2. Life span 2 means it disappears after 2 turns, including the current turn. So on turn 15, life span is 2, so after turn 15, it will have life span 1, and after turn 16, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 15 or 16.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.

Assuming (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? Usually in grids, y increases up or down? In the movement, U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, I think, so higher y is up.\n> \n> In state, U: (x,y+1), so y increases upwards. So (0,0) is bottom-left, (7,7) top-right? But walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 top wall, etc.\n> \n> For simplicity, I'll assume (0,0) bottom-left, so U: y+1 up, D: y-1 down, L: x-1 left, R: x+1 right.\n> \n> Head at (5,6), direction L, so it came from right, since previous position is (6,6), so moving left to (5,6).\n> \n> Now, for turn 15, I need to choose action: U, D, L, or R, but cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is L, so opposite is R, so I cannot choose R for turn 15. So possible actions: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, let's see what each move does.\n> \n> If I move L (left) to (4,6): is this safe? Check for walls or body collision.\n> \n> Walls: x=0 to 7 borders, but (4,6) is within 1 to 6? x=4, y=6. Borders: x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 walls. So (4,6) is not a border wall. Internal obstacles: list is (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). (4,6) not in this list, so no obstacle.\n> \n> Body collision: snake body segments are (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3). (4,6) not among them, so safe to move to.\n> \n> If I move U (up) to (5,7): but y=7 is border wall, so (5,7) is wall, cannot move there. y=7 is top wall, so invalid.\n> \n> If I move D (down) to (5,5): check walls. (5,5) is an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles include (5,5), yes, from the list: (5,5) is there, so wall, cannot move to (5,5).\n> \n> Internal obstacles are walls, so cells occupied by walls.\n> \n> So (5,5) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> If I move R (right) to (6,6): but (6,6) is the first body segment. Now, collision rule: head touches any body segment except the tail, but when moving, if head moves to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's ok.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (6,6), which is currently occupied by the neck, the first body segment.\n> \n> Let's see the snake positions: indices: head (5,6), then body: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) so tail is (4,3).\n> \n> (6,6) is the segment right after head, so it's not the tail. Moving to (6,6) would be head touching body, which is collision.\n> \n> But after the move, the tail moves, so the cell (6,6) might be free or not.\n> \n> When the snake moves, if it doesn't eat, the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is vacated.\n> \n> But for collision, it's about the head moving to a cell that is occupied by any body segment at that moment, except that if it's the tail cell and we move in, it might be ok if the tail moves away.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, only the tail cell is safe to move into, because the tail moves away. Other body segments, if head moves there, it collides.\n> \n> In this case, for move to (6,6): (6,6) is currently occupied by the first body segment, not the tail. Tail is (4,3). So moving to (6,6) would cause collision with body, so invalid.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to any other body segment is invalid except tail.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (5,6):\n> \n> - U to (5,7): but y=7 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> - D to (5,5): (5,5) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid.\n> \n> - L to (4,6): not wall, not body, so possible.\n> \n> - R to (6,6): but (6,6) is body segment (neck), not tail, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move is L to (4,6). Is that right?\n> \n> What about other directions? U and D are invalid, R is invalid, so only L is possible? But let's confirm.\n> \n> (4,6) is empty, I think. No food there, just empty cell.\n> \n> But I have to move, so for turn 15, action must be L.\n> \n> But the action sequence needs to be 5+ turns, so I need to plan ahead.\n> \n> First, for turn 15, I think I have no choice but to move L to (4,6).\n> \n> Then snake head moves to (4,6), and since no food eaten (food is at (1,3)), so tail moves, so new snake positions: head (4,6), then the body: the previous head (5,6) becomes new neck, so positions: [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)] and tail was (4,3), but since no eat, tail moves off, so the last segment (5,3) becomes tail? Let's see.\n> \n> Original positions: index 0: head (5,6), 1: (6,6), 2: (6,5), 3: (6,4), 4: (6,3), 5: (5,3), 6: (4,3) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (4,6) without eating, the body segments shift: new head (4,6), then segment 1 becomes (5,6), segment 2 becomes (6,6), segment 3 becomes (6,5), segment 4 becomes (6,4), segment 5 becomes (6,3), segment 6 becomes (5,3), and tail (4,3) is removed since no growth.\n> \n> So new snake: [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)]\n> \n> Tail is (5,3).\n> \n> Now, head at (4,6), direction was L, but after move, new head direction depends on the action.\n> \n> I need to keep track of direction for the no reverse rule.\n> \n> After moving L, the head is now at (4,6), and it moved from (5,6), so direction is L.\n> \n> For turn 16, current direction is L.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (4,6):\n> \n> - U to (4,7): y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> - D to (4,5): check if wall or body.\n> \n> Walls: (4,5) not border, internal obstacles: list has (4,4), but not (4,5), so no wall.\n> \n> Body: new snake positions: (4,6) head, (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3). (4,5) not in these, so empty, possible.\n> \n> - L to (3,6): x=3,y=6. Not border wall. Internal obstacles: (3,4) is wall, but (3,6) not listed, so no wall. Body: not in snake, so possible.\n> \n> - R to (5,6): (5,6) is now the first body segment (neck), not tail. Tail is (5,3). So moving to (5,6) would collide with body, invalid.\n> \n> Also, cannot move opposite, but opposite of L is R, which is invalid anyway.\n> \n> So possible moves: D to (4,5) or L to (3,6).\n> \n> Now, I need to think about the food. Food is at (1,3) with life span 2 on turn 15. After turn 15, life span decreases to 1 on turn 16. Then after turn 16, it disappears, so only available on turn 16 now? On turn 15, it was available, but I didn't eat it because I moved to (4,6), not near it.\n> \n> On turn 16, food at (1,3) with life span 1, so if not eaten on turn 16, it disappears.\n> \n> Can I reach (1,3) by turn 16?\n> \n> From (4,6) to (1,3): need to move left and down.\n> \n> But I have to move step by step.\n> \n> On turn 16, from (4,6), I can move to (4,5) or (3,6).\n> \n> (1,3) is at x=1,y=3, so I need to go left to x=1 and down to y=3.\n> \n> From (4,6), to (1,3), the Manhattan distance is |4-1| + |6-3| = 3 + 3 = 6, so I need at least 6 moves to reach it, but on turn 16, I can only make one move, so I can't reach it on turn 16. On turn 16, I can be at (4,5) or (3,6), both are far from (1,3), so I cannot eat the food on turn 16. Therefore, the food will disappear after turn 16 without being eaten.\n> \n> So no point chasing it; it's gone.\n> \n> I need to think about survival and future food, but there's no other food mentioned. The state only has one food: (1,3,2,1). So after this, no food, but food might spawn later? The state doesn't say anything about new food spawning; I think for this problem, we only have the given food, and we need to deal with it.\n> \n> But the food has a life span, and it might be the only one.\n> \n> Since I can't eat it, I should focus on staying alive and maybe other opportunities.\n> \n> But there might be no other food, so I need to survive as long as possible, but score only increases by eating positive food.\n> \n> In this case, if no food, score doesn't change, but I need to avoid dying.\n> \n> First, let's plan the next moves.\n> \n> After turn 15, head at (4,6), direction L.\n> \n> For turn 16, I can move D to (4,5) or L to (3,6).\n> \n> I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, the grid has obstacles, so I should find a safe path.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> List: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Snake positions after turn 15: head (4,6), body (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)\n> \n> Tail at (5,3).\n> \n> Now, empty cells.\n> \n> I need to avoid dead ends.\n> \n> Since no food to eat, I should just keep moving safely.\n> \n> For turn 16, from (4,6):\n> \n> Option 1: Move D to (4,5)\n> \n> Then head at (4,5), new direction down?

Snake positions: head (4,6), then (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3). So (4,5) is not in the list, so not body. Also, walls: (4,5) not in wall list. Borders: y=5 is not border, x=4 not border. Internal obstacles: (4,4) is obstacle, but (4,5) is different. (4,4) is wall, but (4,5) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6): x=3,y=6. Not in snake positions, not border (y=6 not 0 or 7, x=3 not 0 or 7), internal obstacles: (3,4) is wall, but (3,6) not listed, so free.\n> \n> Now, both seem safe, but I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, tail position: (5,3). Head is at (4,6), not adjacent to tail. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (4,6) and (5,3) are not adjacent; distance is |4-5| + |6-3| =1 +3=4, not adjacent. So no tail reward danger.\n> \n> Now, food at (2,1) is positive, I should head towards it, but it has life 10, so not urgent.\n> \n> But the other food is disappearing, so I should focus on paths that might lead to other areas.\n> \n> Since I can't get the (1,3) food, I should avoid risks and plan for the future.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls:\n> \n> - Borders: all cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> - Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> (1,5) is listed, and (1,4), (1,2).

When I move without eating, the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> General movement: when snake moves to a new cell, if not eating food, it adds new head and removes tail, so length same.\n> \n> If eating food, adds new head, keeps tail, so length increases.\n> \n> Here, no food eaten yet.\n> \n> So if I move to (4,5), which has no food (food at (1,3) and (2,1), not (4,5)), so not eating.\n> \n> Therefore, new snake: head (4,5), then body: (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3) and tail (5,3) is removed?

Current direction is L, so I can move L (continue left), U (up), or D (down), but not R (right) since that's opposite.\n> \n> Now, from (3,6), moving L would go to (2,6), U to (3,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid, D to (3,5).\n> \n> y=6 is top row, y=1 is bottom? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6, with y=6 being the top, y=1 bottom? Typically in grids, y increases up or down? In the state, it says U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, I assume. Let's confirm.\n> \n> Movement: U (x,y+1) so y increases upwards, D (x,y-1) y decreases downwards. So if y=6 is the highest, moving U from y=6 to y=7 would be wall, invalid. Similarly, D to y=5.\n> \n> In the snake positions, (3,6) is head, and (3,6) to (4,6) etc., so y=6 is row 6.\n> \n> Now, food at (2,1), which is x=2, y=1, so bottom-left area.\n> \n> Life span 10, current turn 17, so it will disappear after 10 turns, meaning it will be gone on turn 17 + 10 = 27? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 17, life span is 10, so it will disappear after 10 turns, so on turn 27 it will be gone. Turn 17: life span 10, after turn 17 it becomes 9, after turn 18 it becomes 8, ..., after turn 26 it becomes 0, and disappears before turn 27 or at turn 27? The countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn t when food is present, life span decreases by 1 per turn.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is N at turn t, it will last N more turns including turn t. So at turn t, it has life span N, after turn t, N-1, and so on, until N=0, and it disappears before the next turn or at the end of the turn? I need to clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"Disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> It might be ambiguous. Let me interpret.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, food has life span N. After turn t, life span becomes N-1. It disappears when life span reaches 0, probably at the end of the turn or before next turn.\n> \n> But for planning, since we move on each turn, we need to eat it before life span reaches 0.\n> \n> At turn t, with life span L, it can be eaten on turns where L > 0, and after being eaten or when L=0, it disappears.\n> \n> In this case, turn 17, life span 10, so it can be eaten from turn 17 to turn 26, inclusive, I think. After turn 26, if not eaten, it disappears before turn 27.\n> \n> But since we act on each turn, we can eat it on any turn from 17 to 26 if we reach it.\n> \n> Now, distance to food: head at (3,6), food at (2,1). Manhattan distance |3-2| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6. So at least 6 moves away, but with obstacles and snake body, it might take more.\n> \n> But we need to think multiple moves ahead.\n> \n> Also, there is a risk: the food is positive, but we need to avoid collisions.\n> \n> Moreover, there is \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, the food is at (2,1), not on the tail, so probably not an issue now.\n> \n> First, let's find possible moves from current position.\n> \n> Head at (3,6), direction L (left).\n> \n> Possible actions:\n> \n> - L: left to (2,6). Is (2,6) valid? Not wall, not obstacle? Walls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (2,6) is x=2,y=6, which is within 1-6, so not border. Obstacles: list has (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1). (2,6) not in obstacles, so free? But snake body: snake positions: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3). So (2,6) is not occupied by snake body, so moving to (2,6) should be safe for now.\n> \n> When moving, the head moves to new cell, and tail moves away, so collision only if head hits body except the tail, since tail moves.\n> \n> Specifically, for a move to be safe, the new head position must not be wall, not obstacle, and not occupied by any body part except possibly the tail, because when head moves, the tail also moves, so the tail cell becomes free.\n> \n> In this case, snake body: head to tail: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3). Tail is (6,3).\n> \n> If head moves to (2,6), new positions: head (2,6), then body (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), and tail (6,3) moves away, so (6,3) is no longer part of snake. The segment that was at (6,3) is gone, and a new segment is added at head if food eaten, but not eaten yet.\n> \n> After move without eating, snake becomes [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)] and (6,3) is free.\n> \n> (2,6) was not occupied before, so no collision.\n> \n> Similarly, other moves.\n> \n> - U: up to (3,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - D: down to (3,5). (3,5) is within grid, not wall. Obstacles: (3,4) is obstacle, but (3,5) not in list. Snake body: (3,6) is head, moving away, so (3,5) not occupied. So possible.\n> \n> - R: right to (4,6), but (4,6) is the second segment of snake. After head moves, if head goes to (4,6), which is currently occupied by the body, but it's not the tail. Tail is (6,3). (4,6) is the second segment. If head moves to (4,6), it would collide with the body segment there, since that segment doesn't move away immediately; only the tail moves when the head moves.\n> \n> When head moves to a new cell, all body segments shift, so the cell that was occupied by the first body segment (after head) becomes the new head position? No.\n> \n> Sequence: positions are [head, segment1, segment2, ..., tail]\n> \n> After move: new head position, then the old head becomes segment1, old segment1 becomes segment2, etc., and the tail is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> So if head moves to a cell that was occupied by segment1 or later, except tail, it collides because that cell is still occupied until the shift.\n> \n> Specifically, the new head position must not be in the set of body cells except the tail cell, because the tail will move.\n> \n> In this case, body cells: (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)\n> \n> Tail is (6,3)\n> \n> If head moves to (4,6), which is occupied by segment1, not tail, so collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (5,6) or others would be collision.\n> \n> Only moving to empty cells or the tail cell is safe.\n> \n> Tail cell is safe because when head moves there, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> But in this position, tail is (6,3), not adjacent to head.\n> \n> Head at (3,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - L to (2,6): empty, safe\n> \n> - U to (3,7): wall, invalid\n> \n> - D to (3,5): empty, safe? (3,5) is not in snake body? Snake body: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), etc., (3,5) not listed, so should be free. But let's confirm coordinates.\n> \n> y=5, x=3.

It's turn 18, and I'm the AI controlling the snake. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,6), then body segments at (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4). So the snake is 7 segments long. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left last turn.\n> \n> Food: only one food item at (2,1) with value 1 and life span 9. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, it will disappear after 9 more turns? Life span is given as 9, and it decreases each turn, so after 9 turns, it will be gone. But on the turn it's eaten, it should be consumed before disappearing, I think. The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn 18, life span is 9, meaning it will last until turn 18 + 9 - 1? Let me clarify.\n> \n> The food has life_span N at turn t. It decreases each turn, so:\n> \n> - At turn t, life_span = N\n> \n> - At turn t+1, life_span = N-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - At turn t + N - 1, life_span = 1\n> \n> - At turn t + N, it disappears, so it can't be eaten on or after that turn.\n> \n> But since we act on turns, if the snake moves to the food cell on a turn when life_span >0, it can eat it. So for food at (2,1) with life_span 9 at turn 18, it can be eaten from turn 18 to turn 26 inclusive? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 18: life_span=9, present\n> \n> - Turn 19: life_span=8\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 26: life_span=1\n> \n> - Turn 27: life_span=0, disappears, not available.\n> \n> So it can be eaten on turns 18 to 26.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (2,6), and food is at (2,1). That's directly below, but with obstacles in between.\n> \n> First, I need to find a path to the food while avoiding walls, obstacles, and its own body.\n> \n> Also, I must think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Current head position: (2,6)\n> \n> Head direction: L (left), so last move was left to (2,6) from (3,6)? Snake positions: [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)]\n> \n> Since head is first, and it was moving left, so from (3,6) to (2,6) on previous turn.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (2,6):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (2,7) but y=7 is border wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Down (D): to (2,5)\n> \n> - Left (L): to (1,6)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (3,6), but (3,6) is the body segment, which is the neck. Since the tail will move, moving to (3,6) might be possible if the tail moves away.\n> \n> Collision rules: moving into a body segment is deadly except for the tail, because when the head moves to the tail cell, the tail moves forward, so it doesn't collide if it's the tail.\n> \n> But in this case, (3,6) is not the tail; the tail is at (6,4). Let's list the body:\n> \n> Index 0: head (2,6)\n> \n> Index 1: (3,6) – this is the segment right behind head\n> \n> Index 2: (4,6)\n> \n> Index 3: (5,6)\n> \n> Index 4: (6,6)\n> \n> Index 5: (6,5)\n> \n> Index 6: (6,4) – tail\n> \n> Now, if I move right to (3,6), which is occupied by index 1, but since the snake moves, when head moves to a new cell, all body segments shift forward. So if head moves to (3,6), which is currently occupied by body, but after movement, that cell will be the new head position, and the body will shift, so the segment that was at (3,6) will move to where the head was or something? I need to simulate the movement.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, if it doesn't eat food, the tail moves one step, so the cell that was tail is vacated. If it eats food, tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n> \n> For collision: head collides with any body segment except that if head moves to the current tail position, and tail moves away, it should be safe, but only if it's the tail.\n> \n> Specifically, from the rules: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But for other body segments, it's a collision.\n> \n> In this case, (3,6) is the first body segment, not the tail. So moving to (3,6) would cause head to collide with body at index 1, which is deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, walls: (2,7) is wall, (0,6) would be wall but x=0 is border, so left to (1,6) is possible, down to (2,5) possible.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,6):\n> \n> - U: (2,7) – y=7 border wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (2,5) – no wall or obstacle? Let's check obstacles: internal obstacles are (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). (2,5) is not in this list, and not border, so should be free.\n> \n> - L: (1,6) – x=1, y=6. Border walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (1,6) is within bounds. Obstacles: (1,5), (1,4), (1,2) are obstacles, but (1,6) is not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> - R: (3,6) – this is occupied by body segment at index 1, which is not tail, so moving there would cause collision. Invalid.\n> \n> So valid moves: Down to (2,5) or Left to (1,6).\n> \n> Now, head direction is L, so if I move Left, that's continuing left, no problem.

So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but borders are walls, so I can only move within x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so yes, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. But internal obstacles are given, so some cells are blocked.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)]\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,5), then (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5). So the snake has 7 segments. Head direction is D, meaning down, so last move was down to (2,5) from (2,6)? Positions are listed head first: [(2,5), (2,6), ...] so head is at (2,5), and since direction is D, it was moving down to (2,5), so previous position was (2,6) or something? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)]\n> \n> So head is (2,5), next is (2,6), which is above it? (2,5) and (2,6): y=5 and y=6, so if y increases upwards or downwards? In grid coordinates, usually y=0 is top or bottom? But in movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so let's define the coordinate system.\n> \n> From the movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). So, increasing y is up, decreasing y is down. So (x,y) with y=0 at bottom or top? Since U is y+1, that means y increases upwards, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? But walls are at y=0 and y=7, so if y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall.\n> \n> In the snake positions: head at (2,5), then (2,6). Since (2,6) is the second segment, and head is at (2,5), with direction D (down). If head is at (2,5) and moving down to (2,5), but direction is the current head direction, meaning the direction it moved to get to current position.\n> \n> Head direction: D, so it moved down to (2,5), so previous head position was (2,6) before moving down to (2,5)? Let's think.\n> \n> At turn t=19, snake head is at (2,5), and direction is D, meaning that on turn 18, head was at (2,6), and it moved down to (2,5) for turn 19. But in the positions, (2,6) is listed as the second segment, which is the body.\n> \n> The positions are the current state at turn t=19: head at (2,5), then segments: (2,6), (3,6), etc. So (2,6) is the neck, directly behind head.\n> \n> Since head direction is D, and head is at (2,5), it came from (2,6) by moving down. So the tail is at (6,5).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (2,1) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,1) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> Both are positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,1), life span 8, meaning it will disappear after 8 turns from now? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 19, life span 8, so it will disappear after turn 19 + 8 - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it decreases to L-1 on turn t+1, and disappears when countdown reaches 0? Or after N turns meaning it lasts for N turns including the current one?\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means it will disappear at the end of turn t + N, so it is available for N turns starting from now.\n> \n> But \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – let's see the wording.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, life span is L, on turn t, the countdown is L, then on turn t+1, it becomes L-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns when countdown >=1.\n> \n> For (2,1), life span 8 at turn 19, so it can be eaten on turns 19 to 26, and disappears after turn 26 or at turn 27?

It's turn 20, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. There are internal obstacles at: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). I should list all walls for clarity.\n> \n> Walls:\n> \n> - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n> \n> - Internal: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> From the input: [(5, 2), (4, 4), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 4), (3, 4), (5, 5), (6, 1)]\n> \n> So: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,4), then (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). So the snake is 7 segments long. Head is at (2,4) and direction is Down. Direction is given as D, which is down, meaning moving towards decreasing y? Let's confirm coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y increases upwards, but in this context, direction D might mean down, which could be decreasing y. Let me see the movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y increases up, decreases down. So (x,y) with y=0 at bottom or top? The movement definitions: U (x,y+1) up, D (x,y-1) down, L (x-1,y) left, R (x+1,y) right.\n> \n> But in the state, snake positions: (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). Head at (2,4), and direction D (down). Since D is (x,y-1), that means moving to lower y values. From (2,4) moving down would go to (2,3), but let's see the positions: from (2,6) to (2,5) to (2,4), so if head is at (2,4) and was moving down, it came from (2,5) to (2,4), which is decreasing y, so y=6 is higher, y=4 is lower? Positions: (2,6), (2,5), (2,4) — so (2,6) to (2,5) is down, decreasing y, so y=6 is north, y=0 is south. So y increases as we go up, decreases down.\n> \n> Standard: let's assume (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? Not specified, but from movement: U (x,y+1) should be up, so if (0,0) is bottom-left, y+1 up; if (0,0) top-left, y+1 down. But in the positions, (2,6) to (2,5) to (2,4) with direction down, so y=6 to y=5 to y=4, decreasing y, so if down is decreasing y, then higher y is north, lower y is south. So (0,0) is probably bottom-left, y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n> \n> But walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=0 is bottom row, y=7 top row.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1, life span 7? Format: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\n> \n> So (2,1, 7, 1) — that should be (x,y, life_span, value)? Input says: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\n> \n> Let's read: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (2, 1, 7, 1)\"\n> \n> It says: \"(2, 1, 7, 1)\" but the description is \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" so it might be (x,y, value, life_span) or what?\n> \n> Input: \" (2, 1, 7, 1) \" and \" (4, 1, 9, 1) \"\n> \n> But the format says: \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" so for first food, it should be ( (2,1), 1, 7 ) meaning x=2,y=1, value=1, life_span=7.\n> \n> Similarly, second: ( (4,1), 1, 9 ) value=1, life_span=9.\n> \n> Both are positive food since value=1.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn 20, for (2,1) life_span=7, so it will disappear after 7 turns, meaning on turn 27 it will be gone. Countdown: at turn 20, life_span=7, so after turn 20, it becomes 6, and so on, until 0, then disappears. So it can be eaten until turn 26 inclusive, I think? Life span decreases every turn, so if life_span at turn t is L, it exists for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at the start of turn t+L. So for (2,1) at t=20, life_span=7, so it exists until turn 26 (since 20+7-1=26), and gone at turn 27.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1) life_span=9, exists until turn 28.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (2,4), direction Down (D), so it was moving down to (2,4).\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is D, I can move L, R, or D, but not U because no instant reverse.

(2,3) is within bounds, not wall, so empty?\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4): is it wall? Internal obstacles: (1,4) is listed, yes, (1,4) is an obstacle.

But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Also, walls deadly.\n> \n> So for (2,3): not wall, not body (since body is at (2,4) and above, (2,3) is below, empty), so moving D to (2,3) is safe.\n> \n> Now, L to (1,4): but (1,4) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move there, collision.\n> \n> R to (3,4): (3,4) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> So only possible move is Down to (2,3)? But that can't be right, because if I can only move down, but let's confirm.\n> \n> Head at (2,4), possible adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (2,5) but that is the body segment, (2,5) is the second segment, so if I move up to (2,5), it would collide with body, since head touches body segment immediately.\n> \n> Movement: if I move U to (2,5), which is occupied by the snake body, so collision, deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, down to (2,3): empty, should be safe.\n> \n> Left to (1,4): (1,4) is wall, collision.\n> \n> Right to (3,4): (3,4) is wall, collision.\n> \n> So indeed, only possible move is Down to (2,3). But is that correct? Let me list all adjacent cells:\n> \n> - North: (2,5) - occupied by snake body (second segment)\n> \n> - South: (2,3) - empty, not wall\n> \n> - West: (1,4) - wall (internal obstacle)\n> \n> - East: (3,4) - wall (internal obstacle)\n> \n> So yes, only south (down) is possible without collision.\n> \n> But direction is D, so moving down is allowed.\n> \n> No instant reverse issue since moving down, not up.\n> \n> So on turn 20, I must move Down to (2,3).\n> \n> But I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n> \n> After moving to (2,3), what next?\n> \n> Turn 20: move D to (2,3)\n> \n> Then snake positions: head moves to (2,3), and tail moves? Snake was [(2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6)]\n> \n> After move down: head to (2,3), and body: since head moved, the segments follow: the new body is [ (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,6)? No.\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to new position, and each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So:\n> \n> New head: (2,3)\n> \n> Then the first body segment (previously at (2,4)) moves to where head was? Standard snake movement: the body segments follow the head.\n> \n> Specifically, the tail end is removed unless food eaten.\n> \n> Since no food eaten, length same, so tail moves away from (6,6).\n> \n> After moving down to (2,3):\n> \n> - Head was (2,4), moves to (2,3)\n> \n> - The segment that was at (2,5) moves to (2,4)\n> \n> - The segment that was at (2,6) moves to (2,5)\n> \n> - The segment that was at (3,6) moves to (2,6)? No.\n> \n> The snake is a sequence: positions[0] is head, positions[1] is next, etc., up to positions[6] tail.\n> \n> When head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So new positions: head at (2,3)\n> \n> Then positions[1] was at (2,5), now moves to where head was, (2,4)\n> \n> positions[2] was at (2,6), moves to where positions[1] was, (2,5)\n> \n> positions[3] was at (3,6), moves to where positions[2] was, (2,6)\n> \n> positions[4] was at (4,6), moves to where positions[3] was, (3,6)\n> \n> positions[5] was at (5,6), moves to where positions[4] was, (4,6)\n> \n> positions[6] was at (6,6), moves to where positions[5] was, (5,6)\n> \n> So new snake positions: [(2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)]\n> \n> Tail at (5,6), previously at (6,6), so moved to (5,6).\n> \n> Now head at (2,3), direction was D, now moving to (2,3) from (2,4), so direction still D?

It's turn 21, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since the borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7.

So the snake is 7 segments long. Head direction is Down, which is D, meaning it's moving downward. Since it's at (2,3) and direction is D, last move was down to (2,3), so it came from above? Let's see the positions: from head to tail: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6). (2,3) to (2,4) is up? y=3 to y=4, but in grid coordinates, usually y increases upward or downward?\n> \n> I need to clarify the coordinate system. The movement definitions: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). So U increases y, which typically means upward if y=0 is bottom, but in grid terms, it might vary. But since walls are at y=0 and y=7, and snake positions have y from 3 to 6, so y=6 is higher than y=3? Let's see: positions (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). (2,6) has higher y than (2,3), so if U is (x,y+1), that means increasing y moves up, so (2,6) is above (2,3). Head is at (2,3), and the body goes to (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), so the tail is at (2,6), which is higher y, so the snake was moving downward to reach (2,3). Head direction is D, which is down, so from (2,4) to (2,3) was down, since D is (x,y-1), so from y=4 to y=3.\n> \n> Confirming: snake positions: [(2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)]. So the head is at (2,3), which is the front. The segment behind it is (2,4), so to go from (2,4) to (2,3), it moved down because y decreased from 4 to 3. Similarly, before that, it was at (2,5) to (2,4) down, and so on. Then from (2,6) to (3,6), which is right, since x increased. Then to (4,6) right, to (5,6) right. So the snake was moving down along x=2 from y=6 to y=3, then turned right at (2,6) to go to (3,6), etc. But head is now at (2,3) moving down? Head direction is given as D, down.\n> \n> Food positions: two foods: (2,1) with life span 6, value 1 (positive), and (4,1) with life span 8, value 1 (positive). Both are positive food.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,1), life span 6 at turn 21, so it will disappear after 6 turns, meaning on turn 27 it will be gone. Similarly, (4,1) life span 8, disappears on turn 29.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan 5+ turns ahead. Possible moves: since head is at (2,3) and direction is D (down), so next move can be L (left), R (right), or D (down), but not U (up) because that would be instant reverse. Current direction D, so cannot move U immediately.\n> \n> Available moves from (2,3):\n> \n> - Down (D): to (2,2)\n> \n> - Left (L): to (1,3)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (3,3)\n> \n> But I have to check for walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So moving to x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 would be wall collision.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> So for possible moves:\n> \n> - D to (2,2): y=2, which is not y=0, so not border. Is (2,2) an obstacle? Internal obstacles listed: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1). (2,2) is not in this list, so should be safe, but need to check if it's part of snake body.\n> \n> Snake positions: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6). So (2,2) is not occupied by snake body, since y=2 is below head.\n> \n> - L to (1,3): x=1, y=3. Not border. Obstacles at (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), but (1,3) is not listed, so should be free? Obstacles are (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) — (1,4) and (1,5) are listed, but (1,3) is not, so (1,3) should be empty.\n> \n> - R to (3,3): x=3, y=3. Obstacles: (3,4) is obstacle, but (3,3) is not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> Also, need to consider future moves and food.\n> \n> Food is at (2,1) and (4,1). (2,1) is directly below (2,3) at (2,2) then (2,1). Similarly, (4,1) is to the right and down.\n> \n> But (2,1) has life span 6, meaning it disappears in 6 turns, so by turn 27. Similarly, (4,1) in 8 turns, turn 29.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (2,3). If I move down to (2,2), then next turn I could move down to (2,1) to eat the food, since (2,1) is positive food.\n> \n> But I need to think about risks. Also, Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision.\n> \n> First, let's see where the tail is. Tail is at (5,6). After moving, the tail moves only if the snake doesn't eat, but when it eats, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows.\n> \n> Currently, snake length 7. If I eat positive food, length becomes 8.\n> \n> Now, for (2,1): if I go directly down, in two moves: turn 21: move D to (2,2), turn 22: move D to (2,1) to eat food.\n> \n> But when I eat at (2,1), what happens? The food is eaten, snake grows, so new tail is added where? When you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and since it's positive, length increases by one, so the tail stays in place for that turn, meaning the segment before the tail doesn't move, but a new segment is added.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when you eat, the head moves to the food, and the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one cell. If you don't eat, the head moves forward and the tail moves forward, so length same.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (2,1) on turn 22, I eat the food, so snake grows: head is now (2,1), and tail remains where it was, but since I moved to (2,1), the previous position (2,2) becomes new body, and tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Let's simulate.\n> \n> Current turn 21: snake positions: head (2,3), body (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), tail (5,6)\n> \n> After move D to (2,2) on turn 21: new head position (2,2), so positions become: head (2,2), then previous head (2,3) becomes body, so [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)]? No: when the head moves, all segments shift. So from turn 21 to turn 22:\n> \n> - Head moves to new position, say (2,2)\n> \n> - Then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front of it.\n> \n> - Tail is removed if no growth.\n> \n> But since no eating on turn 21, just moving to (2,2), so new positions: head (2,2), then (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), and tail (5,6) is removed? No: the tail moves to where the second last was.\n> \n> Standard: the snake moves one cell, head to new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the last segment (tail) is removed from the list, and the new head is added.\n> \n> So current positions: index 0: head (2,3), 1: (2,4), 2: (2,5), 3: (2,6), 4: (3,6), 5: (4,6), 6: tail (5,6)\n> \n> After move D to (2,2): new head (2,2), then body segments take previous positions: segment 1 moves to old head (2,3), segment 2 to old seg1 (2,4), ..., segment 6 (tail) moves to old seg5 (4,6). So new positions: [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)] and tail (5,6) is gone, but since no growth, length same, so positions: head (2,2), then (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) — tail at (4,6).\n> \n> Old tail (5,6) is removed, new tail is the segment that was at (4,6) but now it's at (3,6)? Let's list:\n> \n> - New head: (2,2)\n> \n> - New segment 1: old head (2,3)\n> \n> - New segment 2: old seg1 (2,4)\n> \n> - New segment 3: old seg2 (2,5)\n> \n> - New segment 4: old seg3 (2,6)\n> \n> - New segment 5: old seg4 (3,6)\n> \n> - New segment 6: old seg5 (4,6)  // this is new tail\n> \n> Old seg6 (5,6) is removed.\n> \n> So positions after turn 21 move: [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n> \n> Tail at (4,6).\n> \n> Now, on turn 22, if I move D to (2,1), and (2,1) has food, so I eat it. Then, since eating, the head moves to (2,1), but the tail does not move, so the snake grows: positions become head (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) — and a new segment is added where? The tail stays, so the last segment (4,6) remains, and a new segment is added after the head? No.\n> \n> When eating, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail remains in place, so the new positions are: head at food, then the previous head position, and all body segments, with tail not moving.\n> \n> So after move to (2,1) and eat: head (2,1), then previous positions: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) — and since tail didn't move, the segment at (4,6) is still there, so positions: [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)] length 8.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> Now, back to risks. The food at (2,1) is directly below, and I can reach it in two moves. But is there any danger?\n> \n> First, on turn 21, moving to (2,2): is (2,2) safe? Not a wall, not obstacle, not body part—current body is at (2,3) to (2,6) and (3,6), (4,6), so (2,2) is empty, so ok.\n> \n> Then on turn 22, moving to (2,1): (2,1) is not wall, not obstacle, and after move, it will be head position, but I need to check if it's safe to move there.\n> \n> Also, Tail Reward Danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food. Here, tail is at (5,6) now, but after turn 21 move, tail is at (4,6), and (2,1) is far away, not adjacent. Adjacent means one cell away, like same x or y with diff 1.\n> \n> After eating at (2,1), the tail is at (4,6), which is not adjacent to (2,1), so no issue.\n> \n> But there might be other risks. For example, after eating at (2,1), I'm at (2,1) with a longer snake, and I need to find a way out.\n> \n> (2,1) is near the bottom, y=1, since y=0 is wall. So from (2,1), I can move left to (1,1), right to (3,1), or up to (2,2), but (2,2) is now body, since after eating, (2,2) is the segment behind head.\n> \n> After positions: head (2,1), body (2,2), (2,3), etc. So from (2,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - L to (1,1)\n> \n> - R to (3,1)\n> \n> - U to (2,2) but (2,2) is body, so collision if I move there. So cannot move up.\n> \n> Also, D to (2,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> So only L or R.\n> \n> Now, (1,1): is it free? Walls: x=0 or y=0 border, so (1,1) x=1>0, y=1>0, not border. Obstacles: internal, (1,2) is obstacle, (1,4), (1,5), but (1,1) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1): not border, obstacles: (3,4) is obstacle, but (3,1) not listed, so free.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term. Also, there's another food at (4,1), which is closer to (3,1) or something.\n> \n> But let's consider the sequence.\n> \n> If I go for (2,1) immediately, I can get it by turn 22.\n> \n> But life span: (2,1) life 6, at turn 21, so it will be there until turn 26? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 21, it has life 6, meaning after 6 turns it disappears. So:\n> \n> - Turn 21: life span 6\n> \n> - Turn 22: life span 5\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 26: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 27: gone\n> \n> So I need to eat it by turn 26.\n> \n> Similarly for (4,1), life 8, gone after turn 28? Turn 21: life 8, turn 22:7, ..., turn 28:1, turn 29: gone.\n> \n> Since I can eat (2,1) by turn 22, well within life.\n> \n> But after eating at (2,1), I'm at (2,1) with limited moves: only left or right.\n> \n> Now, if I go left to (1,1), then from there, I can go up to (1,2), but (1,2) is an obstacle! Internal obstacle at (1,2).\n> \n> So from (1,1), moves:\n> \n> - U to (1,2): obstacle, invalid\n> \n> - D to (1,0): y=0 wall, invalid\n> \n> - L to (0,1): x=0 wall, invalid\n> \n> - R to (2,1): but (2,1) is now body? After moving to (1,1), let's see.\n> \n> After eating at (2,1) on turn 22, positions: head (2,1), body (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n> \n> On turn 23, if I move L to (1,1): then new head (1,1), and since no eat, tail moves: so positions become head (1,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — tail at (3,6), since (4,6) removed.\n> \n> (1,1) is free? As I thought, not wall, not obstacle.\n> \n> But from (1,1), I cannot move up because (1,2) is obstacle, cannot move down to (1,0) wall, cannot move left to (0,1) wall, so only possible move is right to (2,1), but (2,1) is now occupied by the body segment behind the head. In the new positions, after moving to (1,1), the segment at (2,1) is the first body segment, so moving to (2,1) would collide with own body.\n> \n> Specifically, from (1,1), moving to (2,1) is adjacent right, but (2,1) is occupied by the snake body, so collision, death.\n> \n> Therefore, if I go to (1,1) from (2,1), I get stuck and die on the next move because the only possible move is back to (2,1), which is occupied.\n> \n> Therefore, moving left to (1,1) is a dead end.\n> \n> Similarly, if from (2,1) I move right to (3,1) on turn 23.\n> \n> (3,1) is free, not wall, not obstacle.\n> \n> Then positions: head (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), etc., tail moves to (3,6)? After move to (3,1), no eat, so tail moves: positions head (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — tail at (3,6).\n> \n> Now from (3,1), I can move: U to (3,2), D to (3,0) wall invalid, L to (2,1) but (2,1) is body, collision, R to (4,1).\n> \n> (4,1) has food! But I need to see if I can eat it.\n> \n> (4,1) is the other food, positive.\n> \n> So on turn 23, from (3,1), I can move R to (4,1) to eat the food.\n> \n> Then, eat at (4,1), so snake grows: head (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), ... up to (3,6), and tail stays, so length increases to 9.\n> \n> But let's see the positions.\n> \n> After turn 23 move to (4,1) and eat: head (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — and since ate, tail doesn't move, so (3,6) remains, positions: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)] length 9.\n> \n> Now, from (4,1), I can move: U to (4,2), D to (4,0) wall, L to (3,1) body, R to (5,1).\n> \n> (5,1): is it free? Not wall, obstacles: (5,2) is obstacle, (5,5), but (5,1) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2): not obstacle? Obstacles: (4,4) is obstacle, but (4,2) not listed.\n> \n> So from (4,1), I can go U to (4,2) or R to (5,1).\n> \n> But I need to think if this is safe long-term. The snake is getting longer, and I'm in the bottom row, which might be risky.\n> \n> Also, there might be better options.\n> \n> But back to the immediate choice: if I go directly for (2,1) on turns 21 and 22, I can eat it, but then from (2,1) I must go right to (3,1) to avoid dying, and then to (4,1) to eat the other food. So I get both foods quickly.\n> \n> But after that, I'm at (4,1) with a long snake, length 9, and need to find a path.\n> \n> Perhaps I should consider not going directly down, but going left or right first to position for other food or avoid dead ends.\n> \n> Another option: on turn 21, instead of down, I could go left or right.\n> \n> For example, move left to (1,3) on turn 21.\n> \n> (1,3) is free?

It's turn 22, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls occupy those borders, meaning I can't go to cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there are internal obstacles at: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). I should list all the walls and obstacles to avoid.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,2), then body segments at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). So the snake has 7 segments. Head direction is D, which is down. Since it's moving down, that means from (2,2) to (2,3) would be down? Let's see the positions: head at (2,2), next segment at (2,3). If head is at (2,2) and moving down, down would decrease y, I think? No, typically in grids, y increases upwards or downwards? I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> The movement definitions: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). And walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders. y=0 is the bottom or top? Since D is (x,y-1), that means y decreases as we go down, so y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top row? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Typically in such games, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? But the movement: U (up) is (x,y+1), so if y+1 is up, then y increases upwards, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right. But walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's see.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So cells like (0,y) for any y, (7,y) for any y, (x,0) for any x, (x,7) for any x are walls. So the grid has cells from (1,1) to (6,6) that are not walls, except for internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). So these are also blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,2), then (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). Since head direction is D, down, which is decreasing y. From (2,2) to (2,3) is increasing y, but direction is down? Inconsistency here.\n> \n> Head is at (2,2), and the next segment is (2,3). If the snake is moving down, but (2,3) has higher y, which should be up if y+1 is up. I think I have a confusion.\n> \n> Movement: U (x,y+1) – if y+1 is up, then higher y is up. But in positions, head at (2,2), next at (2,3), so from (2,2) to (2,3) is an increase in y, so that would be moving up, not down. But head direction is given as D, down. That doesn't match.\n> \n> Perhaps the direction is the current moving direction. At turn 22, the head is at (2,2), and it just moved to there, so the direction it was moving to get to (2,2) is down. Let's think.\n> \n> The snake positions list is in order: head first, then body. So at some previous turn, head was at (2,1) or something, moved down to (2,2)? But let's see the positions: (2,2) head, then (2,3), which is above it if y increases up. So if head is at (2,2) and next is (2,3), that means the snake was moving up to get to (2,2)? I'm confused.\n> \n> Perhaps the direction is the direction it will move next. The state says \"Snake Head Direction: D\" which is the current direction it is facing, meaning it will move in that direction unless changed.\n> \n> But in the positions, from head (2,2) to the next segment (2,3), if (2,3) has higher y, it means the head moved from a lower y to higher y, so it was moving up. But direction is given as D, down. Contradiction.\n> \n> Unless the coordinate system is different. Let's look at the movement definitions: U (x,y+1) – y+1, so y increases up. D (x,y-1) – y decreases down.\n> \n> But in positions, head (2,2), body (2,3), so body is at higher y, so head must have come from a cell with lower y, like (2,1), moving up to (2,2). But direction is D, which is down. That can't be.\n> \n> Perhaps the direction is the direction it is going to move next, not the previous direction.\n> \n> The state says: \"Snake Head Direction: D\" – I think it's the current moving direction, meaning it was moving down to arrive at (2,2), but if it was moving down to (2,2), it came from (2,3) or something? Let's list the positions: indices 0: (2,2) head, 1: (2,3), 2: (2,4), 3: (2,5), 4: (2,6), 5: (3,6), 6: (4,6).\n> \n> So the tail is at (4,6), and head at (2,2). If the snake was moving down to (2,2), that would mean it came from (2,3) or (2,1)? If it was moving down to (2,2), it came from a cell with higher y, like (2,3), but (2,3) is the first body segment, so it should be the cell it just left. I think I have a misunderstanding of how snake positions work.\n> \n> Typically in snake games, the positions list shows the current cells occupied. Head at position 0, then the segment that was head before, and so on, to the tail. So when the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail leaves its cell.\n> \n> At the current state, head is at (2,2), so on the next move, it will move to a new cell based on the direction.\n> \n> The head direction is given as D, so it is currently facing down, meaning if no change, it will move down to (2,1) or (2,1-1)? D is (x,y-1), so from (2,2) moving down would be to (2,1).\n> \n> But in the body, there is a segment at (2,3), which is above, so (2,3) is not directly behind it in terms of movement; the body is at (2,3), (2,4), etc., so the snake is vertical at x=2, y from 2 to 6, then turns to (3,6), (4,6).\n> \n> From head at (2,2), the next segment is (2,3), which is at (2,3), so if the head moves down to (2,1), that would be away from the body, so it's possible. The direction D means it is set to move down next, unless I change it.\n> \n> Similarly, the previous move must have been from (2,1) to (2,2) or something, but (2,1) is not in the positions, so it must have been the previous head position before moving to (2,2).\n> \n> Let's assume that at turn 22, the snake is at these positions, and head direction is D, so it will move down to (2,1) if I choose D or no change, but I can choose to turn left or right.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: since current direction is D, I cannot move U (up) on the next turn, because that would be opposite.\n> \n> So possible moves from (2,2) with direction D: I can move D (down), L (left), or R (right), but not U.\n> \n> Now, let's list all food:\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (4,2) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All have value 1, so all positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,1), life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns including current turn? The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span), Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (2,1), life_span=5, at turn 22, it will disappear after turn 22 + (5-1) or something? Let's see: if life_span N, it disappears after N turns from now, meaning it will be gone at turn 22 + N.\n> \n> The rule: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, if food has life_span L, it will disappear at turn t + L, and the countdown is L at turn t, L-1 at t+1, ..., 0 at t+L, gone.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life_span L, it can be eaten until turn t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> Similarly here, turn 22:\n> \n> - Food at (2,1): life_span 5, so disappears at turn 22+5=27. Can be eaten from turn 22 to 26.\n> \n> - Food at (4,1): life_span 7, disappears at turn 29.\n> \n> - Food at (4,2): life_span 10, disappears at turn 32.\n> \n> All have value +1, so eating any of them increases length by 1.\n> \n> Now, snake is at positions: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). So the body occupies these cells.\n> \n> Food at (2,1) is directly below the head at (2,2). Since head is at (2,2), moving down to (2,1) would eat the food there, if it's present.\n> \n> But is (2,1) a valid cell? Walls: border cells include y=0, so y=1 is not a wall, since walls are y=0 and y=7. y=0 is wall, y=1 is playable, similarly x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6 are playable except obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1). (2,1) is not in obstacles, so it should be free.\n> \n> But (2,1) has food, and if I move down to it, I eat the food.\n> \n> However, there is a rule about food under the body. But (2,1) is not under the body; it's an empty cell with food, I think. The snake is at (2,2) to (2,6) and (3,6),(4,6), so (2,1) is not occupied by snake, so it's fine.\n> \n> But let's check if moving to (2,1) is possible. Current direction D, so moving down is allowed.\n> \n> But after eating, the snake grows, so new tail added.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> List: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Snake: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n> \n> Food: (2,1), (4,1), (4,2)\n> \n> Now, from head (2,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - D (down) to (2,1) - has food, and it's free.\n> \n> - L (left) to (1,2) - but (1,2) is an obstacle!

It's turn 23. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacles at: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). So, I should sketch a grid to visualize this.\n> \n> The grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), I assume, since borders are at x=0,7 and y=0,7. So, it's an 8x8 grid, but coordinates start from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). So the snake is mostly vertical on x=2 from y=1 to y=6, then turns right to (3,6) and (4,6). Head direction is D, which is down. But the head is at (2,1), and moving down would go to (2,0), but y=0 is a wall, so that's impossible. Head direction is D, meaning it was moving down last turn? But it can't move down now because (2,0) is a wall.\n> \n> Current head position is (2,1), and direction is D (down). But moving down to (2,0) would hit the wall since y=0 is border. So that move is invalid. The snake must choose a different direction.\n> \n> The rules say: \"In each turn you can choose to move 1 cell in following directions: U, D, L, R.\" And \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is D, so I cannot move U (up) immediately because that would be reverse. Moving up from (2,1) would be to (2,2), but (2,2) is occupied by the snake's body? Let's see.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]. So head at (2,1), next segment at (2,2), which is directly above it. Since head is at (2,1) and moving down is impossible (wall), and moving up would be to (2,2), which is the body. But is that a collision?\n> \n> Body collision: \"head touches any body segment.\" If head moves to a cell with a body segment, it collides, except for the tail, because the tail will move. But here, (2,2) is not the tail; it's the second segment. The tail is at (4,6).\n> \n> Let me list the segments in order:\n> \n> - Index 0: head (2,1)\n> \n> - Index 1: (2,2)\n> \n> - Index 2: (2,3)\n> \n> - Index 3: (2,4)\n> \n> - Index 4: (2,5)\n> \n> - Index 5: (2,6)\n> \n> - Index 6: (3,6)\n> \n> - Index 7: tail (4,6)\n> \n> So, if the head moves to (2,2), that's where segment 1 is, and it's not the tail, so it would be a collision and die. Similarly, moving left: (1,1) or right: (3,1), but I need to check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> First, possible moves from (2,1):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (2,2) – but (2,2) is occupied by body segment, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> - Down (D): to (2,0) – y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (1,1) – now, is this wall or obstacle?\n> \n> Walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1).\n> \n> (1,1) is not listed as an obstacle, and not border since x=1 not 0 or 7, y=1 not 0 or 7. So (1,1) should be free? But let's confirm the obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) are obstacles, but (1,1) is not mentioned, so it should be empty.\n> \n> Similarly, right (R): to (3,1). (3,1) not listed as obstacle or wall.\n> \n> But (6,1) is an obstacle, but that's different.\n> \n> So possible moves:\n> \n> - Left (L) to (1,1)\n> \n> - Right (R) to (3,1)\n> \n> Up and down are invalid as above.\n> \n> But current direction is D, so I cannot move U because it's opposite. No instant reverse. Since last move was down (to get to (2,1)? Head is at (2,1), and direction is D, meaning it was moving down to reach (2,1), so from where? Previous position must have been (2,2) or something? Snake positions: from (2,1) to (2,6) then to (3,6), (4,6). Since head is at (2,1) and direction D, it must have come from above, so from (2,2) down to (2,1)? But (2,2) is directly above, so if it moved down to (2,1), that means before that, head was at (2,2) and moved down to (2,1). But (2,2) is now the second segment.\n> \n> In terms of movement, the snake was previously at positions shifted. At turn 22, head might have been at (2,2), moved down to (2,1) for turn 23? But in the state, it's given positions at turn 23, so head at (2,1), and direction D means the direction it was moving when it arrived here.\n> \n> For no instant reverse, since current direction is D, I cannot move U (up) on the next turn, because that would be opposite.\n> \n> But in this case, moving U is invalid anyway because (2,2) is body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving D is invalid due to wall.\n> \n> So only options are L or R.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (4,1) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,2) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> Both are positive food.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn, including current. So at turn 23, for (4,1) life span 6, it will disappear after 6 more turns, so at turn 29? Life span is given as remaining turns, I think.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (4,1), life_span=6 at turn 23, meaning it will disappear after 6 turns, so it exists from turn 23 to turn 28, and gone at turn 29. Similarly, (4,2) life_span=9, exists until turn 31.\n> \n> Value both +1.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (2,1). Possible moves: L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's see what happens if I move left to (1,1).\n> \n> From (1,1), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But check surroundings:\n> \n> - Up: (1,2) – but (1,2) is an internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Down: (1,0) – y=0 is border wall, cannot move.\n> \n> - Left: (0,1) – x=0 is border wall, cannot move.\n> \n> - Right: (2,1) – but (2,1) is the current head position, which will be body when snake moves. After moving to (1,1), the new head is at (1,1), and the tail will move, so (2,1) becomes part of body? Let's think about snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail segment is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> In this case, if no food eaten, tail moves away.\n> \n> So after moving to (1,1):\n> \n> - Head moves to (1,1)\n> \n> - Then body: segment 1 moves to old head position (2,1), segment 2 to (2,2), and so on, up to segment 7 (tail) was at (4,6), but since no food, tail is removed, so the new tail is the previous segment 6, which was at (3,6), now at (2,6)? Let's list new positions.\n> \n> Current positions: head (2,1), body: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n> \n> After move left to (1,1):\n> \n> - New head: (1,1)\n> \n> - Then segment 1 (was (2,2)) moves to (2,1)?

Let's list:\n> \n> After growth:\n> \n> - Head: (4,1)\n> \n> - Seg1: (3,1)\n> \n> - Seg2: (2,1)\n> \n> - Seg3: (2,2)\n> \n> - Seg4: (2,3)\n> \n> - Seg5: (2,4)\n> \n> - Seg6: (2,5)\n> \n> - Seg7: (2,6)\n> \n> - Seg8: (3,6)  // this was old seg7\n> \n> - Seg9: (3,6)  // new segment added, but same position? No, the tail segment is added at the position where the tail was before moving.\n> \n> Standard: when food eaten, the tail does not move; it stays, and the head moves to new position with food, so the snake grows by one segment at the tail.\n> \n> So positions: the body segments from 1 to 8 are as above, but seg8 is (3,6), and since tail doesn't move, we add a new segment at (3,6), so now two segments at (3,6)? That can't be.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Better: when the snake eats food, during the move, the head moves to the food cell, and instead of removing the tail, we keep the tail, so the snake gains one segment.\n> \n> So the new positions: the head is at new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, and the tail stays, so the last position is duplicated or something.\n> \n> Example: suppose positions before move: [head, seg1, seg2, ..., seg_k]\n> \n> After move without eating: new head at new_pos, new seg1 at old_head, new seg2 at old seg1, ..., new seg_{k-1} at old seg_{k-2}, and tail removed, so seg_k gone.\n> \n> After move with eating: new head at new_pos, new seg1 at old_head, new seg2 at old seg1, ..., new seg_k at old seg_{k-1}, and new seg_{k+1} at old seg_k (tail position), so tail stays.\n> \n> In this case, before move to (4,1), positions: index 0: (3,1) head, index 1: (2,1), index 2: (2,2), index 3: (2,3), index 4: (2,4), index 5: (2,5), index 6: (2,6), index 7: (3,6) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (4,1) and eating:\n> \n> - New head: (4,1)\n> \n> - New seg1: old head (3,1)\n> \n> - New seg2: old seg1 (2,1)\n> \n> - New seg3: old seg2 (2,2)\n> \n> - New seg4: old seg3 (2,3)\n> \n> - New seg5: old seg4 (2,4)\n> \n> - New seg6: old seg5 (2,5)\n> \n> - New seg7: old seg6 (2,6)\n> \n> - New seg8: old seg7 (3,6)  // this was tail, now it is the new seg8\n> \n> - And since food eaten, add new seg9 at old tail position (3,6), so new seg9: (3,6)\n> \n> But now two segments at (3,6)? That doesn't make sense; the snake cannot have two segments at the same cell.\n> \n> Mistake: when adding a new segment, it is added at the tail position, but after the tail has moved? No.\n> \n> I think I have it: when the snake eats, during the move, the tail does not advance; it stays in place, so the new segment is the old tail position, and the tail remains there.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after eating, the head is at new cell, the body shifts, but the tail position does not change; it stays, so the segment that was the tail is still there, and we add a new segment at that position, but since it's the same, it's like the tail doesn't move and we have an extra segment at the end.\n> \n> Perhaps it's easier to think that the snake grows from the tail.\n> \n> So after moving to (4,1) and eating:\n> \n> - Head: (4,1)\n> \n> - Seg1: (3,1)\n> \n> - Seg2: (2,1)\n> \n> - Seg3: (2,2)\n> \n> - Seg4: (2,3)\n> \n> - Seg5: (2,4)\n> \n> - Seg6: (2,5)\n> \n> - Seg7: (2,6)\n> \n> - Seg8: (3,6)  // this was the old tail, now it is seg8\n> \n> - Seg9: (3,6)  // new segment added at old tail position, so seg8 and seg9 both at (3,6)? That can't be right.\n> \n> I think I'm wrong. Let me recall standard snake mechanics.\n> \n> In snake, when the head eats food, the tail doesn't move on that turn; so the snake grows by one cell at the tail end.\n> \n> So the position that was the tail remains, and a new segment is added there, but in the list, the tail is extended.\n> \n> Positions: after move, the head is at the new position, the body segments move as usual, but the last segment (tail) does not move; it stays, so the new positions include the old tail position as the new last segment, and the segment before it moves to the previous position.\n> \n> Let's index:\n> \n> Before move: positions P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., P7 (tail)\n> \n> After move to new head position H:\n> \n> - New P0 = H\n> \n> - New P1 = old P0\n> \n> - New P2 = old P1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - New P7 = old P6\n> \n> - And since food eaten, new P8 = old P7 (tail position)\n> \n> So new tail is at old P7.\n> \n> In this case, old P7 is (3,6), so new positions:\n> \n> - Head: (4,1)\n> \n> - P1: (3,1)  // old head\n> \n> - P2: (2,1)  // old P1\n> \n> - P3: (2,2)  // old P2\n> \n> - P4: (2,3)  // old P3\n> \n> - P5: (2,4)  // old P4\n> \n> - P6: (2,5)  // old P5\n> \n> - P7: (2,6)  // old P6\n> \n> - P8: (3,6)  // new tail, at old P7 position\n> \n> Old P7 was (3,6), and it becomes P8, but P7 is now (2,6), and P8 is (3,6).\n> \n> The segments are at different positions.\n> \n> New snake: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n> \n> Length 9.\n> \n> Head at (4,1), direction R.\n> \n> From there, possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> - U to (4,2): (4,2) has food?

These are cells I cannot move into.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,1), then body segments at (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6). So the snake has 8 segments. Head is at (3,1), and it's moving right, so direction is R.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1 and life span 5. Since current turn is 24, it will disappear after turn 24 + 5 - 1? Let's clarify life span. It says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (4,1), life span 5, it was probably spawned at turn 24 - (5 - countdown), but I don't have the countdown, I have the remaining life. The input gives life span, which I think is the remaining turns it will exist. Let's read carefully.\n> \n> It says: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" and \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\". Also, \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> In the input, for (4,1), it's (4,1,5,1), which I think means (x,y, life_span, value). Similarly, (4,2,8,1) for the other food.\n> \n> But life_span is the number of turns it will last, including the current turn? Or is it the remaining turns?\n> \n> It says \"disappears after N turns\", and N is given as life_span. Also, \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think life_span is the current remaining life. For example, if life_span is 5 on turn 24, it means it will disappear after turn 28, since it decreases each turn, including turn 24. So on turn 24, life_span=5, after turn 24 it becomes 4, and so on, until turn 28 when it becomes 0 and disappears. Similarly for the other food.\n> \n> For (4,1): value +1, life_span 5, so it will disappear after turn 28? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 24: life_span=5\n> \n> - Turn 25: life_span=4\n> \n> - Turn 26: life_span=3\n> \n> - Turn 27: life_span=2\n> \n> - Turn 28: life_span=1? No, it decreases every turn, and disappears after N turns, meaning when life_span reaches 0.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means that it exists for N more turns, including the current one. So:\n> \n> - At turn t, if life_span = L, it will be present for L turns: turn t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L.\n> \n> For example, L=5 at turn 24: present on turns 24,25,26,27,28; disappears after turn 28, so not there on turn 29.\n> \n> Similarly, for (4,2): life_span=8, so it will be present until turn 24+8-1=31?

Let's see: previous positions: head (3,1), body (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), tail (3,6)\n> \n> After moving up to (3,2): head to (3,2), then the body: (3,1) becomes first body, then (2,1), but (2,1) was second, now since tail moves, the segment at (3,6) is left, so positions: head (3,2), then body (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), and tail (2,6)? The tail was (3,6), but when no food eaten, tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment? Standard snake: when head moves, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, and the last segment (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So positions: let S be the list: S[0] head, S[1] to S[7] body to tail.\n> \n> After move to new position P, if no eat, new head is P, then body S[0] to S[6], so S[7] is gone.\n> \n> If eat, new head P, body S[0] to S[7], so S[7] stays and new segment added.\n> \n> In this case, for move U to (3,2), no food, so new positions: head (3,2), then body: previous head (3,1), then previous body (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), and previous (2,6) becomes the new tail? S[0] was (3,1), S[1] (2,1), S[2] (2,2), ..., S[6] (2,6)?

(5,1) – not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (5,2) is obstacle, (6,1) is obstacle, (5,1) not listed. Snake: after move, positions include (4,1) head, (3,1) body, etc., so (5,1) free? But let's check.\n> \n> (5,1): walls? x=5 not border, y=1 not border. Internal obstacles: (5,2) is obstacle, but (5,1) not listed, so should be free.

But from the positions, before turn 25, head was at some position, and it moved to (4,1).\n> \n> Let's infer: positions are given for turn 25. The head is at (4,1), and the segment that was head at turn 24 is at (3,1), so from turn 24 to turn 25, the head moved from (3,1) to (4,1)? Positions: index 0 is head at turn 25: (4,1), index 1 is the body segment that was head at turn 24: (3,1), so at turn 24, head was at (3,1), and it moved to (4,1) for turn 25. So moving from (3,1) to (4,1) is increasing x, so right, which matches head direction R. Yes, that makes sense. So current direction is right.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (4,2) with value 1 and life span 7, so it disappears after 7 turns, meaning it will be gone after turn 25+7=32? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 25, life span is 7, so it will be there for 7 more turns? Let's see the rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", and \"Disappears after N turns\". So if life span is N at turn t, it will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1? I need to clarify.\n> \n> Rule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at a given turn, if food has life_span L, after this turn, it decreases to L-1, and so on, until L=0, then it disappears. So for food at (4,2), life_span=7 at turn 25, so:\n> \n> - After turn 25, life_span becomes 6\n> \n> - After turn 26, 5\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn 31, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 25 to turn 31 inclusive? At turn 25, it is present, and can be eaten if head moves there. After turn 31, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, second food: (2,5) with value 1 and life_span 10. So at turn 25, life_span 10, disappears after turn 34 (since 10 turns from 25: 25 to 34 is 10 turns, but after decrease).\n> \n> Life_span decreases each turn including current, so:\n> \n> - Turn 25: life_span=10, present\n> \n> - Turn 26: life_span=9 after dec\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 34: life_span=1 after dec? Let's index: at start of turn, food has life_span L. After the turn, if not eaten, L decreases by 1. When L=0 after decrease, it disappears.\n> \n> Rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", but it doesn't specify when it decreases. I think it's after the turn or during?\n> \n> To be safe, assume that at the beginning of turn t, food has life_span L_t. After the actions of turn t, if not eaten, life_span decreases to L_{t+1} = L_t - 1 for the next turn. If eaten during turn t, it's removed.\n> \n> But for existence, it can be eaten on any turn where L_t >=1.\n> \n> For (4,2): L=7 at turn 25, so it can be eaten on turns 25,26,27,28,29,30,31. After turn 31, L=0 and disappears.\n> \n> Similarly for (2,5): L=10 at turn 25, can be eaten turns 25 to 34.\n> \n> Now, the snake: head at (4,1), direction R. Possible moves: U, D, L, R. But cannot instant reverse, so since current direction is R, I cannot move L (left) because that would be opposite to R. So forbidden moves: opposite to current direction. Current is R, so cannot move L. Allowed: U, D, R.\n> \n> Also, need to avoid walls and body, but body collision: head touches body segment except tail, because tail moves.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> List: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Snake positions: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n> \n> So body segments: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n> \n> Head at (4,1), moving R.\n> \n> Food at (4,2) and (2,5)\n> \n> (2,5) is a food position, but in snake positions, (2,5) is a body segment? Snake positions include (2,5), which is the 7th segment? Positions: index 0: (4,1) head, index 1: (3,1), index 2: (2,1), index 3: (2,2), index 4: (2,3), index 5: (2,4), index 6: (2,5), index 7: (2,6), index 8: (3,6)\n> \n> So (2,5) is a body segment at position index 6.\n> \n> But food is at (2,5), which is occupied by the snake body. According to rules, food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for (2,5), since it's currently occupied by a body segment, to eat it, that segment must move away, and then head must move to (2,5) when it's free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) is food, and let's see if it's occupied. Snake positions: (4,1) is head, (3,1), (2,1), etc., no (4,2), so (4,2) is free? But it might be an obstacle or something? Let's check obstacles.\n> \n> Obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), etc., (4,2) not in obstacles, so (4,2) should be free, but food is there.\n> \n> Food at (4,2) with value 1, and it's not occupied by snake or wall, so it can be eaten directly if head moves there.\n> \n> But (2,5) is occupied by body, so cannot be eaten now; need body to move away.\n> \n> Now, current possible moves from head (4,1):\n> \n> - U: (4,1+1) = (4,2)\n> \n> - D: (4,1-1) = (4,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n> \n> - L: (4-1,1) = (3,1) but (3,1) is a body segment. Is it the tail? Tail is at (3,6), which is far. (3,1) is the segment right after head? Positions: head (4,1), then (3,1), which is the first body segment. Moving to (3,1) would cause head to touch the body segment at (3,1), which is not the tail, so collision, death.\n> \n> - R: (4+1,1) = (5,1)\n> \n> Now, (5,1): is it wall? Border x=7, not 5, y=1 not border. Internal obstacles: (6,1) is obstacle, but (5,1) not listed, so should be free. Snake positions: no (5,1), so free.\n> \n> So possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (4,2)\n> \n> - R to (5,1)\n> \n> D and L are invalid.\n> \n> Now, U to (4,2): that's the food position. If I move there, I eat the positive food, score +1, length increases by 1.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead 5+ turns for survival and maximizing score.\n> \n> Also, there's a risk with tail: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But tail is at (3,6), head at (4,1), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (4,1) and (3,6) are not adjacent; distance is |4-3| + |1-6| =1+5=6, so no issue.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the food at (2,5). It's under the body now, so I need to free it to eat.\n> \n> Currently, the snake body has a segment at (2,5). When the snake moves, the tail moves, so eventually (2,5) might be free.\n> \n> But the tail is at (3,6), which is not (2,5), so (2,5) is occupied by index 6, which is not tail.\n> \n> To free (2,5), the snake needs to move such that the segment at (2,5) moves away, but since the snake moves as a whole, when the head moves, each segment moves to the next position, so the segment that was at (2,5) will move to where the next segment was, but it's a chain.\n> \n> Let's simulate the snake movement.\n> \n> Current positions: let's list with indices:\n> \n> 0: head (4,1)\n> \n> 1: (3,1)\n> \n> 2: (2,1)\n> \n> 3: (2,2)\n> \n> 4: (2,3)\n> \n> 5: (2,4)\n> \n> 6: (2,5)\n> \n> 7: (2,6)\n> \n> 8: tail (3,6)\n> \n> When the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So after one move:\n> \n> If head moves to new_pos, then new positions: head at new_pos, segment 1 moves to old head pos (4,1), segment 2 moves to old pos of seg1 (3,1), and so on, up to tail moves to old pos of second last segment.\n> \n> Specifically, for index i, it moves to position of i-1 from previous state.\n> \n> After move, the new position of segment k is the old position of segment k-1 for k>=1, and head at new cell.\n> \n> For example, if head moves to (4,2), then:\n> \n> New head: (4,2)\n> \n> New seg1: old head (4,1)\n> \n> New seg2: old seg1 (3,1)\n> \n> New seg3: old seg2 (2,1)\n> \n> New seg4: old seg3 (2,2)\n> \n> New seg5: old seg4 (2,3)\n> \n> New seg6: old seg5 (2,4)\n> \n> New seg7: old seg6 (2,5) — (2,5) was occupied by seg6, but now seg7 moves to old seg6 pos, which is (2,5)? Old seg6 was at (2,5), so new seg7 is at old seg6 pos (2,5)\n> \n> Let's clarify:\n> \n> Before move:\n> \n> Head: (4,1)\n> \n> Seg1: (3,1)\n> \n> Seg2: (2,1)\n> \n> Seg3: (2,2)\n> \n> Seg4: (2,3)\n> \n> Seg5: (2,4)\n> \n> Seg6: (2,5)\n> \n> Seg7: (2,6)\n> \n> Seg8: (3,6) tail\n> \n> If head moves to (4,2):\n> \n> New head: (4,2)\n> \n> Then new seg1: old head (4,1)\n> \n> New seg2: old seg1 (3,1)\n> \n> New seg3: old seg2 (2,1)\n> \n> New seg4: old seg3 (2,2)\n> \n> New seg5: old seg4 (2,3)\n> \n> New seg6: old seg5 (2,4)\n> \n> New seg7: old seg6 (2,5)  // so (2,5) is still occupied by new seg7\n> \n> New seg8: old seg7 (2,6)  // tail at (2,6)\n> \n> The cell (2,5) is now occupied by new seg7, not free. So the food at (2,5) is still under the body.\n> \n> To free (2,5), I need the segment that is currently at (2,5) to move away, which means that when the snake moves, that position is not reoccupied immediately.\n> \n> The segment at (2,5) is index 6. When the snake moves, new position of index 6 is the old position of index 5, which is (2,4) if no change, but it depends on the move.\n> \n> Generally, after a move, the position of each body segment shifts, so the cell that was occupied by a segment might be freed if that segment moves and no other segment moves there, but since the snake is contiguous, when the head moves, the tail moves forward, so one cell is freed at the tail end, but internal cells may remain occupied.\n> \n> Specifically, to free a cell under the body, it requires that the segment on that cell moves, and since the snake moves, it will be freed when that segment is no longer there after the move.\n> \n> For cell (2,5), currently occupied by seg6. After one move, new seg7 is at old seg6 position (2,5), so (2,5) is still occupied. Similarly, if the snake moves in a way that the segment moves to a different position, but in a straight line, it stays.\n> \n> To free (2,5), I need the snake to move such that seg6 moves to a different cell, and no other segment moves to (2,5). But when seg6 moves, it goes to the position of seg5, so if seg5 was at (2,4), new seg6 is at (2,4), so (2,5) is left empty only if no new segment comes, but since the tail is at (3,6), when the tail moves, it leaves its old position free.\n> \n> The cell that is freed is the old tail position, when the tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (3,6). After a move, new tail is at old position of the second last segment, which is (2,6) or wherever.\n> \n> So the only cell that becomes free is the old tail position.\n> \n> For (2,5) to be free, it must be the tail position at some point. But currently tail is at (3,6), not (2,5). (2,5) is an internal segment.\n> \n> So to eat the food at (2,5), I need to make (2,5) the tail position, or have the snake move so that the segment on (2,5) moves away and it's not occupied immediately.\n> \n> But since the snake is a path, the only way to free an internal cell is if the tail passes through it or something, but it's complicated.\n> \n> Perhaps I should simulate the snake's possible paths.\n> \n> But for now, at turn 25, I have two choices: move U to (4,2) or R to (5,1).\n> \n> If I move U to (4,2), I eat the food there immediately, since it's positive food, value +1, length increases. Then the snake grows, so after eating, the tail doesn't move for that turn, so length becomes 10 segments.\n> \n> Current length is 9 segments: positions from index 0 to 8, so 9 cells.\n> \n> After eating food, when head moves to food, it eats it, and the tail does not move, so the new segment is added at the tail, but since tail doesn't move, the length increases.\n> \n> Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n> \n> So after moving to (4,2) and eating, the new positions: head at (4,2), and the body includes the old head position, but tail stays, so positions: new head (4,2), then old head (4,1) becomes new seg1, then (3,1) new seg2, ..., up to tail (3,6) still there, but since length increases, the tail doesn't move, so the last segment remains.\n> \n> Typically in snake, when you eat, you don't remove the tail, so the snake grows by keeping the tail in place for that move.\n> \n> So after eating at (4,2):\n> \n> New head: (4,2)\n> \n> New seg1: old head (4,1)\n> \n> New seg2: old seg1 (3,1)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New seg8: old seg7 (2,6)\n> \n> And new seg9: old tail (3,6) since tail didn't move, so added as new segment. Old tail was (3,6), and it stays, so positions: head (4,2), seg1 (4,1), seg2 (3,1), seg3 (2,1), seg4 (2,2), seg5 (2,3), seg6 (2,4), seg7 (2,5), seg8 (2,6), seg9 (3,6)\n> \n> Now, food at (2,5) is still there, under seg7.\n> \n> If I move R to (5,1), no food, so tail moves: new head (5,1), new seg1 (4,1), new seg2 (3,1), new seg3 (2,1), new seg4 (2,2), new seg5 (2,3), new seg6 (2,4), new seg7 (2,5), new seg8 (2,6), and tail moves to old seg8 position?

It's turn 26, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning we can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there are internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)].\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,2), and the body segments follow: [(4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]. So the snake is 10 segments long. Head direction is Up, meaning it just moved to (4,2) from (4,1) since it was going Up.\n> \n> Now, food: only one food item is given: (2,5) with value 1 and life span 9. But the food is at (2,5), which is also a position in the snake's body. According to the snake positions, (2,5) is the 8th segment, counting from head: index 0 is head (4,2), index 1 is (4,1), index 2 (3,1), index 3 (2,1), index 4 (2,2), index 5 (2,3), index 6 (2,4), index 7 (2,5), index 8 (2,6), index 9 (3,6). So (2,5) is occupied by the snake's body.\n> \n> The food mechanics say that food can spawn under the snake's body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it. Also, there's a tail reward danger: if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, the food is at (2,5), which is currently under the snake. So to eat it, the snake needs to move such that the body segment at (2,5) moves away, and then later the head can move to (2,5) to eat it.\n> \n> But the life span is 9, meaning it disappears after 9 turns, including the current turn. So at turn 26, life span 9, so it will disappear after turn 26 + 8 = 34? Let's clarify: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, with life span N, it decreases to N-1 at turn t+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear after L-1 turns? No.\n> \n> If life span is L at turn t, then at turn t, countdown is L. After turn t, countdown becomes L-1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears. So it disappears at the start of turn t + L. For example, at turn t, countdown L, so it is present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> In this case, turn 26, life span 9, so it will disappear at turn 26 + 9 = 35. So it is available from turn 26 to 34 inclusive.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (4,2), direction Up. Possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right. But since head direction is Up, it came from below, so it can't move Down instantly because of no instant reverse. So from (4,2), possible moves: Up to (4,3), Left to (3,2), Right to (5,2). Down to (4,1) is not allowed because it's the reverse direction.\n> \n> But (4,1) is the body segment, so moving down would cause collision with body? No, because when the snake moves, the tail also moves, so it's only a collision if it hits a body segment that isn't the tail, or if it hits the tail after growing.\n> \n> Standard snake rules: when you move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves off the last cell, unless you eat food, then tail doesn't move and you grow.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to a cell with food, I eat it, grow, so the tail stays. If no food, tail moves.\n> \n> But for collision, head cannot move to a cell occupied by any body segment except the tail, because when you move, the tail moves away, so if head moves to tail's current position, it's ok since tail leaves.\n> \n> But if you eat food, you grow, so tail doesn't move, and if head moves to where tail is, it collides because tail stays.\n> \n> Specifically, from the rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> And the tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this state, let's list all occupied cells to avoid collisions.\n> \n> Snake positions: (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) for all x,y in range.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> So all obstacles: walls and internal obstacles.\n> \n> For movement, head at (4,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: (4,3) - is this free? Check if occupied.\n> \n> (4,3) is not in snake positions: snake has (4,2), (4,1), etc., no (4,3). Not a wall: walls are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,3) is x=4 not 0 or 7, y=3 not 0 or 7. Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), etc., (4,3) not listed, so (4,3) should be free.\n> \n> - Left: (3,2) - not in snake positions? Snake has (3,1), (3,6), no (3,2). Not wall, not internal obstacle (internal has (1,2), (3,4), etc., not (3,2)). So (3,2) free.\n> \n> - Right: (5,2) - but (5,2) is an internal obstacle! Listed as (5,2) in obstacles. So (5,2) is blocked, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Down: (4,1) - but (4,1) is the second segment of the snake. Since head direction is Up, moving Down is reverse, which is not allowed anyway. But even if allowed, (4,1) is occupied by body, and it's not the tail; tail is (3,6). So moving to (4,1) would cause collision because it's a body segment that isn't the tail.\n> \n> Therefore, possible moves from (4,2) are: Up to (4,3) or Left to (3,2).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n> \n> There's food at (2,5) with value +1, but it's currently under the snake at position (2,5), which is the 7th segment (index 7 in the list).\n> \n> To eat this food, the snake needs to move so that the body moves away from (2,5), and then later head can move to (2,5).\n> \n> Currently, the food is under the body, so it can't be eaten until the snake moves and that cell is vacated.\n> \n> The life span is 9, so it disappears at turn 35, meaning we have from turn 26 to 34 to eat it.\n> \n> But we need to plan a path to get to (2,5) after it's free.\n> \n> First, let's see the snake's current path and how it can move.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)]\n> \n> Head at (4,2), tail at (3,6).\n> \n> The snake is mostly on the left side, from x=2 to 4, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> To free up (2,5), we need the snake to move so that the segment at (2,5) moves away. Since the snake moves step by step, when the head moves, each segment moves to the next position, so the tail moves forward.\n> \n> After one move, if no food eaten, the head moves to new position, and tail moves off the last position.\n> \n> So to vacate (2,5), it depends on which direction the snake moves.\n> \n> Let's simulate possible moves.\n> \n> First, at turn 26, head at (4,2), direction Up.\n> \n> I can choose to move Up or Left.\n> \n> If I move Up to (4,3):\n> \n> - Head moves to (4,3)\n> \n> - Each body segment moves forward: segment 1 (4,1) moves to (4,2), segment 2 (3,1) moves to (4,1)?

free, the tail might be nearby.\n> \n> For example, after two moves, at turn 28, if I did nothing, the tail is at (2,6) or something.\n> \n> But in our earlier simulation, when (2,5) is vacated, the tail is moving away.\n> \n> For instance, if I moved Up at turn 26, at turn 28 after moves, tail might be at (2,6) or (2,5) vacated.\n> \n> But the food is at (2,5), so if I move head to (2,5) at turn 28, I eat it, and since the tail is not adjacent, it should be ok, but I grow, so the new tail is where the old tail was.\n> \n> Then no collision.\n> \n> Tail reward danger only if head is adjacent

the snake's body and internal obstacles, ensuring long-term survival by accessing safer cells. Sacrificing the difficult-to-reach food at (2,5) is necessary to prevent dead ends and collisions, as reaching it within its lifespan would require risky maneuvers through crowded spaces.\n",

It's turn 27, and I'm the AI playing Snake. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). I should list all walls for clarity:\n> \n> - Border: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 – so cells like (0,y), (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x.\n> \n> - Internal: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,3), then (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). So the snake has 10 segments. Head direction is Up, which means it was moving upwards to (4,3) from (4,2)? Positions are listed head first, so from (4,3) to (4,2) to (4,1), etc. Head direction U means it moved up to reach (4,3), so it can move U, D, L, R from there, but with no instant reverse. Since it came from (4,2), which is below (4,3), so it moved up, so current direction is U, so it cannot move down (D) immediately, as that would be reverse.\n> \n> Food positions: only one food is given: (2,5) with value 1 and life span 8. But in the list, it's (2, 5, 8, 1), which I think is (x,y, life_span, value), so (2,5), life_span=8, value=1. Positive food.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's visualize the grid. I'll sketch a grid from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Rows y from 0 to 7, columns x from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls:\n> \n> - Borders: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Snake: positions:\n> \n> - Head: (4,3)\n> \n> - Body: (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)\n> \n> (2,5) is part of the snake body, but there's food at (2,5) with value 1. Food can spawn under the body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, (2,5) has food and is occupied by the snake's body segment. Specifically, looking at snake positions: index 0: (4,3) head, 1: (4,2), 2: (4,1), 3: (3,1), 4: (2,1), 5: (2,2), 6: (2,3), 7: (2,4), 8: (2,5), 9: (2,6) tail.\n> \n> So (2,5) is the 8th segment, not the tail. Tail is (2,6).\n> \n> Food at (2,5) with life span 8, value 1. Since the snake body is on it, it can be eaten only if that body part moves away and head moves in.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current turn 27. So at turn 27, life span is 8, so it will disappear after turn 27 + 8 - 1? Let's see: life span N means it disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will be gone after t + L - 1 turns? For example, if at turn t, life_span=1, it disappears after this turn, so it can be eaten only on turn t if possible.\n> \n> Generally: food appears at some turn, has life_span N, so it exists for turns from spawn to spawn + N - 1, and disappears at the start of turn spawn + N.\n> \n> But here, we're given the current state, so for this food, at turn 27, life_span=8, so it was spawned at some turn, but we don't care; we know that it will disappear after 8 more turns from now? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 27, countdown=8, meaning after 8 turns, it will be gone. After turn 27, countdown becomes 7, then 6, ..., down to 0, and it disappears when countdown reaches 0, I think. But the rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> To clarify: at the current turn, countdown is life_span. After this turn, it decreases by 1. So if life_span=8 at turn 27, after turn 27, life_span=7 for turn 28, and so on, until life_span=0, and it disappears at the end of that turn or beginning of next? The rule doesn't specify, but for eating, as long as it's present when head moves on, it should be fine.\n> \n> Typically, food is present during the turn when countdown > 0, and can be eaten if head moves to that cell on that turn.\n> \n> For this food at (2,5), life_span=8 at turn 27, so it will be available from turn 27 to turn 27 + 7 = 34? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 27: countdown=8, present\n> \n> - Turn 28: countdown=7, present\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 34: countdown=1, present? After turn 34, countdown=0, so disappears after turn 34 or at start of turn 35? I think it disappears at the start of turn 35, so it can be eaten up to turn 34.\n> \n> If countdown decreases at the end of the turn, then at turn t, with countdown C, after the turn, C decreases to C-1, and if C-1=0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> But for simplicity, since eating happens when head moves to the cell during a turn, as long as the food is present at the start of the turn, it can be eaten that turn.\n> \n> I think it's safe to assume that food is present during any turn where countdown > 0 at the start of the turn.\n> \n> So for this food, countdown=8 at start of turn 27, so it will be present for turns 27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34 (8 turns), and disappear at start of turn 35.\n> \n> Now, back to the snake. Head at (4,3), direction U, so it can move U, L, R, but not D because that's reverse.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,3):\n> \n> - U: to (4,4)\n> \n> - D: not allowed, reverse\n> \n> - L: to (3,3)\n> \n> - R: to (5,3)\n> \n> Now, check for collisions or walls.\n> \n> First, (4,4): is it wall or body? Walls: internal obstacles include (4,4), yes, (4,4) is an internal obstacle, so wall. Cannot move there.\n> \n> (5,3): x=5,y=3. Is it wall? Borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (5,3) is not border.

So, I should visualize this grid.\n> \n> The grid is 8x8 since x and y from 0 to 7. Let me sketch this mentally.\n> \n> - Walls: All x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are borders. So, cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). So these are blocked cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (5,3), then body: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). So the tail is at (2,5).\n> \n> Snake head direction is R, meaning it was moving right to get to (5,3) from previous position.

But since the snake is on it, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it. Currently, tail is there, so it might be possible later.\n> \n> Another food at (5,3) with value 1, life span 10. But (5,3) is the head position? Snake head is at (5,3), so food is under the head?\n> \n> Food positions: (2,5,7,1) and (5,3,10,1). (5,3,10,1) means position (5,3), value 1, life span 10.\n> \n> But snake head is at (5,3), so the food is under the head. According to rules, food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it later. But here, the head is on it now? That might not make sense for eating immediately.\n> \n> Let me read the rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> In this case, for (5,3), it's under the head, not body. Head is a body segment, I think. The snake's body includes head and all segments.\n> \n> Typically, the head is part of the body, so food under head should follow the same rule: it can be eaten only if head moves away and then back? But that seems odd.\n> \n> Perhaps for the head, if food is under it when it arrives, it can be eaten, but in this state, the head is currently on (5,3), and food is there, but since the snake just moved there, it might be eaten this turn? The rule is a bit ambiguous.\n> \n> The state says \"Current Turn: 28\" and food is listed, so at turn 28, the head is at (5,3) with food under it? But when did it move there?\n> \n> I need to think about the turn sequence.\n> \n> On turn 27, snake was at some position, say previous head was (4,3), and it moved right to (5,3) on turn 28. So at the start of turn 28, head is at (5,3), and food is there. But when is the food eaten? Usually, in Snake, when the head moves to a cell with food, it eats it during the move.\n> \n> But here, the rule says for food under body, it can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves on later. So for head position, if food is under it when it moves to it, it should be eaten immediately, I think.\n> \n> But in this case, the head moved to (5,3) on this turn, turn 28, so if food was there, it should be eaten now? But the food has life span 10, so it might have been there before.\n> \n> I think I need to clarify the timing.\n> \n> The state is given at turn t1=28, with snake positions including head at (5,3), and food at (5,3) with life span 10. Since the head is on it, and it just moved there, I think it should be eaten this turn, unless the rule prevents it.\n> \n> The rule says: \"can only be eaten if the body moves away, and the head moves onto the food cell.\" But if the head is moving onto it, and the body was not there before? Let's think.\n> \n> At the beginning of turn 28, before any action, the snake is positioned with head at (5,3), which has food. But the snake just arrived at (5,3) from (4,3) during the move to this state.\n> \n> Perhaps the eating happens when the head enters the cell.\n> \n> So on turn 28, when the snake moved to (5,3), it should have eaten the food there, but the food is still listed, so maybe not? Or is the state before the action?\n> \n> The state input says \"Current turn: t1\", and we need to choose an action for turn t1.\n> \n> So at the start of turn t1, the snake is at the given positions, and food is present. Then we choose a move, and after the move, if head moves to a food cell, it eats it.\n> \n> But for cells that have food and are occupied by the snake, if it's not the head, it can't be eaten until the snake moves away.\n> \n> Specifically for (5,3), it's the head, so when we move from here, if we stay, but we can't stay, we have to move to adjacent cell.\n> \n> Let's read the rule carefully: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> The \"body\" here might exclude the head, or include it? I think \"body\" means the segments excluding the head, or sometimes the whole snake.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, let's assume that for any cell occupied by the snake, if it's not the head, food can be eaten later when head moves on after body moves away. If it is the head, then when the head moves to a cell with food, it eats it immediately.\n> \n> In this state, at turn 28, head is at (5,3), and there is food at (5,3), so since the head is on it, it should be eaten this turn, but the food is still listed, so perhaps the state is before eating, and eating happens after the action or during the move.\n> \n> I think there's ambiguity, but to resolve, I should look at the food list. Both foods are listed, so for (5,3), it might not have been eaten yet because the snake is on it, but for the head, it should be eatable.\n> \n> Perhaps the rule \"the body moves away\" implies that for a cell under the body (not head), when that segment moves, the cell is free, then head can move to it to eat.\n> \n> For the head cell, if food is there when the head moves to it, it is eaten.\n> \n> In this case, on turn 28, the head moved to (5,3), so it should have eaten the food if it was there at the time of move. But since the food is listed with life span 10, it might be that the food was spawned there while the snake was on it, so it can't be eaten until the snake moves away and back.\n> \n> I think I need to assume that food under the snake can be present but not eaten until the conditions are met.\n> \n> For (5,3), it's the head, so it might be different.\n> \n> To simplify, let's look at the food: (2,5,7,1) is under the tail, and (5,3,10,1) is under the head.\n> \n> For (5,3), since it's the head, if we move the head away and then back when the cell is free, we can eat it, but the cell is free only if no body is there, but the head is there now.\n> \n> At the start of turn 28, head is at (5,3), so the cell is occupied. If we move the head away, to say (6,3), then (5,3) is now occupied by the neck or something? Let's see the snake positions.\n> \n> After moving, the body follows.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think that at the beginning of the turn, before action, the snake occupies the cells, and food under those cells can be eaten only if the snake moves such that the head moves onto it after the body vacates it.\n> \n> For example, for a body segment, when that segment moves away, the cell is free, then if head moves to it later, it can eat.\n> \n> For the head cell, if we move the head away, the cell might be occupied by the next segment or free, depending on the move.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 28, head at (5,3), body at (4,3), etc.\n> \n> If we move the head to a new position, say (6,3), then the head leaves (5,3), and the body moves, so (4,3) moves to (5,3), so (5,3) is now occupied by the second segment, not free. So the food at (5,3) is still under the body, not accessible.\n> \n> Then later, if the body moves away from (5,3), it might become free for head to eat.\n> \n> Similarly for (2,5), it's the tail, so when the snake moves, the tail moves, so (2,5) might be free if the snake doesn't grow, but if it grows, it stays.\n> \n> But for now, at turn 28, both foods are under snake positions.\n> \n> Also, there's a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to the tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, tail is at (2,5), head at (5,3), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (5,3) and (2,5) are not adjacent; distance is |5-2|=3, |3-5|=2, not adjacent.\n> \n> So no issue for now.\n> \n> Now, life span: food at (2,5) has life span 7, meaning it disappears after 7 turns, including current, so it will disappear on turn 28 + 7 - 1? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\", \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Or at the end of turn t + L?\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\", so at the start of turn t, if life span is N, after this turn, it becomes N-1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span N, after turn t, it becomes N-1; if N-1 >0, it stays, else disappears.\n> \n> So for (2,5), life span 7 at turn 28, so after turn 28, it becomes 6, then 5, etc., and after turn 34, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) life span 10, after turn 28, 9, etc., disappears after turn 37.\n> \n> But since it's under the snake, it might not be eatable immediately.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose actions for the next few turns, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Current head position: (5,3), direction R (since it just moved right to here).\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R. But no instant reverse, so cannot move left (opposite of R), so can move U, D, or R.\n> \n> Now, grid walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7 are walls, so moving to x=6 or x=7 is wall? x=7 is wall, so x=6 might be ok, but let's list all walls.\n> \n> Border walls: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> So let's list all blocked cells:\n> \n> - All border cells: x=0, x=7 for all y; y=0, y=7 for all x.\n> \n> - Internal: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Now, snake positions: (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n> \n> So the grid is 8x8, cells from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Let me sketch the free cells around head.\n> \n> Head at (5,3).\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: (5,4) - is this free? y=4, not border, x=5 not border. Check internal: (5,4) not in internal obstacles list. Internal obstacles are (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1). So (5,4) is not blocked, and not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (5,3) head, (4,3), etc., (5,4) not in list, so should be free, but might have food? No food at (5,4), only at (2,5) and (5,3).\n> \n> Food only at those two positions.\n> \n> So (5,4) is empty and free.\n> \n> - Down: (5,2) - but (5,2) is internal obstacle, blocked. Cannot move there.\n> \n> - Left: (4,3) - but (4,3) is the second segment of snake, body. But in snake movement, moving to a body cell is deadly only if it's not the tail, and since tail will move, but here (4,3) is not tail, it's the neck, so if head moves to (4,3), it would collide with body, since (4,3) is occupied by the second segment, which won't move away until after head moves, so collision.\n> \n> Rule: body collision if head touches any body segment except that you can move to the tail cell because tail moves.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So for (4,3), it is a body segment, not tail, so moving to it causes collision.\n> \n> Tail is at (2,5), so only (2,5) is safe to move to if possible.\n> \n> But (4,3) is not tail, so moving left to (4,3) is invalid, collision.\n> \n> Also, cannot move left because it's reverse? Current direction R, left is L, which is opposite, so no instant reverse, cannot move L anyway.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, R.\n> \n> D: (5,2) is obstacle, blocked.\n> \n> So only U or R possible? U to (5,4), R to (6,3).\n> \n> R to (6,3): x=6, y=3. Not border? Border x=7 is wall, x=6 is not border. y=3 not border. Internal obstacles: (6,1) is obstacle, but (6,3) not listed, so should be free. Snake positions? (6,3) not in snake, so free.\n> \n> U to (5,4) free as above.\n> \n> So possible actions: U or R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> First, let's see the food situation.\n> \n> Food at (2,5) under tail, value +1, life span 7, so available until turn 28+6=34?

It's turn 29. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are on the borders, so playable area might be from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, but moving to walls kills you. So cells (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. Also, internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)]. So I need to avoid these cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,4), then (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). So the snake is 10 segments long. Head direction is U, which is up, so moving towards increasing y.\n> \n> Food positions: two items:\n> \n> - (2,5) with value 1 and life span 6\n> \n> - (5,3) with value 1 and life span 9\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Now, (5,3) is listed as food, but looking at snake positions, (5,3) is the second segment of the snake. So the food is under the snake's body. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5) is not occupied by snake; let's see: snake positions are from (5,4) down to (2,4), and (2,4) is the tail. (2,5) is above (2,4), so it's free.\n> \n> Current head is at (5,4), direction U, so moving up would go to (5,5). But (5,5) is an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles include (5,5), yes, from the list: (5,5) is a wall. So moving up to (5,5) is impossible; it's a wall.\n> \n> Similarly, other directions: left to (4,4)? (4,4) is also an internal obstacle. Down to (5,3)? (5,3) is occupied by the snake's body, but since it's not the tail, it might be a collision? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Movement: head at (5,4), direction U. Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Since current direction is U, reverse would be D, so I cannot move down immediately? No instant reverse means I cannot move opposite to the current direction on the next turn. So current direction is U, so I cannot move D on this turn.\n> \n> Directions: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y).\n> \n> Current head: (5,4), direction U.\n> \n> Possible actions:\n> \n> - U: to (5,5) – but (5,5) is a wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - D: to (5,3) – but (5,3) is occupied by the snake's body (second segment), and since the tail is at (2,4), not here, moving to (5,3) would cause collision because it's a body segment. Also, D is reverse direction, which might be forbidden? No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is U, so moving D would be opposite, so I think I cannot move D at all this turn.\n> \n> Confirming the rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Since this is the next turn, turn t1, I cannot move opposite to the current head direction. So direction is U, so I cannot move D.\n> \n> Similarly, L: to (4,4) – (4,4) is an internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n> \n> R: to (6,4) – is (6,4) valid? Let's see: walls: border x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7. (6,4) is within bounds? x=6, y=4. Borders: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=6 is not border, similarly y=4 not border. Internal obstacles: (6,1) is listed, but (6,4) is not in the list, so it should be free.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)]. So (6,4) not there, so it's free.\n> \n> But is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: head (5,4), then (5,3), (4,3), etc., no (6,4), so free.\n> \n> So possible moves from (5,4):\n> \n> - U: to (5,5) – wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: opposite direction, not allowed, and also occupied by body, invalid\n> \n> - L: to (4,4) – wall, invalid\n> \n> - R: to (6,4) – free, no obstacle, no snake? Snake positions: let's list all: [(5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)]. So (6,4) not occupied, and not wall, so valid.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move is R to (6,4). Is that right? What about other directions? U, D, L all invalid, so only R is possible? But that seems forced.\n> \n> Current direction is U, but I can change direction as long as not reverse. L and R are perpendicular, so should be allowed, but L to (4,4) is wall, so invalid. R to (6,4) is valid.\n> \n> But is there a way to move? Only one choice? But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> Head at (5,4). Neighbors:\n> \n> - Up: (5,5) – internal obstacle (5,5) is wall.\n> \n> - Down: (5,3) – occupied by snake body, and also reverse direction, forbidden.\n> \n> - Left: (4,4) – internal obstacle, wall.\n> \n> - Right: (6,4) – no wall, no snake, free.\n> \n> Yes, so only possible move is R to (6,4). So for turn 29, I must move R.\n> \n> But the food: there is food at (5,3) which is under the snake body, but I can't eat it now because head is not there, and body is on it. Also, food at (2,5) with life span 6.\n> \n> Since I have to move R, let's do that.\n> \n> After moving to (6,4), the snake moves: head to (6,4), and the tail will move, so the segment at (2,4) will be removed if no food eaten, but since no food eaten, length same, tail moves.\n> \n> Snake positions after move: new head at (6,4), then the previous head (5,4) becomes second segment, so positions: [(6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)] and tail (2,4) is removed? Let's see: the snake moves, so when head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the next position, so the last segment (tail) is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> Since no food eaten, tail (2,4) is removed, so new positions: head (6,4), then (5,4) which was head, now body, then (5,3), then (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). (2,3) was the ninth segment, now becomes tail? Original positions: index 0: (5,4) head, 1: (5,3), 2: (4,3), 3: (4,2), 4: (4,1), 5: (3,1), 6: (2,1), 7: (2,2), 8: (2,3), 9: (2,4) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (6,4), new positions: head (6,4), then segment 0 moves to where head was, but it's a shift: the body segments follow. So new head at (6,4), then the previous positions from index 0 to 8 become the body, but since tail is removed, positions: [ (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) ] and (2,4) is gone. So tail is now (2,3).\n> \n> Head direction: after moving R, new head direction is R.\n> \n> Now, food: (2,5) with value 1, life span 6, so it will disappear after 6 turns, including this turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 29, life span is 6, after turn 29, it becomes 5, and so on, until 0, then disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) with value 1, life span 9, but it's under the snake body at (5,3), which is now the third segment? After move, snake positions: (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), ... so (5,3) is occupied, so food is still under body.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns. I have to maximize score, avoid risks.\n> \n> First, after turn 29, I moved to (6,4), direction R.\n> \n> Now turn 30: head at (6,4), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is R, I can move U, D, L (but L is reverse, not allowed), or R.\n> \n> - U: to (6,5) – is it free? Borders: x=6 not border, y=5 not border. Internal obstacles: (6,1) is wall, but (6,5) not listed, so free. Snake positions: no (6,5), so free.\n> \n> - D: to (6,3) – similarly, y=3 not border, no internal obstacle listed for (6,3), snake positions: no (6,3), so free.\n> \n> - L: to (5,4) – but (5,4) is now the second segment of snake, after head moved. Positions: head (6,4), then (5,4), so (5,4) is occupied by body. Also, L is reverse direction? Current direction is R, so moving L would be opposite, left, so reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> - R: to (7,4) – but x=7 is border wall, since walls at x=7, so invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves: U to (6,5) or D to (6,3).\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food and survival.\n> \n> Food at (2,5) and (5,3). (2,5) is at (2,5), which is near the tail area. Current tail is at (2,3), after move.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (6,4), body: (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), tail (2,3).\n> \n> (2,5) is above (2,4) but (2,4) is not occupied now, since tail moved. After turn 29 move, tail was at (2,4), removed, so (2,4) is free? Positions: after move, cells occupied: (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). So (2,4) is free, (2,5) is food, free.\n> \n> (5,3) is occupied by snake body, and food is under it.\n> \n> Life span of (2,5) is 6 at turn 29, so at turn 30, it decreases to 5? Life span decreases every turn including current, but when? At the end of turn or beginning?\n> \n> The state is given at turn t1=29, before action. Food life span is given as 6, meaning it has 6 turns left including this turn. After I take action, the turn advances, and life span decreases.\n> \n> Similarly for food spawn, but here it's existing.\n> \n> Rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, before action, life span is N, meaning after this turn, it becomes N-1, and so on.\n> \n> For (2,5), at turn 29, life span 6, so after turn 29 action, it becomes 5, and will disappear when it reaches 0.\n> \n> Similarly for (5,3), life span 9 at turn 29, after turn 29, becomes 8.\n> \n> Now turn 30, head at (6,4), I can move U or D.\n> \n> I need to plan multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, there might be tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But currently, tail is at (2,3), head at (6,4), not adjacent.\n> \n> Possible paths: I can go towards (2,5) to eat it, or avoid.\n> \n> (2,5) has only 5 turns left after turn 29, so I need to eat it within 5 turns? After turn 29, life span 5 for (2,5), meaning it will disappear after 5 more turns, so I have until turn 33 to eat it? Let's calculate.\n> \n> At turn 29 start, life span 6. After turn 29, life span 5. After turn 30, 4. After 31, 3. After 32, 2. After 33, 1. After 34, 0 and disappears.

After moving U from R, new direction is U.\n> \n> Then possible moves from there.\n> \n> But (6,5) is near the top; y=5, borders y=7 and y=0, so y=5 is not border.\n> \n> If I move D to (6,3), then head at (6,3), direction D.\n> \n> Then from there.\n> \n> But I need to think about the food at (2,5).\n> \n> (2,5) has life span 5, so it will disappear after 5 turns from now, meaning I have until turn 34 to eat it.\n> \n> Current turn after 29 is 30, so turns 30,31,32,33,34 to eat it; on turn 34, if I eat it before it disappears, it should be ok.\n> \n> But at turn 34, if life span is 1, I can eat it, and then it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, the (5,3) food has life span 8, so more time.\n> \n> But (5,3) is under body, so I need to free it first.\n> \n> Let's see when (5,3) will be free.\n> \n> The segment at (5,3) is the third segment. When the snake moves, this segment will move to where the second segment was, which is (5,4) in current state.\n> \n> After turn 29, positions: index 0: (6,4) head, 1: (5,4), 2: (5,3), 3: (4,3), etc.\n> \n> When snake moves, if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the next position, so the cell (5,3) will be vacated when the segment there moves to (5,4), but (5,4) is occupied by segment 1, so it's messy.\n> \n> The cell (5,3) is occupied by segment 2. When the snake moves, segment 2 will move to the position of segment 1, which is (5,4). But (5,4) is currently occupied, but after head moves, segment 1 position might be free or not.\n> \n> Let's simulate one move.\n> \n> At turn 30, suppose I move to a new position.\n> \n> Say I move U to (6,5).\n> \n> Then new head: (6,5)\n> \n> Then the body: segment 0 (old head (6,4)) becomes body at (6,4), segment 1 (5,4) moves to where segment 0 was, which is (6,4), but (6,4) is now occupied by the new body segment, so segment 1 moves to (6,4), but (6,4) is now the second position.\n> \n> The snake positions shift: new head at (6,5), then the previous head (6,4) is now first body segment, then previous segment 1 (5,4) is now second body segment at (5,4), previous segment 2 (5,3) is now at (5,3), and so on, up to previous segment 8 (2,3) is now at (2,3), and the tail previous segment 9 (2,3) is removed? Positions: after move, the list is [new head, old head, old segment 1, old segment 2, ..., old segment 8] since tail is removed.\n> \n> Old positions: indices 0 to 9: 0:(6,4), 1:(5,4), 2:(5,3), 3:(4,3), 4:(4,2), 5:(4,1), 6:(3,1), 7:(2,1), 8:(2,2), 9:(2,3)\n> \n> After moving head to (6,5), new positions: head (6,5), then old 0: (6,4), then old 1: (5,4), old 2: (5,3), old 3: (4,3), old 4: (4,2), old 5: (4,1), old 6: (3,1), old 7: (2,1), old 8: (2,2), and old 9 (2,3) is removed. So new tail is (2,2).\n> \n> The cell (5,3) is still occupied by the body, now at position 3 in the list.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move D to (6,3), similar thing.\n> \n> To free (5,3), I need the snake to move so that the segment at (5,3) moves away and no other segment is there, but since the snake is contiguous, it will take several moves for that cell to be free.\n> \n> For example, if the snake keeps moving, the segment that was at (5,3) will eventually move to a new position, and (5,3) will be free when that segment leaves and no new segment enters immediately.\n> \n> But since the snake is long, it might take time.\n> \n> The food at (5,3) can be eaten only if the head moves to it after it is free.\n> \n> But for now, it's not a priority since life span is long.\n> \n> The food at (2,5) is available and has shorter life span, so I should try to eat that.\n> \n> Path to (2,5) from (6,4).\n> \n> (6,4) to (2,5): difference dx=-4, dy=1.\n> \n> But with obstacles.\n> \n> Possible routes: I can go down to (6,3), then left to (5,3), but (5,3) is occupied by snake body, so I can't move there.\n> \n> At turn 30, from (6,4), if I move D to (6,3), then head at (6,3), which is free.\n> \n> Then from there, I can move L to (5,3), but (5,3) is occupied, so invalid.\n> \n> Or U to (6,4), but that's where I came from, and it's now body, invalid.\n> \n> Or D to (6,2), or L to (5,3) invalid, R to (7,3) wall.\n> \n> So from (6,3), possible moves: U, D, L (but L to (5,3) occupied), so only U or D or R, but R to (7,3) wall, so U or D.\n> \n> But U to (6,4) is body, invalid, so only D to (6,2) or if other.\n> \n> (6,2): is it free? y=2, not border, internal obstacles: (6,1) is wall, but (6,2) not listed, so free.

from (2,6).\n> \n> Position (2,6) to (2,2) is |Δy|=4, so 4 moves down.\n> \n> Similarly from (3,5) to (2,5) to (2,4) to (2,3) to (2,2), also 4 moves if from (3,5), but (3,5) to (2,5) is one move left, then three down, so four moves to (2,2).\n> \n> From (2,6) to (2,2) is four moves down.\n> \n> But at turn 34, we are at (4,6), so to reach (2,2) takes at least 4 moves: to (3,6) or (4,5) at 34, then to (2,6) or (3,5) at 35, then to (2,5) at 36, then to (2,4) at 37, then to (2,3) at 38, then to (2,2) at 39.\n> \n> Turn 39.\n> \n> Life span of (2,2) is 10 at turn 31, so until turn 40, so on turn 40 it can be eaten, disappears at 41.\n> \n> So we have time.\n> \n> Similarly for (5,3).\n> \n> But (5,3) is occupied, will be freed later.\n> \n> For turn 34, since both (3,6) and (4,5) are possible, but moving to (3,6) allows us to go to (2,6) directly, which is on the row to (2,2), so it might be better for long-term to go left.\n> \n> If we go to (4,5), we might go down, but (4,4) is obstacle, so we can only go left to (3,5), which is similar.\n> \n> But (3,6) is higher y, so perhaps better to go to (3,6) to avoid the obstacles below.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (2,2), so heading left is good.\n> \n> Moreover, at (4,5), if we go there, from (4,5) only can go to (3,5), then from (3,5) to (2,5) or (3,6), but (3,4) obstacle, so limited.\n> \n> From (3,6) to (2,6) or (3,5), more options.\n> \n> So I think moving to (3,6) at turn 34 is better.\n> \n> Then at turn 35, from (3,6) to (2,6) to be closer to (2,2).\n> \n> Or to (3,5), but (3,5) is closer to the obstacles.\n> \n> So let's decide.\n> \n> For action sequence:\n> \n> Turn 31: U (only choice)\n> \n> Turn 32: L (only choice to (5,6))\n> \n> Turn 33: L (only choice to (4,6))\n> \n> Turn 34: L to (3,6)  (we choose

left), can move L to (1,6), D to (2,5), U invalid, R to (3,6) body.\n> \n> (1,6) should be free, no obstacle.\n> \n> (2,5) free.\n> \n> Then we can go D to (2,5), then to (2,4), etc to (2,2).\n> \n>

be for 5 turns or so.\n> \n> Since we need to provide sequence, perhaps for turns 31 to 35 or 36.\n> \n> But at turn 31,32,33 fixed, turn 34 we choose L to (3,6), turn 35 we can choose to go to (2,6)

The internal obstacles are given: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). Snake positions: head at (6,6), direction Up, and body segments down to (2,1). Food: three items: (2,5) with life span 3 and value 1, (5,3) with life span 6 and value 1, (2,2) with life span 9 and value 1. All food is positive since value is 1.\n> \n> Current turn is 32. I need to plan 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> Snake head is at (6,6), moving Up. From the positions: (6,6) is head, (6,5) is first body, (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1) is tail. So the snake is 10 segments long.\n> \n> Possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right. But since head direction is Up, I can't move Down instantly because that would be reverse. So invalid moves: Down is opposite to Up, so I can't go Down. Valid moves: Up, Left, Right.\n> \n> Now, let's see what each move does:\n> \n> - Up: from (6,6) to (6,7). But y=7 is a wall, since border y=7. So moving Up to (6,7) is invalid, wall collision.\n> \n> - Left: from (6,6) to (5,6)\n> \n> - Right: from (6,6) to (7,6). But x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> x=7 is border, so (7,6) is wall. Similarly, (6,7) is wall.\n> \n> So only possible move is Left to (5,6). Is that safe?\n> \n> (5,6): is it occupied or wall? Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7. Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). (5,6) is not in obstacles, and not wall since x=5 between 0-7, y=6 between 0-7. Now, is it part of snake body? Snake positions: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). So (5,6) is not in body, so it should be safe to move to.\n> \n> But after moving, the tail moves, so the body will shift. When head moves to a new cell, the tail end is removed, so the snake moves forward.\n> \n> In this case, if I move Left to (5,6), head is now at (5,6), and the body segments follow: (6,6) becomes new neck, then (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), etc., and tail (2,1) is removed.\n> \n> But for collision, head must not hit any body segment except the tail, but since tail moves, it's ok to move to where the tail was, as long as it's not still there when head arrives.\n> \n> Standard Snake: when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by a body segment that isn't the tail, it collides. But if it's the tail, and tail moves away, it's ok.\n> \n> In this position, (5,6) is empty, so no problem.\n> \n> But only Left is possible? Up and Right are walls, Down is reverse, forbidden. So I must move Left to (5,6).\n> \n> But the question is to plan multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Current turn t=32, I move to (5,6).\n> \n> Then for turn 33, head at (5,6), direction was Up, but after moving Left, new direction is Left? Or do I need to track direction?\n> \n> The head direction is given as input, and after each move, it changes.\n> \n> For turn 32, head direction is U, I move L, so for turn 33, head direction is L.\n> \n> Now, food: (2,5) life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current? Life span decreases every turn, including current turn.\n> \n> Current turn t=32, food at (2,5) has life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 34? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. So it disappears at the end of turn t + L - 1 or something?\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span L, it is visible on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears before turn t+L.\n> \n> Standard: after N turns, it disappears. \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, countdown is N, then at turn t+1, it becomes N-1, ..., at turn t+N-1, it becomes 1, and after that turn, it disappears, so not present on turn t+N.\n> \n> For food at (2,5): life span 3 at turn 32, so:\n> \n> - Turn 32: life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 33: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 34: life span 1\n> \n> - After turn 34, it disappears, so not on turn 35.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) life span 6 at turn 32:\n> \n> - Turn 32: 6\n> \n> - Turn 33: 5\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 37: 1\n> \n> - Disappears after turn 37.\n> \n> (2,2) life span 9 at turn 32:\n> \n> - Turn 32:9\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Disappears after turn 40.\n> \n> Now, all food is positive, value 1.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, current turn 32, I must move Left to (5,6), as only option.\n> \n> After moving to (5,6), snake positions: head (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1). Tail (2,1) is removed, so body is now 9 segments? Original snake has 10 positions, after move, head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so length remains 10 only if food eaten; otherwise, length same.\n> \n> In this move, I didn't eat food, so snake length should decrease? No.\n> \n> Snake mechanics: when head moves to a cell without food, snake moves, head to new position, each segment shifts, tail is removed, so length unchanged. If head moves to food, length increases by one, tail not removed.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (5,6), is there food? Food positions: (2,5), (5,3), (2,2). (5,6) has no food, so no eating, snake moves, head to (5,6), body: previous head (6,6) becomes first body, then (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), and tail (2,1) is removed. So positions: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1)]? From original: head was (6,6), after move left to (5,6), new head (5,6), then the previous positions except tail: the body segments are shifted, so the second position becomes where head was, which is (6,6), then (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), and (2,1) is gone. But (3,1) is the last now, so positions: head (5,6), body: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1). So 10 segments? Original had 10, after move no food, so should be 10 segments, but tail removed, so one less? I think I confused.\n> \n> Standard: number of segments: if no food eaten, when head moves to new cell, the tail end is removed, so snake has same length, but positions shift. Length is number of segments.\n> \n> Initially, positions list has 10 elements, so length 10.\n> \n> After move to empty cell: new head position, then the previous positions from index 0 to 8, but index 0 was head, now it's body, so new positions: [new_head] + old_positions[:-1]\n> \n> Old positions: index 0: head (6,6), 1: (6,5), 2: (6,4), 3: (5,4), 4: (5,3), 5: (4,3), 6: (4,2), 7: (4,1), 8: (3,1), 9: (2,1)\n> \n> After moving left to (5,6), new head (5,6), then old positions from 0 to 8: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1). So new positions: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1)] — that's 10 positions, but the last is (3,1), and (2,1) is removed, but we have 10 positions? old positions had 10, new head plus old 0 to 8 is 9, plus new head is 10? [new_head] + old_positions[:-1] : old_positions[:-1] is indices 0 to 8, which is 9 elements, plus new head, 10 elements. Yes, length unchanged.\n> \n> But in terms of grid, the cell (2,1) is now empty.\n> \n> Back to planning.\n> \n> Turn 32: move L to (5,6)\n> \n> Now turn 33: head at (5,6), direction L (since last move was L)\n> \n> Possible moves: from (5,6), direction L, so cannot move R (opposite).

Head at (5,6), direction L, so last move was left to (5,6). Possible moves: since direction is L, I can move left (L), up (U), or down (D), but not right (R) because that would be instant reverse.

Snake positions: head (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), etc. No (4,6) in list. Obstacles: internal obstacles include (5,5) but not (4,6). (5,5) is obstacle, but (4,6) not listed. Walls: border walls, (4,6) x=4, y=6, y=6 is not wall, since walls y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable. x=4 between 1 and 6. So (4,6) should be free? But let's list all occupied or blocked cells.\n> \n> Blocked cells:\n> \n> - Walls: all x=0, x=7 for any y; all y=0, y=7 for any x.\n> \n> - Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> - Snake body: except tail can be moved to, but for now, to check if cell is safe to move, body cells are occupied except that tail cell can be moved to if head goes there.\n> \n> When considering a move, if the cell is body, it might be collision unless it's the tail.\n> \n> Specifically, for a move to a cell, if it's wall or obstacle, invalid; if it's body segment, invalid unless it's the tail segment and we move there.\n> \n> In this case, from (5,6):\n> \n> - Move L to (4,6): what is (4,6)?

It's turn 34, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls include borders and internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,6), then body segments: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1). So the snake is 10 segments long. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to (4,6) from (5,6)? Let's see the positions: head is (4,6), previous was (5,6), so yes, moving left.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (2,5) with value 1, life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten?)\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn including current. So for (2,5), life span 1, meaning if not eaten on turn 34, it will disappear after turn 34, so I need to eat it this turn or it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) value 1, life span 4, so it will disappear after 4 turns from now.\n> \n> (2,2) value 1, life span 7\n> \n> (5,4) value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All values are +1, so all positive food? The value is given as 1, and it says positive food has value +1, so all are positive. No negative food here.\n> \n> But let's confirm the food list: (2,5,1,1) – I think this means (x,y,value,life_span), so (2,5) with value 1, life span 1.\n> \n> Similarly for others: (5,3,4,1) – value 4? No, it says \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\": ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ), so for (5,3,4,1) – that might be (x,y) = (5,3), value=4? But it says value and life span, and in the example, it's value1, life_span1.\n> \n> Look: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\": it says \"Life Span and Value\", but in the input it's listed as (x,y, value, life_span) or (x,y, life_span, value)? I need to check.\n> \n> It says: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\": and then in the state: (2,5,1,1) – this is ambiguous.\n> \n> Read carefully: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (2, 5, 1, 1) - (5, 3, 4, 1) - (2, 2, 7, 1) - (5, 4, 10, 1)\"\n> \n> And it says \"Value and Life Span\", so I think the format is (x, y, value, life_span).\n> \n> But for (2,5,1,1): x=2,y=5, value=1, life_span=1\n> \n> (5,3,4,1): x=5,y=3, value=4? But value should be +1 or -1 for positive/negative food, but here it says value=4? That might be a mistake.\n> \n> Perhaps I misread. Let's see the core rules: \"Positive Food: Reward Value = +1\", \"Negative Food: Penalty Value = -1\", so values should be +1 or -1.\n> \n> But here, for (5,3,4,1), it has 4,1 which might be life_span and value or value and life_span?\n> \n> The description says: \"Value and Life Span\", and in the list, (2,5,1,1) – if value and life span, it should be value first, then life span, so (2,5) value=1, life_span=1\n> \n> (5,3,4,1) – value=4? But that can't be, since food values are only +1 or -1.\n> \n> Perhaps it's (x,y, life_span, value)? But it says \"Value and Life Span\", so value first.\n> \n> Let's look back: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (2, 5, 1, 1)\" – it might be a typo or I need to infer.\n> \n> Another possibility: the \"1\" after (2,5) is the value, and the last \"1\" is life span, so for (2,5): value=1, life_span=1\n> \n> For (5,3,4,1): this could be value=4, life_span=1 or value=1, life_span=4? But it's listed as (5,3,4,1), with value and life span.\n> \n> I think there's inconsistency. Let's read the state input format: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" but in the text, it's written as (x1,y1, value1, life_span1) without the inner parentheses, so it's (x,y, value, life_span).\n> \n> But for (5,3,4,1), value=4, life_span=1, but value should be +1 or -1. Similarly, (2,2,7,1) value=7? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> Perhaps it's a mistake in the problem. Let me read the current state again: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (2, 5, 1, 1) - (5, 3, 4, 1) - (2, 2, 7, 1) - (5, 4, 10, 1)\"\n> \n> It says \"Life Span and Value\", not \"Value and Life Span\". In the core rules, it's \"Value and Life Span\", but here it's specified as \"Life Span and Value\" for the state.\n> \n> Look: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\": oh, in the state, it says \"Life Span and Value\", so the order might be life span first, then value.\n> \n> Let's see: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (2, 5, 1, 1)\" – so (x,y, life_span, value)? But it says \"Life Span and Value\", so for (2,5,1,1), it could be life_span=1, value=1.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3,4,1): life_span=4, value=1\n> \n> (2,2,7,1): life_span=7, value=1\n> \n> (5,4,10,1): life_span=10, value=1\n> \n> Yes, that makes sense, all value=1, so all positive food, and life spans as given.\n> \n> For (2,5): life_span=1, value=1, so it disappears after turn 34 if not eaten.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for food with life_span S at turn t, it will disappear after turn t + S - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If life_span is N, it disappears after N turns from now, meaning:\n> \n> - At turn t, life_span N, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears after turn t+N-1, so not available on turn t+N.\n> \n> For example, life_span=1: available only on turn t, disappears after turn t.\n> \n> Life_span=2: available on turn t and t+1, disappears after turn t+1.\n> \n> In general, available for N turns starting from current turn.\n> \n> For (2,5): life_span=1, so only available on turn 34. If not eaten now, it's gone.\n> \n> (5,3): life_span=4, so available on turns 34,35,36,37, disappears after 37.\n> \n> (2,2): life_span=7, available turns 34 to 40.\n> \n> (5,4): life_span=10, available turns 34 to 43.\n> \n> All have value +1, so eating any grows the snake by 1.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,6), direction L, so moving left.\n> \n> Possible moves: since head direction is L, I can move L (continue left), U (up), D (down), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed.

Walls: borders, y=7 is wall, but (3,6) is not border, x=3 between 0-7, y=6 between 0-7, not border. Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,2), (4,4), (5,5), (6,1) — (3,6) not in list, so no wall. Body: snake positions: (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) — (3,6) not in list, so free, but I need to move to it.\n> \n> When I move, the snake moves, so head goes to new position, tail moves away, so cells are freed.\n> \n> But for collision, I die if head touches any body segment except the tail, because when I move, the tail moves, so it's safe to move to where the tail is, as long as it's not occupied by other body.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So for (3,6): not occupied by body or wall, so safe.\n> \n> (4,7): y=7 is border wall, so if I move up to (4,7), it's wall, collision, death.\n> \n> (4,5): not wall, not body?

It's turn 35. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There are internal obstacles at: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). I should list all walls: borders and these points.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,5), then body segments: (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2). So the snake is 10 segments long.

Life span decreases each turn, including current turn, so for turn 35, life spans are 4,6,9 respectively. After turn 35, they decrease to 3,5,8 on turn 36, and so on.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. I should prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid. I'll sketch a grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7).

It's the 8th segment? Let's count: positions index from head: 0: (4,5), 1: (4,6), 2: (5,6), 3: (6,6), 4: (6,5), 5: (6,4), 6: (5,4), 7: (5,3), 8: (4,3), 9: (4,2).

According to rules, food can spawn under body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Specifically:\n> \n> - Food at (5,3) is currently under body segment at (5,3). Life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 35 + 4 - 1? Life span decreases each turn including current, so on turn 35, life span is 4, meaning it will be there for 4 more turns including this one? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So, for food with life_span L on turn T, it will disappear after T + L - 1? Example: if L=4 on turn 35, then:\n> \n> - Turn 35: L=4\n> \n> - Turn 36: L=3\n> \n> - Turn 37: L=2\n> \n> - Turn 38: L=1\n> \n> - Turn 39: L=0, disappears? But countdown decreases every turn including current, so on turn it appears, L is set, then each turn L decreases by 1, when L=0, it disappears.\n> \n> But \"disappears after N turns\" might mean after N turns from now, so for L=4, it disappears after 4 turns, so on turn 39 it is gone? Let's see the rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so if on turn T, life_span = N, then on turn T, it is present with N, then turn T+1, life_span=N-1, ..., turn T+N-1, life_span=1, turn T+N, life_span=0 and disappears. So it is present from turn T to turn T+N-1 inclusive.\n> \n> For food at (5,3): value 1, life_span 4 on turn 35. So it will be present until turn 35 + 4 - 1 = 38? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 35: life_span=4, so available\n> \n> - Turn 36: life_span=3, available\n> \n> - Turn 37: life_span=2, available\n> \n> - Turn 38: life_span=1, available\n> \n> - Turn 39: life_span=0, disappears, not available\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2): life_span=6 on turn 35, so available until turn 35+6-1=40? Turn 35: L=6, T36:L=5, T37:L=4, T38:L=3, T39:L=2, T40:L=1, T41:L=0 gone. So available turns 35 to 40.\n> \n> (5,4): life_span=9, available turns 35 to 43.\n> \n> But (5,3) and (5,4) are under snake body, so to eat them, the snake must move away from those cells and then head move onto them when they are free.\n> \n> Also, there's a rule about tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide immediately.\n> \n> First, let's find possible moves from current position.\n> \n> Current head position: (4,5), direction Down (D). So last move was down to (4,5).\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since direction is D, reverse is U, so cannot move U. So possible: D, L, R.\n> \n> Now, check for collisions or walls.\n> \n> Move Down (D) to (4,4): is (4,4) free? Walls: internal obstacles include (4,4), which is a wall. Also, borders: y=0 and y=7, but (4,4) is within, but (4,4) is listed as internal obstacle. So (4,4) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Move Left (L) to (3,5): what is at (3,5)? Is it wall or snake?\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,y=0,x=7,y=7, and internal: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1). (3,5) not in walls, so not wall.\n> \n> Snake positions: (4,5) head, (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2). (3,5) not in list, so free. But is it within grid? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, (3,5) is valid.\n> \n> Move Right (R) to (5,5): (5,5) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot move.\n> \n> So possible moves: L to (3,5) or D but D to (4,4) is wall, impossible. U is reverse, not allowed. So only possible move is Left to (3,5).\n> \n> Is that right? Direction is D, so reverse is U. U would be to (4,6), but (4,6) is the body segment right behind head? Snake positions: head (4,5), next is (4,6), so (4,6) is the first body segment. Moving U to (4,6) would be moving into body, which is collision, so impossible anyway. But even if it were free, reverse not allowed.\n> \n> D to (4,4) is wall.\n> \n> R to (5,5) is wall.\n> \n> L to (3,5) seems free.\n> \n> But let's confirm: (3,5) - not in walls, not in snake positions, so yes, only possible move is Left to (3,5).\n> \n> But that can't be right? Let me list all adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up (U): (4,6) - occupied by snake body (segment 1)\n> \n> - Down (D): (4,4) - wall (internal obstacle)\n> \n> - Left (L): (3,5) - not wall, not snake, so free\n> \n> - Right (R): (5,5) - wall (internal obstacle)\n> \n> So indeed, only possible move is Left to (3,5).\n> \n> But the snake has to move, so I must choose L.\n> \n> But I need to plan for multiple turns.

Internal obstacles include (1,5), so wall, cannot move.\n> \n> Also, R to (3,5) is reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> So from (2,5), can go U to (2,6) or D to (2,4).\n> \n> If go D to (2,4), then to (2,3), then (2,2) to eat food.\n> \n> (2,4) to (2,3) to (2,2).\n> \n> (2,4) is free, (2,3) free, (2,2) food.\n> \n> From (2,4), move D to (2,3), then D to (2,2).\n> \n> But when moving to (2,2), need to make sure no collision.\n> \n> Also, at that time, tail position.\n> \n> But let's think sequence.\n> \n> First, for turn 35: move L to (3,5)  // only choice\n> \n> Then turn 36: say move D?

Segments: new head (2,5), then old head (3,5) becomes body, so positions: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3) and (4,3) removed. Tail is (5,3).\n> \n> After turn 36: head (2,5), tail (5,3)\n> \n> Turn 37: move D to (2,4), so new head (2,4), body: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) and tail (5,3) removed? Old tail (5,3) removed, new tail is (5,4) now? Positions: new head (2,4), then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) and (5,3) removed. So tail is (5,4).\n> \n> (5,4) has food? But it's under snake, not eaten yet.\n> \n> Turn 38: move D to (2,3), new head (2,3), body: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) and tail (5,4) removed? Old tail (5,4) removed, new tail is (6,4)? Positions: head (2,3), then (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4) and (5,4) removed. Tail at (6,4).\n> \n> Turn 39: move D to (2,2) to eat food. New head (2,2), and since food eaten, snake grows, so tail not removed. New positions: head (2,2), then previous head (2,3) becomes body, and all body segments, so (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4) and since eaten, length increases, so (5,4) was removed but not, because growth. When food eaten, after moving head to food, the tail does not move, so the new tail is the old tail.\n> \n> Standard snake: when no eat, head to new, body follows, tail removed.\n> \n> When eat, head to new, body follows, tail stays, so new segment added at tail.\n> \n> So turn 39: move to (2,2), food there, so eat, grow. New positions: head (2,2), then the previous positions without removing tail. So after turn 38, positions were: head (2,3), body (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4) with tail (6,4)? Index: 0:(2,3), 1:(2,4), 2:(2,5), 3:(3,5), 4:(4,5), 5:(4,6), 6:(5,6), 7:(6,6), 8:(6,5), 9:(6,4)\n> \n> After move to (2,2) and eat: new head (2,2), then segment 0 moves to (2,3), segment 1 to (2,4), ..., segment 9 to (6,5), and no removal, new segment added at tail, so tail is new at (6,4)? Let's list: positions: [ (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4) ] since (6,4) was tail, now becomes segment 10, and new tail is (6,4) still? No: the segment that was tail (6,4) is now the second last, and new tail is added? Confusion.\n> \n> When growing: the head moves to new cell with food, and the body moves as usual, but the tail does not move, so the snake gains one segment. The new position of the tail is the same as before, but since a new segment is added, the tail position stays, and the segment before that becomes the new body.\n> \n> After turn 38: snake segments S0=(2,3), S1=(2,4), S2=(2,5), S3=(3,5), S4=(4,5), S5=(4,6), S6=(5,6), S7=(6,6), S8=(6,5), S9=(6,4)\n> \n> After moving head to (2,2) and eating: new head H' = (2,2), then S0 moves to where head was, but head was S0, so S0 moves to (2,3)? Standard: the new head is (2,2), then each body segment moves to the position of the previous one. So S1 moves to position of S0, which is (2,3), S2 moves to position of S1 (2,4), ..., S9 moves to position of S8 (6,5), and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so new segment at (6,4).\n> \n> So new positions: head (2,2), then S0 becomes (2,3) [was (2,3) but now index 1], let's list indices:\n> \n> New segment 0: (2,2)\n> \n> New segment 1: old S0 position (2,3)\n> \n> New segment 2: old S1 position (2,4)\n> \n> New segment 3: old S2 position (2,5)\n> \n> New segment 4: old S3 position (3,5)\n> \n> New segment 5: old S4 position (4,5)\n> \n> New segment 6: old S5 position (4,6)\n> \n> New segment 7: old S6 position (5,6)\n> \n> New segment 8: old S7 position (6,6)\n> \n> New segment 9: old S8 position (6,5)\n> \n> New segment 10: old S9 position (6,4) but since eaten, new segment added at old tail position, so segment 10: (6,4)\n> \n> Old tail was S9 at (6,4), so new segment at (6,4).\n> \n> So positions: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)\n> \n> Tail at (6,4)\n> \n> Now, back to the food at (5,3), which has life span until turn 38.

No, walls are at x=0/x=7 and y=0/y=7, so cells like (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. But internal obstacles are also given, so I need to consider those as blocked cells.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)]\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,5), then body: (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3).

Previous head was (4,5) probably, since body is (4,5) next.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (3,5), then (4,5), so yes, it moved from (4,5) to (3,5) by going left.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,5)\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is L (left), I cannot move right (opposite) instantly.

Walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is ok. x=3, ok. But is there an obstacle? Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). (3,4) is an obstacle? (3,4) is in the list, so (3,4) is blocked.\n> \n> Internal obstacles include (3,4), so (3,4) is a wall cell.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) is also an obstacle.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (3,5):\n> \n> - Left (L): (2,5) - x=2, y=5.

Walls are borders and internal, so (2,5) should be free unless obstacle. Obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) — (1,5) is obstacle, but (2,5) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> - Up (U): (3,6) - y=6, which is less than 7, so not wall. But is it occupied? Snake has (4,6) and (5,6), but not (3,6), so free? (3,6) not in snake positions. Obstacles: (3,4) is obstacle, but (3,6) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> - Down (D): (3,4) - but (3,4) is an internal obstacle!

Reverse direction: since head moved left to (3,5), moving right would be opposite to current direction L, so not allowed.\n> \n> So only U and L are possible moves.\n> \n> Now, food is at (5,3), (2,2), (5,4). But (5,3) and (5,4) are under snake body, so I need to move the body away to eat them later.\n> \n> Specifically, food at (5,3) has life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 36, life span 3, it will disappear after 3 more turns? Let's see the rule.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (5,3), life span 3 at turn 36. After turn 36, life span becomes 2, then after turn 37, life span 1, after turn 38, life span 0, so it disappears before turn 39? Or at the start of turn 39?\n> \n> The countdown decreases every turn, including current, so at the beginning of turn 36, life span is 3. After the snake moves on turn 36, the life span decreases to 2. Similarly, after turn 37, to 1, after turn 38, to 0, and then it disappears, so it can be eaten only on turns when life span >0.\n> \n> For (5,3), it can be eaten until turn 38, since on turn 38, after move, life span becomes 0, but if eaten on turn 38, it should be before decrease? I need to clarify.\n> \n> Typically, the sequence: at start of turn, food has life span. Snake moves. If head moves to food, it is eaten, then food removed. Then after move, life span decreases for all food.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", but it doesn't specify when exactly.\n> \n> To be safe, I'll assume that if head moves to a food cell on turn t, and food has life span >0, it is eaten. Then after the move, life span decreases.\n> \n> For (5,3) at turn 36: life span 3. If eaten on turn 36, it happens. After turn 36 move, life span becomes 2, and so on.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Food at (5,3) is currently under snake body at (5,3), which is the 9th segment? Snake positions: index 0 head (3,5), 1: (4,5), 2: (4,6), 3: (5,6), 4: (6,6), 5: (6,5), 6: (6,4), 7: (5,4), 8: (5,3), 9: (4,3) tail.\n> \n> (5,3) is segment 8, which is not tail; tail is (4,3).\n> \n> To eat food at (5,3), the snake needs to move such that the body moves away from (5,3), and then head moves to it later.\n> \n> Similarly for (5,4), which is segment 7.\n> \n> Now, food at (2,2) is free, life span 5, so can be eaten until turn 40 (since turn 36:5, 37:4, 38:3, 39:2, 40:1, 41:0?

So cells (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (1,0) to (6,0), (1,7) to (6,7) are walls, but since we play on grid, only internal cells are playable, but walls occupy those cells.\n> \n> Playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> So let's list all blocked cells:\n> \n> - Borders: all x=0, x=7 for y=0 to 7; all y=0, y=7 for x=0 to 7.

When the snake moves, the tail moves, so if I move in a way that the tail leaves (5,3), then (5,3) is free, and food is there, so if head can move to it, I can eat.\n> \n> But the tail is at (4,3), which will move when the snake moves.\n> \n> At turn 36, tail is at (4,3).\n> \n> If I move, say, L to (2,5), new tail becomes (5,3), and (4,3) is free, but food is at (5,3), not (4,3).\n> \n> Food is at (5,3), which is currently occupied by body segment.\n> \n> After move, if I move L, the body at (5,3) becomes the new tail, so (5,3) is still occupied, with food under it.\n> \n> If I move U, same thing, (5,3) becomes tail.\n> \n> To free (5,3), I need to move the snake so that the segment at (5,3) moves away.\n> \n> The segment at (5,3) is not the tail; it's the second last segment. Tail is (4,3).\n> \n> So when the snake moves, the tail (4,3) is removed, and the segment at (5,3) becomes the new tail, so (5,3) is still occupied, but by the tail now.\n> \n> The cell (5,3) remains occupied by the snake, either as body or tail, until the tail moves away from it.\n> \n> Specifically, after any move, the tail is at a new position, but the previous cell is freed.\n> \n> But for (5,3), it is currently occupied by a body segment. When the snake moves, that segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so it depends on the direction.\n> \n> Let's trace the snake movement.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: head (3,5), 1: (4,5), 2: (4,6), 3: (5,6), 4: (6,6), 5: (6,5), 6: (6,4), 7: (5,4), 8: (5,3), 9: tail (4,3)\n> \n> When head moves to a new position, say new_head, then the new body segments are: position 0: new_head, position 1: old head (3,5), position 2: old pos1 (4,5), and so on, up to position 8: old pos8 (5,3), and position 9: old pos9 (4,3) is removed, so the new tail is the last position, which is old pos8 (5,3).\n> \n> So after any move, the cell at (5,3) will be occupied by the new tail, because old pos8 (5,3) becomes the new last body segment, which is tail if no growth.\n> \n> Similarly, the cell at (4,3) is freed.\n> \n> But food is at (5,3), not at (4,3).\n> \n> To free the food at (5,3), I need the tail to move away from it, but after the move, the tail is at (5,3), so it's still occupied.\n> \n> Then on the next move, if I move the head, the tail will move to the position of the previous segment, which is where the body was.\n> \n> After move at turn 36, tail is at (5,3).\n> \n> Then at turn 37, when head moves, the tail will move to the position that was the second last, which was (5,4) in the new positions? Let's see.\n> \n> After turn 36 move, new positions: for example, if I move L to (2,5):\n> \n> - New head: (2,5)\n> \n> - New body: (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3)  // so positions: head (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), tail (5,3)\n> \n> Food at (5,3) is under the tail.\n> \n> If I move U to (3,6):\n> \n> - New head: (3,6)\n> \n> - New body: (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), tail (5,3)\n> \n> Same thing.\n> \n> Now, at this point, tail is at (5,3) with food under it.\n> \n> On the next turn, turn 37, when the snake moves, the tail will move away from (5,3) to the position of the previous segment, which is (5,4) in this case.\n> \n> For example, if from here, head moves somewhere, say from (2,5) or (3,6), the tail at (5,3) will move to where the neck was, which is (5,4) in the new positions, so (5,3) is freed, and if food is there, it can be eaten if head moves to it, but head is far away.\n> \n> Similarly, if from the U move position, head at (3,6), tail at (5,3), when head moves, tail moves to (5,4), freeing (5,3).\n> \n> So on turn 37, after the move, (5,3) is free and has food with life span decreasing.\n> \n> At turn 36, before move, food at (5,3) has life span 3.\n> \n> After turn 36 move, life span decreases to 2.\n> \n> At turn 37, before move, life span 2.\n> \n> If on turn 37, head moves to (5,3), it can be eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, after turn 37 move, life span decreases to 1, and so on.\n> \n> So to eat (5,3), I need to have head at (5,3) on turn 37 or 38, since on turn 38, life span 1 before move.\n> \n> But on turn 37, (5,3) will be free only after the move of turn 37? Let's clarify the timing.\n> \n> At the start of turn 37, positions are from after turn 36 move.\n> \n> At start of turn 37, tail is at (5,3) with food, so (5,3) is occupied.\n> \n> When the snake moves on turn 37, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves to the next body segment, freeing the current tail cell.\n> \n> So after the move of turn 37, the cell (5,3) is free, and food is there with life span decreased from previous turn.\n> \n> At start of turn 37, before move, food at (5,3) has life span 2 (since after turn 36 decrease).\n> \n> After the move of turn 37, if head did not move to (5,3), then life span decreases to 1, and (5,3) is free.\n> \n> Then on turn 38, before move, life span 1, and (5,3) is free, so if head moves to it, it can be eaten.\n> \n> If not, after move, life span 0, disappears.\n> \n> So to eat (5,3), I need to move head to (5,3) on turn 38 at the latest, since on turn 37 it is still occupied.\n> \n> On turn 37, (5,3) is occupied by tail, so head cannot move to it because it's occupied, and also it's the tail, but moving to tail is allowed only if it's the only cell, but here it's occupied, so cannot move to it.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment\" only if it's the current tail position and the tail will move.\n> \n> But when moving, if head moves to the current tail position, it is safe because the tail moves away.\n> \n> But in this case, at turn 37, before move, tail is at (5,3), so if I move head directly to (5,3), it is possible, but there is food there, and it's the tail.\n> \n> But there is a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n> \n> But here, if head moves to the tail cell, it is not adjacent; it is on the same cell, which might be different.\n> \n> The rule says: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills\"\n> \n> But when moving to the tail cell, head is not adjacent; it is on the cell.\n> \n> So moving to the tail cell should be safe, as per the general rule.\n> \n> The danger is only when head is adjacent and then moves to eat food at tail, causing collision.\n> \n> Let's read carefully:\n> \n> \"**Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is *adjacent to the tail* and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> So this is when head is adjacent to tail, not on the same cell.\n> \n> If head is on a cell next to tail, and tail has food, and head moves to tail cell to eat it, then after eating, the snake grows, so the tail does not move, and head is on the same cell as the new tail, causing collision.\n> \n> But if head moves to tail cell when not adjacent, it might be different.\n> \n> In this case, for (5,3), at turn 37, if head is not adjacent to tail, moving to (5,3) should be safe: head moves to (5,3), eats food, snake grows, so the tail does not move, but since head is moving to tail position, and tail is there, after eating, the new tail is the old tail, so it might be ok, but the cell has two segments, head and tail, which is collision.\n> \n> I'm confused.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a cell with food, it eats, so the tail does not move that turn, so the snake grows by one.\n> \n> If the head moves to the current tail position, and eats food there, then after eating, the head is on that cell, and the tail remains there because no move, so there are two segments on the same cell, which is collision.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to the tail cell to eat food is always deadly, because it results in immediate collision.\n> \n> If there is no food, moving to tail cell is safe because tail moves away.\n> \n> But with food, it causes growth and collision.\n> \n> Similarly, in this case, for (5,3), since it has food, moving head to it when it is the tail cell will cause death.\n> \n> Therefore, I cannot eat the food at (5,3) by moving directly to it when it is the tail position.\n> \n> I need to move to it when it is free, not occupied, and not the tail.\n> \n> But when it is free, it is after the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, on turn 37, after the move, (5,3) is free, but at that point, life span is 1 (after turn 37 move), then on turn 38, I can move to it if possible.\n> \n> But head needs to be near (5,3) on turn 38.\n> \n> Similarly, I can eat it on turn 37 if I move to it when it is not occupied, but on turn 37 before move, it is occupied, so I can only eat on turn 38.\n> \n> Let's outline the turns.\n> \n> Turn 36 (current):\n> \n> - Before move: food at (5,3) life span 3\n> \n> - I move head to new position, say P\n> \n> - After move, snake positions updated, tail now at (5,3), food life span decreases to 2\n> \n> Turn 37:\n> \n> - Before move: tail at (5,3) with food, life span 2\n> \n> - I move head to some position Q\n> \n> - After move: tail moves to (5,4) or wherever, so (5,3) is freed, food life span decreases to 1\n> \n> Turn 38:\n> \n> - Before move: (5,3) is free with food, life span 1\n> \n> - If I move head to (5,3), it can be eaten.

It's turn 37. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and walls are on the borders. Also, internal obstacles at: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). I should list all wall cells to avoid.\n> \n> Border walls: all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. For example, (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7). But since it's a grid, the borders are the edges.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). So all these are walls that the snake cannot move into.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,5), and the body segments are: (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3). The head direction is left, so it's moving left, meaning from (2,5) to (3,5) was previous move? Snake positions are listed head first: (2,5) is head, then (3,5), (4,5), etc. Since head direction is L, it was moving left to (2,5) from (3,5) I think. Positions: index 0: (2,5) head, index 1: (3,5), index 2: (4,5), index 3: (4,6), index 4: (5,6), index 5: (6,6), index 6: (6,5), index 7: (6,4), index 8: (5,4), index 9: (5,3) tail.\n> \n> Head direction L means the snake is currently facing left, so from the head, moving left would go to (1,5), but let's see the positions. The head is at (2,5), and previous position was (3,5) since it moved left to current head. So next move, it can go U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so since it came from right (since (3,5) is to the right of (2,5)), moving left to (2,5) from (3,5), so current direction L, so it cannot move right (opposite direction) next turn. Possible moves: U, D, L. L is left, which is same direction, U is up, D is down. But need to check if those are valid.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (5,3) with value 1, life span 2\n> \n> - (2,2) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (5,4) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all positive food, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, and life span decreasing each turn.\n> \n> Now, life span: for (5,3), life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 more turns, including current turn? The state is at turn 37, so life span decreases every turn including current. So for food at (5,3), life span 2: after turn 37, it will have life span 1, then after turn 38, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 37 or 38.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) life span 4: can be eaten on turns 37,38,39,40.\n> \n> (5,4) life span 7: turns 37 to 43.\n> \n> (2,6) life span 10: turns 37 to 46.\n> \n> But we need to think 5+ turns ahead, so up to turn 42 or so.\n> \n> Snake head at (2,5), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,5): U to (2,6), D to (2,4), L to (1,5), R to (3,5). But R is opposite to current direction L, so cannot move R because of no instant reverse. So only U, D, L possible.\n> \n> Now, check if these moves are safe.\n> \n> First, U to (2,6): is (2,6) a wall? Border walls: y=7 is top, y=0 bottom, x=0 left, x=7 right. (2,6) is within bounds, x=2 between 1 and 6? x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to 6 are free except obstacles. Similarly y=0 and y=7 walls, y=1 to 6 free except obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). (2,6) is not in obstacles, and not border wall since y=6 <7, x=2 not 0 or 7. So (2,6) is free? But there is food at (2,6), but that's fine, snake can eat it.\n> \n> But (2,6) might be occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3). So (4,6) is body, (5,6), (6,6) are body, but (2,6) is not in the list, so it's empty, I think. Snake occupies those cells, so other cells are free unless wall or food.\n> \n> Cells: (2,6) is not snake body, not wall, so it's free, and has food.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (2,4): (2,4) not in snake positions, not in walls? Walls: internal obstacles include (1,4), (3,4), but (2,4) not listed, so should be free. Borders: x=2 not 0 or 7, y=4 not 0 or 7, so free.\n> \n> L to (1,5): (1,5) is an internal obstacle? Obstacles include (1,5), (1,4), (1,2), etc. Yes, (1,5) is an internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> So possible moves from (2,5): U to (2,6), D to (2,4), L to (1,5) but (1,5) is wall, so invalid. So only U and D are possible? L is to (1,5), which is wall, so not possible. And R is invalid because opposite direction. So only U and D are possible moves this turn.\n> \n> U to (2,6) or D to (2,4).\n> \n> Now, (2,6) has food with value 1, life span 10. If we move there, we eat it, snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> But we need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (5,3) which is the tail position? Snake positions include (5,3), which is the tail. (5,3) is in snake positions, index 9: (5,3) tail.\n> \n> But food at (5,3) is listed, but since snake is on it, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (5,3), and food is there. So to eat it, the tail must move away first, then head can move to (5,3) later.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (5,4) is also on a body segment? (5,4) is index 8 in snake positions, which is body, not tail. (5,4) is occupied by snake body, and food is there, so similarly, it can only be eaten if that part moves away and head comes later.\n> \n> Food at (5,4) with life span 7, and (5,3) with life span 2.\n> \n> (5,3) life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 38. Turn 37: life span 2, after turn 37, it becomes 1, after turn 38, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 37 or 38.\n> \n> But currently occupied, so if we want to eat it, we need to move the tail away first.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) is occupied, life span longer.\n> \n> Now, back to current move: from (2,5), we can go U to (2,6) or D to (2,4).\n> \n> First, if we go U to (2,6): we eat the food at (2,6), since it's there. Then snake grows, new head at (2,6), new tail remains until next move? When snake eats food, it grows, so after moving to (2,6), head is now (2,6), and a new segment is added where the head was? Standard snake: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the end, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n> \n> So when head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, length increases, so the tail doesn't move that turn. The snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> Then next turn, when moving, the tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, if we move U to (2,6), we eat the food there, so new positions: head is (2,6), then previous head (2,5) becomes body, and all body segments same, tail at (5,3). Length increases from 10 to 11 segments? Current snake has 10 positions, so length 10.\n> \n> After eating, positions: [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3)]? No: when head moves to (2,6), it eats food, so the tail doesn't move, so the new segment is added at the tail? I think I have confusion.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when the head moves to a cell with food, the snake grows, so the head moves to the new cell, and the tail stays in place; no segment is removed that turn. So the length increases by one.\n> \n> For example, positions before move: head at A, body B,C,D,..., tail T.\n> \n> After moving head to food cell F, positions: head at F, then A, B, C, ..., T. So tail T is still there, and new segment added at the end? No: the positions become [F, A, B, C, ..., T], so length increased by one, tail is still T.\n> \n> Then next move, when head moves to a new cell without food, tail moves away from T.\n> \n> Similarly, if no food, head moves to new cell, tail moves from T.\n> \n> In this case, if we move to (2,6) with food, after move: head at (2,6), then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3) tail. So tail still at (5,3).\n> \n> And food at (5,3) is still there, but under the tail.\n> \n> Now, if we go D to (2,4), no food there, so head moves to (2,4), tail moves away from (5,3), so new tail is (5,4)? Positions: before move, snake: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3)\n> \n> After moving to (2,4) without eating: head to (2,4), then body: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), and tail (5,3) is removed, so new positions: [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)] and (5,3) is free now.\n> \n> But food at (5,3) is still there, so now it's free to be eaten if head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, if we move U to (2,6) with food, we eat it, snake grows, tail at (5,3) stays, so food under tail still occupied.\n> \n> Now, we need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there is a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (5,3), and if head is adjacent to (5,3) and we eat the food there, it would cause collision.\n> \n> But currently, head is at (2,5), not adjacent to (5,3). Adjacent means one cell away in up, down, left, right.\n> \n> (2,5) to (5,3) is not adjacent; it's multiple cells away.\n> \n> Now, let's plan.\n> \n> First, possible actions for turn 37: U or D.\n> \n> Option 1: Move U to (2,6)\n> \n> - Eat food at (2,6), score +1, snake length 11\n> \n> - New head: (2,6)\n> \n> - Direction: since we moved up, new head direction U.\n> \n> - Snake positions: [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3)]\n> \n> - Food at (2,6) eaten, removed.\n> \n> - Food at (5,3) still there, under tail, life span now 1 (since turn 37 passed, but we are at turn 37, after move it's still turn 37? Turn progression: at the start of turn 37, we decide move, then after move, turn 37 ends, life span decreases? The state is at the beginning of turn 37.\n> \n> Input: \"Current turn: t1=37\", so at start of turn 37, before any action.\n> \n> We choose action for turn 37.\n> \n> After we move, the turn ends, life span decreases for all food.\n> \n> Similarly, for food, life span decreases every turn, including current, so after turn 37, life span decreases.\n> \n> For (5,3), life span 2, after turn 37, it becomes 1.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> After we move on turn 37, the state updates.\n> \n> If we move U on turn 37 to (2,6), we eat the food there, so food at (2,6) is removed. Then after turn 37, life span of other food decreases: (5,3) to life span 1, (2,2) to 3, (5,4) to 6, (2,6) was eaten so gone.\n> \n> (2,6) food is eaten, so removed.\n> \n> Then turn 38 begins.\n> \n> Now, head at (2,6), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R.

Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), but (1,6) not listed, so not obstacle. Borders: x=1 not 0 or 7, y=6 not 0 or 7, so should be free?

It's turn 39, and I'm playing as the snake AI. The goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, thinking at least 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> **Grid Setup:**\n> - Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders.\n> - Internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)]. These are cells I cannot move into.\n> \n> **Snake Position:**\n> - Snake segments: Head at (2,3), then (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4). So the head is at (2,3), and the tail is at (6,4). Length is 10 segments.\n> \n> **Head Direction:** Currently moving Down (D). That means from (2,4) to (2,3), since head was previously at (2,4) and now at (2,3) moving down to (2,2)? Let's clarify: the positions are listed from head to tail, so at turn 39, head is at (2,3), and it was at (2,4) before, so moving down to (2,3). But direction is given as \"D\", which is down, so moving downward.\n> \n> The head direction is the current movement direction. Since head is at (2,3) and direction is D, that means it moved down to this position. So next move, from (2,3), I can move U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Since I just moved down, I cannot move up immediately; that would be reverse. No instant reverse means I cannot move opposite to the current direction on the next turn. Current direction is D (down), so I cannot move U (up) on turn 40.\n> \n> **Food Information:**\n> - Food at (2,2) with value 1, life span 3\n> - Food at (5,4) with value 1, life span 5\n> - Food at (2,6) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> All food has positive value +1, since value is 1. No negative food mentioned, so all are positive. Life span: for (2,2), life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn. Since current turn is 39, it will disappear after turn 41? Let's see: life span N means it disappears after N turns, including current, so countdown decreases every turn.\n> \n> - Food at (2,2): life span 3 at turn 39, so it will be there for turns 39,40,41? Disappears after N turns, meaning it lasts for N turns starting from when it was spawned, but here it's given at turn 39 with life span, so:\n> \n> Life span: the number of turns it remains, including the current turn. So for (2,2), life span 3 at turn 39, so it exists on turn 39, 40, 41, and disappears at turn 42 or after turn 41? Typically, \"disappears after N turns\" means it is present for N turns, from the turn it appears to turn + N-1, and gone on turn N.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> For (2,2): at turn 39, life_span=3, so after turn 39, at turn 40, life_span=2, turn 41 life_span=1, turn 42 life_span=0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 39,40,41.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4): life_span=5 at turn 39, so exists until turn 43 (turns 39 to 43, life_span from 5 to 1, gone at turn 44).\n> \n> (2,6): life_span=8, exists until turn 46.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan my moves for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> Current head position: (2,3)\n> \n> Current direction: D (down)\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,3):\n> \n> - Up (U) to (2,4): but (2,4) is occupied by the snake's body, specifically the second segment. Snake positions: [(2,3), (2,4), (2,5), ...] so (2,4) is the first body segment.\n> \n> Moving to (2,4) would be colliding with the body, which is deadly. So cannot move U.\n> \n> - Down (D) to (2,2): (2,2) has food, and it's a valid cell? Let's check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so (2,2) is within bounds, x=2,y=2, not border. Internal obstacles: none at (2,2), so it's free? But food is there, but moving to it might be possible.\n> \n> - Left (L) to (1,3): (1,3) – check if it's wall or obstacle.\n> \n> Borders: x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 walls. (1,3): x=1 not 0 or 7, y=3 not 0 or 7, so not border wall. Internal obstacles: list has (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), but (1,3) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> Internal obstacles given: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). So (1,3) is not there, so free.\n> \n> - Right (R) to (3,3): (3,3) – no border, and not in obstacles list. Obstacles have (3,4), but not (3,3), so free.\n> \n> Now, also, for food, if I move to (2,2), which has food, I need to consider if it's safe to eat.\n> \n> But first, possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (2,4) – occupied by body, collision, invalid.\n> \n> - D: to (2,2) – has food, and cell is free? (2,2) is not wall or obstacle, and food is there, but is it under snake? No, snake is not on (2,2), positions are from (2,3) to (6,4), so (2,2) is empty except for food.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (2,3), then (2,4), (2,5), etc. So (2,2) is not occupied by snake, so moving to (2,2) should be possible to eat the food.\n> \n> But there's a special case: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\" But here, food is at (2,2), not under snake body; snake is at (2,3), (2,4), etc., so (2,2) is free. So moving to it should eat the food.\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills. But tail is at (6,4), head is at (2,3), not adjacent. Adjacent means next cell, so no issue.\n> \n> So from (2,3), possible actions:\n> \n> - D: to (2,2) – eat food, snake grows to length 11, new tail position after move? When snake eats, it grows, so after moving to (2,2), head is at (2,2), and tail stays where it is? No, when snake moves, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position, and if food eaten, tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when head moves to a food cell, the tail doesn't retract, so snake length increases by one, with new head at food, and tail remains.\n> \n> But in terms of positions, after move: head moves to new cell, body segments follow, and if food eaten, the last segment (tail) is not removed, so new position list has one more segment.\n> \n> Here, if I move D to (2,2), eat food, then new positions: head at (2,2), then previous head (2,3) becomes body, and so on, up to tail (6,4) still there, but since length increases, tail doesn't move? Let's think.\n> \n> Initial positions: [H(2,3), B1(2,4), B2(2,5), B3(3,5), B4(4,5), B5(4,6), B6(5,6), B7(6,6), B8(6,5), T(6,4)] that's 10 segments.\n> \n> After move D: head moves to (2,2), so new head (2,2), then B1 is (2,3) which was head, B2 is (2,4) which was B1, and so on, up to T should be (6,5)? No: when snake moves without eating, the tail moves forward, so last segment is removed.\n> \n> But when eating food, tail is not removed, so new segment is added.\n> \n> So after moving to (2,2) and eating: new positions: head (2,2), then (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), and tail was (6,4), but since eating, (6,4) remains as new tail? Positions: the segment that was tail stays, and new head is added.\n> \n> After move: the body segments shift: the cell that was head becomes new first body, previous first body becomes second, and so on, and the tail cell is vacated if no eat, but if eat, the tail cell is not vacated; instead, the tail stays, and a new segment is added at the head.\n> \n> In terms of list: after move without eat: positions become [new_head, previous_head, previous_body1, ..., previous_body8] but since tail moved, previous_tail is removed.\n> \n> With 10 segments: indices 0=head,1=body1, ...,9=tail.\n> \n> After move to new cell without eating: new head at new cell, new body at old head, new body at old body1, ..., new tail at old body8 (which was index 8, since tail is index 9).\n> \n> Old positions: [H0, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, T9]\n> \n> After move to new cell N without eating: new positions [N, H0, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8]  so T9 is removed, and B8 becomes new tail.\n> \n> After move to new cell N with eating: new positions [N, H0, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, T9] so all old positions kept, and new head added, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, T9 was (6,4), and it remains.\n> \n> But for collision, when moving, the head should not collide with body except the tail, which moves away.\n> \n> Back to moves.\n> \n> From (2,3), possible:\n> \n> - D: to (2,2) - cell free, has food, so eat, grow to 11.\n> \n> - L: to (1,3) - free cell, no food.\n> \n> - R: to (3,3) - free cell, no food.\n> \n> U is invalid.\n> \n> Now, current direction is D, so no instant reverse, but U is already invalid, so all possible moves are allowed except U.\n> \n> D is down, same as current, so ok.\n> \n> L and R are perpendicular, so ok.\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, food life spans: (2,2) has life span 3 at turn 39, so must be eaten by turn 41 (since disappears after turn 41, or at turn 42? Can be eaten on turn 41 with life_span=1, then disappears.\n> \n> Turn 39: life_span=3\n> \n> Turn 40: life_span=2 (if not eaten)\n> \n> Turn 41: life_span=1\n> \n> Turn 42: life_span=0, gone.\n> \n> So can be eaten on turn 39,40,41.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) life_span=5, so turns 39 to 43.\n> \n> (2,6) life_span=8, turns 39 to 46.\n> \n> Now, (2,2) is close, at (2,2), which is adjacent down from head.\n> \n> (2,6) is at (2,6), which is on the same column, but y=6, while head at y=3.\n> \n> Snake has segments at (2,5), (2,4), so (2,6) is below (2,5)? y-coordinates: head (2,3), then (2,4), (2,5), so (2,5) is the third segment. (2,6) is a cell, is it occupied? Positions: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), then (3,5), so (2,6) is not occupied, it has food.\n> \n> But to reach (2,6), from head (2,3), I need to go down to (2,2) or something, but (2,6) is at y=6.\n> \n> Grid: y=0 bottom? Or top? Usually in coordinates, y=0 might be bottom or top, but here it doesn't specify, but walls at y=0 and y=7, so I think we can assume y increasing up or down? Head direction is D for down, so probably y increases upwards, D is down to lower y.\n> \n> In positions, head at (2,3), moving D to (2,2)? From (2,4) to (2,3) is down, so y decreasing down.\n> \n> So (2,3) to (2,2) is down, y=2.\n> \n> (2,6) is at y=6, which is up, since y=7 is top wall.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=0 bottom, y=7 top? Head at (2,3), and (2,4) is above it, since from (2,4) to (2,3) down, so y=4 to y=3, so y decreases downward, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 top.\n> \n> Standard: in grids, often (0,0) bottom left, but here walls x=0 left, x=7 right, y=0 bottom, y=7 top? But let's confirm from positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), ...] so from (2,5) to (3,5) right, and (2,4) to (2,5) up? (2,4) to (2,5) is increasing y, so if moving to (2,5) from (2,4), that would be up if y increases up.\n> \n> But head direction is D, down, from previous position.\n> \n> At turn 39, head at (2,3), and head direction D, meaning it moved down to this position from (2,4) at turn 38.\n> \n> So from (2,4) to (2,3) is down, so y=4 to y=3, decreasing y, so y=3 is below y=4, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n> \n> Thus, (2,6) at y=6 is high up, near top wall.\n> \n> Now, (2,6) food is at (2,6), which is above the snake body at (2,5).\n> \n> (2,5) is occupied by snake, body segment.\n> \n> Food at (2,6) is not under snake, it's a separate cell.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) is at (5,4), which might be reachable.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan moves.\n> \n> First, immediate move at turn 40?

With eating: new head (2,2), previous head (3,2) becomes body, etc., up to previous tail (6,5) remains, so positions: [ (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) ] — 12 segments? Let's count: from head to tail: (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) — that's 12, but originally 10, ate one, should be 11.

After turn 40, positions: head (3,2), body (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), tail (6,5) — yes, 11 segments because after turn 40 no eat, but from turn 39 to 40 no eat, so length 10.\n> \n> Start turn 39: 10 segments.\n> \n> Turn 39 move to (3,3), no eat, positions: [ (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) ] tail (6,5), and (6,4) removed.\n> \n> Turn 40 move to (3,2), no eat, positions: [ (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6) ] tail (6,6), (6,5) removed?

Old tail (6,6) is now the last body, and since eating, it stays, so the segment that was tail is kept, so positions have 11 segments: head (2,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), tail (6,6).\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> From here, head at (2,2), and as before, can only move D or R.\n> \n> Move D to (2,1) or R to (3,2), but (3,2) is now body, so moving to (3,2) is collision, invalid.\n> \n> From (2,2), after eating, positions: head (2,2), body (3,2), (3,3), etc.\n> \n> So moves:\n> \n> - U to (2,3): (2,3) is body, collision\n> \n> - D to (2,1): free\n> \n> - L to (1,2): obstacle\n> \n> - R to (3,2): (3,2) is body, collision\n> \n> So only D to (2,1) possible.\n> \n> Then to (2,1), which as before, leads to potential dead end if not careful.\n> \n> From (2,1), can move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n> \n> (1,1) is free, but as before, from (1,1) only dead ends.\n> \n> (3,1) is free, and from (3,1) can move U to (3,2) or R to (4,1), etc.\n> \n> But (3,2) is body, so from (3,1), moving U to (3,2) body, collision; D to (3,0) wall; L to (2,1) body; R to (4,1) free.\n> \n> So only R to (4,1) possible.\n> \n> Then to (4,1), and so on.\n> \n> But it's getting messy, and I might be boxing myself in.\n> \n> Perhaps eating (2,2) immediately is not the best, but I have to because of short life span, or I can avoid it.\n> \n> Another food at (5,4) and (2,6).\n> \n> (2,6) is on the same column, but I need to access it.\n> \n> Currently, the body is on (2,4) and (2,5), so I need to move the snake to free (2,6).\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) is near the tail.\n> \n> Tail at (6,4), so (5,4) is left, and it has food.\n> \n> If I can move the head to (5,4), I can eat it.\n> \n> But to do that, I need a path.\n> \n> Now, at turn 39, if I move R to (3,3), as above, then I can go to (4,3) or (3,2).\n> \n> Let's consider not eating (2,2) at all, but it has +1, so I should eat it if possible.\n> \n> But with the risk of getting stuck.\n> \n> Perhaps I can eat it later, on turn 41, as above.\n> \n> But in that case, I end up at (2,2) with only one move down.\n> \n> Another idea: at turn 39, move D to (2,2) and eat, then at turn 40, move R to (3,2), but from (2,2), moving R to (3,2), is (3,2) free?

Head direction is Down, meaning it moved down to (2,2) from (2,3)? Positions are listed head first: [(2,2), (2,3), ...]. Since head direction is D, that means it was moving down, so from (2,3) to (2,2) is down, but (2,3) is the second segment? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> The snake positions are given in order: index 0 is head (2,2), index 1 is (2,3), index 2 is (2,4), and so on. Head direction is D, which means the snake is facing down. Since it moved to (2,2) with direction D, that suggests it came from above, so the previous head position was (2,3), and it moved down to (2,2). But (2,3) is now the body.

So (2,6) is not occupied, and no wall, so free cell with food.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4): not in snake positions, not wall, so free.\n> \n> (2,4) is occupied by body, so food there can't be eaten now.\n> \n> Now, head at (2,2), need to choose action for turn 40.\n> \n> Possible actions: D to (2,1) or R to (3,2).\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's consider going down to (2,1).\n> \n> If move D to (2,1): new head position (2,1), direction becomes D (since moved down).\n> \n> Then snake positions: head (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), ..., tail (6,4) but when head moves, tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed, and new head added.\n> \n> After moving to (2,1), the new snake positions: head (2,1), then previous head (2,2), then (2,3), ..., up to (6,4) but since tail moves, the segment at (6,4) is removed, so new body: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) — (6,4) is gone, and (6,5) becomes the new tail? Let's see:\n> \n> Original positions: indices 0 to 10: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)\n> \n> After move down to (2,1): new head at (2,1), so new positions: [ (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) ] and (6,4) is removed. Length unchanged since no food eaten.\n> \n> Now, at (2,1), direction D.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,1): down to (2,0) but y=0 is wall, invalid. Left to (1,1), is (1,1) free? x=1,y=1, obstacles: (1,2) is wall, but (1,1) not listed, so should be free. Right to (3,1), free. Up to (2,2), but (2,2) is now body, and direction is D, moving up is reverse, not allowed. So cannot move up.\n> \n> Moves: left to (1,1), right to (3,1), down invalid. So L or R.\n> \n> But (1,1): is it accessible? x=1,y=1, no obstacle listed, so yes.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) free.\n> \n> Now, if we go right to (3,2) at turn 40.\n> \n> Move R to (3,2): new head (3,2), direction R (since moved right).\n> \n> Snake positions: [ (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) ] and (6,4) removed.\n> \n> At (3,2), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: right to (4,2), left to (2,2) but (2,2) is body, and moving left is opposite to R? Direction is R, moving left would be opposite, so not allowed. Down to (3,1), up to (3,3).\n> \n> So moves: R to (4,2), D to (3,1), U to (3,3).\n> \n> Now, I need to plan for food.\n> \n> Food goals:\n> \n> - (2,6) is close, at (2,6), life span 7, so plenty of time.\n> \n> - (5,4) at (5,4), life span 4, so need to reach within 4 turns.\n> \n> - (2,4) is under body, life span 10, so can wait.\n> \n> But (2,4) is currently occupied, so we need to move the snake so that the body leaves (2,4), and then head can go there.\n> \n> Currently, (2,4) is occupied by the third segment. When the snake moves, the tail moves, so after 8 moves, the tail would have moved, but since the snake is long, it might take time for that segment to be vacated.\n> \n> The segment at (2,4) will be vacated when the snake has moved enough that the tail passes that point, but since the snake is moving, the position (2,4) might be freed when the body part there moves away.\n> \n> Specifically, in the current position, (2,4) is the body segment at index 2. When the snake moves, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, so the segment at (2,4) will move to where the head was or something? Let's think of the movement.\n> \n> When the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So for the cell (2,4), the segment there will move to the position of index 1, which is (2,3), after the head moves.\n> \n> After one move, say head moves to new position, then the segment that was at index 1 moves to where index 0 was, index 2 moves to where index 1 was, and so on.\n> \n> So for (2,4), which is index 2, after head moves, it will be occupied by the segment that was at index 1, which was (2,3), so (2,4) is now occupied by the segment that came from (2,3), so the cell (2,4) still has a body segment, but it's a different segment. The food is on the cell, not on the segment. So the cell (2,4) is occupied until no segment is there.\n> \n> After the head moves, the segment that was at (2,3) moves to (2,2)? Let's take an example.\n> \n> Initial positions: head (2,2), body (2,3), body (2,4), etc.\n> \n> After move down to (2,1): new head (2,1), then the first body segment is the old head (2,2), then the second body segment is the old first body (2,3), then (2,4), and so on. So the cell (2,4) is still occupied by the body segment that was at (2,4) before? No.\n> \n> Before move: positions: 0: (2,2), 1: (2,3), 2: (2,4), 3: (2,5), ...\n> \n> After move to (2,1): positions: 0: (2,1), 1: (2,2) [old head], 2: (2,3) [old body 1], 3: (2,4) [old body 2], 4: (2,5) [old body 3], etc. So cell (2,4) is now occupied by the segment that was at (2,3), but the cell itself still has a segment. So (2,4) remains occupied until the snake moves such that the tail passes it.\n> \n> Specifically, (2,4) will be freed when the segment that is currently at (2,4) moves away and no other segment moves there immediately, but since the snake is contiguous, when the tail moves off (2,4), it will be free.\n> \n> Currently, (2,4) is occupied by index 2. The tail is at (6,4), index 10.\n> \n> The distance from head to that segment is 2, so when the snake moves, that segment will move after 2 moves, but it doesn't free the cell immediately.\n> \n> The cell (2,4) will be free when the segment that is currently there has moved away, and no new segment occupies it.\n> \n> In this case, since the snake is moving, the cell (2,4) will be free after the tail has passed, but the tail is at (6,4), which is far.\n> \n> The segment at (2,4) will move to (2,3) or something when the head moves, but the cell (2,4) may be reoccupied later.\n> \n> To free (2,4), we need the snake to move so that no segment is at (2,4) for a turn.\n> \n> For example, if the head moves away, and the body follows, eventually when the segment that was at (2,4) moves to a different cell, and the next segment doesn't come to (2,4), but since the snake is linear, it might be occupied continuously.\n> \n> In this configuration, the snake is mostly vertical at (2,y), so (2,4) will be occupied until the snake changes shape.\n> \n> Specifically, after the head moves down to (2,1), positions: head (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), etc., so (2,4) still occupied.\n> \n> If we move right to (3,2), positions: head (3,2), then (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), etc., so (2,4) still occupied.\n> \n> To free (2,4), we need the snake to bend so that the segment leaves (2,4) and moves elsewhere.\n> \n> For instance, if from (3,2), we move up to (3,3), then positions: head (3,3), body (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), etc. (2,4) occupied.\n> \n> Or if we move down to (3,1), similar.\n> \n> Or right to (4,2), then head (4,2), body (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), etc. Still occupied.\n> \n> It seems difficult to free (2,4) quickly because the snake is long and the body is stuck at (2,4) for now.\n> \n> The segment at (2,4) will move when the head has moved twice, but it moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> Let's simulate.\n> \n> Initial: pos: 0:(2,2), 1:(2,3), 2:(2,4), 3:(2,5), ...\n> \n> After one move, say to (3,2): new pos: 0:(3,2), 1:(2,2), 2:(2,3), 3:(2,4), 4:(2,5), ... so index 2 is now at (2,3), which was previously occupied, but cell (2,4) is now at index 3, occupied by old (2,4)? New index 3 is (2,4), which was old index 3? Old index 3 was (2,5), no.\n> \n> After move to (3,2):\n> - New head: (3,2) - new position\n> - New body 1: old head (2,2)\n> - New body 2: old body 1 (2,3)\n> - New body 3: old body 2 (2,4)\n> - New body 4: old body 3 (2,5)\n> - and so on.\n> \n> So cell (2,4) is now occupied by new body 3, which is the old body 2 from (2,4), so it's still occupied.\n> \n> After another move, say from (3,2) move to (4,2): new head (4,2), body: (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), ... so (2,4) still occupied.\n> \n> Only when the head moves in a way that the body at (2,4) moves to a different row or column, but here it's stuck.\n> \n> For example, if from (3,2) we move up to (3,3), then new head (3,3), body: (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), ... same.\n> \n> Or from (2,2) we could have moved down to (2,1), then positions: head (2,1), body: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), ... still.\n> \n> To free (2,4), we need to move the snake so that the segment that was at (2,4) moves to (2,3) or something, but the cell (2,4) is then occupied by the next segment, so it's always occupied until the tail passes.\n> \n> The tail is at (6,4), which is far, so it will take many moves for the tail to reach (2,4), but since the snake is moving, the position (2,4) will be occupied for a long time unless we shorten the snake or move in a way that the body leaves it early, but in a linear snake, it's hard.\n> \n> For instance, if the head moves right to (3,2), then down to (3,1), then left to (2,1), but (2,1) might be occupied or not.\n> \n> Let's not worry about (2,4) food for now, as it has long life span, 10 turns.\n> \n> Focus on other food.\n> \n> Food at (2,6): (2,6) is free, and we can go there.\n> \n> From head (2,2), to reach (2,6), we need to move up, but current direction is down, so we cannot move up directly because it's reverse.\n> \n> From (2,2), possible moves: D to (2,1) or R to (3,2).\n> \n> If we go D to (2,1), we are going away from (2,6).\n> \n> If we go R to (3,2), we can then move up to (3,3), etc., to reach (2,6) but it's not direct.\n> \n> (2,6) is at (2,6), head at (2,2), so same x, different y, but to move up, we need to change direction.\n> \n> Since we cannot move up from (2,2), we have to go around.\n> \n> Food at (5,4) is at (5,4), life span 4, so we need to eat it by turn 43.\n> \n> Turn 40: life span 4, so present at t40,41,42,43, gone at t44.\n> \n> So we have until turn 43 to eat it.\n> \n> Now, head at (2,2), to (5,4): delta x=3, delta y=2, so Manhattan distance 5, but with obstacles, it might be longer.\n> \n> Possible paths.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving right to (3,2) at turn 40.\n> \n> Then from (3,2), we can move right to (4,2), or down to (3,1), or up to (3,3).\n> \n> To reach (5,4), we need to go to (4,2) or something.\n> \n> (5,4) is at x=5,y=4.\n> \n> But there are obstacles: (5,2) wall, (5,5) wall, (4,4) wall, (3,4) wall, so around (5,4) there are walls.\n> \n> Grid around (5,4):\n> \n> - North: (5,5) is wall\n> \n> - South: (5,3) free? (5,3) not listed as wall, so free.\n> \n> - East: (6,4) but (6,4) is tail of snake now? At turn 40, (6,4) is tail, but when snake moves, it changes.\n> \n> - West: (4,4) is wall\n> \n> (4,4) is wall, so (5,4) has west blocked by wall, north blocked by wall at (5,5), south to (5,3) free, east to (6,4) which is currently tail.\n> \n> Also, (5,4) itself is free, no snake, no wall.\n> \n> To reach (5,4), we can come from south (5,3) or east (6,4) or north but (5,5) wall, or west (4,4) wall, so only from south or east.\n> \n> (6,4) is currently tail, but it might move.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) is free.\n> \n> So to eat (5,4), we need to be at (5,3) and move up, or at (6,4) and move left, but (6,4) might not be free when we get there.\n> \n> Now, from current position (2,2), to reach (5,4) in 3 moves (since at turn 40, eat by 43, so moves on 40,41,42 to be at (5,4) on turn 43?

So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and walls are on the borders. Also, internal obstacles at: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). I need to avoid these cells.\n> \n> - Snake positions: Head is at (3,2), and the body segments are: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5).

Life span decreases each turn, so at turn 41, it has 3 turns left, meaning it will vanish after turn 43 if not eaten? Let me clarify the life span.\n> \n> Life span: Disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn including current. So for (5,4), life_span=3 at turn 41. That means:\n> - Turn 41: life_span=3\n> - Turn 42: life_span=2\n> - Turn 43: life_span=1\n> - Turn 44: gone? But it says \"disappears after N turns\", and countdown decreases each turn. Probably, after the turn when life_span becomes 0, it disappears. So for (5,4) at turn 41, life_span=3, it will be there until turn 43, and disappear on turn 44? I think I need to be careful.\n> \n> The input says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So, at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear after (t + L - 1) or something?

But it says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning that it is present for N turns starting from now.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think: at the start of turn t, if food has life_span S, it will be present for S more turns, including the current turn. So after S turns, it vanishes.\n> \n> For example, at turn 41, (5,4) has life_span=3, so it will be present on turns 41, 42, 43, and vanish before turn 44.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) has life_span=6, so present from turn 41 to 46, vanish before 47.\n> \n> (2,4) has life_span=9, present from 41 to 49, vanish before 50.\n> \n> All food have value 1, so all positive food? Value is given as 1, which is positive, since penalty is -1 for negative food, but here all are 1, so all positive food.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (3,2), direction R (right), so last move was right to (3,2) from (2,2)? Positions: [(3,2), (2,2), ...], so head at (3,2), and next segment is (2,2), which is left of head, so since head moved right to (3,2), previous position was (2,2), so direction from (2,2) to (3,2) is right.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (3,2): Since direction is R, I can go U, D, R, but not L because L is opposite, which is instant reverse and not allowed.\n> \n> Current head direction is R, so I cannot move L (left) on the next turn because that would be opposite.\n> \n> Available moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), R (right, x+1), but not L.\n> \n> From (3,2), moving:\n> \n> - U: (3,3)\n> \n> - D: (3,1)\n> \n> - R: (4,2)\n> \n> - L: (2,2) but (2,2) is the body, and it's occupied, but also, L is opposite direction, so not allowed anyway.\n> \n> Now, I need to check if these cells are safe: not wall, not body except tail.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,3) is within 0-7, not border wall.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> So (3,3) is not in obstacles.\n> \n> (3,1): not border, not in obstacles list?

After move, the cell that was pos10 is freed if no growth.\n> \n> The cell (2,4) is currently occupied by the segment. When that segment moves, it leaves the cell free, but only if no new segment comes, but since the snake moves, the segments shift, so the cell is freed when the tail leaves it or when a segment moves from it without another segment coming in.\n> \n> Specifically, for a cell occupied by a segment, after a move, if that segment moves to a new cell, the old cell is free unless another segment moves into it.\n> \n> But in the shift, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> So for example, after one move, the segment that was at pos0 moves to new head, segment that was at pos1 moves to where pos0 was, segment at pos2 moves to where pos1 was, and so on, so the cell where pos10 was is freed.\n> \n> For cell (2,4), which is occupied by pos3, after k moves, it will be occupied by a different segment or freed, depending on the moves.\n> \n> It will be freed when the tail passes that area, which is far away.\n> \n> Since tail is at (6,5), and (2,4) is at (2,4), it will take at least Manhattan distance moves, but with turns, more.\n> \n> For instance, to move tail from (6,5) to (2,4), it's |6-2| + |5-4| = 4+1=5 cells, but since the tail moves only when the head moves and no growth, it takes many moves for the tail to reach (2,4), but actually, the cell (2,4) will be freed when the segment that is now at (2,4) moves away and no segment replaces it immediately, but due to the shift, it will be freed only when the tail comes to that position.\n> \n> The position (2,4) will be occupied until the segment that is now at (2,4) is no longer in the snake, which happens when the tail shortens or something, but since no growth, the tail shortens each move, so the cell that was occupied by the tail is freed each move.\n> \n> But for (2,4), it is not the tail, so it will be freed when the snake has moved enough that the segment at (2,4) has become the tail and then moved away.\n> \n> Currently, pos3 is at (2,4), and there are 7 segments after it (pos4 to pos10), so it will take at least 7 moves for that segment to become the tail, and then on the next move, when the tail moves, (2,4) is freed.\n> \n> After 7 moves, pos3 will be at the position where the tail is now, but let's think.\n> \n> After m moves, the segment that was at position k will be at position k in the list, but the list shifts.\n> \n> After one move: the segment that was pos0 is gone? No, the segments are the same, but their positions change.\n> \n> The snake body segments are fixed; only the positions change.\n> \n> The cell (2,4) is occupied by a particular segment. When that segment moves to a new cell, (2,4) is freed, and the new cell is occupied.\n> \n> But when the segment moves, it may be that another segment moves into (2,4), but in the standard snake movement, when the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the preceding segment, so the cells are vacated except for the new head position.\n> \n> Specifically, for a cell, it is freed when the segment that occupied it moves to a different cell, and no other segment moves into it at the same time.\n> \n> In the shift, for example, when head moves from A to B, segment 1 moves to A, segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, etc., so the cell where the tail was is freed, and other cells may have segments moving in and out.\n> \n> For cell (2,4), currently occupied by segment S.\n> \n> After one move, segment S moves to where the previous segment was, which is (2,3) if head moves, say, right.\n> \n> Then (2,4) is now occupied by the segment that was at (2,5), which moves to (2,4).\n> \n> So (2,4) is still occupied, by a different segment.\n> \n> Similarly, after each move, (2,4) remains occupied until the tail segment reaches that point.\n> \n> The cell (2,4) will be freed when the tail is at that position and then the snake moves, so the tail moves away.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (6,5), so it will take many moves for the tail to reach (2,4).\n> \n> Minimum distance from (6,5) to (2,4) is |6-2| + |5-4| = 4+1=5, but since the snake must move in the grid, it could take more turns.\n> \n> So (2,4) will not be freed soon; it might take 10 or more turns.\n> \n> Since we have other food, I should focus on (2,6) for now.\n> \n> (2,6) is at (2,6), free, and life span 6, so I can eat it within 6 turns.\n> \n> From current position (3,2), how to reach (2,6).\n> \n> (2,6) is at x=2,y=6.\n> \n> Head at (3,2), so I need to go left and up.\n> \n> But directly, from (3,2) I can go L to (2,2), but (2,2) is body, occupied, and also L is opposite direction?

I should list all obstacles to avoid.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,2), then (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). So the snake has 11 segments. Head direction is right, so it's moving east.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (5,4) with life span 2, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (2,6) with life span 5, value +1\n> \n> - (2,4) with life span 8, value +1\n> \n> (2,4) is listed as food, but (2,4) is also part of the snake's body! Snake positions include (2,4). According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Specifically for (2,4): it's occupied by the snake now, so to eat it, the snake must move such that the body leaves (2,4), and then later the head moves to (2,4). But since (2,4) has food with life span 8, it might be possible if we can free that cell.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) is food, not occupied by snake now. (5,4) is food.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan 5+ turns ahead. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid: 8x8, rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7 are walls, so we can't go there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> (1,4) and (1,5) are obstacles, but (1,2) also.\n> \n> List all obstacles:\n> \n> - (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x? No, border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so all edge cells are walls.\n> \n> Plus internal: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> (1,4) and (1,5) are listed, but (1,2) is also.\n> \n> Now snake: head at (4,2), moving right. So from (4,2), it can move to (5,2), but (5,2) is an internal obstacle! Oh, (5,2) is a wall, so it can't move there.\n> \n> Current head position: (4,2), direction right, so it wants to go to (5,2), but (5,2) is an obstacle, so that move is invalid? But the snake must move, so it has to choose another direction.\n> \n> Directions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1)\n> \n> From (4,2):\n> \n> - Right: (5,2) is obstacle, not possible.\n> \n> - Up: (4,3)\n> \n> - Down: (4,1), but y=0 is wall? y=0 is bottom? Let's define coordinates. Typically in grids, (0,0) bottom left, but in programming, often (0,0) top left. Here, it doesn't specify, but since it says U is (x,y+1), I think y increases upwards, so (0,0) bottom left, (7,7) top right? Or top left? The walls are x=0 left, x=7 right, y=0 bottom, y=7 top? I need to confirm.\n> \n> In the wall description: \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" And U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top row. x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> So from (4,2):\n> \n> - Up: (4,3)\n> \n> - Down: (4,1) — now y=1 is not wall, walls are y=0, so (4,1) is empty? But we need to check if it's occupied or obstacle.\n> \n> (4,1): not listed as obstacle, and not snake position? Snake positions are from (4,2) to (6,6), so (4,1) should be free.\n> \n> - Left: (3,2) — but (3,2) is the second segment of the snake, so moving left would cause collision with body.\n> \n> - Right: (5,2) is obstacle, not possible.\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,2) are Up to (4,3) or Down to (4,1).\n> \n> But direction is R, and no instant reverse, so moving left would be opposite, which is not allowed. Current direction is R, so opposite is L. So cannot move L immediately.\n> \n> So from (4,2), with head direction R:\n> \n> - Cannot move L (reverse)\n> \n> - Cannot move R to (5,2) because obstacle\n> \n> - Can move U to (4,3)\n> \n> - Can move D to (4,1)\n> \n> Also, moving to a cell with snake body is deadly, except the tail, but only if it's the current tail position and we can move there because tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, (3,2) is not the tail; tail is at (6,6). So moving to (3,2) would be collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) and (4,1) need to be checked.\n> \n> First, (4,3): is it occupied? Snake positions: let's list all snake cells: (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6)\n> \n> So (4,3) is not in this list, so free? But we have obstacles; internal obstacles include (4,4), but (4,3) is not listed as obstacle. Walls are only borders and those points.\n> \n> (4,3) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1): not snake, not obstacle, so free.\n> \n> So possible actions at turn 42: U or D.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (5,4) with life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, so at turn 44 it will be gone if not eaten. Since current turn 42, life span 2, so it disappears after turn 42 + 2 - 1? Life span decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> Rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span), Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (5,4) with life span 2 at turn 42:\n> \n> - At turn 42, life span 2, decreases to 1 after this turn? Or during the turn?\n> \n> It says \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so when we are at turn t, the life span is the remaining turns.\n> \n> At turn 42, life span is 2, meaning it will disappear after 2 more turns? Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> I think: at the start of turn t, if food has life span L, after the turn, it decreases to L-1. If L-1 >=1, it stays, else it disappears.\n> \n> But it says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning it is present for N turns.\n> \n> For example, if spawned at turn S with life N, it is present from turn S to turn S + N - 1? I need to clarify.\n> \n> The rule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the beginning of turn t, the food has a certain life span. After each turn, including when it is spawned, the life span decreases by 1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> But in the input, it's given with life span at current turn.\n> \n> For (5,4) at turn 42, life span 2, so after turn 42, it decreases to 1, still present. After turn 43, it decreases to 0 and disappears, so not available on turn 44.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 42 + 5 - 1 = 46? Let's not assume, just track.\n> \n> At turn t, life span L:\n> \n> - After turn t, L becomes L-1\n> \n> - If L-1 >0, food still there; if L-1=0, food disappears.\n> \n> So for (5,4): L=2 at turn 42. After turn 42, L=1 (still there). After turn 43, L=0, disappears, so not available on turn 44.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6): L=5 at turn 42, so after turn 42, L=4; ... after turn 46, L=0, disappears before turn 47.\n> \n> (2,4): L=8 at turn 42, so it will last until after turn 42+8-1=49? After turn 49, L=0.\n> \n> But (2,4) is currently occupied by snake body, so we can't eat it now.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves at turn 42: U to (4,3) or D to (4,1).\n> \n> I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> First, let's see the grid layout for reference.\n> \n> List all obstacles:\n> \n> Border walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 cells.\n> \n> Internal: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Now, snake: head (4,2), body (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6)\n> \n> Tail at (6,6).\n> \n> Food: (5,4), (2,6), (2,4) but (2,4) occupied.\n> \n> (2,6) is at row 6, column 2.\n> \n> Since (2,4) is occupied, we can only eat it if we move away and come back later when it's free.\n> \n> But life span is 8, so we have time.\n> \n> Now, short-term: at turn 42, move U or D.\n> \n> If we move U to (4,3), then head at (4,3), direction now U.\n> \n> From there, possible moves: U to (4,4), but (4,4) is an obstacle! Internal obstacle at (4,4).\n> \n> (4,4) is internal obstacle, so cannot go there.\n> \n> D to (4,2), but (4,2) is the current position, but after moving, the snake body will move, so (4,2) will be occupied by the next segment? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> So if head moves to (4,3), then the segment that was at (3,2) moves to (4,2)? Let's see:\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: head (4,2), 1: (3,2), 2: (2,2), 3: (2,3), etc.\n> \n> After move U: head to (4,3), then segment 1 moves to (4,2), segment 2 to (3,2), segment 3 to (2,2), segment 4 to (2,3), and so on, up to tail from (6,6) to (5,6) or whatever.\n> \n> Specifically, the cell (4,2) is now occupied by segment 1, which was (3,2).\n> \n> But for movement, from (4,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (4,4): obstacle, not possible\n> \n> - D to (4,2): now (4,2) is occupied by segment 1, which is body, so moving there would cause collision, deadly.\n> \n> - L to (3,3): need to check if free.\n> \n> (3,3): not in snake positions? Snake has (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,5), etc., not (3,3). Obstacles: (3,4) is obstacle, but (3,3) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> - R to (5,3): not snake, not obstacle? Obstacles: (5,2), (5,5), but (5,3) free? Walls: x=5,y=3 not border, not internal obstacle listed, so free.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (5,5), etc., not (5,3).\n> \n> So from (4,3), after moving there, head at (4,3), direction U.\n> \n> Then possible moves: U not possible (obstacle), D to (4,2) but occupied by body, deadly, so cannot.\n> \n> L to (3,3) or R to (5,3).\n> \n> Both possible, since no instant reverse issue; current direction U, so L and R are perpendicular, not opposite.\n> \n> Opposite of U is D, which is not possible anyway.\n> \n> So from (4,3), can go L or R.\n> \n> If at turn 42 we move D to (4,1), then head at (4,1), direction now D.\n> \n> From (4,1):\n> \n> - U to (4,2): but after moving to (4,1), the body moves, so (4,2) is now occupied by segment 1 (was (3,2)), so moving back to (4,2) would be collision.\n> \n> - D to (4,0): but y=0 is wall, not possible.\n> \n> - L to (3,1): check if free. (3,1): not snake, not obstacle (obstacles include (3,4) but not (3,1)), so free.\n> \n> - R to (5,1): (5,1) not snake, not obstacle? Obstacles: (5,2), (6,1), but (5,1) not listed, so free?

Obstacles: (5,2), (5,5), but (5,3) not listed.\n> \n> Also, borders: x=0,7 y=0,7 walls, so (5,3) is within 1-6, fine.\n> \n> So possible moves: L to (3,3) or R to (5,3). D not possible due to reverse.\n> \n> Now, food considerations.\n> \n> Food at (5,4) with life span 1. If not eaten this turn, it disappears. But to eat it, we need to move to (5,4). From head (4,3), to (5,4) is not adjacent directly? Adjacent cells are (4,4) up, (3,3) left, (5,3) right. (5,4) is diagonally? No, not adjacent. From (4,3), adjacent are (4,4) north, (4,2) south but snake, (3,3) west, (5,3) east. (5,4) is northeast, not adjacent, so we can't reach it directly from here. To get to (5,4), we might need to go via (5,3) or something.\n> \n> But life span 1, so if we don't eat it this turn, it's gone. But we can't eat it this turn because it's not adjacent to head. Head at (4,3), (5,4) is at (5,4), which is one right and one up, so not adjacent; it's diagonal. Only orthogonal moves. So impossible to eat it this turn. Therefore, (5,4) will disappear after this turn, so we can ignore it.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (2,6) life span 4, (2,4) life span 7, but (2,4) is under snake body, position 5, (2,4). (3,5) life span 10, under body position 7.\n> \n> Now, for turn 43, possible actions: L to (3,3) or R to (5,3).\n> \n> I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> First, let's list the free cells and possible paths.\n> \n> Also, tail is at (5,6), which is the end. When snake moves, tail moves, so cells might free up.\n> \n> Current head: (4,3)\n> \n> If move L to (3,3), then head at (3,3), and tail moves from (5,6) to? Snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to previous position, tail is removed or new cell added if eat food.\n> \n> But no food eaten yet.\n> \n> If move to (3,3), snake becomes: head (3,3), then (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) — tail was (5,6), but since no food, tail removed, so new positions: [(3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)] — length 11, tail at (4,6).\n> \n> Similarly, if move R to (5,3), head (5,3), then (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) — tail at (4,6), and (5,6) removed.\n> \n> (5,6) was tail, removed, so (4,6) is new tail? Positions: head new, then previous head, then body... so after move to (5,3): positions: (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) — yes, tail at (4,6).\n> \n> Now, food at (2,6) which is free, and (2,4) under body, (3,5) under body.\n> \n> (2,6) is at (2,6), which is adjacent to current tail? Tail is at (5,6), but after move, depending.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence.\n> \n> First, let's think about immediate risks.\n> \n> After turn 43, the food (5,4) disappears since life span 1 and not eaten.\n> \n> Now, for turn 43, I have two choices: L or R.\n> \n> I should consider which one leads to better options.\n> \n> Also, the head is near the body; for example, if I go left to (3,3), then from there, I can go U, D, L, R, but direction will be from (4,3) to (3,3), so direction L, so cannot go R (right) next turn.\n> \n> Similarly, if go R to (5,3), direction R, cannot go L next.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the food at (2,6). It has life span 4, so available for turns 43,44,45,46; disappears after turn 46 if not eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) under body, life span 7, so longer.\n> \n> (3,5) under body, life span 10.\n> \n> To eat (2,4), which is at (2,4), currently occupied by body segment. When the snake moves, that segment might move away.\n> \n> Similarly for (3,5).\n> \n> Also, there's a danger with tail reward: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But tail moves when we eat, so need to be careful.\n> \n> First, let's simulate possible paths.\n> \n> Option 1: Turn 43, go L to (3,3)\n> \n> Then snake positions: head (3,3), body: (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) tail at (4,6)\n> \n> Direction: from (4,3) to (3,3), so head direction L.\n> \n> Now turn 44, possible moves: from (3,3), can go U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse, reverse would be R (right, back to (4,3)), but (4,3) is now body, and we cannot go to body cell? Movement: we can move to adjacent cells except walls, obstacles, or body except tail if moving into tail is safe when tail moves.\n> \n> Rules: deadly collisions: body collision, head touches any body segment. But we can move into tail cell because tail will move, so it's safe unless eating food there causes growth and collision.\n> \n> Specifically: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But with the tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills because after eating, tail doesn't move, so head and tail collide.\n> \n> Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> So, only if head is adjacent to tail and we eat food on the tail cell.\n> \n> Otherwise, moving to tail cell is safe because tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, after move to (3,3), tail is at (4,6). Head at (3,3), not adjacent to (4,6); (3,3) to (4,6) is not adjacent, distance |dx|+|dy|=1+3=4>1, so not adjacent.\n> \n> From (3,3), possible moves:\n> \n> U: (3,4) but (3,4) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n> \n> D: (3,2) but (3,2) is body segment, position in new snake: after move, positions are (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), ... so (3,2) is the fourth segment, body, so moving to (3,2) would be collision with body.\n> \n> L: (2,3) — (2,3) is body segment, fifth position? Positions: index 0: (3,3), 1: (4,3), 2: (4,2), 3: (3,2), 4: (2,2), 5: (2,3), 6: (2,4), etc. So (2,3) is index 5, body, so moving to (2,3) would collide.\n> \n> R: (4,3) — (4,3) is index 1, body segment, collision.\n> \n> All possible moves from (3,3) are blocked?\n> \n> U: (3,4) obstacle\n> \n> D: (3,2) body\n> \n> L: (2,3) body\n> \n> R: (4,3) body\n> \n> No valid move?

Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (2,6) with life span 4, on turn 44, it has 4 turns left including turn 44. So it will disappear after turn 47, meaning on turn 48 it's gone. Similarly for others.\n> \n> Turn 44: life span decreases to 3? No.\n> \n> If life span is N on a given turn, it decreases every turn, so on turn t when it appears, life span is N, then turn t+1 it becomes N-1, ..., turn t+N-1 it becomes 1, and on turn t+N it disappears. But the description says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, for example, if food spawns at turn t with life span N, on turn t, countdown is N. On turn t+1, countdown is N-1, ..., on turn t+N-1, countdown is 1, and after that turn, it disappears, so not available on turn t+N.\n> \n> In this case, for (2,6) with life span 4 on turn 44:\n> \n> - Turn 44: countdown 4\n> \n> - Turn 45: countdown 3\n> \n> - Turn 46: countdown 2\n> \n> - Turn 47: countdown 1\n> \n> - After turn 47, it disappears, so not on turn 48.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) life span 6: from turn 44 to 49, disappears after turn 49.\n> \n> (3,5) life span 9: from turn 44 to 52, disappears after turn 52.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (5,3), direction right. So from (5,3), moving right would go to (6,3).\n> \n> But let's see the grid layout. Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls, so playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). So these cells are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)\n> \n> (2,4) is occupied by the snake body? (2,4) is the 7th segment, index 6 if head is 0. Positions: index 0: (5,3) head, 1: (4,3), 2: (4,2), 3: (3,2), 4: (2,2), 5: (2,3), 6: (2,4), 7: (2,5), 8: (3,5), 9: (4,5), 10: (4,6) tail.\n> \n> But there is food at (2,4) and (3,5). (2,4) has food, but it's currently occupied by the snake body at index 6. Similarly, (3,5) has food, occupied by index 8.\n> \n> Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n> \n> So for (2,4), since the snake body is on it, to eat it, the body must move away first. Similarly for (3,5).\n> \n> Now, snake head direction is right, at (5,3). Possible moves: since direction is right, I can go U (up), D (down), R (right), but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse? No, instant reverse means opposite direction.\n> \n> Current direction is R (right), so opposite is L (left). I cannot move left on the next turn because it would be instant reverse. But I can move up, down, or right.\n> \n> The rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> So from right, I cannot move left next. But I can move up, down, or continue right.\n> \n> Now, from (5,3), adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (5,4)\n> \n> - Down: (5,2)\n> \n> - Right: (6,3)\n> \n> - Left: (4,3) but left is not allowed because it would be reverse, and also (4,3) is occupied by the snake body? (4,3) is position index 1, which is the neck, but since the snake moves, when the head moves, the body follows, so I can move to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, but (4,3) is not the tail; tail is (4,6).\n> \n> Generally, the head can move to a cell that is not occupied by the body except for the tail cell, because when the head moves, the tail also moves, so if I move to the tail cell, it's ok as long as the tail moves away.\n> \n> But there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (4,6). Is head adjacent to tail? Head (5,3) to tail (4,6): distance |5-4| + |3-6| = 1 + 3 = 4, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n> \n> (5,3) and (4,6) are not adjacent; (4,6) is left and up from (5,3)? (5,3) to (4,6): x diff 1, y diff 3, so not adjacent. Adjacent cells to head are (5,4), (5,2), (6,3), (4,3) but (4,3) is body and also reverse not allowed.\n> \n> First, let's list possible moves from (5,3) with direction R.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, D, R (since L is opposite and not allowed).\n> \n> Now, check each:\n> \n> - U: to (5,4)\n> \n> - D: to (5,2)\n> \n> - R: to (6,3)\n> \n> Now, check if these cells are valid: not wall, not body except tail.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 playable, but internal obstacles.\n> \n> (5,4): is it wall or obstacle? Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). So (5,4) is not in the list, so it should be free? But let's confirm.\n> \n> (5,4) not in obstacles, and not border, so should be free.\n> \n> But is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6). No (5,4), so empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2): is obstacle? (5,2) is in internal obstacles, yes, (5,2) is listed, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> (6,3): not in obstacles, not border? x=6, y=3, borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (6,3) is playable if not obstacle. Obstacles: (6,1) is listed, but (6,3) not, so should be free. Snake positions? No (6,3), so free.\n> \n> (4,3) is body and also reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> So possible moves: U to (5,4), R to (6,3).

It's turn 45, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm: x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are free? Similarly for y.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x. And internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)]\n> \n> So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but borders are walls, and those internal cells are obstacles.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,4), then (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). Head direction is U, meaning up, so from (5,4) it came from below, I assume? Head direction U means it's facing up, so last move was up or something. But for movement, I need to know the current direction to avoid instant reverse.\n> \n> Head direction is given as U, so I can move U, L, R, but not D, because D is opposite to U.\n> \n> Food: three items:\n> \n> 1.

Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life_span is N, it disappears after N turns from now? Let's see: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for (2,6), life_span=3 at turn 45. After turn 45, it decreases to 2. After turn 46, to 1. After turn 47, to 0, so it disappears after turn 47? Or at the start of turn 48?\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the end of each turn, life_span decreases. So at turn 45, before action, life_span is 3. After snake moves, if not eaten, life_span decreases by 1, so after turn 45, it becomes 2.

Food at (2,4) is under the snake's body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,5) is at position 9, which is also a body segment? (3,5) is index 9, body segment.\n> \n> Food positions: (2,6), (2,4), (3,5)\n> \n> But (2,4) and (3,5) are currently occupied by snake body, so they can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves there later.\n> \n> Also, (2,6) is free, I think. Is (2,6) occupied? Snake positions don't have (2,6), so it's free.\n> \n> Now, head at (5,4), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (5,5)\n> \n> - L: to (4,4)\n> \n> - R: to (6,4)\n> \n> But need to check for collisions and walls.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (5,5) is within 1-6? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to 6 are free. Similarly y=1 to 6. But (5,5): x=5, y=5, which is between 1 and 6, so ok.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> (5,5) is an obstacle? Internal obstacles include (5,5). So (5,5) is a wall.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) is an obstacle.\n> \n> So for move U to (5,5): but (5,5) is an obstacle, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Move L to (4,4): (4,4) is also an obstacle, cannot move.\n> \n> Move R to (6,4): is (6,4) a wall or obstacle? Borders: x=6 is not border, since x=7 is wall, x=6 is free. Internal obstacles: (6,1) is one, but (6,4) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> But is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: head (5,4), body (5,3), etc. (6,4) not in list, so free.\n> \n> Also, not a wall, so move R to (6,4) is possible.\n> \n> But only one possible move? U to (5,5) is obstacle, L to (4,4) is obstacle, so only R to (6,4) is possible? But what about D? D is down, to (5,3), but (5,3) is the body segment, index 1, which is the neck, I think.\n> \n> Collision: if head moves to a body segment, it dies, except for the tail, because tail will move.\n> \n> The rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a body segment that is not the tail is deadly.\n> \n> Here, (5,3) is the segment right after head, so if head moves down to (5,3), it would collide with itself immediately.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,5), index 10.\n> \n> So (5,3) is not tail, it's the second segment, so moving to (5,3) would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, other body segments.\n> \n> So possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (5,5) - but (5,5) is obstacle, invalid.\n> \n> - L: to (4,4) - obstacle, invalid.\n> \n> - D: to (5,3) - body segment, collision, invalid.\n> \n> - R: to (6,4) - not wall, not obstacle, not body, so valid.\n> \n> So only possible move is R to (6,4).\n> \n> But that seems too constrained. Let me double-check.\n> \n> Head at (5,4), direction U.\n> \n> After moving R, direction changes to R.\n> \n> Then next turn, from (6,4), possible moves U, D, R? Not L, since L would be opposite to R.\n> \n> But for now, turn 45, only one choice: R to (6,4).\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Snake positions: (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)\n> \n> Now, from (5,4):\n> \n> - Up: (5,5) - internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n> \n> - Down: (5,3) - occupied by snake body, not tail, collision.\n> \n> - Left: (4,4) - internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n> \n> - Right: (6,4) - no wall, no obstacle, no snake, so yes.\n> \n> So indeed, only move is R to (6,4) for turn 45.\n> \n> Now, after that, head at (6,4), direction now R (since moved right).\n> \n> Snake moves: head to (6,4), then body segments follow: the previous head (5,4) becomes body, so new positions: head (6,4), then (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), and tail (4,5) moves? When snake moves, the tail moves away.\n> \n> Snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail segment is removed if no food eaten, or if food eaten, tail stays and snake grows.\n> \n> But in this move, no food eaten, since (6,4) has no food.\n> \n> Food is at (2,6), (2,4), (3,5) – none at (6,4).\n> \n> So after moving to (6,4), new snake positions: head (6,4), then body: (5,4) [previous head], (5,3) [previous index 1], (4,3) [index 2], (4,2) [3], (3,2) [4], (2,2) [5], (2,3) [6], (2,4) [7], (2,5) [8], (3,5) [9], and the tail (4,5) is no longer part, since it moves away?

Then the body segments shift: segment 1 moves to where head was (5,4), segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was (5,3), segment 3 to (4,3), and so on, down to segment 10 moves to where segment 9 was (3,5). And the previous tail (4,5) is left, so it's no longer occupied.\n> \n> New positions: head: (6,4)\n> \n> Then: (5,4) [previous head]\n> \n> Then: (5,3) [previous index 1]\n> \n> Then: (4,3) [previous index 2]\n> \n> Then: (4,2) [previous index 3]\n> \n> Then: (3,2) [previous index 4]\n> \n> Then: (2,2) [previous index 5]\n> \n> Then: (2,3) [previous index 6]\n> \n> Then: (2,4) [previous index 7]\n> \n> Then: (2,5) [previous index 8]\n> \n> Then: (3,5) [previous index 9]\n> \n> And index 10 was (4,5), which is not part now; the tail is now at (3,5).\n> \n> Snake length was 11 segments, after move without eating, length still 11, tail moves to (3,5).\n> \n> Positions: new head (6,4), then (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5) tail.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> Now, food: (2,6) life was 3 at turn 45, after turn 45, it decreases to 2.\n> \n> (2,4) was under body, but after move, body at (2,4) has moved? In new positions, (2,4) is still occupied, by index 8 above, which is (2,4) in new list? New positions: indices after move: 0: (6,4), 1: (5,4), 2: (5,3), 3: (4,3), 4: (4,2), 5: (3,2), 6: (2,2), 7: (2,3), 8: (2,4), 9: (2,5), 10: (3,5)\n> \n> So (2,4) is still occupied by segment 8.\n> \n> Food at (2,4) is still under body.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5) is now the tail, segment 10.\n> \n> Food at (3,5) is under the tail.\n> \n> (2,6) is free.\n> \n> Now turn 46, head at (6,4), direction R (since last move was right).\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, R.

After turn 45, life decreased to 2, so available for turns 46 and 47? Life span: at turn 46, before action, life is 2, after move decreases to 1 if not eaten, etc.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) life was 5, after turn 45 decreased to 4, available.\n> \n> (3,5) life was 8, decreased to 7.\n> \n> Now, the food under body: (2,4) and (3,5) can be eaten only if body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> For (2,4): it is currently occupied by segment 8.

It's turn 46, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0/x=7 and y=0/y=7, so coordinates go from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls include the borders and internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (6,4), then body segments: (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5). So the snake has 11 segments.

Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 46, life span 2 means it will be gone after turn 47? Let me clarify the life span.\n> \n> Life span: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So for food at (2,6) with life span 2 at turn 46, it will be available on turn 46 and 47, and disappear after turn 47, so not available on turn 48.\n> \n> Similarly:\n> \n> - (2,6): value 1, life span 2 (available turn 46,47)\n> \n> - (2,4): value 1, life span 4 (available turn 46,47,48,49)\n> \n> - (3,5): value 1, life span 7 (available for 7 turns from 46)\n> \n> - (6,4): value 1, life span 10 (available for 10 turns)\n> \n> But (6,4) is where the snake head is currently? Snake head is at (6,4), and there's food at (6,4). But according to the rules, if food is under the snake body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it. But here, the head is already on it? That might be a special case.\n> \n> Let me read the rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2.

The rule says \"the head moves onto the food cell,\" which implies that the head wasn't there before. But here, at the start, head is on the food.\n> \n> I think I need to interpret this. Probably, when the state is given, the food is present, but the snake hasn't eaten it yet this turn. So on this turn, if the head is on food, it might be eaten, but according to the rule, for food under body, it requires body to move away first.\n> \n> But for the head position, since the head is moving, if it starts on food, it might be eaten immediately or not?

Is this valid? y=5, x=6. Walls: borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (6,5) is not border. Internal obstacles: (6,1) is wall, but (6,5) is not listed, so it should be free. Snake body: positions are (6,4) head, (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5). So (6,5) is not occupied by body, so moving U to (6,5) is possible.\n> \n> - D: to (6,3).

No.\n> \n> Standard: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell (which it is on), so it consumes the food, and the snake grows, meaning that the tail does not advance on this turn. So the body segments remain, and the tail position is unchanged, so the new length is old length +1, with the tail cell now part of the body, and the new tail is the same as before.\n> \n> Positions: before eating, snake has N segments: S0, S1, S2, ..., S_{N-1} where S0 head, S_{N-1} tail.\n> \n> After eating at S0, the head is at S0, and the tail S_{N-1} does not move, so the snake becomes S0, S1, S2, ..., S_{N-1}, with S_{N-1} as the new tail? No, the tail is still S_{N-1}, but since it didn't move, the segment is added between head and body, but in terms of positions, it's like the body is extended at the tail end.\n> \n> Typically, in Snake, when you eat, the head moves to the new cell, eats food, and the tail does not move, so the snake gains a new segment at the tail position, so the tail cell remains for this turn, and next turn when you move, the tail moves.\n> \n> For example, if tail was at T, after eating, tail is still at T, and when you move next, the tail leaves T.\n> \n> In this case, for turn 46, before action, head at (6,4) with food, so it is eaten. Snake grows to 12 segments. Positions: the head is at (6,4), body segments from (5,4) to (3,5), and since tail didn't move, the tail is still at (3,5), but now there is an additional segment, so the positions are: (6,4) head, then (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), and (3,5) is repeated? No.\n> \n> List of positions: before eating, 11 positions: index 0: (6,4) head, 1: (5,4), 2: (5,3), 3: (4,3), 4: (4,2), 5: (3,2), 6: (2,2), 7: (2,3), 8: (2,4), 9: (2,5), 10: (3,5) tail.\n> \n> After eating at (6,4), the head is at (6,4), and the tail does not move, so the new positions are: head (6,4), then the body: (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), and since tail didn't move, (3,5) is still the tail, but now there are 11 positions, but length should be 12? I think I have a off-by-one.\n> \n> Standard: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and the body follows, but the tail segment is not removed, so the snake gains one segment. So the new set of positions is: the new head position (the food cell), then the previous head position, then the previous body positions, and the previous tail position is still there.\n> \n> So before move: positions P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk where P0 head, Pk tail.\n> \n> After moving to a new cell with food: new head at Q, then P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk, so k+2 positions, length increased by 1.\n> \n> But in this case, for the start of turn, the head is already on food without moving.\n> \n> For this state, at the beginning of turn 46, the head is at (6,4) with food, so we can assume that the food is eaten at the start, so the snake grows: positions become (6,4) head, then the previous positions from (5,4) to (3,5), so 11 positions but with (6,4) and (5,4) to (3,5), that's 11 positions, but since we ate, it should be 12 positions: the head (6,4), then the previous head (5,4) as first body, then (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), and the previous tail (3,5) is still there, but (3,5) is the same as before, so positions: (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5) – that's 11 positions, but it should be 12.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> When the snake is not eating, it moves: head to new position, each body segment to the previous position of the one ahead, tail leaves its position.\n> \n> When eating, head moves to new position, body follows, but tail does not leave, so the position that was tail remains occupied, and a new segment is added there.\n> \n> So for example, before move, positions: H, B1, B2, ..., T.\n> \n> If move to new cell with food: new head at NH, then positions: NH, H, B1, B2, ..., T, so length increases by 1, with T still there.\n> \n> If move without food, new head at NH, then positions: NH, H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, and T is removed.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 46 start, head is at (6,4) with food, so it is as if it just moved there and ate, so the positions should be: head (6,4), then previous head (5,4), then (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), and the previous tail (3,5) is still there, but (3,5) is listed twice? No, the positions are (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), and (3,5) as tail. That's 11 positions, but before it was 11, after eating it should be 12.\n> \n> Positions before: 11 positions.\n> \n> After eating at head position: the head is at (6,4), and the body includes all previous positions, so (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5) – that's 11, but (3,5) is the tail, and it was the tail before, so no change in number, but length should increase.\n> \n> I think I have it: when you eat, the tail position is not removed, so the number of segments increases.\n> \n> Before: segments: H, B1, B2, ..., B9, T (11 segments, indices 0 to 10)\n> \n> After eating at H: new segments: new head at H (same position), then B1, B2, ..., B9, T, but T is still there, so positions: H, B1, B2, ..., B9, T – still 11, but it should be 12 with the new head and the tail not moving.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think that after eating, the snake has the same positions, but the tail doesn't move, so for the next move, when you move the head, the tail stays, so the new position after move will have the head moved, and the tail added.\n> \n> For this turn, since head is on food at start, we don't move the head for eating; it's already eaten.\n> \n> So for turn 46, the food at (6,4) is eaten at the start, so snake length becomes 12, with positions unchanged for now, and when we choose to move, we move the head from (6,4) to a new position, and since we ate, the tail does not move, so after move, the positions will be: new head position, then (6,4), then (5,4), (5,3), ..., up to (3,5), and (3,5) remains as part of the body, with the new tail still at (3,5)? Let's not overcomplicate.\n> \n> I think for practical purposes, at turn 46, food at (6,4) is eaten, so we gain +1 score, length increases to 12, and the tail position (3,5) will not move this turn when we move the head.\n> \n> Then, we choose action for turn 46: move U, D, or R, but R to (7,4) is wall, so only U or D.\n> \n> Similarly, after moving, if we move to a cell with food, we eat it.\n> \n> But for now, at (6,4), food is eaten, so it should be removed from the food list.\n> \n> But in the state, it's listed, but after eating, it's gone.\n> \n> For the action, we need to choose where to move.\n> \n> Also, for other food, like (2,4) on body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves there later.\n> \n> Similarly for (3,5) on tail.\n> \n> But for (3,5), it's the tail, and there's food, so if the tail moves away, the food is exposed, and head can move to it.\n> \n> But with the growth, it might be different.\n> \n> Let's first handle turn 46.\n> \n> Assume that at start of turn 46, food at (6,4) is eaten because head is on it.

It's turn 47. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). So, I should sketch a grid to visualize this.\n> \n> The grid is 8x8 since x from 0 to 7 and y from 0 to 7. Let me list the obstacles:\n> \n> - Borders: all cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> - Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,5), then body: (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). So the snake is 11 segments long.\n> \n> Head direction is Up, so it's moving towards increasing y, I assume? Let me confirm the coordinate system. Typically, in such grids, (0,0) is bottom-left, but it might not be specified. But since head is at (6,5) and moving Up, and previous position is (6,4), so Up means increasing y, so (x,y+1) is up. Similarly, Down would be (x,y-1), Left (x-1,y), Right (x+1,y). Yes, as per the movement constraints.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1, life span 1\n> \n> - (2,4) with value 3, life span 1? Wait, the format is (x,y, life_span, value)? No, let's see: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (2,6,1,1) - (2,4,3,1) - (3,5,6,1) - (6,4,9,1)\"\n> \n> It says: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) but in the list, it's written as (2,6,1,1) which might be (x,y,value,life_span) or (x,y,life_span,value)? I think there's inconsistency.\n> \n> Look: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\" then it says \"- (2,6,1,1)\" – probably (x,y,value,life_span) or (x,y,life_span,value)? The header says \"Value and Life Span\" but in the list, it's written with four numbers.\n> \n> Check the state: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (2,6,1,1) - (2,4,3,1) - (3,5,6,1) - (6,4,9,1)\"\n> \n> But in the core rules, it says: \"( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" so for (2,6,1,1), it should be x=2,y=6, value=1, life_span=1? But it says \"value and life span\" in the state, but the tuple has four elements.\n> \n> Perhaps it's (x,y, value, life_span). Let me assume that.\n> \n> For (2,6,1,1): x=2,y=6, value=1, life_span=1\n> \n> (2,4,3,1): x=2,y=4, value=3, life_span=1? value=3, life_span=1\n> \n> But life_span=1 means it disappears after this turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life_span is 1, it will disappear after this turn 47, meaning if not eaten on turn 47, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5,6,1): x=3,y=5, value=6, life_span=1? No, (3,5,6,1) – value=6, life_span=1? But life_span=1 for all except last?\n> \n> List:\n> \n> - (2,6,1,1) : probably x=2,y=6, value=1, life_span=1\n> \n> - (2,4,3,1) : x=2,y=4, value=3, life_span=1\n> \n> - (3,5,6,1) : x=3,y=5, value=6, life_span=1\n> \n> - (6,4,9,1) : x=6,y=4, value=9, life_span=1\n> \n> All have life_span=1? But (6,4,9,1) has value=9, but life_span=1.\n> \n> But y=4 is occupied by the snake body at (6,4), which is the second segment.\n> \n> Also, (2,4) has food with value=3, but (2,4) is occupied by the snake body, as per positions: snake has (2,4) as part of the body.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)]\n> \n> So (2,4) is the 10th segment, I think? Indices: head (0): (6,5), (1): (6,4), (2): (5,4), (3): (5,3), (4): (4,3), (5): (4,2), (6): (3,2), (7): (2,2), (8): (2,3), (9): (2,4), (10): (2,5)\n> \n> So (2,4) is segment 9, and (2,5) is segment 10, tail? Tail is the last one, (2,5).\n> \n> Food at (2,4) is under the snake body. Similarly, food at (6,4) is at segment (1), (6,4).\n> \n> Also, food at (2,6), (3,5), and (6,4).\n> \n> Now, life span: all have life_span=1, meaning they disappear after this turn if not eaten. Since life span decreases every turn including current, and if life_span=1, after turn 47, it will be gone. So to eat them, we must move to that cell on this turn, turn 47.\n> \n> But the snake head is at (6,5), and we're choosing action for turn 47.\n> \n> Current head position: (6,5), direction Up.\n> \n> Possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right, but with constraints.\n> \n> First, cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is Up, so opposite is Down, so cannot move Down next? No, the rule is: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> For turn 47, we can choose any direction except the opposite of current, which is Down? Current direction is Up, so opposite is Down, so we cannot move Down on turn 47 if current direction is Up.\n> \n> Let me read: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n> \n> So for turn 47, current direction is Up, so we cannot choose Down for turn 47. We can choose Up, Left, or Right.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid to avoid walls and body collisions.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> (4,4) is an obstacle, (5,2), etc.\n> \n> Snake body: all positions except the head and tail can be collided with, but moving into tail is ok if tail moves away.\n> \n> Now, for turn 47, head at (6,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: (6,5+1) = (6,6). Is this valid? y=6, not border, y=7 is border, so (6,6) is within bounds? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so (6,6) is not wall, but is it obstacle? Internal obstacles: (6,1) is one, but (6,6) not listed, so should be free. But snake body: is (6,6) occupied? Snake positions: (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), etc., no (6,6), so (6,6) is empty. So Up to (6,6) is possible.\n> \n> - Left: (6-1,5) = (5,5). (5,5) is an internal obstacle! Listed: (5,5) is wall. Also, in snake positions? (5,5) not in list, but obstacle, so cannot move there. Wall collision.\n> \n> - Right: (6+1,5) = (7,5). But x=7 is border wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> - Down: (6,5-1) = (6,4). But (6,4) is occupied by snake body, segment (1). And since it's not the tail, it would be body collision. But tail is at (2,5), so (6,4) is body, not tail. So moving to (6,4) would collide with body.\n> \n> Down is also opposite direction, which is not allowed anyway.\n> \n> So possible moves for turn 47: only Up to (6,6), since Left and Right are walls, Down is invalid due to reverse and body.\n> \n> Down is invalid because reverse move and also body there.\n> \n> Left to (5,5) is wall, Right to (7,5) is wall.\n> \n> So only possible move is Up to (6,6).\n> \n> Is that right? (6,6) is free? Let me confirm coordinates.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> (6,6) not in obstacles, not border, not occupied by snake (snake at (6,5), (6,4), etc., but (6,6) free).\n> \n> So yes, only possible move is Up to (6,6).\n> \n> But we need to think multiple turns ahead, as per instruction.\n> \n> First, on turn 47, we must move Up, no choice.\n> \n> Then, after moving to (6,6), what next?\n> \n> Also, food: all food has life_span=1, so if not eaten on turn 47, they disappear. Since we're moving to (6,6), not eating any food this turn, so all food disappears after turn 47.\n> \n> Food positions: (2,6), (2,4), (3,5), (6,4)\n> \n> (6,4) is under snake body, and we're not moving there, so it can't be eaten now. Similarly, (2,4) under body, not accessible. (2,6) and (3,5) are free, but we're at (6,5), moving to (6,6), not to them, so we can't eat them this turn. Since life_span=1, they vanish after this turn.\n> \n> So no food eaten on turn 47.\n> \n> Now, after turn 47, snake moves: head to (6,6), body follows, so tail at (2,5) moves to (2,4)? Let's see the new positions.\n> \n> Current positions: head (6,5), body (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n> \n> After move Up: head to (6,6), then each segment moves to the previous position, so new positions: head (6,6), then (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) — and tail was (2,5), which is now gone? Tail moves to where segment 9 was, which is (2,4).\n> \n> List: old positions: index 0: (6,5), 1: (6,4), 2: (5,4), 3: (5,3), 4: (4,3), 5: (4,2), 6: (3,2), 7: (2,2), 8: (2,3), 9: (2,4), 10: (2,5)\n> \n> After head moves to (6,6), new positions: head (6,6), then segment 1 becomes (6,5), segment 2 becomes (6,4), segment 3 becomes (5,4), ..., up to segment 10 becomes (2,4), and segment 11 would be, but no, the tail is the last, so positions: [ (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) ] — 11 segments, tail at (2,4).\n> \n> Old tail (2,5) is left, so (2,4) is now the tail.\n> \n> Now, on turn 48, head at (6,6), direction was Up, but after moving, the new direction depends on the move. Since we moved Up, the new head direction is Up.\n> \n> We need to choose next move for turn 48.\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,6): U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> Current direction is Up (since we just moved Up).\n> \n> Cannot move Down (opposite).\n> \n> Now, check cells:\n> \n> - Up: (6,7) — but y=7 is border wall, cannot.\n> \n> - Down: (6,5) — but (6,5) is now occupied by body segment (1), which is not tail.

Old positions after turn 47: [ (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) ]\n> \n> After moving Left to (5,6): head to (5,6), then segment 1 to (6,6), segment 2 to (6,5), ..., segment 10 to (2,3), segment 11 to (2,4)?

No.\n> \n> After move, the body follows: the segment that was at index i moves to index i-1 position.\n> \n> After turn 47, positions: let's list indices for clarity.\n> \n> After turn 47 (before turn 48 move): snake: [ (6,6) head, (6,5) seg1, (6,4) seg2, (5,4) seg3, (5,3) seg4, (4,3) seg5, (4,2) seg6, (3,2) seg7, (2,2) seg8, (2,3) seg9, (2,4) seg10 tail ]\n> \n> On turn 48, move Left to (5,6).\n> \n> New head: (5,6)\n> \n> Then new body: seg1: previous head position (6,6)?

It's turn 48. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,6), then (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). So the snake has 11 segments. Head direction is Up, meaning it moved to (6,6) from below, so previous position was (6,5), which matches the second segment.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (2,4) with value 1 and life span 3. Since it's turn 48, this food will disappear after 3 turns, so by turn 51.\n> \n> - (3,5) with value 1 and life span 5, disappears after 5 turns, by turn 53.\n> \n> - (6,4) with value 1 and life span 8, disappears after 8 turns, by turn 56.\n> \n> All food has value +1, so they're all positive food.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 48. Actions are U, D, L, R, and I must avoid instant reverse. Since head direction is U, I cannot move Down on the next turn.\n> \n> Also, I need to think about collisions. Walls are at borders and internal obstacles. Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. So playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? But internal obstacles are given, so cells like (1,2) are obstacles, meaning not all border cells are walls, but the borders are specified as walls.\n> \n> The walls are: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1).\n> \n> So the grid size: since x=0 and x=7 are walls, x from 1 to 6 is playable except obstacles. Similarly y from 1 to 6 playable except obstacles.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to 6 should be playable, but internal obstacles might be at those points.\n> \n> List all wall cells:\n> \n> - All cells with x=0 or x=7 for any y\n> \n> - All cells with y=0 or y=7 for any x\n> \n> - Plus internal: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) are at x=1, but since y=0 and y=7 are walls, y=1 to 6 are within bounds. Similarly, (6,1) is at y=1.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (6,6). Since head direction is U, it came from (6,5), so moving up.\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,6): U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But U: (6,7) — y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> D: (6,5) — but (6,5) is the second segment of the snake. However, since the snake moves, when the head moves, the tail moves too, so moving to the current tail position might be safe if the tail moves away.\n> \n> Collision rules: head touches any body segment except that it can move to the tail cell because the tail will move forward.\n> \n> Specifically: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So from (6,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (6,7) — y=7 is border wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - D: (6,5) — currently occupied by the second segment. But since the tail will move, if I move down to (6,5), and the tail is at (2,4), which will move, but let's see the snake positions.\n> \n> Snake: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)]\n> \n> Head at (6,6), then (6,5), (6,4), etc., tail at (2,4).\n> \n> If I move down to (6,5), that is where the second segment is now. After the move, the head will be at (6,5), and since the snake moves, the segment that was at (6,5) will move to where the head was? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if head moves from (6,6) to (6,5), then:\n> \n> - New head: (6,5)\n> \n> - The segment that was at (6,5) moves to (6,6)? But (6,6) is where head was, but now head is moving to (6,5), so the body moves.\n> \n> Let's index the segments: S0 = head (6,6), S1 = (6,5), S2 = (6,4), S3 = (5,4), ..., S10 = tail (2,4).\n> \n> If I move head to (6,5), then:\n> \n> - New head position: (6,5)\n> \n> - S1 moves to S0's old position: (6,6)\n> \n> - S2 moves to S1's old position: (6,5) but (6,5) is now the head, so S2 moves to (6,5)? No.\n> \n> Positions after move:\n> \n> - Head moves to new cell, here (6,5)\n> \n> - Then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So after moving head to (6,5):\n> \n> - New positions: head at (6,5)\n> \n> - Then S1 (which was at (6,5)) moves to where head was, (6,6)\n> \n> - S2 (was (6,4)) moves to where S1 was, (6,5) but (6,5) is now occupied by head? Conflict.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard: when snake moves, the head occupies a new cell, and the tail is removed if no food eaten, or if food eaten, tail stays and snake grows.\n> \n> But in terms of positions:\n> \n> - If no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment shifts forward, so the tail segment is removed.\n> \n> - If food eaten, head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail doesn't move, snake grows.\n> \n> But for collision, when moving to a cell, if that cell is occupied by a body segment, it might be a collision except if it's the tail and we're not eating food there or something.\n> \n> The rules say: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So for moving to tail cell: if head moves to the current tail position, and no food there, then after move, the tail moves away, so it's safe. If there is food, it might be eaten, but for collision, it's ok because tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, from (6,6), moving D to (6,5): (6,5) is occupied by S1, not the tail. Tail is at (2,4), far away.\n> \n> (6,5) is S1, which is a body segment, not tail. So moving to (6,5) would be head touching body, collision, death.\n> \n> The rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell occupied by a non-tail body segment causes collision. Moving to tail cell is safe because tail moves.\n> \n> Here, (6,5) is not the tail; it's S1, the second segment. Tail is (2,4). So moving to (6,5) should cause collision because it's a body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (6,4) is S2, body segment, collision.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (6,6):\n> \n> - U: (6,7) — y=7 wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (6,5) — occupied by S1, body segment, collision\n> \n> - L: (5,6) — is this free?

It's turn 49, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates go from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are given: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). These are cells I cannot move into.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head at (5,6), then body segments: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3). So the snake is 11 segments long.\n> \n> Head direction is Left (L), meaning it just moved left to (5,6) from (6,6), I assume. Since positions are given with head first, and it was at (6,6) before moving to (5,6).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (2,4) with value 1, life span 2 (so disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 49, life span 2 means it will disappear after turn 50? Let me clarify.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if life span is L at turn t, it will be gone after turn t + L - 1? For example, at turn t, life span L, after turn t, it becomes L-1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears. So it can be eaten on the turn when life span is 1, but not after that.\n> \n> Standard: if life span is N at turn t, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N.\n> \n> In the input, it says \"life_span\" for each food. For (2,4): life_span=2 at turn 49. So it can be eaten on turn 49 or 50, and disappears after turn 50.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5): life_span=4 at turn 49, so can be eaten on turns 49,50,51,52.\n> \n> (6,4): life_span=7, turns 49 to 55.\n> \n> (4,6): life_span=10, turns 49 to 58.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (5,6), direction left. Possible moves: since head direction is L, I can move L (left), U (up), D (down), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So current direction is L, so I cannot move R. Allowed moves: L, U, D.\n> \n> Now, grid size 8x8, walls at borders and obstacles.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> Rows y=0 to 7, bottom to top? Usually in such coordinates, y=0 might be bottom or top? The movement: U is (x,y+1), so y increases up, I think. So y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> So head at (5,6). Let's list all cells:\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x. But since it's grid, cells outside are walls, but we can only move to (1,1) to (6,6)? x and y from 0 to 7, so cells (0,0) to (7,7), but borders are walls, so snake can be on (1,1) to (6,6)? No, walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning those coordinates are occupied by walls, so snake can be on cells where 1<=x<=6 and 1<=y<=6? Let's see the borders.\n> \n> It says \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1).\n> \n> So playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except where obstacles are.\n> \n> x and y both from 0 to 7, but walls at min and max, so cells with x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are playable, minus obstacles.\n> \n> But obstacles include (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), which are on x=1, so those cells are blocked.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) on x=6, y=1.\n> \n> Now snake positions: head (5,6), body: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3).\n> \n> Food: (2,4), (3,5), (6,4), (4,6)\n> \n> (6,4) is also a body segment? Snake has (6,4) as the fourth segment, counting from head: index 0: (5,6), 1: (6,6), 2: (6,5), 3: (6,4), so (6,4) is occupied by body, but food is at (6,4)? That can't be right.\n> \n> Food positions: (2,4), (3,5), (6,4), (4,6)\n> \n> But (6,4) is a snake body position. Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for (6,4), there is food, but it's currently under the snake body. So to eat it, the snake must move so that body leaves (6,4), and then head moves to (6,4) when it's free.\n> \n> But currently, at turn 49, the snake is on (6,4), so food is there but not accessible yet.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (2,4) is free, (3,5) free, (4,6) free.\n> \n> (4,6) is at y=6, which is one below top, since y=7 is wall.\n> \n> Now, head at (5,6), direction left.\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,6):\n> \n> - Left (L): to (4,6)\n> \n> - Up (U): to (5,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Down (D): to (5,5)\n> \n> - Right (R): but current direction is L, so cannot move R, instant reverse.\n> \n> So only possible moves: L to (4,6) or D to (5,5)\n> \n> (4,6) has food!

So (4,6) is not in the list, so it's free, except there is food.\n> \n> Moving to (4,6) would eat the food, since head moves to food cell.\n> \n> Rule: eating positive food increases length by 1, so snake grows.\n> \n> But also, need to check for Tail Reward Danger.\n> \n> Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, tail grows and collides with head.\n> \n> First, where is the tail? Snake positions: head (5,6), tail is (2,3), I think. Positions list: indices 0 to 10, so tail is (2,3).\n> \n> After moving, if no food eaten, tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail might be free, but if food is eaten, tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n> \n> But in this case, for (4,6), if I move there and eat food, the snake grows, so the tail stays at (2,3).\n> \n> Now, is head adjacent to tail? After move, head at (4,6), tail at (2,3). Distance: |4-2|=2, |6-3|=3, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so horizontal or vertical neighbor.\n> \n> (4,6) and (2,3) are not adjacent.

I should list all walls: borders and these points.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,6), then (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3). So the snake has 12 segments. Head direction is L, meaning left, so last move was to the left, from (5,6) to (4,6), I think. Positions are given head first, so at turn 50, head is at (4,6), previous was (5,6), and so on.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (2,4) with value 1, life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten)\n> \n> - (3,5) with value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (6,4) with value 1, life span 6\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid. I'll make a small grid representation to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1) – that's all.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (4,6), body: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)\n> \n> Tail is at (2,3).\n> \n> Head direction is L, so it's moving left. From (5,6) to (4,6).\n> \n> Now, possible moves from head position (4,6):\n> \n> - Up (U): (4,7) – but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Down (D): (4,5) – is this free? Let's see.\n> \n> (4,5): not in snake positions? Snake is at (4,6), (5,6), etc. (4,5) is not listed, so should be free, but check for walls.\n> \n> x=4,y=5: not border wall, not in internal obstacles list. Internal obstacles are (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1). (4,4) is an obstacle, but (4,5) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, Left (L): (3,6) – x=3,y=6. Not border, not in obstacles, and not in snake positions? Snake has (4,3), (3,2), etc., but not (3,6). So should be free.\n> \n> But head direction is L, and we can't do instant reverse. Reverse would be Right, since current direction is L.\n> \n> Current head direction is L, meaning last move was left, so we cannot move right (opposite) on this turn.\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,6):\n> \n> - U: (4,7) – y=7 is border wall, invalid.\n> \n> - D: (4,5) – seems free.\n> \n> - L: (3,6) – seems free.\n> \n> - R: (5,6) – but (5,6) is the first body segment. Also, reverse is not allowed since current direction is L, so R is opposite, cannot move R.\n> \n> Cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is L, so cannot move R.\n> \n> So only possible: D or L.\n> \n> D: (4,5) or L: (3,6)\n> \n> Now, food positions: (2,4), (3,5), (6,4)\n> \n> (6,4) is also a snake position? Snake positions include (6,4), which is the 5th segment? Let's list snake: index 0: head (4,6), 1: (5,6), 2: (6,6), 3: (6,5), 4: (6,4), 5: (5,4), etc.\n> \n> (6,4) is occupied by the snake body, but there is food at (6,4) with life span 6.\n> \n> Food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods: (2,4) and (3,5) are not on snake, I think.\n> \n> (2,4): not in snake positions, snake has (2,2), (2,3), but not (2,4). Similarly (3,5): not in snake positions.\n> \n> (3,5) is free, I think.\n> \n> Now, life spans: food at (2,4) has life span 1, so if not eaten this turn, it disappears. Turn 50, life span 1, so after turn 50, it disappears, meaning it can be eaten only on turn 50.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, if life span is L, it can be eaten on turns from t to t+L-1? Let's see the rule.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life span N, it appears at turn t and will disappear after N turns, so it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1? Example: if life span 1 at turn 50, it can be eaten only on turn 50, and disappears after turn 50.\n> \n> Similarly, life span 3 at turn 50, can be eaten on turns 50, 51, 52, disappears after turn 52.\n> \n> In the input, it's given as (x,y, value, life_span), and life_span is the remaining life at current turn.\n> \n> For (2,4): life_span=1, so it can be eaten only on turn 50 or it's gone.\n> \n> (3,5): life_span=3, so can be eaten on turn 50,51,52.\n> \n> (6,4): life_span=6, can be eaten on turn 50 to 55.\n> \n> But (6,4) is currently occupied by snake body segment 4: (6,4). So to eat it, the snake must move so that the body moves away from (6,4), and then head moves to (6,4) later.\n> \n> Similarly, for other foods.\n> \n> Now, back to possible actions at turn 50.\n> \n> From head (4,6), possible moves: D to (4,5) or L to (3,6)\n> \n> If I move D to (4,5):\n> \n> - Then head to (4,5), body follows: tail moves, so snake becomes: head (4,5), then (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), etc. Tail (2,3) moves to (2,2) or something, but the segment that was tail moves forward.\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it. Tail segment leaves its position.\n> \n> So after moving D to (4,5):\n> \n> New positions: head (4,5), then previous head (4,6) becomes neck, then (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), and tail (2,3) is left, so the new tail is (2,2)? Let's list:\n> \n> Old positions: 0:(4,6), 1:(5,6), 2:(6,6), 3:(6,5), 4:(6,4), 5:(5,4), 6:(5,3), 7:(4,3), 8:(4,2), 9:(3,2), 10:(2,2), 11:(2,3)  // 12 segments, indices 0 to 11.\n> \n> After move D: head moves to (4,5), so new position 0: (4,5)\n> \n> Then segment 1: old position 0 (4,6)\n> \n> Segment 2: old position 1 (5,6)\n> \n> Segment 3: old position 2 (6,6)\n> \n> Segment 4: old position 3 (6,5)\n> \n> Segment 5: old position 4 (6,4)\n> \n> Segment 6: old position 5 (5,4)\n> \n> Segment 7: old position 6 (5,3)\n> \n> Segment 8: old position 7 (4,3)\n> \n> Segment 9: old position 8 (4,2)\n> \n> Segment 10: old position 9 (3,2)\n> \n> Segment 11: old position 10 (2,2)  // tail was old 11 (2,3), but since body moves, segment 11 becomes old position 10 (2,2), and the cell (2,3) is vacated.\n> \n> Similarly, if move L to (3,6): new head (3,6), then (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), etc., down to (2,2) as new tail position 11.\n> \n> Now, food at (2,4) can be eaten only this turn, turn 50.\n> \n> To eat it, head must move to (2,4) on this turn.\n> \n> But head is at (4,6), and (2,4) is not adjacent; it's two cells away.\n> \n> From (4,6) to (2,4) is not possible in one move; adjacent cells are U,D,L,R.\n> \n> (2,4) is at (x=2,y=4), head at (4,6), so not adjacent. Cannot reach it this turn. Therefore, food at (2,4) will disappear after this turn and cannot be eaten. So we should forget about it.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,5) can be eaten on turn 50,51,52.\n> \n> (3,5) is at x=3,y=5.\n> \n> From head (4,6), if I move D to (4,5), then head is at (4,5), which is adjacent to (3,5)? (4,5) to (3,5) is left, so if next turn I move L, I can go to (3,5).\n> \n> Similarly, if I move L to (3,6) first, then from (3,6) I can move D to (3,5) next turn.\n> \n> (3,6) to (3,5) is down.\n> \n> Now, food at (6,4) is under snake body, currently occupied. To eat it, we need the body to move away and head to move there later.\n> \n> (6,4) is segment 4 in the snake, which is not the tail; tail is (2,3). When the snake moves, the segment at (6,4) will move to the next position.\n> \n> Let's see the path: after move, segment 4 was at (6,4), but after any move, it will move to where segment 3 was, which is (6,5) for segment 4? In the list, old segment 3 is (6,5), after move, segment 4 becomes old segment 3's position, but it's messy.\n> \n> Better to think of the snake moving: when head moves, the tail end moves forward, so the cell that was occupied by the tail is vacated, and other cells shift.\n> \n> Specifically for (6,4): it is currently occupied by segment index 4. After one move, this segment will move to the position of old segment 3, which is (6,5) if no eating, but since no eating, length same, so segment 4 moves to (6,5), and (6,4) is vacated? No.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list. So the cell that was occupied by the last segment (tail) is vacated.\n> \n> For cell (6,4), it is occupied by segment 4. After move, segment 4 will be at the position that was previously segment 3, which is (6,5). Similarly, segment 3 moves to where segment 2 was, etc.\n> \n> So after one move, the cell (6,4) is no longer occupied, because segment 4 has moved to (6,5), and no other segment is there yet.\n> \n> Then (6,4) becomes free, and since there is food there, it can be eaten if head moves to it.\n> \n> But head is at (4,6), which is not adjacent to (6,4). (4,6) to (6,4) is diagonal, not adjacent; adjacent are (4,5), (3,6), etc.\n> \n> Distance: |dx|=2, |dy|=2, not adjacent.\n> \n> So from (4,6), I can move to (4,5) or (3,6). From there, I might reach (6,4) in multiple moves.\n> \n> But (6,4) has life span 6, so we have time.\n> \n> Now, back to turn 50 action.\n> \n> Options: move D to (4,5) or L to (3,6)\n> \n> If I move D to (4,5):\n> \n> - Head at (4,5)\n> \n> - Then I can move to (3,5) to eat food there, but (3,5) has life span 3, can be eaten later.\n> \n> - Or move to other places.\n> \n> If I move L to (3,6):\n> \n> - Head at (3,6)\n> \n> - Then I can move D to (3,5) to eat food, or to other places.\n> \n> Food at (3,5) is close.\n> \n> Also, I need to think about survival and avoiding dead ends.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> I'll make a text grid for y from 7 to 0, x from 0 to 7.\n> \n> y=7: border wall, all cells x=0 to 7, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Similarly y=0, x=0, x=7 walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Also, snake positions: head (4,6), body (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)\n> \n> (2,3) is tail.\n> \n> Now, let's list free cells or something.\n> \n> First, for turn 50, move to (4,5) or (3,6).\n> \n> Now, food at (3,5) is at distance 1 from both (4,5) and (3,6).\n> \n> From (4,5), (3,5) is left.\n> \n> From (3,6), (3,5) is down.\n> \n> Also, after moving, the head direction will be set to the move direction.\n> \n> Current direction is L.\n> \n> If I move D, new direction is D.\n> \n> If I move L, new direction is L.\n> \n> Then next turn, I cannot move opposite to that.\n> \n> Also, need to check if moving to (4,5) or (3,6) is safe.\n> \n> (4,5): is it wall? No, border walls are at edges, (4,5) is inside, not in obstacle list.\n> \n> Similarly (3,6) not wall.\n> \n> Now, after moving there, what about body collision? When moving to a cell, if that cell is occupied by body, it's collision, except if it's the tail and we move into it, since tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (4,5): is (4,5) occupied by snake? Snake positions: (4,6), (5,6), etc., no (4,5), so free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) not occupied, free.\n> \n> So both moves are safe for now.\n> \n> But let's think ahead.\n> \n> If I move D to (4,5) on turn 50:\n> \n> - New head at (4,5), direction D.\n> \n> - Then on turn 51, from (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6) but (4,6) is now the neck, occupied by body?

Let's list positions:\n> \n> Index: 0: (3,6) head\n> \n> 1: (4,6)\n> \n> 2: (5,6)\n> \n> 3: (6,6)\n> \n> 4: (6,5)\n> \n> 5: (6,4)\n> \n> 6: (5,4)\n> \n> 7: (5,3)\n> \n> 8: (4,3)\n> \n> 9: (4,2)\n> \n> 10: (3,2)\n> \n> 11: (2,2) tail\n> \n> So (6,4) is position index 5, which is a body segment.\n> \n> Food at (6,4) has value 1 and life span 5. But since the snake is on it, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,5) is not occupied, I think. (3,5) is not in snake positions, so it's free.\n> \n> Now, life spans: food at (3,5) has life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\"\n> \n> So at turn 51, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 53? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, it disappears after turn t + N - 1? Or after N turns from now.\n> \n> The rule: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, after this turn, it becomes L-1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears at the end of that turn or something. I need to be careful.\n> \n> Typically, if countdown decreases every turn including current, then at turn t with life span L, after turn t, it becomes L-1; if L=1, it disappears after turn t.\n> \n> Standard way: at the start of turn t, if food has life span L, it will be present during turn t, and at the end of turn t, life span decreases to L-1. If after decrease it becomes 0, it disappears before next turn.\n> \n> But for movement, during turn t, if head moves to food cell, it is eaten.\n> \n> The rule doesn't specify when it disappears, but it says \"disappears after N turns\", and countdown includes current turn.\n> \n> I think it's safer to assume that if life span is L at turn t, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., up to t+L-1, and disappears after turn t+L-1.\n> \n> For example, life span 3 at turn 51: present on turn 51, 52, 53; disappears after turn 53, so not on turn 54.\n> \n> Similarly, life span 5 at turn 51: present on turns 51 to 55.\n> \n> Now, food at (3,5): life span 3 at turn 51, so must be eaten by turn 53.\n> \n> Food at (6,4): life span 5, so by turn 55.\n> \n> But (6,4) is currently occupied by snake body, so it can only be eaten if the snake moves away and head comes later.\n> \n> Now, head direction is L, so from (3,6), possible moves: since direction is L, I can move L (left), U (up), D (down), but not R (right) because reverse is not allowed? No instant reverse rule: cannot move opposite to current direction.\n> \n> Current direction is L, so opposite is R. So cannot move right on next turn.\n> \n> Possible moves: L, U, D.\n> \n> Now, let's see what cells are around head (3,6):\n> \n> - Left: (2,6) - is this free? x=2,y=6\n> \n> Check walls: borders are walls, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. (2,6) is not border, since x=2>0, y=6<7? y=7 is border, y=6 is not border.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=6 is not border.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). None at (2,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,6), body at (4,6), etc. (2,6) not in positions, so free? But let's list all positions to confirm.\n> \n> Snake: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)\n> \n> So (2,6) is not occupied by snake or wall, so should be free.\n> \n> But is it accessible? From (3,6) moving left to (2,6) should be possible.\n> \n> - Up: (3,7) - but y=7 is border wall, so cannot move up, because it's a wall.\n> \n> y=7 is top border, so (3,7) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Down: (3,5) - this is where the food is. (3,5) has food, and it's not occupied by snake, as per positions.\n> \n> Is (3,5) in snake positions? Snake has (3,6), (3,2), but not (3,5). So yes, free cell with food.\n> \n> - Right: (4,6) - but this is the first body segment, and moving right would be opposite to current direction L, so cannot move right anyway.\n> \n> Possible moves: Left to (2,6), Down to (3,5), or Up but Up is wall, so only Left or Down.\n> \n> Up is (3,7) which is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> So only two choices: Left to (2,6) or Down to (3,5).\n> \n> If I move down to (3,5), I eat the food there, since it's positive food. Value +1, length increases by 1.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> Food at (3,5) has only 3 turns life, so if I don't eat it now, it might disappear soon.\n> \n> But I can eat it now by moving down.\n> \n> Moving down to (3,5) seems safe? After moving, head to (3,5), then the body follows: the tail was at (2,2), so after move, new head at (3,5), and the body moves: the segment that was at (4,6) moves to (3,6), but since head moved to (3,5), the body will shift.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So after moving down to (3,5):\n> \n> - New head: (3,5)\n> \n> - Then body: position 1: (3,6) [was head]\n> \n> Position 2: (4,6) [was pos1]\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Up to tail: (2,2) moves to where? The last body segment was (2,2), and it will move to the position of the previous last segment, which is (3,2)? Let's index.\n> \n> After move: new positions:\n> \n> - Head: (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 1: old head (3,6)\n> \n> - Segment 2: old seg1 (4,6)\n> \n> - Segment 3: old seg2 (5,6)\n> \n> - Segment 4: old seg3 (6,6)\n> \n> - Segment 5: old seg4 (6,5)\n> \n> - Segment 6: old seg5 (6,4)\n> \n> - Segment 7: old seg6 (5,4)\n> \n> - Segment 8: old seg7 (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 9: old seg8 (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 10: old seg9 (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 11: old seg10 (3,2)\n> \n> - And since we ate food, we add a new segment at the tail, so tail becomes old seg11 position? No.\n> \n> When eating food, the snake grows, so after moving, the tail stays where it is, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the snake gets longer.\n> \n> Specifically: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the next segment closer to head, but since we eat food, we don't remove the tail segment; instead, we keep the tail and add a new segment at the end.\n> \n> Standard: when no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> When food eaten, head moves to food, body segments move, but tail does not vacate; instead, the snake grows by one, so the tail position remains, and a new segment is added there effectively.\n> \n> More precisely: after moving to food, the snake length increases, so the positions: head at new cell, then the previous positions from head to one before tail remain, and tail stays, so new tail is the old tail.\n> \n> For example, current snake: positions S0, S1, S2, ..., S11 (11 segments? Indices from 0 to 11, 12 segments.\n> \n> S0: (3,6), S1: (4,6), S2: (5,6), S3: (6,6), S4: (6,5), S5: (6,4), S6: (5,4), S7: (5,3), S8: (4,3), S9: (4,2), S10: (3,2), S11: (2,2)\n> \n> After moving down to (3,5) and eating food:\n> \n> - New head: (3,5)\n> \n> - New segment 1: S0 = (3,6)\n> \n> - New segment 2: S1 = (4,6)\n> \n> - New segment 3: S2 = (5,6)\n> \n> - New segment 4: S3 = (6,6)\n> \n> - New segment 5: S4 = (6,5)\n> \n> - New segment 6: S5 = (6,4)\n> \n> - New segment 7: S6 = (5,4)\n> \n> - New segment 8: S7 = (5,3)\n> \n> - New segment 9: S8 = (4,3)\n> \n> - New segment 10: S9 = (4,2)\n> \n> - New segment 11: S10 = (3,2)\n> \n> - New segment 12: S11 = (2,2)  // since we ate food, tail doesn't move, and we add a new segment at old tail position? No.\n> \n> When eating food, the snake grows by one segment. So the new snake has the same body positions, but the tail stays, and head moves to new position.\n> \n> So positions:\n> \n> - Head: new position (3,5)\n> \n> - Then the first body segment is the old head position (3,6)\n> \n> - Then old S1 (4,6)\n> \n> - ... up to old S10 (3,2)\n> \n> - And since we ate food, we add a new segment at the position of old tail, which is (2,2), so new tail at (2,2)\n> \n> But (2,2) was the tail, now it becomes the second last, and new tail is added at (2,2)? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> I think I have it wrong.\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> When moving to food, head moves to food, each body segment moves to the previous position, but since food is eaten, the tail does not move; it stays, so the snake length increases by one.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after eating, the new positions are:\n> \n> - Head at food cell\n> \n> - Then the old head position\n> \n> - Then the old position of segment 1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Up to the old position of segment k for some k\n> \n> - And the tail position remains the same.\n> \n> For example, current segments: 0: head, 1,2,3,...,11: tail.\n> \n> After moving and eating:\n> \n> - New segment 0: (3,5)  // new head\n> \n> - New segment 1: old seg0 = (3,6)\n> \n> - New segment 2: old seg1 = (4,6)\n> \n> - New segment 3: old seg2 = (5,6)\n> \n> - New segment 4: old seg3 = (6,6)\n> \n> - New segment 5: old seg4 = (6,5)\n> \n> - New segment 6: old seg5 = (6,4)\n> \n> - New segment 7: old seg6 = (5,4)\n> \n> - New segment 8: old seg7 = (5,3)\n> \n> - New segment 9: old seg8 = (4,3)\n> \n> - New segment 10: old seg9 = (4,2)\n> \n> - New segment 11: old seg10 = (3,2)\n> \n> - New segment 12: old seg11 = (2,2)  // this is the new tail, but since we ate, the old tail position is not vacated, so the new snake has segments at (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) — that's 13 segments, with head at (3,5) and tail at (2,2).\n> \n> The position (2,2) is still occupied, and it was the tail, now it's the new tail.\n> \n> In the body, (2,2) is still there.\n> \n> But in this case, when we move, the cell (3,5) was free, so no problem.\n> \n> But after eating, the snake is longer.\n> \n> Now, back to choices: at turn 51, I can move left to (2,6) or down to (3,5).\n> \n> If I move down to (3,5), I eat the food, get +1 score, snake length 13.\n> \n> Then head at (3,5), direction down.\n> \n> From there, possible moves: since I moved down, current direction is D.\n> \n> Then next turn, I can move D (down), L (left), R (right), but not U (up) because reverse.\n> \n> (3,5) down would be (3,4), left (2,5), right (4,5), up (3,6) but reverse not allowed.\n> \n> (3,4): is it free?

It's turn 52. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). So, I should visualize the grid to avoid these cells.\n> \n> The grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), I assume, since borders are at x=0,7 and y=0,7. So it's an 8x8 grid.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,5), then body segments: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2). So the tail is at (2,2).\n> \n> Snake head direction is D, which is down. Since it's moving down, from (3,5) to... wait, positions show head at (3,5), then (3,6) which is above? Let's list the positions in order:\n> \n> Head: (3,5)\n> \n> Next: (3,6) — that's y=6, which is above y=5? Coordinates: I need to be careful. Typically, in grids, y increases upwards or downwards? The movement definitions: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). So if U increases y, that means y increases upwards, like in Cartesian coordinates.\n> \n> But in the snake positions, head is at (3,5), and next segment is (3,6). Since U is (x,y+1), that means moving up increases y, so (3,6) is above (3,5). But the head direction is D, down. Down is (x,y-1), so decreasing y.\n> \n> Current head at (3,5), direction D (down). But the previous position must be (3,6) since positions are head first, so from (3,6) to (3,5) is down, which is consistent with direction D.\n> \n> Positions: [(3,5), (3,6), ...] so head at (3,5), which was just entered from (3,6) by moving down to (3,5). Next segments: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2). So the snake is going down to (3,5), then up to (3,6)? No, the positions are listed from head to tail, so the head is at (3,5), and the body follows. So at the previous turn, head was at (3,6), and it moved down to (3,5), so now the body segment that was at (3,6) is still there, but when the snake moves, the tail will move away.\n> \n> I should think about the current state after the move to (3,5).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (6,4) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> Both are positive food, since value is 1, and it says \"Positive Food\" with value +1.\n> \n> The food is given as (x,y, life_span, value), but in the input it's written as (6,4,4,1) and (1,1,10,1), so I think it's (x,y, life_span, value).\n> \n> Similarly, for (1,1,10,1).\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for (6,4), life span 4, meaning it will disappear after 4 more turns, including turn 52? Countdown decreases on turn 52.\n> \n> Let's read: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So on turn 52, for food at (6,4), life span is 4, so after 4 turns, it will be gone. That means it will disappear at the end of turn 55? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, on turn 52, it has life span 4, so after turn 52, it will have 3 left, after turn 53, 2 left, after turn 54, 1 left, after turn 55, 0, so it disappears at the start of turn 56 or something? I need to define.\n> \n> Typically, \"disappears after N turns\" might mean it lasts for N turns starting from now.\n> \n> But to be precise: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so on the turn it is present, countdown decreases.\n> \n> For example, if life span is N at turn t, it will be present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappear at turn t+N.\n> \n> On turn t, countdown is N, decreases to N-1 at end of turn or something? But for planning, I need to know when it will be gone.\n> \n> Since countdown decreases each turn, including current, that means on turn t with life span L, after turn t, L becomes L-1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for (6,4) at turn 52, life span 4, so:\n> \n> - Turn 52: present, after turn, life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 53: present, after turn, life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 54: present, after turn, life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 55: present, after turn, life span 0 → disappears, so not available on turn 56.\n> \n> Similarly, for (1,1), life span 10, so it will last until turn 52+10-1 = 61? Turn 52: life 10, after turn 52: 9, ..., after turn 61: life 0, disappear on turn 62.\n> \n> At turn 52, life span 10, so after 10 turns, it will be gone. On turn 52, it has 10 turns left including current, so it will be present for 10 more turns: turns 52 to 61 inclusive, disappear at turn 62.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (3,5), direction down.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is down, I can move L, R, or D, but not U because that would be instant reverse.

the food at (1,1) with life span 9, so we might be able to eat it later if we approach carefully, but since it's cornered, it's hard.\n> \n> Perhaps we can eat it when the tail is not adjacent or something, but after eating, we are at (1,1) with direction constraint, so same problem.\n> \n> Unless we eat it and immediately have a move, but as above, no.\n> \n> So probably, it's better to avoid this food and focus on survival until new food spawns or something, but the game may have food spawning, but in this state, only these foods are given, no mention of new food, so we have to deal with current.\n> \n> The state has only these two foods, so we should use them if possible.\n> \n> But (1,1) is risky.\n> \n> Another idea: perhaps we can eat the food but at a time when we can move away, but in this case, we can't.\n> \n> Or, the tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating kills.\n> \n> But here, when we eat at (1,1), tail is elsewhere, not adjacent, so no issue, the problem is the move after eating.\n> \n> So we need to have an escape route.\n> \n> But at (1,1), no escape.\n> \n> Therefore, for long-term survival, we should not eat this food and go to open space.\n> \n> So for turn 53, move D to (2,4)\n> \n> Turn 54, move D to (2,3)\n> \n> Then turn 55, instead of down, move R to (3,3)\n> \n> Then from (3,3), we can move D to (3,2) or R to

few moves.\n> \n> But to maximize score, we should eat if possible, but here it's not safe.\n> \n> Perhaps there is a way to eat the food at (6,4) but we thought impossible, but let's double-check.\n> \n> Food at (6,4) life span 3, turn 53.\n> \n> If we can move the snake such that (6,4) is freed soon, but with 13 segments, it takes many turns to move the tail there.\n> \n> For example, tail at (3,2), distance to (6,4) is |3-6| + |2-4| = 3+2=5, so at least 5 moves to free, but life span only 3, so by turn 56 it disappears, turn 53,54,55 it exists, but on turn 55, countdown 1, still there, but we need to free it by then.\n> \n> But to free (6,4), we need the tail to pass that area, but tail is at (3,2), and (6,4) is occupied, so we need to move the head so that the body moves away.\n> \n> After k moves without eating, the cell that was at position i will be at position i-k or something, but since the snake moves, the segment at (6,4) will move when the head moves.\n> \n> For example, after one move, the segment at (6,4) moves to where the previous segment was, which is (6,5) if head moves, etc.\n> \n> But to free the cell (6,4), we need no segment to be there after the move.\n> \n> Currently, segment at (6,4) is there.\n> \n> After one move, if head moves, that segment moves to another cell, and the cell (6,4) might be occupied by the next segment or not.\n> \n> In the shift, when head moves, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the cell that was occupied by a segment may be freed only if it was the tail position and not eaten.\n> \n> For (6,4), it is occupied by a body segment, not tail, so after a move, the segment moves away, but the cell may be occupied by the segment that was behind it if it moves there, but since the segments shift forward, the cell (6,4) will be occupied by the segment that was at (5,4) or something.\n> \n> In general, for a body segment not tail, the cell it occupies will be occupied by another segment after the move, unless it is the last body segment before tail and tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically, in the list, the segment at position k will move to position k-1 after head moves.\n> \n> Cell occupied by position k is freed only if k is the tail and we don't eat.\n> \n> Here, (6,4) is position 7 in initial list, not tail, so after move, position 7 moves to where position 6 was, so cell (6,4) is now occupied by position 8 moving to it or something.\n> \n> It's messy, but essentially, the cell (6,4) will remain occupied until the tail passes that point, which requires many moves.\n> \n> For example, the tail is at (3,2), and (6,4) is at index 7, so we need to move at least 6 times without eating to free that cell, but 6 > 3, impossible.\n> \n> So cannot eat (6,4).\n> \n> Therefore, only option is to avoid both foods or eat (1,1) with risk, but we saw it causes death.\n> \n> So for survival, we should avoid (1,1) and move to the center or open area.\n> \n> For example, from (2,3), move to (3,3), then to (4,3), etc.\n> \n> (4,3) might be occupied later.\n> \n> Let's define a sequence for 5 turns.\n> \n> Turn 53: move D to (2,4)\n> \n> Turn 54: move D to

The chosen sequence avoids the dangerous food at (1,1) due to its inescapable position after eating, which would lead to immediate death on the next turn, and instead prioritizes moving toward open space (e.g., via (3,3) and (3,2)) for long-term survival while ignoring the inaccessible food at (6,4) given its short lifespan and occupied state. This ensures the snake remains safe and positions it for potential future opportunities.\n",

So the head is at (2,4) and the tail is at (4,2). Snake length is 13 segments.\n> \n> Head direction is down (D), meaning last move was down, so from (2,5) to (2,4)? Let's see the positions: snake positions are listed as [(2,4), (2,5), ...]. Since head is first, (2,4) is head, then (2,5) is the next segment. But if head direction is D, down, that means it moved down to (2,4). Moving down decreases y, so from (2,5) to (2,4) is down, yes. So current head position is (2,4) facing down.\n> \n> Food: There are two food items:\n> \n> - (6,4) with value 1 and life span 2\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1 and life span 8\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span: for (6,4), life span 2 means it disappears after 2 more turns, including current turn. So on turn 54, life span 2; after turn 54, it will have life span 1; after turn 55, it disappears, so it can be eaten only on turn 54 or 55.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) has life span 8, so it will be there for 8 more turns, from turn 54 to 61 inclusive? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, it can be eaten on turns from t to t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N.\n> \n> So for (6,4): life span 2 at turn 54, so can be eaten on turn 54 or 55, disappears at turn 56.\n> \n> For (1,1): life span 8 at turn 54, can be eaten from turn 54 to 61, disappears at turn 62.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, but since food has limited life, I should consider that.\n> \n> Also, movement constraints: I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse.

It's turn 55. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). I should list all obstacles to avoid.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,3), then body segments: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3). Head direction is down (D), which means moving towards decreasing y, so from (2,3) moving to (2,2) or something, but let's see.\n> \n> Head is at (2,3), direction D, so last move was down, meaning it came from (2,4) to (2,3)? No: snake positions are given with head first: [(2,3), (2,4), ...]. If head is at (2,3) and direction is D, that means it's facing down, so the next position should be south, like (2,2) if it moves down.\n> \n> But in the list, (2,3) is head, then (2,4) is the first body segment. So if head is at (2,3) and moving down, it was previously at (2,4), I think. Direction indicates the current heading.\n> \n> Perhaps I should think of the snake's movement. From the positions: head (2,3), then neck (2,4), so the head is at (2,3) and the body is above it at (2,4), meaning it just moved down to (2,3) from (2,4). But direction is given as D, which is consistent with moving down to (2,3).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (6,4) with value 1, life_span 1\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life_span 7\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1, life_span 10\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all are positive food.

So at turn 55, life_span=1, it will disappear after turn 55? Let's read the rule.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (6,4) with life_span=1 on turn 55. After turn 55, the countdown decreases to 0, so it disappears after this turn. Meaning, if not eaten on turn 55, it will be gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) with life_span=7, so it has 7 turns left including turn 55.\n> \n> (4,3) with life_span=10.\n> \n> But (4,3) is also a snake position?

So (4,3) is the last segment, the tail.\n> \n> Now, food at (4,3) is present, but it's under the snake's body. Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1.

(4,3) is not there, so it should be empty except for the food.\n> \n> But (4,3) has food, and head is at (3,3) with direction R, so moving right to (4,3) would eat the food immediately on this turn if I choose to go right.\n> \n> But I need to think about risks.\n> \n> First, possible moves from current position (3,3):\n> \n> - Up: to (3,4)\n> \n> - Down: to (3,2)\n> \n> - Left: to (2,3)\n> \n> - Right: to (4,3)\n> \n> But snake head direction is R, so I cannot move left (opposite direction) on this turn because of no instant reverse rule.

Snake positions: (3,4) not listed. Obstacles: internal obstacles include (3,4)? Look: obstacles are (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). Yes, (3,4) is an obstacle! So I cannot move up to (3,4).\n> \n> - Down: to (3,2)\n> \n> (3,2): is it wall? x=3,y=2, within 1-6. Obstacles: (5,2) is obstacle, but (3,2) not listed. Snake positions: no (3,2). So should be free? But let's confirm.\n> \n> Walls: borders are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (3,2) is inside.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2) is one, but (3,2) not mentioned, so probably free.\n> \n> But is it occupied? Snake: positions from (3,3) down to (5,3), etc. (3,2) not in list, so free.\n> \n> - Left: to (2,3)\n> \n> But (2,3) is occupied by the snake body, segment index 1. Also, cannot move opposite to current direction (R to L is opposite), so invalid.\n> \n> - Right: to (4,3)\n> \n> (4,3) has food, and is it free? Snake positions: no (4,3). Obstacles: (4,4) is obstacle, but (4,3) not listed. So should be free.\n> \n> (4,3) is a food cell, so moving there would eat the food.\n> \n> But I need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> First, possible moves from (3,3):\n> \n> - Up: blocked by obstacle at (3,4)\n> \n> - Down: to (3,2), possible\n> \n> - Left: invalid, body and opposite direction\n> \n> - Right: to (4,3), with food\n> \n> So only two choices: down or right.\n> \n> If I go right to (4,3), I eat the food. Value +1, snake length increases by 1.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, there's a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (5,3). Head is at (3,3), so not adjacent to tail. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (3,3) and (5,3) are not adjacent; they are two cells apart diagonally or something. (3,3) to (5,3) is distance 2 in x, same y, so not adjacent. Adjacent would be like (4,3) or (3,4) or (3,2) or (2,3). (2,3) is body, not tail.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,3), head at (3,3), so positions: (3,3), (2,3), ... to (5,3). Distance: from (3,3) to (5,3) is two steps right, so not adjacent. Adjacent cells to head: (3,4) up, but obstacle; (3,2) down; (2,3) left, body; (4,3) right, food.\n> \n> Tail at (5,3) is not adjacent to head.\n> \n> So no issue with tail reward danger here.\n> \n> If I eat the food at (4,3), snake head moves to (4,3), and since it's positive food, length increases, so the tail doesn't move this turn. Normally, when snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to previous position, tail is removed. But when eating, tail stays, so new segment added.\n> \n> After eating, positions: new head at (4,3), then the previous head (3,3) becomes second segment, and so on, down to tail at (5,3) still there, and since length increased, tail doesn't move, so (5,3) remains, and a new segment is added where the food was, but since head is moving to (4,3), which was food, so new segment is effectively added at the tail end later? I need to think carefully.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when no eat, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> When eat, head moves to food cell, but tail does not move, so the segment that was tail stays, and a new segment is added at the position where tail was, but since tail didn't move, it's like the snake grows by one at the tail.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after moving without eat, positions shift: new head, then old head, then next, etc., tail position removed.\n> \n> With eat: new head at food, old head becomes new second, and so on, down to old tail stays, and since tail didn't move, the cell is occupied, and length increases.\n> \n> In this case, if I move right to (4,3) and eat food, new positions: head at (4,3), then previous head (3,3) now second, then (2,3) third, (2,4) fourth, and so on, up to the old tail (5,3) is now the 13th segment, and since we ate, we add a new segment at the old tail position? No.\n> \n> When you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the last segment stays. So positions: new head (4,3), then the rest: (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), and tail (5,3) remains. So now snake has 14 segments: from (4,3) to (5,3), with (5,3) still tail.\n> \n> Old tail was (5,3), and it stays, so now it's part of the body, and the new tail is the segment that was second last? Let's index.\n> \n> Before move: positions: idx 0: (3,3) head, 1: (2,3), 2: (2,4), 3: (2,5), 4: (3,5), 5: (3,6), 6: (4,6), 7: (5,6), 8: (6,6), 9: (6,5), 10: (6,4), 11: (5,4), 12: (5,3) tail.\n> \n> After move right to (4,3) and eat: new head at (4,3). The body: segment 1 (old head) becomes new segment 1 at (3,3), segment 2 at (2,3), ..., segment 12 at (5,4), and segment 13 at (5,3) (old tail). But since we ate, we add a new segment, so the tail stays at (5,3), and a new segment is added, but where? The new segment is added at the position where the tail was, which is (5,3), but (5,3) is already occupied by the tail, so it stays, and the snake grows.\n> \n> In terms of positions list: after move, head at (4,3), then the previous positions from idx 0 to 12 are now the body, but idx 0 is now (3,3), idx1 (2,3), ..., up to idx12 (5,3). Since we ate, we keep the tail, so the positions become: [ (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3) ] — so 14 positions, with tail at (5,3).\n> \n> (5,3) was tail, and it remains tail? No, after growth, the segment that was tail is now the second last, and the new tail is the same position? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard: when snake eats, it grows by one cell at the tail end. So when moving, the head moves to the new cell (food), the body follows, and the tail does not move, so the cell that was tail is still occupied, and a new segment is added there. But the tail segment itself doesn't move, so the positions: the new head is at the food cell, the old head is now connected, and the old tail position has the tail segment, but since it didn't move, it's like the tail stayed and a new segment is added behind? No.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think: the snake moves forward, head to new position, each segment to previous position of the one ahead. If no eat, tail position vacated. If eat, tail position not vacated, so the segment that was at tail stays, and the new head is added, so length increases by one.\n> \n> In position list: for move without eat: new head at new pos, then pos[0], pos[1], ..., pos[n-1] but since tail is removed, it's from new head to pos[n-2] or something.\n> \n> Easier: positions before move: [P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk] with P0 head, Pk tail.\n> \n> After move to new cell C:\n> \n> - If no eat, new positions: [C, P0, P1, ..., P{k-1}] so tail is P{k-1}\n> \n> - If eat, new positions: [C, P0, P1, ..., Pk] so tail is Pk\n> \n> In both cases, when moving, the head goes to C, then P0 becomes the neck, etc.\n> \n> In eat case, Pk is kept, so tail is still Pk.\n> \n> In no eat, Pk is dropped, tail is P{k-1}.\n> \n> In this case, before move, positions: 13 segments, P0=(3,3), P1=(2,3), P2=(2,4), ..., P12=(5,3)\n> \n> If I move to (4,3) and eat, since (4,3) has food, new positions: head at (4,3), then P0=(3,3), P1=(2,3), P2=(2,4), ..., P12=(5,3) all kept, so 14 segments, head (4,3), tail (5,3)\n> \n> If I don't eat, say move down to (3,2), no food, so new positions: head at (3,2), then P0=(3,3), P1=(2,3), P2=(2,4), ..., P11=(5,4), and P12=(5,3) is dropped, so tail is P11=(5,4)\n> \n> Back to decision.\n> \n> At turn 56, from (3,3), I can move down to (3,2) or right to (4,3) to eat food.\n> \n> If I go right to (4,3), I eat food, score +1, length increases to 14.\n> \n> Then head at (4,3), direction now R (since moved right).\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> There is also food at (1,1) with life span 7, so it will disappear after turn 56+7=63? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 56, life span 7, so after 7 turns, on turn 63 it disappears? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Food life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, food has life span L, it will disappear at the end of turn t+L-1? Or after N turns from now.\n> \n> The input says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life span N, it will be there for N turns: at turn t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and gone at turn t+N.\n> \n> For (1,1): at turn 56, life span 7, so present from turn 56 to 62, gone at turn 63.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) life span 9, present from 56 to 64, gone at 65.\n> \n> Now, head at (4,3) after eating.\n> \n> From (4,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: to (4,4)\n> \n> But (4,4) is an obstacle?

In new positions, head (4,3), then (3,3), ..., tail (5,3). (5,3) is tail, and head is at (4,3), which is adjacent to (5,3)? (4,3) and (5,3) are adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> But (5,3) is tail, and it has no food, I think. The food was at (4,3), which we ate, so (5,3) is just tail position, no food.\n> \n> Tail reward danger only if the tail cell has positive food, but here no food at (5,3), so moving right to (5,3) would be moving to the tail cell.\n> \n> In snake, moving to the tail cell is usually safe because when you move, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> Specifically: if head moves to the current tail cell, since the tail will move forward, it vacates the cell, so head can move there without collision, as long as no other body part.\n> \n> In this case, from (4,3) to (5,3): current tail is at (5,3).

Since life span decreases every turn, including current, it will disappear after turn 62? Let's calculate: current turn 57, life span 6, so it will disappear after 6 turns, meaning on turn 63 it's gone? No.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn 57, life span is 6, meaning it has 6 turns left including this one. After turn 57, countdown to 5; after turn 58, to 4; ... after turn 62, to 0, so it disappears before turn 63? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is N at turn t, it will be present for N more turns: at turn t, countdown=N; after turn t, it becomes N-1; ... at turn t + N - 1, countdown=1; at turn t + N, it should be gone, so it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1.\n> \n> In this case, food at (1,1) with life span 6 at turn 57.

But after the move, the tail will move forward, so (5,3) becomes the new head position, and the tail segment at (5,3) moves to the next position? Let's think about snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So if head moves to a new cell, say to (5,3), which was tail, then the new positions: head is now (5,3), then the old head (4,3) becomes segment 1, (3,3) segment 2, ..., and the tail (5,3) was segment 13, but it moves to where segment 12 was, which is (5,4)?

Standard snake: when head moves to a new cell, the tail is removed, unless food is eaten.\n> \n> If no food eaten, the snake moves: head to new position, each body segment shifts to the position of the previous one, so the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> Specifically:\n> \n> - Head moves to new cell.\n> \n> - Each body segment from 1 to end moves to the position of segment index-1?

Let's see internal obstacles: (5,2) is obstacle, (4,4) is obstacle, but (5,3) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, walls: x=0,7 y=0,7, so (5,3) is within 1-6, so ok.\n> \n> So move R to (5,3) is possible and safe.\n> \n> But is there food there? No, food at (1,1).\n> \n> Now, other moves:\n> \n> Move U (up) to (4,4): but (4,4) is an internal obstacle! (4,4) is in the obstacle list: internal obstacles include (4,4).

So the snake has 14 segments. Head is at (4,2) and tail at (5,4).\n> \n> Head direction is D, which is down. So it's moving down to (4,2) from (4,3)? Positions are given with head first: [(4,2), (4,3), ...]. Since it was moving down to (4,2), the previous position was (4,3), I think. Head direction is D, meaning it just moved down to (4,2), so for the next move, I can't go up because that would be instant reverse. Current head direction is D, so I cannot move U next.\n> \n> Food: two items. One at (1,1) with value 1 and life span 5, meaning it will disappear after 5 turns, including this one. So from turn 58, it has 5 turns left, so it will vanish after turn 62? Let's see: life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 58, life span 5; turn 59, it becomes 4; ... down to turn 62, life span 1, and after that, gone? Or does it disappear when life span reaches 0?\n> \n> Typically, if life span is N, it lasts for N turns, so at turn t when it appears, life span N, then at turn t+1, life span N-1, ..., at turn t + N -1, life span 1, and then after that turn, it disappears. But the problem says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Let me read: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at turn t with life_span L, at turn t, countdown is L; turn t+1, countdown L-1; ... turn t + L -1, countdown 1; then after turn t + L -1, it disappears, so not available on turn t + L.\n> \n> But for eating, it can be eaten on any turn as long as countdown >0.\n> \n> In this case, food at (1,1): value 1, life_span 5 at turn 58.

It's turn 59. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the edges, meaning the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, let's clarify.\n> \n> The walls are specified: border cells are x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, so any cell with x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 is a wall. That means the snake can only be on cells from (1,1) to (6,6). But there are also internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)]. So these cells are blocked and cannot be moved into.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,1), and direction is down (D). The body segments follow: (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4). Let's list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (4,1)\n> \n> - Then: (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)\n> \n> The tail is at (6,4). Snake length is 14 segments.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1 and life span 4. So it disappears after 4 turns, including this turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 59, life span 4 means it will disappear after turn 62? Let's see: on turn 59, life span is 4; turn 60, it becomes 3; turn 61, it becomes 2; turn 62, it becomes 1; turn 63, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 59, 60, 61, 62.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) with value 1 and life span 9. So it will be around until turn 67 or something, but since life span decreases each turn, it has 9 turns left including turn 59. So disappears after turn 67? Turn 59: life=9, turn 60:8, ..., turn 67:1, turn 68: disappears. So available from 59 to 67.\n> \n> But (6,6) is currently occupied by the snake! Snake positions include (6,6), which is the 12th segment? Let's index:\n> \n> Position 0: head (4,1)\n> \n> 1: (4,2)\n> \n> 2: (4,3)\n> \n> 3: (3,3)\n> \n> 4: (2,3)\n> \n> 5: (2,4)\n> \n> 6: (2,5)\n> \n> 7: (3,5)\n> \n> 8: (3,6)\n> \n> 9: (4,6)\n> \n> 10: (5,6)\n> \n> 11: (6,6)\n> \n> 12: (6,5)  ? Snake positions: [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)]\n> \n> So (6,6) is position 11, and it's part of the body. Food at (6,6) is under the snake's body. But according to rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, head is at (4,1), moving down. Direction is D, so down, meaning y decreases? Typically in grids, y=0 might be top or bottom, but here walls are y=0 and y=7, and snake head at (4,1) with direction D (down), so probably y increases downward or upward?\n> \n> Direction D is down, and head is at (4,1), moving to (4,0)? But y=0 is wall, so it can't move down. That's a problem.\n> \n> Current head position: (4,1), direction D (down). Down should decrease y if y=0 is top, or increase y if y=0 is bottom? I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in such games, (0,0) is top-left, y increases downward, x increases right. So down means (x, y+1).\n> \n> But walls: y=0 is top wall, y=7 is bottom wall. So for a cell (x,y), moving up decreases y, moving down increases y.\n> \n> Confirm: head at (4,1), direction D (down), so if it moves down, it would go to (4,2). But (4,2) is the next segment? Snake positions: head (4,1), then (4,2), so if it moves down to (4,2), it would collide with its own body.\n> \n> But movement: in each turn, the snake moves one cell in the chosen direction, and the body follows.\n> \n> Current direction is D, so if no change, it would move down to (4,2), but (4,2) is occupied by the body, so it would die.\n> \n> But we can choose to change direction, but with no instant reverse.\n> \n> Current direction is D (down), so we can move L, R, or D, but not U (up), since that would be reverse.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,1):\n> \n> - Down: to (4,2) but (4,2) is occupied by body segment, so collision if we move there.\n> \n> - Left: to (3,1)\n> \n> - Right: to (5,1)\n> \n> - Up: to (4,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> (6,1) is at x=6,y=1, which might be accessible.\n> \n> First, let's list possible moves from head position (4,1):\n> \n> - Up: (4,0) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - Down: (4,2) - occupied by snake body (segment 1), so collision\n> \n> - Left: (3,1) - let's check if free. Snake positions: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), etc. (3,1) not listed, so probably free? Also, walls: no wall at (3,1), internal obstacles don't include (3,1), so should be free.\n> \n> - Right: (5,1) - not in snake positions, not a wall? Walls are borders and internal. Borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (5,1) is x=5,y=1, which is within 1-6, not internal obstacle? Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). (5,1) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> But (6,1) is an internal obstacle, but (5,1) is not.\n> \n> So possible moves: Left to (3,1) or Right to (5,1).

Let's list:\n> \n> - Head: (3,1)\n> \n> - Seg1: (4,1)\n> \n> - Seg2: (4,2)\n> \n> - Seg3: (4,3)\n> \n> - Seg4: (3,3)\n> \n> - Seg5: (2,3)\n> \n> - Seg6: (2,4)\n> \n> - Seg7: (2,5)\n> \n> - Seg8: (3,5)\n> \n> - Seg9: (3,6)\n> \n> - Seg10: (4,6)\n> \n> - Seg11: (5,6)\n> \n> - Seg12: (6,6)\n> \n> - Tail: (6,5)\n> \n> (6,6) is still occupied, and food is there, but head is not on it.\n> \n> Similarly, if we move right to (5,1), new head (5,1), body: (4,1), (4,2), etc., up to (6,5), (6,6) is still there.\n> \n> To eat the food at (6,6), we need the cell to be free and head to move there.\n> \n> Currently, (6,6) is occupied by seg11, which will move when the snake moves. But since the snake is long, it will take many moves for that segment to be freed, unless the tail moves away.\n> \n> The tail is at (6,4), and when we move, it moves to (6,5) or something, but (6,6) is fixed until the segment moves.\n> \n> For (6,6) to be free, the snake must move such that the segment that was at (6,6) moves forward, and no new segment comes, so when the tail moves, (6,6) might be freed if it was the tail, but it's not.\n> \n> The only way to free a body cell is when the tail moves away from it.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (6,4), and (6,6) is not adjacent, so it will take several moves.\n> \n> Let's see the path: from tail to (6,6): positions (6,4) tail, (6,5), (6,6), so when the snake moves, if no food eaten, tail (6,4) is removed, new tail is (6,5), and (6,6) is still occupied by the segment that was at (6,5) or something.\n> \n> After one move no eat: head moves, tail removed, so the cell that was tail is freed, but other body cells remain occupied.\n> \n> (6,6) is not the tail, so it remains occupied until the snake moves enough that that segment becomes the tail and moves away.\n> \n> The segment at (6,6) is position 11, and there are 14 segments, so it will take 3 moves for that segment to become the tail? Let's see.\n> \n> After k moves with no eating, the tail segment moves forward, and after k moves, the segment that was at index i will be at index i-k, but when k=i, it becomes the tail.\n> \n> For segment at position 11 (0-based index), it will become the tail after 11 moves with no eating, because after m moves, the tail is the segment that was at index m.\n> \n> Initial positions: index 0 (head) to 13 (tail).\n> \n> After one move no eat: new head, then index 0 to 12 become body, index 13 removed. So segment that was at index 1 is now at index 1, but the positions shift.\n> \n> The segment that was at index 11 will be at index 10 after one move, index 9 after two moves, and so on, until it becomes index 0 after 11 moves, but when it becomes head? No.\n> \n> After m moves with no eating, the segment that was at index k is now at index k - m if k >= m, or gone if k < m.\n> \n> For example, after 0 moves, index 11 is at position 11.\n> \n> After 1 move, it is at index 10 (since positions shift down).\n> \n> After 2 moves, index 9, ..., after 11 moves, it would be at index 0, which is head, but head is new position.\n> \n> The cell (6,6) is occupied by a particular segment. That segment will move to the next position each time the snake moves. So after one move, the segment that was at (6,6) moves to where the next segment was, but since the snake moves, each segment advances to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> When the snake moves, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So for the cell (6,6), it is occupied by segment 11. When snake moves, segment 11 will move to the position of segment 10, which is (5,6) or whatever, so the cell (6,6) is vacated only if no new segment comes, but since the tail is removed, the last position is vacated, but (6,6) is not the last position; the last position is (6,4), which is vacated when tail moves.\n> \n> Specifically, after a move with no eat, the cell that was tail is freed, and other body cells may change but are still occupied except for the tail cell.\n> \n> (6,6) is not the tail, so it remains occupied until that segment becomes the tail.\n> \n> The distance from current position: segment at index 11, tail at index 13, so it will take 2 moves for it to become the tail? After 0 moves, tail index 13.\n> \n> After 1 move no eat: new head, segments 0 to 12 become new body, index 13 removed, so new tail is old index 12.\n> \n> After 2 moves: new tail is old index 11.\n> \n> So after 2 moves with no eating, the segment that was at index 11 will be the tail, and when the snake moves again, it will move, freeing the cell (6,6) if it was there, but it may have moved.\n> \n> Initially at (6,6), after one move, that segment moves to where the next was, which is (5,6) if it was segment 10, but segment 10 is (5,6), segment 11 is (6,6), so after move, segment 11 moves to (5,6), so (6,6) is vacated? No.\n> \n> When the snake moves to a new head position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> For example, if head moves to new cell, then segment 1 moves to old head position, segment 2 moves to old segment 1 position, ..., segment k moves to old segment k-1 position, and the old tail position is abandoned.\n> \n> So for cell (6,6), it is old position of segment 11. When snake moves, segment 11 moves to old position of segment 10, which is (5,6), so the cell (6,6) is no longer occupied by segment 11; instead, it might be occupied by the segment that moves to it, but no, each segment moves to a different cell.\n> \n> The cell that was occupied by segment 11 is (6,6). After move, segment 11 is now at the cell that was previously occupied by segment 10, so (5,6). The cell (6,6) is now empty, unless the new head or something moves there, but the head moves to a new cell.\n> \n> After a move with no eat, the cells that were occupied are all vacated except that each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the only cell that is completely freed is the old tail position.\n> \n> For example, old positions: P0, P1, P2, ..., P13.\n> \n> New positions: new head Q, then P0, P1, P2, ..., P12. So the new body occupies Q, P0, P1, ..., P12, so cells P1 to P12 are still occupied, but by different segments, and P13 is freed, and Q is new.\n> \n> Cell P13 (old tail) is freed, cells P0 to P12 are still occupied, but by new segments: P0 is now occupied by new segment 1, P1 by new segment 2, ..., P12 by new segment 13 (tail), and Q by head.\n> \n> So for a cell like (6,6), which is old P11, it is now occupied by new segment 12 (since new segment 12 is at old P11).\n> \n> The cell itself is still occupied, but by a different segment.\n> \n> The only cell that becomes empty is the old tail position P13.\n> \n> For (6,6) to be free, it must be the tail position at some point.\n> \n> Currently, (6,6) is not the tail; tail is at (6,4).\n> \n> After moves, the tail will move, but (6,6) will be freed only when it becomes the tail position.\n> \n> The segment at (6,6) will move to (5,6) next move, etc.\n> \n> To have (6,6) free, we need the tail to be at (6,6) at some point.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (6,4), and the path is (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), so after two moves with no eating, the tail will be at (6,6), and when it moves from there, (6,6) will be freed.\n> \n> But if we eat food, the tail doesn't move, so it stays longer.\n> \n> For now, to eat (6,6), we need to move the head to (6,6) when it is free.\n> \n> It will be free after the tail moves away from it.\n> \n> Currently, tail at (6,4), so after two moves, if no eat, tail will be at (6,6), then on the third move, if we move the tail away, (6,6) is freed, and then head can move to it.\n> \n> But let's calculate.\n> \n> Turn 59: tail at (6,4)\n> \n> After move (no eat), turn 60: tail moves to (6,5) or wherever, but new tail is at old (6,5), which was segment 12.\n> \n> Old positions: seg12: (6,5), seg13: (6,4) tail.\n> \n> After move no eat: new head, then old head to old seg1 to old seg12 become new body, old tail removed. So new tail is old seg12 at (6,5).\n> \n> So on turn 60, tail at (6,5)\n> \n> Then on turn 61, after move no eat, new tail is old seg11 at (6,6)\n> \n> On turn 61, tail is at (6,6)\n> \n> Then on turn 62, if we move and no eat, tail moves from (6,6), so (6,6) is freed, and head can move to (6,6) on turn 62 to eat the food.\n> \n> But on turn 62, when we move, if head moves to (6,6), and it is free, we can eat it.\n> \n> On turn 61, tail is at (6,6), so cell (6,6) is occupied by tail.\n> \n> On turn 62, if we move the head to (6,6), but (6,6) is occupied by tail, so it would be collision, unless the tail moves first.\n> \n> The move happens: the head moves to a new position, then the body shifts, tail is removed if no eat.\n> \n> If on turn 62, we move head to (6,6), but at that time, (6,6) is occupied by the tail, so head moving there would collide with body.\n> \n> So we cannot move directly to the tail position when it is occupied.\n> \n> The food at (6,6) can only be eaten if the cell is empty when head moves there.\n> \n> So on turn 62, after the move, (6,6) is freed only if the tail was there and moves away.\n> \n> On turn 61, tail is at (6,6).\n> \n> On turn 62, when we move, if we don't eat food, the head moves to new position, then the tail (at (6,6)) is removed, so (6,6) is freed, and the new body has the segment that was before tail moving to (6,6), but since tail is removed, (6,6) is empty after the move.\n> \n> Then, on the next turn, head can move to (6,6) if possible.\n> \n> Let's clarify the sequence.\n> \n> At the start of turn t, positions are given.\n> \n> We choose a move.\n> \n> The head moves to the new cell.\n> \n> If that cell has food, it is eaten, length increases, tail does not move.\n> \n> If no food, tail is removed.\n> \n> Body segments shift.\n> \n> For the food at (6,6), it is currently occupied, so not accessible.\n> \n> To make it accessible, we need to move so that the snake leaves that cell.\n> \n> Specifically, when the segment that is at (6,6) moves away, and no other segment is there, then it is free.\n> \n> Currently, on turn 59, (6,6) is occupied.\n> \n> After one move with no eat: on turn 60, the segment that was at (6,6) moves to (5,6) (since it was seg11, moves to old seg10 position (5,6)), so (6,6) is vacated, and not occupied by anyone, so it is free for food eating.\n> \n> Is that right?\n> \n> Old positions: seg10: (5,6), seg11: (6,6), seg12: (6,5), seg13: (6,4)\n> \n> After move no eat: new head at some place, say Q.\n> \n> Then new body: old head at P0, old seg1 at P1, ..., old seg12 at P12.\n> \n> Old seg12 is at (6,5), which becomes new tail.\n> \n> The cell (6,6) was occupied by old seg11, which has moved to old seg10 position (5,6), so (6,6) is no longer occupied; it is empty.\n> \n> Similarly, the old tail position (6,4) is also empty.\n> \n> So after one move with no eating, the cell (6,6) is freed because the segment moved away.\n> \n> Then, on turn 60, (6,6) is empty, and food is there, so if head moves to (6,6), it can eat it.\n> \n> Similarly for any body cell except the tail if it's adjacent.\n> \n> In this case, (6,6) is not the tail; tail is at (6,4), so after one move, (6,6) is free.\n> \n> On turn 59, after we move, on turn 60, (6,6) is free.\n> \n> Then on turn 60, if we move head to (6,6), we can eat the food.\n> \n> But we need to be able to reach it.\n> \n> First, back to current turn 59.\n> \n> We must move to (3,1) or (5,1).\n> \n> Now, food at (1,1) is also available, with short life span.\n> \n> (1,1) is at (1,1), which might be reachable.\n> \n> Let's plan the path.\n> \n> First, from head (4,1), we can go left to (3,1) or right to (5,1).\n> \n> If we go left to (3,1), then positions: head (3,1), body (4,1), (4,2), etc.\n> \n> From (3,1), possible moves: up to (3,0) wall, invalid; down to (3,2); left to (2,1); right to (4,1) but (4,1) is now body, so invalid, collision.\n> \n> So from (3,1), possible: down to (3,2) or left to (2,1).\n> \n> Similarly, if we go right to (5,1), then from (5,1): up to (5,0) wall; down to (5,2) but (5,2) is internal obstacle, blocked; left to (4,1) body; right to (6,1) but (6,1) is internal obstacle, blocked.

Let me write the snake from head to tail:\n> \n> - Head: (3,1)\n> \n> - Then: (4,1)\n> \n> - (4,2)\n> \n> - (4,3)\n> \n> - (3,3)\n> \n> - (2,3)\n> \n> - (2,4)\n> \n> - (2,5)\n> \n> - (3,5)\n> \n> - (3,6)\n> \n> - (4,6)\n> \n> - (5,6)\n> \n> - (6,6)\n> \n> - Tail: (6,5)\n> \n> Snake length: counting positions, there are 14 segments. Positions list has 14 elements: from index 0 to 13, so length 14.\n> \n> Food: two items:\n> \n> - (1,1) with life span 3, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (6,6) with life span 8, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current turn, so at turn 60, food at (1,1) has life span 3, meaning it will disappear after turn 62? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be there for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L. For example, if at turn t life span is 3, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, t+2, and disappears at turn t+3.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,6): life span 8 at turn 60, so it will last until turn 67 (since 60 + 8 - 1 = 67? Let's think: turn 60: life span 3, means it has 3 turns left including turn 60. After turn 60, life span becomes 2, then 1, then 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 60, 61, 62, and gone on turn 63.\n> \n> General: if at turn t, life span is L, it exists from turn t to turn t + L - 1, and is gone at turn t + L.\n> \n> So for (1,1): life span 3 at turn 60, so exists turns 60, 61, 62. Gone turn 63.\n> \n> For (6,6): life span 8 at turn 60, exists turns 60 to 67, gone turn 68.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (3,1), direction left. Since it's moving left, last move was to (3,1) from, say, (4,1) but (4,1) is the second position, so head was at (4,1) before moving to (3,1) with direction L.\n> \n> Current head direction is L, meaning it just moved left to (3,1).\n> \n> Possible moves: since head direction is L, I can move U, D, L, but not R because R is opposite to L, and no instant reverse.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is L, so I cannot move R on this turn. I can move U, D, or L.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid. I should sketch the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

Not occupied by snake (but food can be under snake; here it's not).\n   - **Right (R)**: (3,1) \n     - Occupied by body segment (not tail), invalid (collision).\n\n3. **Food Analysis**:\n   - (1,1): Life span 2 (disappears after turn 62). If not eaten now, it will be gone.\n   - (6,6): Under tail, cannot be eaten immediately.\n   - (5,1): Life span 10, no urgency.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n\n1. **Move Left (L) to (1,1)**:\n   - Eat food: +1 score, length increases to 15.\n   - Next turn (62): From (1,1), possible moves:\n     - U: (1,2) - wall (internal obstacle).\n     - D: (1,0) - wall.\n     - L: (0,1) - wall.\n     - R: (2,1) - occupied by body (not tail), collision.\n   - **Result**: No valid moves on turn 62 → death. Total score: +1.\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (2,2)**:\n   - No food eaten.\n   - Next turn (62): From (2,2), possible moves:\n     - U: (2,3) - occupied by body.\n     - D: (2,1) - occupied by body and reverse direction (invalid).\n     - L: (1,2) - wall.\n     - R: (3,2) - free.\n   - Only valid move: R to (3,2).\n   - Turn 63: From (3,2), possible moves:\n     - U: (3,3) - occupied.\n     - D: (3,1) - occupied.\n     - L: (2,2) - occupied and reverse direction.\n     - R: (4,2) - occupied.\n   - **Result**: No valid moves on turn 63 → death. Total score: +0.\n\n### Decision:\n- Moving left (L) to (1,1) yields +1 score before death.\n- Moving up (U) leads to death with no score.\n- **Optimal choice**: Move left to secure the food.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The food at (1,1) is the only immediately accessible positive food.\n- The snake is in a highly constrained position with no long-term survival path in this scenario.\n- The previous analysis correctly identifies that both options lead to death, but moving left at least captures the reward.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{L}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 61 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(5, 2), (4, 4), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 4), (3, 4), (5, 5), (6, 1)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: L\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (1, 1, 2, 1)\n\t- (6, 6, 7, 1)\n\t- (5, 1, 10, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 61 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 61. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). So, these are all cells I must avoid.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,1), and the body segments follow: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). The head direction is L, which means left, so the snake is moving left.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1 and life span 2. So, it will disappear after 2 turns, including this one, so after turn 62, it might be gone? Life span decreases every turn, including current. Current turn is 61, so life span 2 means it disappears after turn 62? Let's clarify: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (1,1), life span 2 on turn 61: after turn 61, it has 1 turn left; after turn 62, it has 0, so it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 61 or 62.\n> \n> Similarly:\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1 and life span 7. So it will last until turn 67 or something. Life span 7 on turn 61: after turn 61, 6 left; ... after turn 67, 0 left, disappears.\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1 and life span 10. Lasts a long time.\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose an action sequence for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> Current head position: (2,1), moving left. So from (2,1), possible moves: U (up, to (2,2)), D (down, but y=1, down to y=0, but y=0 is wall, so not possible), L (left, to (1,1)), R (right, to (3,1)).\n> \n> But (3,1) is the second segment of the snake, currently occupied. But since the snake moves, when the head moves, the tail moves, so moving to (3,1) might be possible if it's the tail, but let's see.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (2,1), then (3,1), (4,1), etc. So (3,1) is the first body segment after head. If I move right to (3,1), since the snake will move, the head would go to (3,1), but at that moment, (3,1) is still occupied by the body, so it would collide. I need to be careful.\n> \n> Collision rules: body collision if head touches any body segment except that you can move into the tail cell because the tail moves away.\n> \n> Let's read: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, when moving, if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment, it collides unless it's the tail segment and the tail moves away at the same time.\n> \n> In this case, the tail is at (6,6). So, for any move, if the new head position is a body segment except the tail, it's collision. If it's the tail, it's safe because the tail moves.\n> \n> Also, walls: cannot move to wall cells.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,1):\n> \n> - U: to (2,2). Is (2,2) occupied? Snake positions: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), ... (2,2) is not in the list, so it should be free? Let's list all snake positions: [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6)]. So (2,2) is not occupied. Also, not a wall. Walls are borders and internal obstacles. Borders x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (2,2) is within bounds, and internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). None at (2,2), so U to (2,2) should be safe.\n> \n> - D: to (2,0). But y=0 is border wall, so not possible.\n> \n> - L: to (1,1). (1,1) is a food position, but let's see if it's occupied. Snake positions don't include (1,1), so it might be free. But (1,1) has food, and it could be under the snake or not? Food can spawn under body, but only eaten when head moves there after body moves away. Here, (1,1) is not occupied by snake, I think. Snake positions are given, and (1,1) not listed, so it should be empty except for food. So moving to (1,1) is possible.\n> \n> - R: to (3,1). But (3,1) is the second segment of the snake. Since it's not the tail (tail is (6,6)), moving to (3,1) would cause collision with body. Not possible.\n> \n> Also, direction: current head direction is L (left), so moving left is fine. Moving right would be opposite, but \"no instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is L, so opposite is R. Moving R to (3,1) is not possible anyway due to collision, but even if it were empty, moving opposite might not be allowed? The rule says \"on next turn\", meaning from the current direction. So from L, I cannot move R immediately. But since R is not possible anyway, it's fine.\n> \n> So possible moves: U or L.\n> \n> L to (1,1) has food, which is positive, value +1. Eating it would increase length by 1.\n> \n> U to (2,2) is empty, I think.\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, food at (1,1) has life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 62. That means if I don't eat it by turn 62, it's gone. Turn 61: I can eat it now, or on turn 62.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (6,6) has life span 7, so plenty of time, but (6,6) is currently occupied by the tail? Snake positions include (6,6), which is the tail. So food at (6,6) is under the tail. To eat it, the body must move away and head move there. But since it's the tail, when the tail moves, it exposes the cell, and if head moves there later, it can be eaten. But for now, it's under the snake, so not accessible immediately.\n> \n> Food at (5,1) has life span 10, so no rush.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the grid. I should sketch this mentally.\n> \n> Grid size: from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7. Borders are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Snake: head (2,1), body: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), tail (6,6)\n> \n> So the snake is long, 14 segments.\n> \n> From (2,1), if I move L to (1,1), I eat the food, length becomes 15, and the new tail will be... when I eat, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one. After moving to (1,1), head is at (1,1), the previous head (2,1) becomes body, and so on, tail stays until next move if no food eaten. But since I eat food, the tail doesn't move, so positions: new head (1,1), then (2,1), (3,1), ..., up to (6,6), so length 15.\n> \n> If I move U to (2,2), no food eaten, so head moves to (2,2), tail moves from (6,6) to (5,6)? Let's see: when snake moves, head to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed. So after move U, positions: head (2,2), then (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6). Tail was (6,6), now removed, so tail is (5,6). Length remains 14.\n> \n> Now, food at (1,1) has short life, only until after turn 62. So if I don't eat it now, I might miss it.\n> \n> But moving to (1,1) might have risks. Let's see the surroundings.\n> \n> (1,1): what are the possible moves from there?\n> \n> If I move to (1,1), head at (1,1), direction was L, but after move, new direction is L.\n> \n> Then from (1,1), possible moves: U to (1,2), D to (1,0) but y=0 wall, not possible, L to (0,1) but x=0 wall, not possible, R to (2,1).\n> \n> But (2,1) is now the second segment after I move there.\n> \n> After moving to (1,1), snake positions: head (1,1), then (2,1), (3,1), etc.\n> \n> So from (1,1):\n> \n> - U to (1,2): is (1,2) occupied? Snake positions: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) — (1,2) not in list, so free? But (1,2) is an internal obstacle! Walls include internal obstacles: (1,2) is listed, so it's a wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,2) is one, so (1,2) is wall.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4) and (1,5) are walls.\n> \n> So from (1,1):\n> \n> - U: to (1,2) wall, not possible.\n> \n> - D: to (1,0) border wall, not possible.\n> \n> - L: to (0,1) border wall, not possible.\n> \n> - R: to (2,1), which is the body segment.\n> \n> Now, (2,1) is the second segment, not tail. Tail is at (5,6) after this move? After moving to (1,1), tail is still (5,6) or (6,6)? When I move to (1,1) and eat food, tail doesn't move, so positions: head (1,1), then (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6) — I think I miscounted.\n> \n> Original positions: 14 segments. After eating, length 15, so positions: new head (1,1), then previous: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). So tail is (6,6).\n> \n> From (1,1), moving R to (2,1): but (2,1) is occupied by the body, and it's not the tail (tail is (6,6)), so collision. Not possible.\n> \n> Other directions: U, D, L all walls or borders. So only possible move is R, but that causes collision. So if I move to (1,1), on the next turn, I have no valid moves! I would be trapped and die.\n> \n> That's a dead end.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (1,1) now is suicidal because after that, I cannot move anywhere without colliding.\n> \n> So I should not move L to (1,1) on this turn.\n> \n> The only other option is to move U to (2,2).\n> \n> Move U to (2,2): no food eaten, so tail moves, positions become: head (2,2), then (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6). Tail was (6,6), now removed, tail at (5,6). Length 14.\n> \n> Food at (1,1) still there, but life span decreases. After this turn, turn 61, food at (1,1) has life span 1 left? Turn 61: life span was 2, after turn 61, it becomes 1, so can be eaten on turn 62.\n> \n> But to eat it, I need to be able to move to (1,1) on turn 62.\n> \n> Now, from (2,2), after moving U.\n> \n> Head at (2,2), direction now U (since I moved up).\n> \n> Current direction: after moving U, head direction is U.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,2):\n> \n> - U to (2,3): but (2,3) is in the snake positions. After move, positions: head (2,2), then (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)\n> \n> So (2,3) is occupied, it's the 7th segment? List: index 0: (2,2), 1: (2,1), 2: (3,1), 3: (4,1), 4: (4,2), 5: (4,3), 6: (3,3), 7: (2,3), 8: (2,4), 9: (2,5), 10: (3,5), 11: (3,6), 12: (4,6), 13: (5,6)\n> \n> So (2,3) is position of segment 7, not tail. Tail is (5,6). So moving to (2,3) would collide with body.\n> \n> - D to (2,1): (2,1) is segment 1, directly behind head, but since direction is U, moving D would be opposite direction. Current direction U, moving down is opposite, so not allowed by \"no instant reverse\". Also, (2,1) is body, so collision anyway.\n> \n> - L to (1,2): but (1,2) is an internal obstacle, wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - R to (3,2): is (3,2) occupied? Not in the positions above. Also, not a wall? Walls: internal obstacles include (5,2), but not (3,2). Borders fine. So (3,2) might be free.\n> \n> (3,2) not in snake positions, not a wall. But is there food? Food is at (1,1), (6,6), (5,1), not (3,2). So empty.\n> \n> So from (2,2), possible move: only R to (3,2)? U, D, L not possible, so only R.\n> \n> D is not possible because reverse and occupied, U occupied, L wall, so only R to (3,2).\n> \n> Move R to (3,2): no food, so tail moves. Positions: head (3,2), then (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6). Tail at (5,6) moved away, now tail at (4,6)? After move to (3,2), head to (3,2), then previous head (2,2), then (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6). Tail was (5,6) removed, so tail at (4,6). Length 14.\n> \n> Now, food at (1,1) has life span 1, so after this turn (turn 62?), let's keep track of turns.\n> \n> Current turn is 61.\n> \n> On turn 61, I move U to (2,2).\n> \n> Then turn 62, I move R to (3,2).\n> \n> Now on turn 62, food at (1,1) has life span 1 (since it decreased on turn 61 to 1, and after turn 62, it disappears). So on turn 62, I can still eat it if I move there, but I'm at (3,2), not adjacent to (1,1). I need to be at (1,1) to eat, but I'm at (3,2), so I can't eat it on turn 62. After turn 62, it disappears. So I missed that food.\n> \n> But moving to (1,1) on turn 61 was bad, so it's better to miss it than to die.\n> \n> Now, after turn 62, I'm at (3,2), head direction? I moved R, so now direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,2):\n> \n> - U to (3,3): (3,3) is occupied? Current positions: head (3,2), then (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6)\n> \n> (3,3) is segment 7?

Tail is (4,6). So moving to (3,3) would collide.\n> \n> - D to (3,1): (3,1) is segment 3, body, not tail. Also, current direction R, moving down might not be opposite? Directions: U,D,L,R. R is right, D is down, not opposite; opposite of R is L. Down is perpendicular. \"No instant reverse\" means cannot move directly opposite, e.g., from U to D, L to R, etc. From R, opposite is L. D is not opposite, so allowed, but (3,1) is occupied, collision.\n> \n> - L to (2,2): (2,2) is segment 1, directly behind, but since moving, if I move L, to (2,2), which is the first body segment. Not tail, so collision. Also, moving left from right might be opposite? Current direction R, moving L is opposite, so not allowed by no instant reverse.\n> \n> - R to (4,2): (4,2) is in positions? (4,2) is segment 5? From above, segment 5 is (4,2), which is body, not tail. So moving to (4,2) would collide.\n> \n> (4,2) is occupied by segment 5.\n> \n> Also, is there wall? (4,2) not a wall, but occupied.\n> \n> So all moves seem impossible?

This is invalid.\n\n2. **Adjacent Cells to Head (1, 1)**:\n   - **Up (U)**: (1, 2) - Internal obstacle (wall)\n   - **Down (D)**: (1, 0) - Border wall\n   - **Left (L)**: (0, 1) - Border wall\n   - **Right (R)**: (2, 1) - Occupied by the snake's body (second segment)\n\n3. **Possible Moves**:\n   - **U**: (1, 2) - Wall (invalid)\n   - **D**: (1, 0) - Wall (invalid)\n   - **L**: (0, 1) - Wall (invalid)\n   - **R**: (2, 1) - Body collision (invalid, as it's not the tail)\n\n4. **Food**:\n   - (6, 6): On the tail, value 6, life span 1 (disappears after this turn)\n   - (5, 1): Free cell, value 9, life span 1 (disappears after this turn)\n   - Neither can be reached in one move from (1, 1).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - All possible moves from (1, 1) lead to either a wall collision or a body collision.\n   - The snake is trapped with no valid moves.\n\n### Decision\nSince all immediate moves are invalid and lead to the snake's death, the only possible action is to choose one of the invalid moves. The least harmful choice (though still fatal) is to move right (R) into the body, as this is the only non-wall option, but it still results in a collision.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{R}",

It's turn 62, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No, walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive? Similarly for y. But let's see the snake positions: head at (1,1), and it goes to (6,6), so yes, grid is from (1,1) to (6,6). x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)]\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (1,1), then (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). So the snake has 15 segments. Head direction is L, which is left, so currently moving left.\n> \n> Food: two items:\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 6 and life span 1? Wait, the format is (x,y, value, life_span), I think. Let me read: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (6, 6, 6, 1)\" so that's (x=6, y=6, value=6, life_span=1)\n> \n> But the snake is currently at (6,6)? Snake positions end with (5,6), (6,6), so (6,6) is the tail, I think. Positions: [(1,1), (2,1), ..., (5,6), (6,6)] so head is (1,1), tail is (6,6).\n> \n> Food at (6,6) with value 6 and life span 1. But (6,6) is occupied by the snake's tail. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, another food at (5,1) with value 9 and life span 1? \" (5, 1, 9, 1) \" so (x=5,y=1, value=9, life_span=1)\n> \n> Life span 1 means it disappears after this turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 62, life span 1, it will disappear after this turn, meaning if not eaten now, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,6) food, life span 1, disappears after turn 62.\n> \n> Now, current turn is 62, and I need to choose actions starting from turn 62.\n> \n> Snake head is at (1,1), moving left. But (1,1) is at the bottom-left? Let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Assume x from left to right, y from bottom to top? Or top to bottom? In programming, often y=0 is top, but here walls are y=0 and y=7, and snake positions: head (1,1), then (2,1) etc., so probably (1,1) is bottom-left if y increases up, but let's see the positions.\n> \n> List y values: all positions have y from 1 to 6, so y=1 is bottom, y=6 is top? But walls y=0 and y=7, so y=0 bottom or top? Typically in such games, y=0 might be top, but here since snake starts at (1,1) and moves, and head direction L, which is decreasing x.\n> \n> Direction: U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, I think. So y increases as we go up. So (1,1) is bottom-left, (1,6) top-left, etc. U (up) increases y, D (down) decreases y.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> So head at (1,1), moving left. But x=1, left would be to x=0, which is a wall. So moving left from (1,1) to (0,1) is invalid, wall collision.\n> \n> But the snake is at (1,1), and direction is L, but it can't move left because x=1, left is x=0, wall.\n> \n> So I must change direction? But the action is for the next move.\n> \n> Current state: snake head at (1,1), direction L, but since it can't move L, I need to choose a different action for turn 62.\n> \n> The action sequence starts from turn t1, which is 62.\n> \n> So for turn 62, I need to choose an action: U, D, L, or R.\n> \n> But current head direction is L, meaning it was moving left to reach (1,1)? From previous position.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (1,1), then (2,1), so it came from (2,1) to (1,1), so it moved left to get to (1,1). But now at (1,1), it can move U, D, L, or R for the next step.\n> \n> But L to (0,1) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> R to (2,1) is the body, collision? (2,1) is the second segment, so if head moves to (2,1), it collides with body.\n> \n> Body collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, but since the tail moves, moving to the tail cell is ok only if the tail moves away.\n> \n> Rules: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But (2,1) is not the tail; tail is at (6,6). (2,1) is the second segment, so if head moves to (2,1), it would collide with body.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: head (1,1), index 1: (2,1), index 2: (3,1), etc.\n> \n> So (2,1) is a body segment, not tail.
