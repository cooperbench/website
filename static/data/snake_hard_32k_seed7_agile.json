Not occupied by snake (but food can be under snake; here it's not).\n   - **Right (R)**: (3,1) \n     - Occupied by body segment (not tail), invalid (collision).\n\n3. **Food Analysis**:\n   - (1,1): Life span 2 (disappears after turn 62). If not eaten now, it will be gone.\n   - (6,6): Under tail, cannot be eaten immediately.\n   - (5,1): Life span 10, no urgency.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n\n1. **Move Left (L) to (1,1)**:\n   - Eat food: +1 score, length increases to 15.\n   - Next turn (62): From (1,1), possible moves:\n     - U: (1,2) - wall (internal obstacle).\n     - D: (1,0) - wall.\n     - L: (0,1) - wall.\n     - R: (2,1) - occupied by body (not tail), collision.\n   - **Result**: No valid moves on turn 62 → death.

Total score: +0.\n\n### Decision:\n- Moving left (L) to (1,1) yields +1 score before death.\n- Moving up (U) leads to death with no score.\n- **Optimal choice**: Move left to secure the food.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The food at (1,1) is the only immediately accessible positive food.\n- The snake is in a highly constrained position with no long-term survival path in this scenario.\n- The previous analysis correctly identifies that both options lead to death, but moving left at least captures the reward.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{L}",
