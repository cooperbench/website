        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 0 (t1=0). The goal is to plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob) for the next several turns to maximize the reward from delivering soup.\n\nEnvironment Details:\n- Kitchen Counters: many locations, all empty initially.\n- Onion Dispensers: at (2,4) and (4,4)\n- Plate Dispenser: at (0,2)\n- Pots: at (2,0) and (4,0)\n- Serving Counter: at (6,2)\n\nRecipe: Only one recipe is given: 3 onions, reward 20, cooking time 5 turns.\n\nCurrent State:\n- Alice: at (3,3), facing Down (D), holding nothing.\n- Bob: at (3,1), facing Down (D), holding nothing.\n\nWe need to deliver soup. The plan should involve:\n1. Getting onions from the dispensers and putting them into a pot.\n2. Once the pot has 3 onions, it will start cooking (automatically). Then we need to get a plate and serve the soup from the pot to the serving counter.\n\nSince there are two pots and two players, we can try to use both pots to make two soups simultaneously? But note: we have only one plate dispenser and one serving counter. Also, the recipe requires 3 onions per soup.\n\nHowever, we are at turn 0 and both players are empty. We must coordinate.\n\nLet me sketch a plan:\n\nOption 1: Both players work on one pot to get the first soup quickly.\n\nOption 2: Each player works on a different pot.\n\nGiven the positions:\n- Alice is at (3,3). She is near the onion dispensers (at (2,4) and (4,4)) and also near the kitchen counters (which are empty and can be used for temporary storage? but we don't have items to store initially).\n- Bob is at (3,1). He is near the pots (at (2,0) and (4,0)) and the plate dispenser (at (0,2)) and the serving counter (at (6,2)).\n\nSo, perhaps:\n- Alice can focus on gathering onions and bringing them to a pot.\n- Bob can focus on getting plates and serving, but also can help with gathering onions or putting them in the pot.\n\nBut note: the pot is at (2,0) and (4,0). Bob is at (3,1). He can easily move to (2,0) or (4,0).\n\nAlternatively, we can assign:\n- Alice to the top area (onions) and Bob to the bottom area (pots and plates).\n\nDetailed Steps:\n\nFirst, we need to get onions. There are two onion dispensers: (2,4) and (4,4). Alice is at (3,3). She can go to (2,4) or (4,4). Let's choose (2,4):\n\nAlice: \n- Turn 0: Move to (2,3) [by moving left]? But she is at (3,3) and facing down. To move left, she must change orientation? Actually, the move actions change both position and orientation. So:\n\nOption: \nTurn 0: Alice moves left to (2,3) and now faces left? Then she can then move up to (2,4) to get an onion.\n\nBut note: the grid has kitchen counters? Let me check the kitchen counter list: (0,0), (1,0), ... (3,4), (5,4), (6,4). At (2,4) is an onion dispenser, so it's not a kitchen counter? And (2,3) is not in the kitchen counter list? So (2,3) should be empty? Similarly, (3,3) is not in the kitchen counter list? So it's walkable.\n\nBut we have to be cautious: the grid is 7x5? The coordinates go from (0,0) to (6,4)? \n\nLet me list the non-empty tiles from the tile types:\n\n- Kitchen Counters: (0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)\n- Onion Dispensers: (2,4), (4,4) -> note: (2,4) is both a kitchen counter? No, the kitchen counters include (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4). So (2,4) is an onion dispenser and not a kitchen counter? Actually, the dispenser is a separate type. So (2,4) is an onion dispenser and is non-empty, so we cannot walk on it? But we can interact with it from adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, the pot at (2,0) is non-empty? So we cannot walk on it? But we can interact from adjacent.\n\nSo, Alice at (3,3) can:\n- Move left to (2,3) [which is empty? Check: (2,3) is not in the kitchen counter list? The kitchen counters at y=3: (0,3) and (6,3). So (2,3) is empty? Yes.\n\nThen from (2,3) she is adjacent to the onion dispenser at (2,4) (above her). So she must face up to interact.\n\nSo plan for Alice:\n- Turn 0: Move Left to (2,3) -> now at (2,3) facing Left? Actually, when you move left, you end up facing left? The problem says: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" So if she moves left, she becomes at (2,3) and facing left. But to interact with (2,4) which is above, she must face up. So she needs to change orientation? Or can she interact in the next turn?\n\nAlternatively, she can move up? But from (3,3) moving up would go to (3,4). But (3,4) is a kitchen counter? And we cannot walk on non-empty tiles. So (3,4) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty? So she cannot walk there. Therefore, she must go left to (2,3) then face up and interact.\n\nSo:\nTurn 0: Alice moves Left -> to (2,3) facing Left.\n\nThen Turn 1: Alice changes orientation to Up? Or moves up? But she can't move up because (2,4) is non-empty (onion dispenser). So she must change orientation to Up? Then Turn 2: Interact to get an onion.\n\nBut that seems inefficient. Alternatively, after moving to (2,3) she is facing left, but she can immediately change orientation to Up in the same turn? No, each turn one action. So:\n\nTurn 0: Alice moves Left -> (2,3), facing Left.\nTurn 1: Alice changes orientation to Up (so now facing Up at (2,3)).\nTurn 2: Alice interacts (I) -> picks up an onion from (2,4).\n\nBut then she is holding an onion. Then she needs to take it to a pot. The pots are at (2,0) and (4,0). (2,0) is directly below her? So she can go down to (2,2) but (2,2) is a kitchen counter? Yes, (2,2) is in the kitchen counter list -> non-empty. So she cannot walk on it. Therefore, she must go around.\n\nFrom (2,3) she can move down to (2,2)? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty -> cannot walk. So she must go right to (3,3) and then down? Or left? But left is (1,3) -> is (1,3) empty? The kitchen counters: (0,3) and (6,3) -> so (1,3) should be empty? Similarly, (3,3) is empty? But (3,3) is her starting position and we know it's walkable.\n\nSo from (2,3) she can move right to (3,3) -> but that is going back? Then from (3,3) she can move down to (3,2) -> but (3,2) is a kitchen counter? Yes, so cannot walk. Alternatively, she can go down from (2,3) to (2,2) is blocked, so she must go to (1,3) then down to (1,2)? But (1,2) is not in the kitchen counter list? The kitchen counters at y=2: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2). So (1,2) should be empty? Then (1,1), (1,0) is kitchen counter? (1,0) is kitchen counter, but (1,1) is not? Because kitchen counters: (0,1) and (6,1) -> so (1,1) is empty.\n\nSo a path for Alice: \n- (2,3) -> move left to (1,3) [facing left] -> then down to (1,2) [facing down] -> then down to (1,1) [facing down] -> then right to (2,1) [facing right]? Then she is adjacent to the pot at (2,0) which is below? So she must face down to interact? But at (2,1) she is above the pot at (2,0). So she can face down and interact.\n\nBut that is 4 moves to get from (2,3) to (2,1) and then interact? Plus the initial steps to get the onion.\n\nAlternatively, she can go to the other pot at (4,0). But she is on the left side.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the kitchen counter for temporary storage? But we don't have anything to store yet.\n\nNow, let's consider Bob. Bob is at (3,1) facing down. He is near the pots: (2,0) and (4,0). He can easily go to a pot. Also, the plate dispenser is at (0,2). So Bob can get a plate and then serve? But we don't have soup yet.\n\nWe need to coordinate: Alice can get one onion and bring it to a pot, then go back for more? But one soup requires 3 onions. So we need three onions. We have two players.\n\nIdea: \n- Alice gets onions and brings them to a pot (say pot at (2,0)).\n- Bob can also get onions? But Bob is near the pots and plate dispenser. Alternatively, Bob can get the first plate and then wait? But we don't have soup yet.\n\nBut note: Bob is at (3,1). He can move to (4,0) to use that pot? Or (2,0). Let's assign one pot to each? But we have two onion dispensers.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Alice focus on one pot and Bob on the other? But we have only two players and each soup requires three onions. So one player making a soup would take three round trips.\n\nBut we can use the kitchen counters for temporary storage? For example, Alice can take an onion and put it on a kitchen counter near the pot, then Bob can pick it up and put it in the pot? That might save time.\n\nLet me think about the steps for the first soup:\n\nOption: Use the pot at (2,0). We need 3 onions.\n\nStep 1: Alice gets an onion and brings it to a kitchen counter near the pot? For example, (2,2) is a kitchen counter but it's non-empty? We cannot walk on it, but we can interact with it. So we can use (2,2) as a storage? But it's adjacent to the pot? Actually, the pot at (2,0) is below (2,1). The kitchen counter at (2,2) is above? So if Alice is at (2,3) with an onion, she can move to (2,2) but cannot because (2,2) is non-empty. So she must go around to (1,1) or (3,1) and then to (2,1) to interact with the pot? Or use a kitchen counter near the pot? The kitchen counters near the pot: at (2,2) is above, and (1,0) and (3,0) are adjacent? But (1,0) and (3,0) are kitchen counters? Yes. So we can use (1,0) or (3,0) for storage? But they are adjacent to the pot? \n\nThe pot at (2,0): adjacent tiles are (1,0), (3,0) [left and right] and (2,1) [above]? Because (2,-1) doesn't exist.\n\nSo if we put an onion on (1,0) or (3,0) or (2,1)? But (2,1) is empty? Yes, because kitchen counters are at (0,1) and (6,1) -> so (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) are empty? (3,1) is where Bob is, but he can move.\n\nSo we can use (2,1) as a temporary spot? But it's empty, so we can place an item there? But (2,1) is not a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters are specific tiles. We can only place items on kitchen counters? The problem says: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" And the interact for kitchen counter: if player is holding an item and the counter is empty, then place. But (2,1) is not a kitchen counter? So we cannot place an item there. Only on designated kitchen counters.\n\nThe kitchen counters are: (0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4). \n\nNear the pot at (2,0): we have kitchen counters at (1,0) and (3,0). Also, (0,0) and (0,1) are a bit far.\n\nSo Alice can bring an onion and place it on (1,0) or (3,0). Then Bob can pick it up and put it in the pot.\n\nBut Bob is at (3,1). He can easily go to (3,0) because (3,0) is a kitchen counter? But we cannot walk on non-empty tiles? (3,0) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty? So we cannot walk on it. But we can interact with it from adjacent? \n\nTo interact with (3,0) from where? Bob is at (3,1). He is above (3,0). So he can face down and interact? But (3,0) is below him? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, for (1,0): if we place an onion there, then Bob would have to go to (1,1) and face down to interact? But (1,1) is empty? Yes.\n\nSo plan:\n\nAlice gets an onion from (2,4):\n- Turn 0: Alice moves Left to (2,3) [facing Left].\n- Turn 1: Alice changes orientation to Up (to face the dispenser).\n- Turn 2: Alice interacts (I) -> picks up onion. Now holding onion.\n\nThen Alice brings it to the kitchen counter at (3,0) or (1,0)? Let's choose (1,0) because (3,0) is adjacent to Bob? But Bob might be using the pot at (2,0) which is adjacent to (1,0) and (3,0). We can choose (1,0).\n\nPath for Alice from (2,3) to (1,0) to place the onion on (1,0):\n- From (2,3) holding onion, move left to (1,3) [facing left] -> then down to (1,2) [facing down] -> then down to (1,1) [facing down]. Now at (1,1) and facing down. The kitchen counter at (1,0) is below her? So she can interact (facing down) to place the onion on (1,0).\n\nSteps:\n- Turn 3: Alice moves Left to (1,3) [facing left? because she moved left] -> now at (1,3) facing left.\n- Turn 4: Alice moves Down to (1,2) [facing down? because moved down] -> now at (1,2) facing down.\n- Turn 5: Alice moves Down to (1,1) [facing down] -> now at (1,1) facing down.\n- Turn 6: Alice interacts (I) to place the onion on (1,0). Now she is empty.\n\nThen she can go back for another onion.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can be doing something. Bob is at (3,1) facing down. He can also get an onion? Or he can pick up the onion from the kitchen counter and put it in the pot? But the pot at (2,0) is adjacent to (1,0)? No, (1,0) and (2,0) are adjacent? Yes, because (1,0) is left of (2,0). So if Bob is at (2,1) he can interact with (2,0) (the pot) and also with (1,0) (the kitchen counter) if he is at (1,1) or (2,1)? \n\nTo interact with (1,0), Bob must be adjacent and facing it. He can be at (1,1) facing down? Or at (0,0) or (2,0)? But (2,0) is a pot -> non-empty, cannot walk. So he must be at (0,0) or (1,1) or (0,1). But (0,0) and (0,1) are kitchen counters -> non-empty, cannot walk. So the only adjacent empty tile to (1,0) is (1,1) (above) and (0,0) is adjacent but not walkable? And (2,0) is adjacent but not walkable? Actually, (1,0) has:\n- Left: (0,0) [kitchen counter -> non-empty]\n- Right: (2,0) [pot -> non-empty]\n- Above: (1,1) [empty]\n\nSo the only accessible adjacent tile is (1,1). So Bob must be at (1,1) and facing down to interact with (1,0).\n\nSimilarly, for the pot at (2,0), the accessible adjacent tile is (2,1) (above) because (1,0) and (3,0) are non-empty and cannot be walked on, and (2,0) is non-empty? So to interact with the pot at (2,0), Bob must be at (2,1) and facing down.\n\nSo if we put an onion on (1,0), then Bob can:\n- Go to (1,1) and face down to pick it up? Then he is holding an onion. Then he can move to (2,1) and face down to put it in the pot.\n\nSteps for Bob to get the onion from (1,0) and put in pot at (2,0):\n- Turn ?: Bob moves to (1,1) and faces down? He is at (3,1) initially. He can move left to (2,1) [facing left] -> then left to (1,1) [facing left]. Then interact with (1,0) to pick up the onion. Then move right to (2,1) [facing right] -> then interact with the pot at (2,0) (facing down).\n\nBut note: after moving to (2,1) he is facing right? Then he must change orientation to down? Then interact.\n\nAlternatively, after picking up the onion at (1,1), he moves to (2,1) and then changes orientation to down and interacts.\n\nThis is very time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can be getting his own onion? But he is far from the onion dispensers.\n\nAnother idea: Bob can start by getting a plate? But we don't have soup yet. Or he can help with the pot.\n\nBut let's think about the entire process for one soup:\n\nWe need 3 onions in the pot. If Alice brings all three, it will take a long time. So Bob should also help.\n\nBob is at (3,1). He can go to the onion dispenser at (4,4)? That is far: from (3,1) to (4,4): \n- Move right to (4,1) -> up to (4,2) but (4,2) is kitchen counter -> cannot walk. So he must go around: (3,1) -> (3,2) is kitchen counter -> blocked. So go (3,1) -> (4,1) [right] -> then (4,2) is blocked, so go (5,1) [right] -> then (5,2) is not in kitchen counter? Kitchen counters: (5,0), (5,4) -> so (5,1), (5,2), (5,3) are empty? Then from (5,1) to (5,2) [up] -> (5,3) [up] -> (5,4) is kitchen counter, so cannot walk. But the onion dispenser is at (4,4) and (2,4). (4,4) is an onion dispenser -> non-empty, so he must be at (4,3) to interact? \n\nSo Bob from (3,1):\n- Turn 0: move right to (4,1) [facing right]\n- Turn 1: move right to (5,1) [facing right] (since (4,2) is blocked, he cannot move up from (4,1))\n- Turn 2: move up to (5,2) [facing up]\n- Turn 3: move up to (5,3) [facing up]\n- Turn 4: change orientation to left? Because he needs to face the onion dispenser at (4,4) which is to the left? But (4,4) is at (4,4) and he is at (5,3). He is not adjacent to (4,4). (4,4) is one up and one left from (5,3)? So he needs to move to (4,3) first? But (4,3) is not in kitchen counter? Kitchen counters at y=3: (0,3), (6,3) -> so (4,3) is empty? Yes.\n\nSo:\n- Turn 4: move left to (4,3) [facing left]\n- Turn 5: change orientation to up (to face the dispenser at (4,4) which is above)\n- Turn 6: interact to get onion.\n\nThen he has to bring it back to a pot. That's at least 7 turns for one onion.\n\nThis is too slow.\n\nTherefore, it's better for Alice to handle the onions and for Bob to handle the pot and plates.\n\nBut Alice cannot carry more than one onion at a time. So she has to make three trips.\n\nTo save time, Alice can put the onion on a kitchen counter near the onion dispenser? For example, at (2,3) or (3,3) or (1,3)? But (2,3) is empty, but it's not a kitchen counter -> we can only use designated kitchen counters. The nearest kitchen counter to (2,4) is (1,4) or (3,4) or (0,3) or (0,4)? (1,4) and (3,4) are kitchen counters. (1,4) is at (1,4), which is adjacent to (2,4)? No, (1,4) is left of (2,4) and (3,4) is right of (2,4)? So if Alice is at (2,3), she can move to (1,3) and then up to (1,4) [kitchen counter] and place the onion there? But then she has to come back to get it later? That might not save time.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the kitchen counter at (3,2) or (2,2) but they are blocked by kitchen counters? (2,2) is a kitchen counter, so we can use it. But it's below.\n\nBut the point is to have a stock of onions near the pot.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's focus on one soup with one player (Alice) bringing onions and the other (Bob) managing the pot and then serving.\n\nPlan for the first soup in the pot at (2,0):\n\nAlice will bring three onions. Each onion takes:\n- 2 turns to get (move to (2,3), face up, interact) and then 3 turns to move to (1,1) and then interact to place on (1,0) [as we had earlier]? But we don't have to place it on the kitchen counter every time. She can bring it directly to the pot? But the pot is at (2,0), and she can be at (2,1) and face down to interact with the pot. But how to get to (2,1)? From (2,3) she can't go down because (2,2) is a kitchen counter. So she must go around: (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1). Then at (2,1) face down and interact to put in the pot.\n\nSo for one onion:\n- Alice: \n  - Turn 0: Left to (2,3)\n  - Turn 1: Up (orientation) to face the dispenser\n  - Turn 2: Interact to get onion\n  - Turn 3: Left to (1,3)\n  - Turn 4: Down to (1,2)\n  - Turn 5: Down to (1,1)\n  - Turn 6: Right to (2,1)\n  - Turn 7: Down (orientation) to face the pot\n  - Turn 8: Interact to put onion in pot.\n\nThat's 9 turns for one onion. For three onions, 27 turns. Then the pot will have 3 onions and start cooking at turn 8 (after the first onion is put) but then we add two more, so the cooking starts after the third onion is put. Then cooking takes 5 turns. Then we need to serve.\n\nBut 27 turns is too long. And we are only planning for a few turns (H turns, but H is not specified, but typically we plan for a short horizon).\n\nWe must use Bob to help.\n\nBob can bring the second and third onion? But he is far away.\n\nAlternatively, after Alice puts the first onion, the pot has one onion. Then Alice goes for the second onion, and in the meantime, Bob can bring the second onion? But Bob is not near the onions.\n\nAnother idea: Alice gets one onion and puts it in the pot, then while the pot is cooking, she gets the next two onions and puts them in the other pot? But we have two pots.\n\nBut the other pot is at (4,0). Alice is on the left side.\n\nLet's try to use both players to fill one pot quickly.\n\nAlice gets one onion and brings it to the pot at (2,0) as above (9 turns). In the meantime, Bob can get an onion from the other dispenser at (4,4) and bring it to the same pot? But it will take Bob many turns to get to (4,4) and back.\n\nBob from (3,1) to (4,4) and back to (2,1) to put in the pot:\n\nTo (4,4):\n- Turn 0: move right to (4,1) [ facing right]\n- Turn 1: move right to (5,1) [ facing right]\n- Turn 2: move up to (5,2) [ facing up]\n- Turn 3: move up to (5,3) [ facing up]\n- Turn 4: move left to (4,3) [ facing left]\n- Turn 5: change orientation to up [ to face (4,4)]\n- Turn 6: interact to get onion.\n\nThen from (4,3) to (2,1) to put in the pot at (2,0):\n- From (4,3): move down to (4,2) but (4,2) is kitchen counter -> cannot walk. So move left to (3,3) [ but (3,3) is empty? and (3,2) is kitchen counter -> so from (4,3) move left to (3,3) [facing left] -> then down to (3,2) is blocked, so move left to (2,3) [facing left] -> then down to (2,2) is blocked, so move down to (3,2) blocked, so must go to (2,3) and then to (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1). Then face down and interact.\n\nThis is very long.\n\nTherefore, a better strategy might be to have both players work on different pots. But then each player has to make three trips for one soup, which is still long.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps we should start with Alice getting one onion and Bob getting a plate and being ready to serve, but we need three onions.\n\nSince the planning horizon is not specified, we might plan for the first few turns to initiate the process.\n\nLet's do a simple start:\n\nTurn 0:\n- Alice: move Left to (2,3) [ to get closer to onion dispenser]\n- Bob: move Left to (2,1) [ to get closer to the pot at (2,0)]\n\nThen Turn 1:\n- Alice: change orientation to Up (so she can interact with the dispenser at (2,4))\n- Bob: change orientation to Down (so he can interact with the pot at (2,0))\n\nThen Turn 2:\n- Alice: Interact to get an onion.\n- Bob: cannot interact yet because the pot is empty. So Bob should do something else. Perhaps Bob should go to the plate dispenser to get a plate? But we don't have soup yet.\n\nTurn 2 for Bob: move Down? But (2,0) is non-empty, so he can't move down. He can only interact if there's something to do. Since the pot is empty, interact does nothing? So he should go for a plate or for an onion.\n\nLet's have Bob go to the plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nBob at (2,1) after Turn 0. To go to (0,2):\n- (2,1) -> move left to (1,1) [facing left]\n- then move left to (0,1) [facing left] -> but (0,1) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, cannot walk. So he must go via (0,0) or (0,2)? (0,2) is the plate dispenser, non-empty, cannot walk. The only way is to be at (0,1) or (1,2) or (0,3) to interact with (0,2)? (0,2) has:\n- Left: ( -1,2) invalid\n- Right: (1,2) [empty? kitchen counters are (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) -> so (1,2) is empty]\n- Above: (0,3) [kitchen counter]\n- Below: (0,1) [kitchen counter]\n\nSo to interact with (0,2), Bob must be at (1,2) and facing left.\n\nSo from (2,1):\n- Turn 1: after Turn 0 he is at (2,1) facing left (because he moved left on Turn 0).\n- Turn 1: move up? but (2,2) is kitchen counter, blocked. So move left to (1,1) [facing left].\n- Turn 2: move up to (1,2) [facing up] -> because moved up.\n- Then Turn 3: change orientation to left to face the plate dispenser at (0,2).\n- Turn 4: interact to get a plate.\n\nThen he can hold the plate and wait for the soup to be ready.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice can be getting onions and putting them in the pot.\n\nSo for the first few turns, we can plan:\n\nTurn 0:\n  Alice: L (move left to (2,3))\n  Bob: L (move left to (2,1))\n\nTurn 1:\n  Alice: U (change orientation to Up to face the dispenser)\n  Bob: D (change orientation to Down to face the pot)  [but then he will change to go to the plate dispenser, so this might be wasted]\n\nAlternatively, on Turn 1, Bob should start moving toward the plate dispenser.\n\nRevised:\n\nTurn 0:\n  Alice: L  # to (2,3)\n  Bob: L   # to (2,1)\n\nTurn 1:\n  Alice: U  # face up at (2,3)\n  Bob: U   # to face up? but he is at (2,1) and (2,2) is blocked, so he cannot move up. So he can only change orientation? Let's have him move left to (1,1) on Turn 1.\n\nTurn 1:\n  Alice: U (orientation change to Up)\n  Bob: L (move left to (1,1))\n\nTurn 2:\n  Alice: I (interact to get onion)\n  Bob: U (move up to (1,2))  [now at (1,2) facing up]\n\nTurn 3:\n  Alice: L (move left to (1,3))  [now at (1,3) facing left]\n  Bob: L (change orientation to left to face the plate dispenser at (0,2))\n\nTurn 4:\n  Alice: D (move down to (1,2))  [now at (1,2) facing down]  -- but note: at Turn 3, Bob is at (1,2) and on Turn 4, Alice is moving to (1,2) -> cannot, because players cannot walk onto each other. So collision.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid collision.\n\nOn Turn 3, Alice is at (1,3) and wants to move down to (1,2), but on Turn 2, Bob moved to (1,2) and on Turn 3, Bob is still at (1,2) (only changed orientation). So on Turn 4, Alice cannot move to (1,2) because Bob is there.\n\nSo we need to coordinate to avoid the same cell.\n\nFor Alice, after getting the onion at (2,3) on Turn 2, she can go down by a different route? Or wait.\n\nAlternatively, Alice can go to the other onion dispenser at (4,4) and use the other pot at (4,0) to avoid conflict.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nAlice at (3,3) initially.\n\nTurn 0: Alice move Right to (4,3) [facing right]\nTurn 1: Alice move Up to (4,4) -> cannot because (4,4) is onion dispenser, non-empty. So she must move to (4,3) and then face up and interact.\n\nTurn 0: Alice: R to (4,3) facing right.\nTurn 1: Alice: U (orientation change to up) to face (4,4)\nTurn 2: Alice: I to get onion.\n\nThen she can go to the pot at (4,0). From (4,3) to (4,0): \n- (4,3) -> move down to (4,2) is blocked (kitchen counter). So must go around: (4,3) -> (5,3) [right] -> (5,2) [down] -> (5,1) [down] -> (5,0) is kitchen counter, so cannot. Then to (4,1) [left] -> then (4,0) is pot, non-empty, so cannot walk. So she must be at (4,1) to interact with the pot at (4,0) (facing down).\n\nHow to get to (4,1):\n- From (4,3): move right to (5,3) [facing right]\n- move down to (5,2) [facing down] -> (5,2) is empty? Yes.\n- move down to (5,1) [facing down]\n- move left to (4,1) [facing left]\n\nThen face down and interact to put in the pot.\n\nSo turns for one onion: 2 ( to get) + 4 ( to move) = 6 turns, then interact on turn 7.\n\nBetter than the left side.\n\nSo for the first onion in the right pot (4,0):\n\nTurn 0: Alice: R to (4,3)\nTurn 1: Alice: U (orientation up)\nTurn 2: Alice: I (get onion)\nTurn 3: Alice: R to (5,3)\nTurn 4: Alice: D to (5,2)\nTurn 5: Alice: D to (5,1)\nTurn 6: Alice: L to (4,1)\nTurn 7: Alice: D (orientation down) to face the pot\nTurn 8: Alice: I (put onion)\n\nThen she can go for the next onion.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can work on the left pot at (2,0) or also on the right pot? If both work on the same pot, they might conflict.\n\nFor the first few turns, let's have Alice work on the right pot and Bob work on the left pot.\n\nBob for the left pot:\n- He is at (3,1) facing down.\n- He can move to (2,1) and face down to interact with the pot.\n- But to put an onion, he needs to have an onion. So he must first get an onion from (2,4) or (4,4). (2,4) is closer.\n\nBob to (2,4) to get an onion:\n\nFrom (3,1):\n- Turn 0: move left to (2,1) [facing left]\n- Turn 1: move up? (2,2) is kitchen counter, blocked. So move to (1,1) [left from (2,1) to (1,1)] -> facing left.\n- Turn 2: move up to (1,2) [facing up]\n- Turn 3: move up to (1,3) [facing up]\n- Turn 4: move right to (2,3) [facing right]\n- Turn 5: change orientation to up (to face (2,4))\n- Turn 6: interact to get onion.\n\nThen from (2,3) to the pot at (2,0): must go around: (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> face down and interact.\n\n- Turn 7: move left to (1,3) [facing left]\n- Turn 8: move down to (1,2) [facing down]\n- Turn 9: move down to (1,1) [facing down]\n- Turn 10: move right to (2,1) [facing right]\n- Turn 11: change orientation to down\n- Turn 12: interact to put in pot.\n\nSo it takes Bob 13 turns to deliver one onion.\n\nTherefore, it's better for Bob to focus on plates and serving.\n\nLet's plan the first few turns (say 5-10 turns) to get the process started.\n\nWe are at turn 0.\n\nPlan for turns 0 to 5:\n\nAlice will head to the right onion dispenser and get an onion.\n\nBob will head to the plate dispenser to get a plate and then wait near the serving counter or the pot.\n\nTurn 0:\n  Alice: R (move to (4,3), facing right)\n  Bob: L (move to (2,1), facing left)\n\nTurn 1:\n  Alice: U (change orientation to up)\n  Bob: U (change orientation to up? but then he can't move up because (2,2) is blocked. So instead, he should move to (1,1) to head to the plate dispenser)\n  So: Alice: U, Bob: L (move left to (1,1))\n\nTurn 2:\n  Alice: I (interact with (4,4) to get onion)\n  Bob: U (move up to (1,2))  [facing up]\n\nTurn 3:\n  Alice: R (move to (5,3), facing right)  # to start moving down to the pot\n  Bob: L (change orientation to left to face the plate dispenser at (0,2))\n\nTurn 4:\n  Alice: D (move to (5,2), facing down)\n  Bob: I (interact with (0,2) to get a plate)\n\nTurn 5:\n  Alice: D ( move to (5,1), facing down)\n  Bob: ?  # now holding a plate. He can move to the serving counter or to the pot. But the soup is not ready. He should wait near the serving counter or near the pot where the soup will be. Since the first soup is being prepared on the right by Alice, he should go to the right side? But he is on the left.\n\nAlternatively, he can deliver any soup, so he can wait near the serving counter.\n\nThe serving counter is at (6,2). From (1,2) holding a plate, he can:\n- move right to (2,2) -> but (2,2) is kitchen counter -> cannot walk. So must go down or up then right.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (6,2):\n- (1,2) -> move down to (1,1) [facing down] -> then right to (2,1) [facing right] -> then right to (3,1) [facing right] -> then right to (4,1) [facing right] -> then up to (4,2) is blocked, so move right to (5,1) [facing right] -> then up to (5,2) [facing up] -> then right to (6,2) [facing right] -> then interact to serve? but we don't have soup yet.\n\nOr from (1,2) move to (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (6,1) [ which is kitchen counter, blocked] -> so must go to (6,2) from (5,2) as above.\n\nThis is long, so perhaps he should wait at (5,1) or (5,2) for the soup on the right.\n\nBut let's see the state after Turn 5:\n- Alice is at (5,1) and will move to (4,1) on Turn 6, then face down and put the onion in the pot at (4,0) on Turn 8.\n- The pot will then have one onion. We need two more.\n\nSo Bob might as well get the next onion for the right pot? But he has a plate in hand, so he cannot grab an onion. He must deliver the plate somewhere? He can put the plate on a kitchen counter and then get an onion.\n\nFor example, at (1,2) after getting the plate, he can place it on the kitchen counter at (1,2) if it's empty? But (1,2) is not a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters are at (0,0), (1,0), ... but (1,2) is not in the list. The list has (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) -> so (1,2) is not a kitchen counter. So he cannot place it there.\n\nHe can place it on a kitchen counter that is empty and nearby. The nearest might be (0,3) or (0,1) or (1,0) or (3,2) -> (3,2) is a kitchen counter, but it's at (3,2) and he is at (1,2). So he would have to move to (3,2) but (2,2) is a kitchen counter and blocks the way.\n\nSo perhaps (1,0) is the nearest kitchen counter? To place on (1,0), he must be at (1,1) facing down.\n\nFrom (1,2) holding plate:\n- Turn 4: he is at (1,2) after getting the plate.\n- Turn 5: move down to (1,1) [facing down]\n- Turn 6: change orientation to down (if not already) and interact to place the plate on (1,0) (kitchen counter).\n\nThen he is free to get an onion.\n\nBut then he can go to the onion dispenser.\n\nThis is getting very complex for a short plan.\n\nGiven the constraints, I will plan the first few turns to get the first onion in the pot on the right by Alice and have Bob get a plate and wait at a strategic position.\n\nFor example, after Bob gets the plate, he can move to (5,1) or (5,2) to be near the right pot and serving counter.\n\nSo turns:\n\nTurn 0:\n  Alice: R  # to (4,3)\n  Bob: L   # to (2,1)\n\nTurn 1:\n  Alice: U  # face up at (4,3)\n  Bob: L   # to (1,1)\n\nTurn 2:\n  Alice: I  # get onion from (4,4)\n  Bob: U   # to (1,2)\n\nTurn 3:\n  Alice: R  # to (5,3)\n  Bob: L   # face left to interact with plate dispenser\n\nTurn 4:\n  Alice: D  # to (5,2)\n  Bob: I   # get plate from (0,2)\n\nTurn 5:\n  Alice: D  # to (5,1)\n  Bob: R   # move right to (2,2)? cannot, because (2,2) is kitchen counter. So move down to (1,1) [facing down] -> then right to (2,1) [facing right]\n\nTurn 6:\n  Alice: L  # to (4,1)\n  Bob: R  # to (3,1) [facing right]\n\nTurn 7:\n  Alice: D  # change orientation to down to face the pot at (4,0)\n  Bob: R  # to (4,1) [facing right] -> but on Turn 6, Alice is moving to (4,1) at Turn 6, so at Turn 7, Alice is at (4,1) and will change orientation, and Bob wants to move to (4,1) -> collision.\n\nSo to avoid, on Turn 5, after Alice moves to (5,1), on Turn 6 she moves to (4,1), so at Turn 6, Alice will be at (4,1). Then on Turn 6, Bob should not move to (2,1) if that is not on the way, but we want him to go to the right.\n\nAfter Turn 4, Bob is at (1,2) holding a plate. Instead of moving down, he can move up to (1,3) and then right to (2,3), etc., but that is away from the serving counter.\n\nGiven the complexity, and since the serving counter is at (6,2), perhaps Bob should move to (6,1) or (5,2) to wait.\n\nBut (5,2) is empty? Yes. And (6,2) is serving counter -> non-empty, cannot walk, so he can be at (6,1) or (5,2) or (6,3) to interact with (6,2). The adjacent empty tiles to (6,2) are (5,2), (6,1), (6,3). (6,1) and (6,3) are kitchen counters -> non-empty, cannot walk. So only (5,2) is available. So he must be at (5,2) and facing right to interact with (6,2).\n\nSo from (1,2) to (5,2):\n- (1,2) -> move right to (2,2) blocked. So must go down to (1,1) -> then right to (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> then to (5,1) -> then up to (5,2).\n\nBut (4,2) is kitchen counter, so from (4,1) cannot move up. So (4,1) -> (5,1) [ move right] -> then (5,2) [ move up].\n\nSo:\nTurn 5: Bob move down to (1,1) [ from (1,2) facing down]\nTurn 6: Bob move right to (2,1) [ facing right]\nTurn 7: Bob move right to (3,1) [ facing right]\nTurn 8: Bob move right to (4,1) [ facing right]\nTurn 9: Bob move right to (5,1) [ facing right]\nTurn 10: Bob move up to (5,2) [ facing up]\nTurn 11: Bob change orientation to right to face the serving counter.\n\nThen wait.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice will have delivered the first onion to the pot at (4,0) on Turn 8 ( as per earlier calculation: at Turn 7 she faces down, Turn 8 interact to put onion).\n\nThen she goes for the second onion.\n\nSo for the first 5 turns, we can output:\n\nTurn 0: Alice=R, Bob=L\nTurn 1: Alice=U, Bob=L  # Bob moves to (1,1)\nTurn 2: Alice=I, Bob=U  # Bob moves to (1,2)\nTurn 3: Alice=R, Bob=L  # Bob changes orientation to left ( to face the plate dispenser)\nTurn 4: Alice=D, Bob=I  # Bob gets plate\nTurn 5: Alice=D, Bob=D  # Bob moves down to (1,1) and Alice moves down to (5,1)\n\nBut then for Turn 6, Alice will move to (4,1) and Bob to (2,1) or something.\n\nSince the problem asks for a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally for Bob), and the answer format is for both, but the task says \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", so we can plan for both.\n\nTo keep it simple, I'll plan for the first 5 turns as above.\n\nBut on Turn 5, when Alice moves down to (5,1), she is at (5,1) and Bob is moving down to (1,1) -> no conflict.\n\nThen Turn 6:\n  Alice: L to (4,1)\n  Bob: R to (2,1)   # from (1,1) move right to (2,1)\n\nTurn 7:\n  Alice: D (orientation down to face the pot)\n  Bob: R to (3,1)\n\nTurn 8:\n  Alice: I ( put onion in pot at (4,0) )\n  Bob: R to (4,1)   # but at Turn 7, Alice is at (4,1) and on Turn 8 she is still there (only changing orientation and interacting) -> so at Turn 8, Alice is at (4,1) and Bob wants to move to (4,1) -> conflict.\n\nSo on Turn 8, Bob should not move to (4,1). Instead, on Turn 7, after Alice orients down, on Turn 8 she interacts and remains at (4,1). So Bob should not be moving to (4,1) on Turn 8.\n\nPerhaps on Turn 7, Bob should move to (3,1) and then on Turn 8 move to (3,2) but (3,2) is kitchen counter -> cannot. So he must move to (4,1) on Turn 8, which will conflict.\n\nTherefore, we should have Bob move to (5,1) and (5,2) after Turn 5 without going to (4,1) when Alice is there.\n\nAfter Turn 5, Bob is at (1,1). Instead of moving right immediately, he can wait or move in a way that avoids the right until Alice has left (4,1).\n\nAlice will be at (4,1) on Turn 6 and 7, and on Turn 8 she is still there (interacting). Then on Turn 9 she might leave to get another onion.\n\nSo Bob can take a different route or wait.\n\nSince this is very time-sensitive and we are only planning a few turns, I'll stop at Turn 5.\n\nSo for turns 0 to 4:\n\nTurn 0: Alice=R, Bob=L\nTurn 1: Alice=U, Bob=L  # Bob moves to (1,1)\nTurn 2: Alice=I, Bob=U  # Bob moves to (1,2)\nTurn 3: Alice=R, Bob=L  # Bob faces left towards the plate dispenser\nTurn 4: Alice=D, Bob=I  # Bob gets a plate\n\nThen for Turn 5, we can say:\nTurn 5: Alice=D, Bob=D  # Alice moves to (5,1), Bob moves to (1,1)\n\nAnd then we stop.\n\nThis is a start.\n\nSo in the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: R, L\nTurn 1: U, L\nTurn 2: I, U\nTurn 3: R, L\nTurn 4: D, I\nTurn 5: D, D\n}\n\nBut this is for both players. The task says \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", so we must provide for Alice, and optionally for Bob. But to coordinate, we provide for both.\n\nIf only Alice is required, then we would only give Alice's actions, but then we cannot coordinate. So I think we need to give both.\n\nSo I'll output the above.\n\nNote: in Turn 3, Bob's action 'L' is a change orientation to left, because he is at (1,2) and wants to face the plate dispenser at (0,2) which is to the left. So it's orientation change.\n\nIn Turn 4, Bob's 'I' is to interact and get the plate.\n\nIn Turn 5, Alice's 'D' is to move down to (5,1), and Bob's 'D' is to move down to (1,1).\n\nAfter that, we can continue, but for the sake of the problem, this is a reasonable start.\n\nSo the answer is as above.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes in *Overcooked*, Alice and Bob must coordinate efficiently. Given the current game state at turn \\( t_1 = 0 \\), the optimal plan focuses on initiating the preparation of an onion soup in the pot at (4,0) (right pot) and having Bob secure a plate for future serving. Alice will handle onion gathering and delivery to the pot, while Bob retrieves a plate and positions himself near the serving counter. The sequence for the next 6 turns (horizon \\( H = 6 \\)) is designed to avoid collisions and set up for subsequent onion deliveries and soup serving.\n\n### **Plan Justification**\n- **Alice's Role**: Alice starts at (3,3) and moves toward the onion dispenser at (4,4) to grab an onion. She then navigates to the pot at (4,0) to deliver the first onion. The path avoids kitchen counters and ensures she faces correctly for interactions.\n- **Bob's Role**: Bob starts at (3,1) and moves toward the plate dispenser at (0,2) to grab a plate. He then begins positioning near the serving counter at (6,2) to be ready for future soup delivery. His path avoids conflicts with Alice and non-walkable tiles.\n- **Coordination**: By turns 5–6, Alice is delivering the first onion to the pot, and Bob is moving toward the serving area. This sets up for Alice to fetch more onions while Bob waits near the serving counter, minimizing idle time.\n\n### **Action Sequence**\nThe following actions are planned for turns 0 to 5. Alice's actions are optimized for onion delivery, and Bob's actions focus on plate retrieval and positioning. Actions ensure both players avoid collisions and face correctly for interactions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: R, L \\\\\nTurn 1: U, L \\\\\nTurn 2: I, U \\\\\nTurn 3: R, L \\\\\nTurn 4: D, I \\\\\nTurn 5: D, D\n}\n\n### **Detailed Breakdown**\n- **Turn 0**:\n  - Alice moves right (R) to (4,3), facing right. This positions her adjacent to the onion dispenser at (4,4).\n  - Bob moves left (L) to (2,1), facing left. This starts his journey toward the plate dispenser.\n- **Turn 1**:\n  - Alice changes orientation to up (U) at (4,3) to face the onion dispenser at (4,4).\n  - Bob moves left (L) to (1,1), facing left. This avoids the kitchen counter at (2,2) and progresses to the plate dispenser.\n- **Turn 2**:\n  - Alice interacts (I) to grab an onion from (4,4). She is now holding an onion.\n  - Bob moves up (U) to (1,2), facing up. This positions him adjacent to the plate dispenser at (0,2).\n- **Turn 3**:\n  - Alice moves right (R) to (5,3), facing right. This begins her path down to the pot at (4,0), avoiding the kitchen counter at (4,2).\n  - Bob changes orientation to left (L) at (1,2) to face the plate dispenser at (0,2).\n- **Turn 4**:\n  - Alice moves down (D) to (5,2), facing down. This continues her path toward the pot.\n  - Bob interacts (I) to grab a plate from (0,2). He is now holding a plate.\n- **Turn 5**:\n  - Alice moves down (D) to (5,1), facing down. This positions her to move left to (4,1) next.\n  - Bob moves down (D) to (1,1), facing down. This starts his journey toward the serving counter, avoiding conflicts with Alice.\n\n### **Next Steps (Beyond Turn 5)**\n- **Alice**: On turn 6, move left (L) to (4,1), then face down (D) and interact (I) to deliver the onion to the pot at (4,0). Repeat onion gathering and delivery for the remaining two onions (total 3 required for soup).\n- **Bob**: Move right to (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), then up to (5,2). Face right (R) and wait near the serving counter at (6,2). Once soup is cooked (after 5 turns from the third onion), interact to serve.\n- **Reward Potential**: The first soup (3 onions) yields 20 points. With efficient coordination, a second soup can be started in the other pot (at (2,0)) while the first cooks, maximizing rewards.",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 4. The goal is to plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob) to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes.\n\nFirst, note the environment:\n- Onion dispensers at (2,4) and (4,4)\n- Plate dispenser at (0,2)\n- Pots at (2,0) and (4,0)\n- Serving counter at (6,2)\n\nRecipe: only one recipe is given: 3 onions, reward 20, cooking time 5 turns.\n\nCurrent state:\n- Alice: at (4,3), facing right (R), holding nothing. Action history: S, S, S, R (so she was stationary for first 3 turns, then moved right to (4,3) at turn 4).\n- Bob: at (1,3), facing up (U), holding nothing. Action history: L, L, U, U (so he moved left twice and then up twice, ending at (1,3)).\n\nAll kitchen counters are empty and all pots are empty.\n\nWe need to deliver soup as quickly as possible. The recipe requires 3 onions. Since there are no tomatoes, we only have onions.\n\nPlan:\nWe have two pots. We can use one of them. We need to collect onions and put them in a pot. Then wait for the pot to cook (5 turns) and then serve.\n\nSteps for one soup:\n1. A player picks up an onion from a dispenser.\n2. The player puts the onion into a pot.\n3. Repeat step 1 and 2 until 3 onions are in the pot (the pot will start cooking automatically when the third onion is added).\n4. After 5 turns of cooking, a player picks up a plate and then serves the soup at the serving counter.\n\nSince we have two players, we can coordinate to do multiple tasks in parallel.\n\nLet's assign roles:\n\nOption 1: Alice focuses on the pot at (4,0) because she is near (4,3) and can move down to (4,2) then to (4,1) and then to (4,0). But note: the grid has kitchen counters at (3,0), (5,0), (0,0), etc. We must check the path.\n\nThe grid is 7x5? From the tile list, x from 0 to 6, y from 0 to 4.\n\nAlice at (4,3). She can move down to (4,2). (4,2) is a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters are at (3,2), (4,2), (2,2) ... so (4,2) is a kitchen counter. But note: players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles? Actually, the tile types: kitchen counter is non-empty? The problem says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and \"Kitchen Counter\" is a non-empty tile? But in the description, it's a tile that can be used for storage, so it is a non-empty tile meaning it's not walkable? Actually, the problem says: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and the others are non-empty and not walkable? But then how do we interact? We must be adjacent and facing.\n\nRe-read: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So we cannot step on a kitchen counter. Therefore, (4,2) is a kitchen counter and cannot be walked on. So Alice cannot go down to (4,2) because that tile is a kitchen counter and not walkable.\n\nSimilarly, the pot at (4,0) is at (4,0). How do we get to the pot? We must be adjacent and facing it. The adjacent tiles to (4,0) are (3,0), (5,0), (4,1). But (3,0) and (5,0) are kitchen counters (non-empty, so not walkable). And (4,1) is an empty tile? We don't have a list of empty tiles, but we can infer: any tile not listed as one of the non-empty types is empty.\n\nNon-empty tiles are:\n- Kitchen Counter: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (3, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (0, 1), (6, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (0, 3), (6, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (3, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4)]\n- Onion Dispenser: [(2,4), (4,4)]\n- Plate Dispenser: [(0,2)]\n- Pot: [(2,0), (4,0)]\n- Serving Counter: [(6,2)]\n\nSo (4,1) is not in any of these, so it is an empty tile -> walkable.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1), (5,1) are not listed -> empty.\n\nTherefore, to access the pot at (4,0), we must be at one of the adjacent empty tiles: (3,0) is kitchen counter (non-walkable), (5,0) is kitchen counter (non-walkable), (4,1) is empty. So the only adjacent tile we can stand on is (4,1) and then face down (D) to interact with the pot at (4,0).\n\nSimilarly, for the pot at (2,0): adjacent tiles are (1,0) [kitchen counter], (3,0) [kitchen counter], (2,1) [empty?]. (2,1) is not listed in non-empty, so empty. So we can stand at (2,1) and face down to interact.\n\nNow, Alice is at (4,3). How to get to (4,1) to access the pot at (4,0)?\n\nPath: (4,3) -> (4,2) is kitchen counter, so cannot go down. Instead, we can go left to (3,3) or right to (5,3). (3,3): is it empty? Not listed in non-empty, so yes. (5,3): kitchen counter at (5,4) and (6,3) but (5,3) is not listed -> empty? Actually, (5,4) is kitchen counter, but (5,3) is not listed -> empty.\n\nBut we need to get to (4,1). From (4,3), we can go left to (3,3) then down to (3,2) but (3,2) is kitchen counter -> not walkable. Alternatively, from (3,3) we can go down to (3,2) but cannot because (3,2) is non-walkable. So we must go around.\n\nAlternative path: (4,3) -> left to (3,3) -> then down to (3,2) is blocked? (3,2) is a kitchen counter. So we cannot go to (3,2). Then we can go from (3,3) to (3,4)? (3,4) is a kitchen counter -> cannot. So (3,3) is surrounded? Actually, (3,3) is empty and adjacent to (3,2) [kitchen counter], (2,3) [empty? not listed], (4,3) [empty], (3,4) [kitchen counter]. So (2,3) is empty? Yes, because not listed. So from (3,3) we can go left to (2,3). Then from (2,3) we can go down to (2,2) but (2,2) is kitchen counter -> cannot. So we are stuck? \n\nWait, let me list the empty tiles: any coordinate not in the non-empty list is empty. So for example, (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) [Bob is at (1,3), so it must be walkable?], (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3) [Alice is here], (5,1), (5,2) [is (5,2) empty? Not in non-empty list -> empty], (5,3), etc.\n\nSo a path for Alice to (4,1):\n- From (4,3) we can go right to (5,3) [empty] -> then down to (5,2) [empty] -> then left to (4,2) but (4,2) is kitchen counter -> cannot. Alternatively, from (5,3) go down to (5,2) then down to (5,1) [empty] -> then left to (4,1) [empty]. That works: (4,3) -> R (to 5,3) -> D (to 5,2) -> D (to 5,1) -> L (to 4,1). Then at (4,1) facing left? But we need to face down to interact with the pot at (4,0). So after moving to (4,1), we need to change orientation to down.\n\nAlternatively, we can go from (4,3) down? But (4,2) is blocked. So the above path is one way.\n\nBut note: the onion dispenser at (4,4) is above Alice. Alice is at (4,3). (4,4) is an onion dispenser. She is adjacent to (4,4) if she moves up? But she is at (4,3) and (4,4) is above. So if she moves up to (4,4) but (4,4) is an onion dispenser -> non-empty tile, so she cannot walk on it. Instead, she must be adjacent and facing it to interact. Currently, she is at (4,3) and facing right (R). To interact with the onion dispenser at (4,4), she must be facing up? Because (4,4) is above her. But she is facing right. So she would need to change orientation to up and then interact.\n\nBut she is holding nothing, so she can grab an onion from the dispenser.\n\nAlternatively, Bob is at (1,3). He is near the onion dispenser at (2,4)? How? (1,3) to (2,3) is one step right, then (2,3) to (2,4) is up? But (2,4) is an onion dispenser, so he cannot step on it. He can stand at (2,3) and face up to interact.\n\nAlso, the plate dispenser is at (0,2). Bob is at (1,3). How to get there? From (1,3) go left to (0,3) [kitchen counter? (0,3) is kitchen counter -> not walkable. So he cannot go left. He can go down? (1,2) is empty? Not listed -> empty. So (1,3) -> D to (1,2). Then from (1,2) to (0,2) is the plate dispenser? (0,2) is non-empty, so cannot step. He can stand at (1,2) and face left to interact with the plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nNow, let's plan:\n\nWe want to make a soup in the pot at (4,0) because Alice is closer to it. But note that the pot at (2,0) is also available. We can choose one.\n\nBut Alice is at (4,3) and there is an onion dispenser at (4,4) above her. She can grab an onion from (4,4) without moving, by changing orientation to up and then interact.\n\nCurrent turn: t1=4. We are planning for the next H turns. We don't know H, but we can plan until we deliver the soup.\n\nStep-by-step:\n\nTurn 5 (t1+1=5):\n- Alice: currently at (4,3), facing right. She is holding nothing. She can change orientation to up (U) to face the onion dispenser at (4,4). Then she can interact to grab an onion. But note: to interact, she must be adjacent and facing. She is adjacent (above her) and if she faces up, she can interact. So action: change orientation to U? But the action set: we can change orientation without moving. But the action is one of {U, D, L, R, I, S}. If we choose U, that is a move? The problem says: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" and \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" Actually, the problem says:\n\n\"Each player can:\n- Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\n- Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThis is confusing. Let me read again: \n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nBut that doesn't make sense. I think it's a typo. Actually, the standard in Overcooked is that changing orientation doesn't move. The problem says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This might mean that if you try to move in a direction and the adjacent tile is not empty, then you don't move but you change orientation? But that is the same as the move action? \n\nLet me clarify from the problem:\n\n\"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" -> so if you do a move action, you move and your orientation becomes that direction.\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This is ambiguous. I think it means: when you choose a direction for change orientation, you are not moving, but the condition about adjacent tile is confusing. Actually, I think it's a mistake. Probably, the change orientation action just changes the orientation without moving, regardless of adjacent tiles.\n\nBut the problem says: \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This seems to be a condition for when you try to move? But for change orientation, it should be just changing the direction without moving.\n\nLooking back: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This might be a copy-paste error. I think the intended meaning is:\n\n- When you choose a move action (L/R/U/D), you move in that direction and change your orientation to that direction, but only if the adjacent tile in that direction is empty and walkable.\n\n- When you choose a change orientation action (L/R/U/D), you change your orientation to that direction without moving, regardless of what is adjacent.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This is unclear. I think we should assume that change orientation action only changes the direction and does not move.\n\nTo be safe, let me assume that the actions are:\n\n- U, D, L, R: if it's a move, then it moves and changes orientation. But if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty (so not walkable), then the move fails and you don't move? But the problem says for move: it changes position and orientation, but it doesn't specify the condition. It must be conditional: you can only move if the adjacent tile in that direction is empty.\n\nSimilarly, for change orientation: the problem says \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This seems to imply that it might move? But that doesn't make sense. I think it's a mistake. I believe the intended actions are:\n\n- Move actions: U, D, L, R -> attempt to move in that direction (and change orientation to that direction) only if the adjacent tile in that direction is empty and walkable. Otherwise, the move fails and you stay (and orientation changes? or not? The problem doesn't say. But typically, in such games, if you try to move and cannot, you don't move and orientation changes? The problem says for move: \"Changes position and orientation\" but it doesn't say what happens when blocked. We must assume that if blocked, the move fails and you don't move? But the orientation change might still happen? The problem doesn't specify.\n\nTo resolve, note the action history: \n- Alice's action history: S, S, S, R. At turn 4 she did R: move right. She was at (4,3) and moved to (4,3)? Wait, she was at some position and then moved right. How did she get to (4,3)? Probably she started at (3,3) and moved right to (4,3) at turn 4. Because her action history: first three turns S (stay), then R (move right). So she must have moved from (3,3) to (4,3) at turn 4.\n\nSimilarly, Bob: L, L, U, U. He started at (3,3)? Then L to (2,3), L to (1,3), then U to (1,4)? But wait, (1,4) is a kitchen counter? So he cannot walk on (1,4). Therefore, when he tried to move up at turn 3 and 4, he couldn't? But the problem doesn't say he failed. His position is (1,3). So his last two U actions must have failed because (1,4) is non-walkable. But then what happened to orientation? The problem doesn't specify.\n\nWe must assume that when a move action is attempted and the adjacent tile is not walkable, then the player does not move and does not change orientation? Or changes orientation? The problem doesn't say.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will assume that:\n\n- Move action (U/D/L/R): if the adjacent tile in that direction is empty (walkable), then the player moves and changes orientation to that direction. Otherwise, the player does not move and does not change orientation (or perhaps the orientation changes? but that would be bad). To be consistent with typical games, I assume that if the move is blocked, the player does not move and the orientation does not change? But the problem doesn't specify.\n\nLooking at Bob: he did U, U at turns 3 and 4. He ended at (1,3) and facing U. So even though he couldn't move up (because (1,4) is non-walkable), he still changed his orientation to U? Because he did a move action U, which changes orientation to U even if he doesn't move? The problem says: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" It doesn't say conditionally. So it might change orientation regardless. Then for Bob, at turn 3: he was at (1,3) and did U: he couldn't move to (1,4) but his orientation became U. Then at turn 4: he did U again: again couldn't move, but orientation is already U.\n\nSimilarly, for change orientation action: it should just change the orientation without moving.\n\nBut the problem says for change orientation: \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This might be a mistake. I think it should be: change orientation action changes the orientation without any condition.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I will use:\n\n- For moving: use U/D/L/R only when the move is possible.\n- For changing orientation without moving, we can use the same letters but the problem has only one set of actions. The actions are U, D, L, R, I, S. How do we distinguish move and change orientation? The problem lists two types: \"Move (L/R/U/D)\" and \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D)\" as separate actions. But in the action set, they are both represented by U/D/L/R? That's ambiguous.\n\nI see the issue. The problem says: \"Each player (Alice/Bob) can:\n- Move (L/R/U/D): ...\n- Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): ...\n- Interact (I): ...\n- Stay (S): ...\"\n\nBut then in the answer format, it says \"each action a_t ∈ {U, D, L, R, I, S}\". So the same letter U can mean either a move or a change orientation? That's not possible. \n\nThis is a critical ambiguity. I think the problem intends that:\n\n- When you choose U, D, L, R, it is a move action. If the move is possible (adjacent tile empty), then you move and change orientation. If not, then you don't move and the orientation changes to that direction? Or you don't move and orientation doesn't change? The problem doesn't specify.\n\nBut then how do you change orientation without moving? The problem has a separate \"Change Orientation\" action, but it is also represented by U/D/L/R? That doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps the action set for change orientation is not the same as move. But the answer format only has U, D, L, R, I, S.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. The problem lists \"Move\" and \"Change Orientation\" as two different types of actions, but both are represented by the same set of letters? That can't be.\n\nRe-read: \"Each player (Alice/Bob) can:\n- **Move** (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\n- **Change Orientation** (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\n- **Interact (I)**: ...\n- **Stay (S)**: ...\"\n\nAnd then in the answer format: \"each action a_t ∈ {U, D, L, R, I, S}\".\n\nSo how do we specify whether it's a move or a change orientation when we use U? It's the same symbol.\n\nI think the problem has a flaw. But we must interpret. Perhaps:\n\n- The action U can mean either a move up or a change orientation to up? But that's ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that the move action is when you want to move, and it is only successful if the tile is empty, but the change orientation action is when you want to change orientation without moving, and it is always possible.\n\nBut how to represent them? Both are called with U/D/L/R.\n\nI think the only way is to assume that:\n\n- When you use U/D/L/R, it is a move action. If the move is blocked, then you don't move, and the orientation changes to that direction? Because the problem says for move: it changes position and orientation. So even if blocked, the orientation changes.\n\nThen, how do you change orientation without moving? You cannot. Because there is no separate action for change orientation without moving. The \"Change Orientation\" action is not available in the action set? But the problem lists it.\n\nThis is confusing. Perhaps the \"Change Orientation\" action is not available as a separate symbol. It is subsumed by the move action when blocked? But then you can change orientation by trying to move in a blocked direction.\n\nFor example, to change orientation to up without moving, you can try to move up even if blocked, and then you will not move but your orientation becomes up.\n\nSo effectively, the move action when blocked results in a change of orientation without move.\n\nAnd if you want to change orientation without moving, you can do that by attempting to move in that direction (even if blocked).\n\nSo in the action set, we only have U, D, L, R for both moving and changing orientation (when blocked).\n\nAnd the separate \"Change Orientation\" action might be a misnomer or not directly available.\n\nGiven that, we can use:\n\n- To move in a direction: use that direction's letter, and if the path is clear, you move and change orientation; if not, you don't move but change orientation.\n- To change orientation without moving: use the direction's letter when the adjacent tile is blocked, then you change orientation without moving.\n\nSo for Alice at (4,3) facing right, if she wants to face up, she can try to move up (U). But (4,4) is an onion dispenser (non-empty), so she cannot move there. Therefore, she will not move, but her orientation will change to up.\n\nThen, she can interact (I) to grab an onion from (4,4).\n\nSimilarly, if she wants to move to (5,3), she can use R. (5,3) is empty, so she will move to (5,3) and face right.\n\nSo let's plan accordingly.\n\nBack to turn 5:\n\nAlice is at (4,3) facing right. She wants to grab an onion from the dispenser at (4,4). To do that, she needs to be facing up. So she can do U (move up). Since (4,4) is non-empty, she cannot move, but her orientation will change to up. Then at the same turn, she can do I? No, each turn only one action.\n\nEach turn, each player does one action. So she cannot do two actions in one turn.\n\nSo at turn 5, she can do U (which will change her orientation to up, without moving) because the tile above is blocked.\n\nThen at turn 6, she is at (4,3) facing up. She can interact (I) to grab an onion from (4,4). Then she will be holding an onion.\n\nSimilarly, for Bob: at (1,3) facing up. He can try to move up? But (1,4) is kitchen counter, so he cannot move, but if he does U again, he will remain at (1,3) facing up. But he can do something else.\n\nBob can be assigned to get a plate or another onion.\n\nSince we need three onions, and Alice is about to get one, we can have Bob get an onion too or get a plate.\n\nBut the plate is at (0,2). Bob is at (1,3). He can go down to (1,2) [empty] and then face left to interact with the plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nPath for Bob:\n- From (1,3) facing up. He can do D (move down) to (1,2) and face down? Or he can change orientation to left? But he needs to go down first.\n\nAt turn 5:\n- Bob: do D to move down to (1,2). Since (1,2) is empty, he moves to (1,2) and faces down.\n\nThen at turn 6, he is at (1,2) facing down. He wants to interact with the plate dispenser at (0,2), which is to his left. So he needs to face left. He can do L (move left). But (0,2) is non-empty, so he cannot move left, but he will change orientation to left. Then at turn 7, he can interact to grab a plate.\n\nBut we don't need the plate until after the soup is cooked. The soup will take 5 turns to cook after the third onion is added.\n\nSo perhaps Bob should help with onions first.\n\nWe have two onion dispensers: (2,4) and (4,4). Alice is at (4,3) and will get an onion at turn 6. Then she needs to put it in a pot. The nearest pot is (4,0). But she is at (4,3). To put it in the pot at (4,0), she needs to go to (4,1) and face down.\n\nPath: from (4,3) to (4,1): cannot go directly down because (4,2) is blocked. So she must go right to (5,3), then down to (5,2), then down to (5,1), then left to (4,1). That's 3 moves.\n\nThen at (4,1) she can face down and interact to put the onion in the pot.\n\nBut she is holding an onion, so she can only do one thing per turn.\n\nLet's timeline for Alice:\n\nTurn 5: U -> changes orientation to up (doesn't move)\nTurn 6: I -> grabs onion from (4,4), now holding onion.\nThen she needs to go to (4,1):\nTurn 7: R (move right to 5,3) and face right\nTurn 8: D (move down to 5,2) and face down\nTurn 9: D (move down to 5,1) and face down\nTurn 10: L (move left to 4,1) and face left\nTurn 11: change orientation to down? Currently at (4,1) facing left. To interact with the pot at (4,0), she needs to face down. So she can do D (move down) but (4,0) is non-empty, so she will not move but change orientation to down.\nTurn 12: I -> put the onion in the pot.\n\nThat's turn 12 for the first onion. Then she can go get another onion.\n\nBut that's too slow. We have Bob idle. We can have Bob help with onions.\n\nBob is at (1,3). He can go to the onion dispenser at (2,4). How? \n- From (1,3) he can move right to (2,3) [empty] and face right? \n- Then from (2,3) he can change orientation to up? Or move up? (2,4) is non-empty, so if he does U at (2,3), he will not move but face up.\n- Then interact to grab onion.\n\nTimeline for Bob:\n\nTurn 5: R (move right to 2,3) and face right\nTurn 6: U (change orientation to up, because (2,4) is blocked) -> now at (2,3) facing up\nTurn 7: I -> grab onion from (2,4)\n\nThen he can put it in a pot. The nearest pot is (2,0). He is at (2,3). To get to (2,1) to access (2,0):\n- (2,3) to (2,2) is kitchen counter -> blocked. So he must go around: down to (2,2) blocked, so he can go left to (1,3) or right to (3,3). (3,3) is empty.\n- Then from (3,3) to (3,2) is kitchen counter -> blocked. So he can go down to (3,2) blocked, so he must go to (3,1)? (3,1) is empty. Then to (2,1)? (2,1) is empty. Then to (2,1) and face down to interact with pot at (2,0).\n\nPath: (2,3) -> R to (3,3) [at turn 8] -> D to (3,2) blocked? (3,2) is kitchen counter, so he cannot move down. So he will not move but face down. Then he can do D again? But still blocked. So he needs to go down from (3,3) is not possible. Alternative: from (2,3) go down? (2,2) blocked, so he can go left to (1,3) [empty] at turn 8: L to (1,3) and face left.\nThen from (1,3) go down to (1,2) [empty] at turn 9: D to (1,2) face down.\nThen from (1,2) go down to (1,1) [empty?] at turn 10: D to (1,1) face down.\nThen from (1,1) go right to (2,1) [empty] at turn 11: R to (2,1) face right.\nThen at (2,1) facing right, but the pot at (2,0) is below, so he needs to face down. Turn 12: D (change orientation to down, since (2,0) is non-empty, so no move but face down).\nTurn 13: I -> put onion in pot at (2,0).\n\nThis is even slower.\n\nWe should use the same pot to avoid duplication. Let's use the pot at (4,0) for both players to put onions.\n\nAlice will put the first onion at turn 12. Then she can go get another onion.\n\nBut Bob can also put an onion in the same pot. However, the pot can be accessed by only one player at a time? But they can take turns.\n\nAlternatively, after Alice puts the first onion, Bob can come to (4,1) and put his onion.\n\nBut Bob is at (2,3) at turn 7 after grabbing onion. Then he can go to (4,1) to access the same pot.\n\nPath from (2,3) to (4,1): \n- (2,3) to (3,3) [right] -> turn 8: R to (3,3)\n- (3,3) to (4,3) [right] -> turn 9: R to (4,3)\n- (4,3) to (4,2) blocked, so he can go to (5,3) [right] at turn 10: R to (5,3)\n- then down to (5,2) at turn 11: D to (5,2)\n- then down to (5,1) at turn 12: D to (5,1)\n- then left to (4,1) at turn 13: L to (4,1) face left.\n- then change orientation to down: turn 14: D (no move, face down)\n- turn 15: I to put onion in pot at (4,0)\n\nThis is very slow.\n\nWe need a better plan.\n\nSince Alice is near the onion dispenser at (4,4), she can grab an onion quickly. Then, instead of going to the pot immediately, she can drop the onion on a kitchen counter nearby? But the kitchen counters are at (3,4), (5,4), (4,2) is blocked, etc. The closest kitchen counter to (4,3) is (3,3) or (5,3) but those are empty tiles? No, kitchen counters are at (3,4), (5,4), (0,4), etc. (3,3) is empty, not a kitchen counter.\n\nKitchen counters are only at the listed coordinates. The nearest kitchen counter to (4,3) is (3,4) or (5,4) or (3,2) or (5,2), but (3,2) and (5,2) are not adjacent to (4,3).\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4) which is above (3,3). So Alice can go to (3,3) and face up to interact with the kitchen counter at (3,4)? But (3,4) is above (3,3), so she can stand at (3,3) and face up to interact.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) is above (5,3), so she can stand at (5,3) and face up.\n\nSo for Alice at (4,3) holding an onion, she can go to (3,3) or (5,3) and then face up to place the onion on the kitchen counter at (3,4) or (5,4).\n\nThen she can go back to get another onion.\n\nBut this might not be efficient.\n\nAnother idea: use the pot at (4,0) and have Alice focus on that. Bob can get plates and be ready to serve.\n\nBut the soup takes 5 turns to cook after the third onion is in.\n\nSo if we can put three onions quickly, then after 5 turns, serve.\n\nLet's have Alice get all three onions and put them in the pot.\n\nAlice timeline:\n\nTurn 5: U -> face up (at 4,3)\nTurn 6: I -> grab onion (now holding onion)\nThen she needs to go to the pot area. But instead of going directly, she can drop the onion at a kitchen counter near the pot to save trips.\n\nFor example, drop the onion at (3,1) or (5,1), then go get another onion.\n\nBut (3,1) is empty, not a kitchen counter. Kitchen counters are at (3,0), (5,0), etc., which are not walkable.\n\nThe only kitchen counters are at the listed positions. Near the pot at (4,0), the adjacent kitchen counters are at (3,0) and (5,0), but they are not walkable, so we cannot stand on them. The only walkable tile near the pot is (4,1). But (4,1) is empty, not a kitchen counter. To use a kitchen counter, we need to be adjacent to it.\n\nThe nearest kitchen counter to the pot might be (3,0) or (5,0), but we cannot stand on them. Or (3,2) or (4,2) or (5,2), but (4,2) is a kitchen counter, so we can stand at (4,1) or (4,3) or (3,2) is kitchen counter itself -> not walkable.\n\nSo to access a kitchen counter, for example (3,2), we can stand at (3,1), (3,3), (2,2) is also kitchen counter, (4,2) is kitchen counter. So for (3,2), we can stand at (3,1) and face up, or at (3,3) and face down, or at (2,2) not possible, etc.\n\n (3,1) is empty, so we can stand at (3,1) and face up to interact with (3,2) kitchen counter.\n\nSimilarly for (4,2): we can stand at (4,1) and face up, or at (4,3) and face down.\n\nSo Alice can go to (4,1) and then face up to interact with (4,2) kitchen counter.\n\nBut (4,1) is near the pot.\n\nSo plan for Alice to collect one onion and put it on the kitchen counter at (4,2) for temporary storage.\n\nThen she can collect more.\n\nBut she can only carry one item at a time.\n\nAlice:\n\nTurn 5: U -> face up\nTurn 6: I -> grab onion\nThen she needs to go to (4,1) to be able to interact with (4,2) kitchen counter above.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (4,1): as before, must go around.\n\nTurn 7: R to (5,3)\nTurn 8: D to (5,2)\nTurn 9: D to (5,1)\nTurn 10: L to (4,1)  [now at (4,1)]\nTurn 11: U -> face up (because (4,2) is above, but (4,2) is non-empty, so she changes orientation to up without moving)\nTurn 12: I -> place the onion on the kitchen counter at (4,2). Now the kitchen counter at (4,2) has an onion.\n\nThen she is free to get another onion.\n\nTurn 13: U -> try to move up to (4,2) but (4,2) is non-empty (kitchen counter with onion? But kitchen counter can have items, but it's still non-walkable, so she cannot move. So she changes orientation to up.\nThen she can do nothing with that. She needs to go back to (4,3) or (5,3) to then go up to the onion dispenser.\n\nFrom (4,1) she can go up? (4,2) blocked, so she must go right to (5,1), then up to (5,2), then up to (5,3), then left to (4,3).\n\nTurn 13: R to (5,1) -> move to (5,1) face right\nTurn 14: U to (5,2) -> (5,2) is empty? Yes, so move to (5,2) face up\nTurn 15: U to (5,3) -> (5,3) empty, move to (5,3) face up\nTurn 16: L to (4,3) -> move to (4,3) face left\nTurn 17: U -> face up (because (4,4) blocked)\nTurn 18: I -> grab another onion\n\nThis is very inefficient.\n\nWe must use both players.\n\nLet's have Alice and Bob both collect onions and put them in the pot at (4,0) as soon as possible.\n\nAlice focuses on the onion dispenser at (4,4), Bob on the one at (2,4).\n\nAlice:\nTurn 5: U -> face up (at 4,3)\nTurn 6: I -> grab onion\n\nThen she goes to (4,1) to access the pot:\nTurn 7: R to (5,3)\nTurn 8: D to (5,2)\nTurn 9: D to (5,1)\nTurn 10: L to (4,1) -> now at (4,1) facing left\nTurn 11: D -> face down (since (4,0) is below, non-empty, so no move, face down)\nTurn 12: I -> put onion in pot at (4,0). Now the pot has one onion.\n\nThen she can go back for another onion.\n\nFrom (4,1) to (4,3) for onion dispenser: but (4,2) blocked, so:\nTurn 13: R to (5,1)\nTurn 14: U to (5,2)\nTurn 15: U to (5,3)\nTurn 16: L to (4,3) -> at (4,3) facing left\nTurn 17: U -> face up\nTurn 18: I -> grab onion\n\nThen again to the pot: turn 19-24: similar to before, 6 turns to put the second onion.\n\nThat's too long.\n\nAfter the first onion, she can stay near the pot and let Bob bring onions, but Bob is slow too.\n\nAnother idea: Alice collects one onion and puts it in the pot, then while the pot is cooking, she collects more for the next soup or helps with plates.\n\nBut for the first soup, we need three onions.\n\nWe have Bob. At turn 5, Bob can start moving to the onion dispenser at (2,4).\n\nBob:\nTurn 5: R -> move to (2,3) face right\nTurn 6: U -> face up (cannot move to 2,4)\nTurn 7: I -> grab onion\n\nThen he can go to the pot at (4,0) to put it.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (4,1):\nTurn 8: R to (3,3)\nTurn 9: R to (4,3) [empty]\nTurn 10: D? (4,2) blocked, so cannot. He can go to (5,3) first.\nTurn 10: R to (5,3)\nTurn 11: D to (5,2)\nTurn 12: D to (5,1)\nTurn 13: L to (4,1) face left\nTurn 14: D -> face down\nTurn 15: I -> put onion in pot at (4,0)\n\nSo at turn 15, the pot has two onions (one from Alice at turn 12, one from Bob at turn 15).\n\nThen we need a third onion.\n\nAlice, after putting her onion at turn 12, is at (4,1) facing down. She can go back for another onion.\n\nTurn 13: R to (5,1)\nTurn 14: U to (5,2)\nTurn 15: U to (5,3)\nTurn 16: L to (4,3) face left\nTurn 17: U -> face up\nTurn 18: I -> grab onion\n\nThen to the pot: from (4,3) to (4,1) via (5,3)-(5,2)-(5,1)-(4,1) as before, 4 moves:\nTurn 19: R to (5,3)\nTurn 20: D to (5,2)\nTurn 21: D to (5,1)\nTurn 22: L to (4,1) face left\nTurn 23: D -> face down\nTurn 24: I -> put onion in pot. Now the pot has three onions at turn 24. The cooking starts.\n\nCooking time: 5 turns. So at turn 29, the soup is ready.\n\nThen someone needs to get a plate and serve.\n\nThe plate dispenser is at (0,2). Bob is at (4,1) after turn 15? At turn 15, Bob put onion and is at (4,1) facing down. He can be assigned to get the plate.\n\nBob to get plate:\nFrom (4,1) to (0,2): long path.\n\n (4,1) -> (4,0) not walkable, so go to (3,1) [empty] then to (2,1) [empty] then to (1,1) [empty] then to (1,2) [empty] then to (1,2) and face left to interact with plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nBut (0,2) is left of (1,2).\n\nPath for Bob:\nTurn 16: W (left) to (3,1) -> L to (3,1) face left ( (3,1) is empty, so he moves to (3,1) face left)\nTurn 17: L to (2,1) face left\nTurn 18: L to (1,1) face left\nTurn 19: U to (1,2) face up ( (1,2) is empty, so move to (1,2) face up? But he needs to face left for the plate dispenser. So at (1,2) he is facing up.\nTurn 20: L -> face left (no move, because (0,2) is non-empty)\nTurn 21: I -> grab plate\n\nThen he needs to go to the pot at (4,0) to serve the soup.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (4,1): \nTurn 22: R to (2,2) but (2,2) is kitchen counter -> cannot walk, so he will not move but face right.\nTurn 23: R again -> still cannot, face right. He needs to go down or up.\n\nFrom (1,2) he can go down to (1,1) then right to (2,1), etc.\n\nTurn 22: D to (1,1) face down\nTurn 23: R to (2,1) face right\nTurn 24: R to (3,1) face right\nTurn 25: R to (4,1) face right\nTurn 26: D -> face down (towards the pot)\nTurn 27: I -> serve the soup? But the soup is at (4,0), and he is holding a plate. To serve, he needs to interact with the pot, which will put the soup on the plate? Then he needs to deliver to serving counter.\n\nInteract with pot when holding a plate and pot has cooked soup: it will give the player the soup in a plate.\n\nThen he needs to take it to the serving counter at (6,2).\n\nFrom (4,1) to (6,2): \n- (4,1) to (5,1) [right]\n- then to (5,2) [up]\n- then to (6,2) [right]\n\nTurn 28: R to (5,1) face right\nTurn 29: U to (5,2) face up\nTurn 30: R to (6,2) face right? But (6,2) is serving counter, non-empty, so he cannot move to it. He can stand at (5,2) and face right to interact with (6,2)? (6,2) is at the east of (5,2), so he needs to face right.\n\nAt turn 29, he is at (5,2) facing up. Then turn 30: R -> face right (no move, because (6,2) is non-empty)\nTurn 31: I -> deliver the soup.\n\nBut the soup is ready at turn 29? The third onion was put at turn 24, so cooking starts at turn 24. It cooks for 5 turns, so ready at turn 29. At turn 27, when Bob interacts with the pot, the soup is not ready yet because turn 27 < turn 29. So he must wait.\n\nAt turn 27, the soup is not ready (cooking started at turn 24, so at turn 27, 3 turns passed, not done). So he cannot serve yet.\n\nHe should wait until turn 29.\n\nSo at turn 27: Bob is at (4,1) facing down, holding a plate. He can wait until turn 29.\n\nTurn 27: S (stay)\nTurn 28: S (stay)\nTurn 29: I -> interact with pot to get the soup on plate.\nTurn 30: then he can start moving to the serving counter.\n\nBut at turn 29, after getting the soup, he is at (4,1) holding soup in plate. Then he needs to go to (6,2).\n\nTurn 30: R to (5,1)\nTurn 31: U to (5,2)\nTurn 32: R -> face right (cannot move to 6,2)\nTurn 33: I -> deliver at (6,2)\n\nSo delivered at turn 33.\n\nThis is for one soup, reward 20.\n\nBut we can try to do better.\n\nNote that after the third onion is put at turn 24, the cooking starts, and we have 5 turns. In that time, Alice and Bob can start preparing for the next soup or get the plate early.\n\nIn the above, Bob got the plate at turn 21, then went to the pot area to wait.\n\nAlice, after putting the third onion at turn 24, is at (4,1) facing down. She can go to get a plate or another onion for the next soup.\n\nBut let's optimize the first soup.\n\nTo save time, we can have one player get the plate while the other is getting the last onion.\n\nBut in the above, the third onion is put at turn 24 by Alice, and the plate is already with Bob at that time.\n\nBob got the plate at turn 21, then moved to (4,1) by turn 25, and waited from turn 25 to turn 29.\n\nHe arrived at (4,1) at turn 25, and the soup is ready at turn 29, so he waits 4 turns.\n\nWe can have him get the plate later.\n\nBut he needs to be at the pot when the soup is ready to minimize waiting.\n\nAlternatively, have Alice get the plate after she puts the third onion.\n\nBut she is at (4,1) at turn 24. To get to the plate dispenser at (0,2), it's far.\n\nAlice from (4,1) to (0,2):\n- (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> then face left to interact.\n\nTurn 25: L to (3,1)\nTurn 26: L to (2,1)\nTurn 27: L to (1,1)\nTurn 28: U to (1,2)\nTurn 29: L -> face left\nTurn 30: I -> grab plate\n\nThen she needs to go back to the pot to serve, but the soup is ready at turn 29, so at turn 30 she is at (1,2) with the plate, far from the pot.\n\nThen she would need to go back to (4,1) which takes about 4 turns, then serve, then deliver, so even later.\n\nSo the first plan with Bob getting the plate is better.\n\nTo reduce the waiting time for Bob, we can have him get the plate later, but then he might not arrive in time.\n\nThe cooking finishes at turn 29, so he needs to be at (4,1) facing down by turn 29.\n\nIn the first plan, he arrived at turn 25, so he can get the plate later.\n\nFor example, after putting his onion at turn 15, Bob is at (4,1) facing down. He can then go to get the plate.\n\nBut then he will return after the soup is ready.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\nBob at turn 15: at (4,1) facing down.\nThen he goes to get plate:\nTurn 16: L to (3,1)\nTurn 17: L to (2,1)\nTurn 18: L to (1,1)\nTurn 19: U to (1,2)\nTurn 20: L -> face left\nTurn 21: I -> grab plate\nThen return to (4,1):\nTurn 22: R to (2,1)  [from (1,2) move right? But (1,2) to (2,2) blocked, so he must go down to (1,1) first.\nTurn 22: D to (1,1) face down\nTurn 23: R to (2,1) face right\nTurn 24: R to (3,1) face right\nTurn 25: R to (4,1) face right\nTurn 26: D -> face down\nNow at turn 26, he is at (4,1) facing down, holding plate. The soup will be ready at turn 29, so he can wait turns 27, 28, 29.\nTurn 27: S\nTurn 28: S\nTurn 29: I -> get the soup\nThen deliver as before.\n\nThis is turn 29 for getting the soup, same as before, and then deliver by turn 33.\n\nBut compared to the first approach where he got the plate early and waited, here he is also waiting from turn 26 to 29, 3 turns, similar.\n\nIn the first approach, he arrived at turn 25 and waited 4 turns (25,26,27,28) and at turn 29 he interacts.\n\nIn this approach, he arrives at turn 26 and waits 3 turns.\n\nBut in the first approach, he got the plate earlier and then came, in this he got the plate later and came.\n\nThe number of turns is similar.\n\nTo save turns, we can have Alice or Bob get the plate while the soup is cooking.\n\nIn the first plan, after Alice puts the third onion at turn 24, she is free. She can get the plate.\n\nAlice at turn 24: at (4,1) facing down.\nThen she can go to (0,2) to get a plate.\n\nTurn 25: L to (3,1)\nTurn 26: L to (2,1)\nTurn 27: L to (1,1)\nTurn 28: U to (1,2)\nTurn 29: L -> face left\nTurn 30: I -> grab plate\n\nBut the soup is ready at turn 29, and at turn 30 she is at (1,2) with the plate, not at the pot.\n\nThen she would need to go back to (4,1) to serve, which takes about 4 turns, then to deliver, so the soup is served late.\n\nAlternatively, after getting the plate, she can go directly to the serving counter, but she doesn't have the soup yet.\n\nShe needs to get the soup from the pot first.\n\nSo she must go to the pot.\n\nTherefore, it's better to have the player who is near the pot when the soup is ready to serve it.\n\nIn this case, Bob is better positioned.\n\nBut in the first plan, with Bob getting the plate early and waiting, we deliver at turn 33.\n\nCan we do better by using both players more efficiently?\n\nFor example, after Alice puts the first onion at turn 12, instead of going for the third onion, she can get a plate.\n\nAlice at turn 12: at (4,1) facing down.\nThen she goes to get plate:\nTurn 13: L to (3,1)\nTurn 14: L to (2,1)\nTurn 15: L to (1,1)\nTurn 16: U to (1,2)\nTurn 17: L -> face left\nTurn 18: I -> grab plate\n\nThen she can wait at (1,2) or go back to the pot area.\n\nBut the soup won't be ready until turn 29, so she has time.\n\nShe can go back to (4,1) to be ready to serve.\n\nTurn 19: R to (2,1)  [from (1,2) she can go down to (1,1) then right, or right directly? (1,2) to (2,2) blocked, so:\nTurn 19: D to (1,1)\nTurn 20: R to (2,1)\nTurn 21: R to (3,1)\nTurn 22: R to (4,1)\nTurn 23: D -> face down\n\nThen she waits at (4,1) with the plate from turn 23 to turn 29 (6 turns waiting) and then serves at turn 29.\n\nThen deliver:\nTurn 30: R to (5,1)\nTurn 31: U to (5,2)\nTurn 32: R -> face right\nTurn 33: I -> deliver\n\nSame as before.\n\nOr after she has the plate, she can do something else, but she is holding the plate, so she can't do much.\n\nSo the fastest we can deliver the first soup is at turn 33.\n\nBut we can start a second soup.\n\nFor example, after the third onion is in at turn 24, Alice is free. She can start collecting onions for the next soup.\n\nShe can go to the onion dispenser and grab an onion, then put it in the other pot or the same pot after the first soup is served.\n\nBut the first soup is served at turn 33, so she can start after that.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nWe are to plan for the next several turns. We can plan until the first soup is delivered.\n\nGiven the complexity, I will write the actions for Alice and Bob for the next 20 turns or so, but the problem asks for Alice's actions, and optionally Bob's. But the answer format is for Alice only? The task says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But the answer format only shows actions for Alice? Let's read.\n\n\"plan a sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=1}^{H-1}\\) for Alice (and optionally Bob)\"\n\nBut the answer format only has turns for Alice: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo probably we only need to output Alice's actions.\n\nBut then how can we coordinate if we don't control Bob? The task is to help Alice collaborate with Bob, so we assume we can control both? Or only Alice?\n\nThe task says: \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\", and \"plan for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can plan for both, but the answer format might be for Alice only.\n\nLooking at the answer format: it only has \"Turn t: action\", without specifying the player. But the actions are for Alice, I think.\n\nThe problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice\", so we output Alice's actions.\n\nThen we must assume that Bob is controlled by another agent, and we have to coordinate with him by Alice's actions only.\n\nBut that is hard because we don't know what Bob will do.\n\nThe current state includes Bob's position and action history, so we can predict or assume that Bob will cooperate.\n\nTo simplify, perhaps we can plan for Alice only, and assume Bob will do the optimal thing based on common goal.\n\nSince the task is to maximize reward, and Bob is teammate, we can assume he will work towards the goal.\n\nIn the initial plan, we need to have Alice do her part.\n\nSo for Alice, at turn 5, she should start by getting an onion.\n\nThen put it in the pot as soon as possible.\n\nSo for Alice:\n\nTurn 5: U  // face up to prepare for interact with onion dispenser\nTurn 6: I  // grab onion from (4,4)\nThen she needs to go to the pot at (4,0) via the path.\n\nTurn 7: R  // move to (5,3), face right\nTurn 8: D  // move to (5,2), face down\nTurn 9: D  // move to (5,1), face down\nTurn 10: L  // move to (4,1), face left\nTurn 11: D  // face down (towards the pot)\nTurn 12: I  // put onion in pot at (4,0)\n\nThen she can go back for another onion.\n\nTurn 13: R  // move to (5,1), face right\nTurn 14: U  // move to (5,2), face up\nTurn 15: U  // move to (5,3), face up\nTurn 16: L  // move to (4,3), face left\nTurn 17: U  // face up (towards onion dispenser)\nTurn 18: I  // grab another onion\n\nThen she can put it in the pot again for the same soup or for the next. Since the first soup only needs three, and we have Bob also contributing, she might put it in the same pot if not full, or in the other pot.\n\nBut the pot can hold only one soup, so after three onions, it is full and cooking.\n\nAt turn 12, she put the first onion, so the pot has one onion.\n\nAt turn 12, Bob might have put one or not.\n\nAssume that Bob is also working on onions.\n\nAlice can put the second onion if the pot is not full.\n\nSo after turn 18, she is holding an onion, so she should put it in the pot.\n\nTurn 19: R // to (5,3)\nTurn 20: D // to (5,2)\nTurn 21: D // to (5,1)\nTurn 22: L // to (4,1), face left\nTurn 23: D // face down\nTurn 24: I // put onion in pot\n\nThen if the pot has less than 3, it's good, but if already 3, then it will not accept? The problem says for pot: \"Add ingredient (if pot is not full and player is holding ingredient)\". If the pot is full (has 3 ingredients or is cooking), then cannot add.\n\nSo Alice should check, but we don't know the state. We have to assume.\n\nTo be safe, after the first onion, she can let Bob do the other two, and she can get a plate.\n\nBut since we only control Alice, we can have her get the plate after the first onion.\n\nFor example, after turn 12, she has put one onion, then she can go get a plate.\n\nAlice after turn 12: at (4,1) facing down.\n\nTurn 13: L // to (3,1), face left\nTurn 14: L // to (2,1), face left\nTurn 15: L // to (1,1), face left\nTurn 16: U // to (1,2), face up\nTurn 17: L // face left ( towards plate dispenser)\nTurn 18: I // grab plate\n\nThen she can wait or go back to the pot area.\n\nTurn 19: R // to (2,1) ? From (1,2) she can't move right, so:\nTurn 19: D // to (1,1), face down\nTurn 20: R // to (2,1), face right\nTurn 21: R // to (3,1), face right\nTurn 22: R // to (4,1), face right\nTurn 23: D // face down\n\nThen she waits until the soup is ready.\n\nBut the soup may not be ready yet, because only one onion is in the pot at turn 12, and we need two more.\n\nIf Bob puts two onions, it might be ready by turn 17 or later.\n\nBut we don't control Bob.\n\nThis is risky.\n\nPerhaps the best is for Alice to focus on the onions and assume Bob will do the same.\n\nSo I will output for Alice to collect two onions and put them in the pot, then get a plate.\n\nBut with the actions above, she puts the second onion at turn 24, which is late.\n\nSince we are only planning for Alice, and for several turns, let's output 10 turns for Alice.\n\nBut the task says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\", so we can choose H.\n\nLet's output 10 turns for Alice.\n\nSo from turn 5 to turn 14.\n\nAlice:\nTurn 5: U  // face up\nTurn 6: I  // grab onion\nTurn 7: R  // move to (5,3)\nTurn 8: D  // move to (5,2)\nTurn 9: D  // move to (5,1)\nTurn 10: L  // move to (4,1)\nTurn 11: D  // face down\nTurn 12: I  // put onion in pot\nTurn 13: R  // move to (5,1)\nTurn 14: U  // move to (5,2)\n\nThen at turn 14, she is at (5,2) facing up.\n\nShe can continue to (5,3) and then to (4,3) for another onion, but we stop at turn 14.\n\nSo the sequence for Alice for turns 5 to 14:\n\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: I\nTurn 7: R\nTurn 8: D\nTurn 9: D\nTurn 10: L\nTurn 11: D\nTurn 12: I\nTurn 13: R\nTurn 14: U\n\nThis is for 10 turns.\n\nBut it's not efficient, but with the constraints, it's hard to do better.\n\nPerhaps she can get the onion and then if there's a closer pot, but there isn't.\n\nSo I think this is a reasonable start.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes in *Overcooked*, Alice and Bob must coordinate to prepare and deliver onion soup as efficiently as possible, given the recipe requires 3 onions, a cooking time of 5 turns, and yields a reward of 20. The current game state (turn 4) shows both players holding nothing, with Alice at (4,3) facing right and Bob at (1,3) facing up. All pots and counters are empty. Alice should focus on collecting onions from the nearby dispenser at (4,4) and delivering them to the pot at (4,0), while Bob is expected to collect onions from the dispenser at (2,4) and assist with the same pot or plate retrieval.\n\n### Optimized Plan for Alice (Turns 5-14)\nAlice's actions are planned for the next 10 turns (H=10) to initiate the soup preparation. She will:\n1. **Grab an onion** from the dispenser at (4,4) by facing up and interacting.\n2. **Navigate to the pot at (4,0)** via a path around the kitchen counter at (4,2): move right to (5,3), down to (5,2), down to (5,1), left to (4,1), face down, and interact to add the onion.\n3. **Return toward the onion dispenser** to collect a second onion, starting with moving right to (5,1) and up to (5,2).\n\nThis sequence ensures Alice contributes at least one onion to the pot quickly, with the second onion collection underway. Bob is anticipated to:\n- Collect an onion from (2,4) and deliver it to the pot at (4,0) or (2,0).\n- Retrieve a plate from (0,2) after the third onion is added, to serve the soup once cooked.\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence\n```\nTurn 5: U  // Face up to prepare for interaction with onion dispenser (no move, as (4,4) is blocked).\nTurn 6: I  // Interact to grab onion from dispenser at (4,4).\nTurn 7: R  // Move right to (5,3), facing right.\nTurn 8: D  // Move down to (5,2), facing down.\nTurn 9: D  // Move down to (5,1), facing down.\nTurn 10: L  // Move left to (4,1), facing left.\nTurn 11: D  // Face down toward pot at (4,0) (no move, as (4,0) is blocked).\nTurn 12: I  // Interact to add onion to pot at (4,0). Pot now has 1 onion.\nTurn 13: R  // Move right to (5,1), facing right.\nTurn 14: U  // Move up to (5,2), facing up (preparing to return for second onion).\n```\n\n### Expected Outcome\n- By turn 12, Alice delivers the first onion to the pot. \n- Bob is likely to deliver a second onion by turn 15–18, and the third onion (from Alice or Bob) by turn 20–24. \n- Cooking starts when the third onion is added (e.g., turn 24), and soup is ready at turn 29. \n- Bob can retrieve a plate during cooking and serve at turn 29, with delivery by turn 33 for a reward of 20.\n\nThis plan optimizes Alice's role in the early stages of soup preparation. Further turns would involve Alice collecting additional onions for more soups, coordinating with Bob for plate retrieval and serving.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: I \\\\\nTurn 7: R \\\\\nTurn 8: D \\\\\nTurn 9: D \\\\\nTurn 10: L \\\\\nTurn 11: D \\\\\nTurn 12: I \\\\\nTurn 13: R \\\\\nTurn 14: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 8. We need to plan for Alice (and optionally Bob) for the next several turns (H turns). Let's set H to 10 for a reasonable plan.\n\nGoal: Maximize total reward by delivering soup. The only recipe is 3 onions, which cooks in 5 turns and gives 20 reward.\n\nCurrent state:\n- Alice: at (3,3), facing Up, holding nothing.\n- Bob: at (1,3), facing Left, holding one onion.\n\nPots are empty. Kitchen counters are empty.\n\nWe have:\n- Onion dispensers at (2,4) and (4,4)\n- Plate dispenser at (0,2)\n- Pots at (2,0) and (4,0)\n- Serving counter at (6,2)\n\nSince the recipe requires 3 onions, we need to get 3 onions into a pot. Bob already has one onion. So we need two more onions.\n\nPlan:\n1. Bob is holding an onion and is near the pots? Bob is at (1,3). The pots are at (2,0) and (4,0). Bob needs to go to a pot to put the onion. But note: (1,3) is above the kitchen counter at (1,4) and (0,3) and (0,4) are counters. So Bob must move to a pot.\n\n2. Alice is at (3,3) and can go to an onion dispenser to get an onion.\n\nSteps:\n\nFor Bob:\n- He is at (1,3) facing Left. He can move down to (1,2) because (1,2) is an empty tile? Let's see the grid.\n\nWe don't have a full grid, but we know the non-empty tiles. The empty tiles are walkable. We must avoid non-empty tiles.\n\nList of non-empty tiles (from tile types and counters):\nKitchen Counters: [(0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)]\nOnion Dispensers: (2,4), (4,4)\nPlate Dispenser: (0,2)\nPots: (2,0), (4,0)\nServing Counter: (6,2)\n\nSo the grid is 7x5? (from (0,0) to (6,4))\n\nWe can reconstruct the grid:\n\nRow y=0: [K, K, P, K, P, K, K]  (K: kitchen counter, P: pot)\nRow y=1: [K, empty, empty, empty, empty, empty, K]  (but (0,1) and (6,1) are K)\nRow y=2: [P_disp (plate dispenser at (0,2)), empty, K, K, K, empty, S]  (serving counter at (6,2))\nRow y=3: [K, empty, empty, empty, empty, empty, K]  (0,3) and (6,3) are K, and (3,3) is Alice? but (3,3) is empty? Actually, (3,3) is not listed as non-empty, so it's empty. Similarly, (1,3) is not listed, so empty.\nRow y=4: [K, K, O, K, O, K, K]  (O: onion dispenser) at (2,4) and (4,4)\n\nSo the grid:\n\ny=4: [K(0,4), K(1,4), O(2,4), K(3,4), O(4,4), K(5,4), K(6,4)]\ny=3: [K(0,3), empty(1,3), empty(2,3), empty(3,3), empty(4,3), empty(5,3), K(6,3)]\ny=2: [Plate(0,2), empty(1,2), K(2,2), K(3,2), K(4,2), empty(5,2), Serving(6,2)]\ny=1: [K(0,1), empty(1,1), empty(2,1), empty(3,1), empty(4,1), empty(5,1), K(6,1)]\ny=0: [K(0,0), K(1,0), Pot(2,0), K(3,0), Pot(4,0), K(5,0), K(6,0)]\n\nAlice is at (3,3) and Bob at (1,3). Both are on empty tiles.\n\nBob is holding an onion. He needs to put it in a pot. The pots are at (2,0) and (4,0). The closer one to Bob is (2,0). Bob is at (1,3). He can go down to (1,2) (empty) then (1,1) (empty) then (1,0) is a kitchen counter? But (1,0) is a kitchen counter, which is non-empty and cannot be walked on. So he must go to (2,0) or (4,0) via a different path.\n\nFrom (1,3):\n- Move down to (1,2) -> empty\n- Then right to (2,2) -> but (2,2) is a kitchen counter, non-empty, cannot walk. So that's blocked.\nAlternative:\n- From (1,3), move right to (2,3) -> empty\n- Then down to (2,2) -> blocked by kitchen counter.\n\nWait, (2,2) is a kitchen counter, so he cannot step on it. Similarly, (3,2) and (4,2) are kitchen counters.\n\nSo the only way to get to the pots is to go around the kitchen counters? Let's see:\n\nBob at (1,3) can:\n- Move right to (2,3) [empty]\n- Then down to (2,2) is blocked -> so he must go to (2,1) but how? From (2,3) he can move down? (2,3) to (2,2) is blocked. So he must go to (3,3) first? But (3,3) is occupied by Alice at the moment.\n\nAt turn 8, Alice is at (3,3) and Bob at (1,3). So Bob cannot go to (2,3) because Alice is not there? (2,3) is empty. Bob can move to (2,3) because it's empty and adjacent.\n\nThen from (2,3), Bob can move down? (2,3) to (2,2) is blocked by kitchen counter. So he must go to (3,3) but that's occupied by Alice.\n\nSo Bob must go left? (1,3) can go left to (0,3) but (0,3) is a kitchen counter -> cannot walk.\n\nBob is stuck? But that can't be. There must be a way.\n\nAlternative: Bob can go down from (1,3) to (1,2) -> empty. Then from (1,2) he can go right to (2,2) but (2,2) is a kitchen counter -> blocked. Then left to (0,2) is plate dispenser -> non-empty, cannot walk. So (1,2) is surrounded? (1,2) has neighbors:\n- Up: (1,3) [empty] \n- Down: (1,1) [empty] \n- Left: (0,2) [plate dispenser, non-empty] \n- Right: (2,2) [kitchen counter, non-empty]\n\nSo from (1,2) Bob can go down to (1,1) [empty]. Then from (1,1) he can go down to (1,0) [kitchen counter, blocked] or right to (2,1) [empty]. Then from (2,1) he can go right to (3,1) [empty] and then down to (3,0) [kitchen counter, blocked] or to (4,1) [empty] and then down to (4,0) [pot]? (4,0) is a pot, which is non-empty? But note: pots are non-empty tiles? The rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So pots are non-empty? Then Bob cannot step on (4,0) to interact? Actually, he doesn't need to step on the pot. He must stand adjacent and face the pot to interact.\n\nSo for Bob to put an onion in the pot at (2,0) or (4,0), he must be adjacent and facing it.\n\nFor pot at (2,0):\nAdjacent tiles: (1,0) [kitchen counter, blocked], (2,1) [empty], (3,0) [kitchen counter, blocked]. So only (2,1) is accessible.\n\nSimilarly, for pot at (4,0): adjacent tiles: (3,0) [kitchen counter, blocked], (4,1) [empty], (5,0) [kitchen counter, blocked]. So only (4,1) is accessible.\n\nSo Bob must get to (2,1) to interact with (2,0) or to (4,1) to interact with (4,0).\n\nBob at (1,3) can:\n- Move down to (1,2) -> empty\n- Then down to (1,1) -> empty\n- Then right to (2,1) -> empty. Then he can face down to interact with the pot at (2,0).\n\nAlternatively, he can go to (4,1) for the other pot.\n\nBut (4,1) is farther: \n(1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (4,3) -> (4,2) [kitchen counter, blocked] -> so must go (4,3) to (4,2) blocked? So he must go via (3,3) to (4,3) then down to (4,2) is blocked? Then how? (4,3) can go down? (4,2) is kitchen counter -> blocked. So he must go to (5,3) then down to (5,2) [empty? (5,2) is not listed as non-empty? In row y=2: (0,2) plate, (1,2) empty, (2,2) K, (3,2) K, (4,2) K, (5,2) empty? because (5,2) is not in the kitchen counter list? The kitchen counters at y=2 are (2,2), (3,2), (4,2). So (5,2) is empty. Then (5,1) is empty? Then (5,0) is kitchen counter. So from (4,3) to (5,3) [empty] then down to (5,2) [empty] then down to (5,1) [empty] then down to (5,0) [kitchen counter, blocked] -> then he can go left to (4,1) [empty] and then interact with (4,0) by facing down.\n\nBut that's longer.\n\nSo the fastest for Bob is to go to (2,1) to use the pot at (2,0).\n\nPath for Bob:\n- From (1,3): D (to 1,2) -> then D (to 1,1) -> then R (to 2,1). Then at (2,1) he must face down (D) to interact with the pot at (2,0). But note: he is holding an onion, so he can add it to the pot.\n\nBut the pot is empty. So after adding, the pot will have one onion.\n\nNow, we need two more onions.\n\nAlice is at (3,3). She can go to an onion dispenser. The closest is (2,4) or (4,4). (2,4) is above (2,3). But (2,3) is empty. So Alice can move left to (2,3) then up to (2,4). But (2,4) is an onion dispenser. She can grab an onion by facing up at (2,3) and interacting? Or she can step? No, dispensers are non-empty, so she must be adjacent and facing it.\n\nSo at (2,3), facing up, she can interact to get an onion.\n\nAlternatively, (4,4): from (3,3) she can go right to (4,3) then up to (4,4). At (4,3) facing up, interact.\n\nBoth are similar. Let's choose (2,4) because it's closer to the pot at (2,0).\n\nPlan for Alice:\n- From (3,3): move left to (2,3) [empty] -> action L.\n- Then change orientation to U (if not already) and then Interact to get an onion.\n\nBut note: when moving, the orientation changes? The move action changes position and orientation. So if she moves left, she will be at (2,3) and facing left? But we need her to face up to interact with (2,4). So after moving to (2,3), she must change orientation to U, then Interact.\n\nThen she has an onion. Then she must go to the pot at (2,0) to put it. But the pot is at (2,0). She is at (2,3). She can go down? (2,3) to (2,2) is blocked by kitchen counter. So she must go via (3,3) to (3,2) -> blocked? (3,2) is kitchen counter. So same problem.\n\nAlternative: from (2,3) she can go down? blocked. So she must go to (3,3) then down? (3,3) to (3,2) is blocked. So she must go to (1,3) but that might be occupied by Bob? Bob is moving.\n\nBut Bob is moving to (2,1) via (1,2) and (1,1). So at (1,3) is free? Not necessarily at the same time.\n\nAlternatively, Alice can go to the other pot at (4,0). But let's see.\n\nWe can use the kitchen counter to temporarily store the onion? Then Bob can pick it up? But that might be inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, we can have both players working on the same pot? Or use the pot at (4,0) for the second onion.\n\nBut we need 3 onions in one pot. So we should put all in one pot.\n\nSo let's choose the pot at (2,0) for both.\n\nHow can Alice get to (2,0)? She must go to (2,1) to interact. But how to get to (2,1) from (2,3)? The direct path is blocked at (2,2). So she must go around:\n\nFrom (2,3) to (3,3) [empty] -> (3,3) to (3,2) blocked -> so to (4,3) [empty] -> (4,3) to (4,2) blocked -> then to (5,3) [empty] -> (5,3) to (5,2) [empty] -> (5,2) to (5,1) [empty] -> (5,1) to (5,0) blocked -> then to (4,1) [empty] -> then she can interact with pot at (4,0) by facing down? But that's for the other pot.\n\nBut we want to put in the same pot? So if we use pot at (2,0), then Alice must get to (2,1). How?\n\nFrom (2,3) she can go to (1,3) [empty] -> then down to (1,2) [empty] -> then down to (1,1) [empty] -> then right to (2,1) [empty]. That works.\n\nSo path for Alice to get an onion and then go to (2,1):\n- At (3,3): L to (2,3) -> now at (2,3) facing left? (because she moved left, so orientation left)\n- Then change orientation to U (to face the onion dispenser at (2,4)) -> then I to grab an onion.\n- Then she must go to (2,1) via: from (2,3) move left to (1,3) [if Bob is not there?] -> then down to (1,2) -> down to (1,1) -> right to (2,1).\n\nBut Bob is also going to (1,1) and (2,1). We must coordinate to avoid collision.\n\nBob's path to (2,1):\n- Start at (1,3): move down to (1,2) -> then down to (1,1) -> then right to (2,1).\n\nSo if Alice is at (2,3) and Bob at (1,3) at the same time, then when Alice moves left to (1,3), Bob must not be there. But Bob is moving down to (1,2) at that time? Let's simulate by turns.\n\nTurn 8: \n- Alice: at (3,3), Bob: at (1,3)\n\nWe plan from turn 8 onward.\n\nTurn 8: \nAlice: move left to (2,3). Now Alice at (2,3), facing left (after move).\nBob: we can control Bob? The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can suggest actions for Bob? But the problem says \"for Alice\" and optionally Bob, meaning we can plan for both? But the answer format only shows Alice? Actually, the task says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", but the answer format only shows actions for Alice? The example output only has \"Turn t: a_t\" for Alice? \n\nRe-read: \"plan a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=1}^{H-1} for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But the answer format only has one action per turn? It says \"each action a_t\", so I think we are only planning for Alice? But then we have to assume Bob will act independently? Or we can assume we can control both? The problem says \"collaborate with Bob\", so we should plan for both? But the answer format doesn't specify for whom? It just says \"a_t\". \n\nLooking at the answer format: \n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\n...\n}\n\nIt doesn't specify the player. But the task says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So I think we are to output Alice's actions, and we can assume Bob acts optimally as per the plan? Or we can output both? The format doesn't have two actions.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think we are only to output Alice's actions, and we assume Bob is also acting optimally? But we know Bob's state and we can infer what he would do? But the problem says \"optionally Bob\", meaning we can plan for Bob too? But the answer format doesn't have room for Bob.\n\nTo be safe, I will plan for Alice only, and assume Bob will act reasonably (like going to put his onion in the pot). But we can coordinate by having Alice avoid Bob's path.\n\nAlternatively, we can plan for both and output only Alice's actions, and hope Bob does his part? But the problem says \"help Alice collaborate\", so we should plan with Bob in mind.\n\nGiven the constraints, I think we should output only Alice's actions, and we design her actions to avoid conflicts and to complement Bob.\n\nSo let's assume Bob will go to put his onion in the pot at (2,0) by the path: D (to 1,2), D (to 1,1), R (to 2,1), then D (to change orientation down) and then I to interact.\n\nBob's actions:\nTurn 8: Bob moves down to (1,2)\nTurn 9: Bob moves down to (1,1)\nTurn 10: Bob moves right to (2,1)\nTurn 11: Bob changes orientation to down (if not already) -> but he moved right, so facing right? He needs to face down to interact with (2,0). So he must change orientation to down? Or he can interact without changing orientation? But he is at (2,1) and (2,0) is below him, so he must face down to interact. So at turn 11: change orientation to D? Or he can do it in one move? The interact requires facing the tile. So if at turn 10 he moves right to (2,1), he is facing right. Then at turn 11 he must change orientation to down (D action) and then at turn 12 interact.\n\nBut the move action changes orientation. When he moves right to (2,1) at turn 10, he is facing right. Then at turn 11, he can do a D (down) to change orientation to down? Or he can move? But he doesn't need to move. So he can do a change orientation to down at turn 11, then interact at turn 12.\n\nBut we can have him interact at turn 11? Only if he is already facing down. But after the move, he is facing right. So he must change orientation.\n\nAlternatively, at turn 10 he moves to (2,1) and is facing right. Then at turn 11, he can change orientation to down (action D) and then at turn 12 interact.\n\nBut we can combine? The change orientation action is separate.\n\nNow for Alice:\n\nTurn 8: Alice is at (3,3), facing U. We want her to go to (2,3). So move left (L). This will move her to (2,3) and she will face left.\n\nTurn 9: Alice is at (2,3) facing left. She needs to face up to interact with the onion dispenser at (2,4). So she can change orientation to up (U). Or move up? But (2,4) is non-empty, so she cannot move up. So change orientation to up (U action).\n\nTurn 10: Now facing up, she can interact (I) to grab an onion.\n\nNow she has an onion. Then she needs to go to (2,1) to put it in the pot. But Bob is going to be at (2,1) at turn 10? \n\nAt turn 10:\n- Bob: at (2,1) [from his turn 10 action: move right from (1,1) to (2,1)]\n- Alice: at (2,3) and just grabbed the onion, so she is at (2,3).\n\nShe cannot go down because (2,2) is blocked. So she must go left to (1,3) at turn 11? But at turn 10, Bob is at (2,1) and Alice at (2,3). They are not adjacent? (2,3) and (2,1) are separated by (2,2) which is blocked. So no conflict.\n\nBut to get to (2,1), Alice must go via (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1).\n\nBut at turn 10, Bob is at (2,1). He will stay there to change orientation and interact? So (2,1) is occupied by Bob until he leaves? But he doesn't leave. After putting the onion, he will leave? But he can leave to let Alice put her onion? Or he can stay and we can have Alice put the onion too? But the pot can hold three onions.\n\nAfter Bob puts his onion at turn 12 (if he interacts at turn 12), then the pot will have one onion. Then Alice can put hers to make two.\n\nBut we need one more onion. Who gets it? Bob is free after putting his onion. He can get another onion.\n\nBut let's see the timeline.\n\nAt turn 10:\n- Alice: at (2,3), does I (interact) to get onion.\n- Bob: at (2,1), he just arrived.\n\nTurn 11:\n- Bob: changes orientation to down (D action) to face the pot.\n- Alice: at (2,3) holding onion. She moves left to (1,3) [empty? and Bob is not there] -> action L.\n\nTurn 12:\n- Bob: interacts (I) to put his onion into the pot. Now the pot has one onion.\n- Alice: moves down from (1,3) to (1,2) -> action D.\n\nTurn 13:\n- Bob: after putting, he is holding nothing. He can go to get another onion? Or stay? He should get another onion.\n- Alice: moves down from (1,2) to (1,1) -> action D.\n\nTurn 14:\n- Bob: moves? He is at (2,1) holding nothing. He can go to an onion dispenser. The closest is (2,4). So he can move up to (2,2) -> blocked. So he must go via (1,1) or (3,1). Let him go to (1,1) but Alice is coming to (1,1) at turn 13? At turn 13, Alice is at (1,1). Then at turn 14, Alice will move to (2,1) [if Bob leaves]. \n\nBut at turn 14, Bob is at (2,1) and wants to leave. He can move up? blocked. Or left to (1,1) but (1,1) will be occupied by Alice at turn 13? At turn 13, Alice is at (1,1). So at turn 14, if Bob moves left to (1,1), he cannot because Alice is there? \n\nSo they might collide.\n\nTo avoid: at turn 13, Bob should move right to (3,1) [empty] to let Alice go to (2,1). Then Alice can put her onion.\n\nTurn 12:\n- Bob: I (put onion, pot now has 1 onion)\n- Alice: D (to 1,2)\n\nTurn 13:\n- Bob: moves right to (3,1) [empty] -> action R. Now at (3,1) facing right.\n- Alice: moves down to (1,1) -> D. Now at (1,1)\n\nTurn 14:\n- Bob: can go to get another onion? He is at (3,1). He can go up to (3,2) but blocked? (3,2) is kitchen counter. So he must go to (4,1) or (3,0) blocked. So he can go to (4,1) then to (4,0) pot? But we don't need to use that pot. He should get an onion. So from (3,1) to (4,1) [empty] then to (4,2) blocked? Then to (5,1) [empty] then to (5,2) [empty] then up to (5,3) [empty] then left to (4,3) [empty] then up to (4,4) [onion dispenser] and interact? That's long.\n\nAlternatively, from (3,1) he can go up? No, (3,2) blocked. So he must go to (4,1) then to (4,0) is pot, but he needs an onion. So he must go to an onion dispenser. The other one is at (4,4). So from (4,1) to (4,2) blocked -> so he must go via (5,1) and (5,2) to (5,3) then to (4,3) then to (4,4). \n\nBut Alice is going to (2,1) to put her onion.\n\nTurn 14:\n- Alice: from (1,1) moves right to (2,1) -> action R. Now at (2,1) facing right? (after move)\n- Then she must change orientation to down to face the pot? Then interact.\n\nTurn 15: Alice changes orientation to down (D) and then interact at turn 16? \n\nBut we want to minimize time.\n\nAlternatively, when she moves right to (2,1) at turn 14, she is facing right. She can change orientation to down at the same turn? No, one action per turn. So turn 14: move to (2,1) and face right. Then turn 15: change orientation to down (D). Then turn 16: interact to put onion.\n\nNow the pot has 2 onions (Bob put one, Alice put one). We need one more.\n\nBob is on his way to get another onion. He will take several turns.\n\nAfter Alice puts her onion, she can go get the third onion? But Bob is already going.\n\nBut Bob might be closer to the dispenser? He is at (3,1) at turn 13, then at turn 14 he moves to (4,1), turn 15 to (5,1), turn 16 to (5,2), turn 17 to (5,3), turn 18 to (4,3), turn 19 to (4,4) [if he moves up? (4,3) to (4,4) is a move? (4,4) is non-empty, so he must be at (4,3) and face up to interact. So at turn 19: change orientation to U? Then turn 20: interact to get onion.\n\nThat's too long.\n\nAlternatively, after Alice puts her onion at turn 16, she can go get the third onion. She is at (2,1). She can go to (2,3) then get onion from (2,4)? But (2,3) is empty. From (2,1) she can move up? blocked. So she must go via (1,1) and (1,2) to (1,3) then to (2,3). Then get onion.\n\nPath for Alice from (2,1) to get onion at (2,4):\n- Turn 16: after interacting, she is holding nothing? No, she put the onion, so holding nothing. Then she can go to (1,1) [but Bob might be there?] -> better to go to (1,1) at turn 17? \n\nTurn 16: Alice interacts (put onion, pot has 2 onions). Then she is at (2,1) holding nothing.\n\nTurn 17: Alice moves left to (1,1) [if Bob is not there] -> but Bob is at (4,1) at turn 14, then turn 15 to (5,1), etc. So (1,1) is free.\n\nTurn 18: Alice moves up to (1,2) -> U\nTurn 19: moves up to (1,3) -> U\nTurn 20: moves right to (2,3) -> R\nTurn 21: change orientation to up (U) -> then interact at turn 22 to get onion.\n\nThen she must go back to (2,1) to put the onion: \nTurn 22: interact to get onion, then at (2,3) holding onion.\nTurn 23: move left to (1,3)\nTurn 24: move down to (1,2)\nTurn 25: move down to (1,1)\nTurn 26: move right to (2,1)\nTurn 27: change orientation to down (D)\nTurn 28: interact to put onion.\n\nThen the pot has 3 onions and starts cooking at turn 28. Cooking time 5 turns, so ready at turn 33.\n\nThen someone must get a plate and serve.\n\nThis is taking too long. We need a better plan.\n\nAlternative: after the pot has two onions (at turn 16), Alice is at (2,1). Instead of her going, Bob can get the third onion faster? But Bob is far.\n\nOr we can have Bob get the third onion immediately after putting his first onion, but then he doesn't move away to let Alice put hers? \n\nAt turn 12: Bob puts his onion (pot has 1) and is at (2,1) holding nothing.\nThen at turn 13: Bob can go to get another onion? But Alice is coming to put hers. If Bob leaves immediately, Alice can come to (2,1) and put her onion without Bob being in the way.\n\nSo:\nTurn 12:\n- Bob: I (put, pot has 1)\n- Alice: D (to 1,2)\n\nTurn 13:\n- Bob: moves to (1,1) [left] -> L (to (1,1))? But (1,1) is where Alice is going? Alice is at (1,2) at turn 12, and at turn 13 she moves to (1,1). So if Bob moves to (1,1) at turn 13, collision? They cannot be on the same tile.\n\nSo Bob should not go to (1,1). He can go to (3,1) as before.\n\nBut then Alice can go to (2,1) at turn 13? \n\nTurn 13:\n- Alice: from (1,2) she can move down to (1,1) -> but then she is at (1,1) and Bob is at (2,1). Then at turn 14, Alice moves right to (2,1) but (2,1) is occupied by Bob? So she cannot.\n\nSo they must coordinate.\n\nAt turn 12:\n- Bob: after putting, he can move to (3,1) -> R (right) to (3,1)\n- Alice: moves down to (1,2) -> D\n\nTurn 13:\n- Bob: at (3,1), he can move to (4,1) -> R (right) to (4,1)\n- Alice: moves down to (1,1) -> D\n\nTurn 14:\n- Bob: moves to (5,1) -> R\n- Alice: moves right to (2,1) -> R. Now at (2,1) facing right.\n\nTurn 15: Alice changes orientation to down (D)\nTurn 16: Alice interacts to put onion (pot has 2)\n\nNow Bob is at (5,1), he can continue to the onion dispenser at (4,4) as before, but it will take many turns.\n\nAlice, after putting, can go to the closer onion dispenser? She is at (2,1). She can go to (2,3) to get onion from (2,4).\n\nTurn 17: Alice moves left to (1,1) -> L (from (2,1) to (1,1), facing left)\nTurn 18: moves up to (1,2) -> U\nTurn 19: moves up to (1,3) -> U\nTurn 20: moves right to (2,3) -> R\nTurn 21: change orientation to up (U)\nTurn 22: interact to get onion.\n\nThen she must return to (2,1) to put it.\n\nTurn 23: move left to (1,3)\nTurn 24: move down to (1,2)\nTurn 25: move down to (1,1)\nTurn 26: move right to (2,1)\nTurn 27: change orientation to down (D)\nTurn 28: interact to put onion. Pot now has 3 onions at turn 28.\n\nCooking starts at turn 28, takes 5 turns, so ready at turn 33.\n\nThen we need to serve the soup. Someone must get a plate, pick up the soup, and deliver to serving counter.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nAlice is at (2,1) after putting the onion. She can go to get a plate.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (0,2):\n- (2,1) to (1,1) -> left\n- (1,1) to (1,2) -> up\n- (1,2) to (0,2) -> left, but (0,2) is plate dispenser, non-empty, so she must be at (0,2) adjacent? (0,2) has adjacent: (0,1) [kitchen counter, blocked], (0,3) [kitchen counter, blocked], (1,2) [empty]. So she must be at (1,2) and face left to interact with the plate dispenser.\n\nSo at (1,2) facing left, she can interact to get a plate.\n\nThen she must go to the pot at (2,0) to serve the soup. She must be at (2,1) facing down to interact.\n\nThen she must deliver to serving counter at (6,2). From (2,1) to (6,2): \n- (2,1) to (3,1) -> right\n- (3,1) to (3,2) blocked -> so must go via (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), then to (6,2). But (6,2) is serving counter, non-empty. She must be at (5,2) and face right to interact with (6,2)? (6,2) has adjacent: (6,1) [kitchen counter], (6,3) [kitchen counter], (5,2) [empty]. So she must be at (5,2) facing right.\n\nSo path: from (2,1) to (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (5,2) -> then face right and interact to deliver.\n\nThis will take many turns.\n\nAnd the soup is ready at turn 33, so we can only deliver after turn 33.\n\nBut we are only planning for H turns, say 10 turns. So we may not complete the soup in 10 turns.\n\nPerhaps we should plan for a shorter horizon and focus on getting the pot filled.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize reward, and we can only get reward by delivering.\n\nGiven the time, let's plan for Alice for the next 10 turns (t8 to t17) to get one onion and put it in the pot, and assume Bob will put his onion and get the third.\n\nAlice's actions:\n\nTurn 8: L (move left to (2,3))\nTurn 9: U (change orientation to up to face the onion dispenser)\nTurn 10: I (interact to grab an onion)\nTurn 11: L (move left to (1,3))\nTurn 12: D (move down to (1,2))\nTurn 13: D (move down to (1,1))\nTurn 14: R (move right to (2,1))\nTurn 15: D (change orientation to down to face the pot)\nTurn 16: I (interact to put onion)\n\nThen at turn 16, the pot has at least one onion (if Bob put his), and Alice's onion makes two. Then she can leave to let Bob or herself get the third.\n\nBut we stop at turn 17? H=10 turns from t8 to t17? t8 to t8+9 = t17.\n\nSo 10 actions: turns t8 to t17 (inclusive) is 10 turns.\n\nSo actions for Alice for turns 8 to 17:\n\nTurn 8: L\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: I\nTurn 11: L\nTurn 12: D\nTurn 13: D\nTurn 14: R\nTurn 15: D\nTurn 16: I\nTurn 17: ? \n\nAt turn 17, Alice is at (2,1) holding nothing (after putting onion). She can start going to get another onion or a plate.\n\nBut since H=10, we stop at turn 17.\n\nBut this plan has Alice put one onion and we hope Bob has put one and will put another.\n\nBob's action history shows he has been moving and interacting. We can assume he will put his onion and get another.\n\nBut to be safe, we output Alice's actions.\n\nIn this plan, at turn 10, Alice is at (2,3) and Bob at (2,1) — no conflict.\n\nAt turn 11, Alice moves to (1,3), Bob is at (2,1) — no conflict.\n\nAt turn 12, Alice to (1,2), Bob at (2,1) — adjacent but not same tile, ok.\n\nTurn 13: Alice to (1,1), Bob at (2,1) — adjacent.\n\nTurn 14: Alice to (2,1) — but at turn 13, Bob is at (2,1). At turn 14, Bob must have moved away. In our earlier plan, at turn 13, Bob moves to (3,1) to avoid.\n\nSo we assume Bob will move away at turn 13.\n\nSo Alice's actions are feasible.\n\nSo the sequence for Alice:\n\nTurn 8: L\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: I\nTurn 11: L\nTurn 12: D\nTurn 13: D\nTurn 14: R\nTurn 15: D\nTurn 16: I\nTurn 17: ?  We can have her stay or start moving to get another onion. But since we are to plan for H turns, and H=10, we need 10 actions. Turn 8 to turn 17 is 10 actions (t8, t9, ..., t17).\n\nAt turn 17, she can move left to (1,1) to start going to get another onion? Or up to (2,2) blocked. So she can move left to (1,1) -> action L.\n\nBut then she is at (1,1). Then she can go up to get an onion.\n\nBut to be simple, we can have her stay or move towards the onion dispenser.\n\nAlternatively, since the pot has two onions, she can go to get the third onion.\n\nTurn 17: L (move left to (1,1))\nTurn 18: U (to (1,2))\nTurn 19: U (to (1,3))\nTurn 20: R (to (2,3))\nTurn 21: U (change orientation to up)\nTurn 22: I (get onion)\n\nBut we only need to output up to turn 17 for this plan of 10 turns.\n\nSo for turn 17, we can have her move left to (1,1).\n\nSo the actions:\n\nTurn 8: L\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: I\nTurn 11: L\nTurn 12: D\nTurn 13: D\nTurn 14: R\nTurn 15: D\nTurn 16: I\nTurn 17: L\n\nThis is for turns 8 to 17.\n\nBut at turn 17, she moves to (1,1), which is empty and not occupied by Bob (who is at (3,1) or further).\n\nSo it's ok.\n\nWe can output this.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice and Bob must collaborate to fill a pot with 3 onions (as per Recipe 1) and deliver the cooked soup. Given the current state (turn 8), Alice is at (3,3) holding nothing, and Bob is at (1,3) holding an onion. Both pots are empty. The plan focuses on Alice gathering an onion and delivering it to the pot at (2,0) via the accessible tile (2,1), while Bob is expected to deliver his onion to the same pot and gather a third onion. Alice's actions are optimized for efficiency and coordination with Bob's likely path.\n\n### Key Assumptions:\n- **Bob's actions**: Bob will move to (2,1) to deliver his onion to the pot at (2,0) by turn 12 (actions: Down to (1,2), Down to (1,1), Right to (2,1), then Down to face the pot, and Interact). After delivering, Bob will move away to gather another onion.\n- **Collision avoidance**: Alice's path avoids Bob's position. At turn 14, Alice moves to (2,1), which requires Bob to have moved away by turn 13 (to (3,1)).\n- **Pot usage**: The pot at (2,0) is used for efficiency, as it is closer to both players. After Alice's onion is added (turn 16), the pot will have 2 onions. Bob will gather the third onion to complete the recipe.\n\n### Alice's Action Plan (Turns 8 to 17):\n- **Turn 8 (t=8)**: Move Left (L) to (2,3). *Reason: Position for onion collection*.\n- **Turn 9 (t=9)**: Change orientation Up (U). *Reason: Face the onion dispenser at (2,4)*.\n- **Turn 10 (t=10)**: Interact (I) to grab an onion. *Reason: Collect onion from dispenser*.\n- **Turn 11 (t=11)**: Move Left (L) to (1,3). *Reason: Begin path to pot, avoiding Bob*.\n- **Turn 12 (t=12)**: Move Down (D) to (1,2). *Reason: Continue to pot access point*.\n- **Turn 13 (t=13)**: Move Down (D) to (1,1). *Reason: Final approach to pot tile*.\n- **Turn 14 (t=14)**: Move Right (R) to (2,1). *Reason: Arrive at pot interaction tile (assumes Bob has moved away)*.\n- **Turn 15 (t=15)**: Change orientation Down (D). *Reason: Face the pot at (2,0)*.\n- **Turn 16 (t=16)**: Interact (I) to add onion to pot. *Reason: Contribute to recipe (pot now has 2/3 onions)*.\n- **Turn 17 (t=17)**: Move Left (L) to (1,1). *Reason: Clear space for Bob and prepare for next task (e.g., gather third onion or plate)*.\n\n### Expected Outcome by Turn 17:\n- Alice delivers one onion to the pot at (2,0), contributing to the recipe.\n- Bob delivers one onion by turn 12, and gathers a third onion afterward.\n- The pot will have 2 onions by turn 16. With Bob adding the third, cooking starts (5-turn duration). Subsequent turns (beyond t=17) involve fetching a plate and delivering the soup for 20 reward.\n\nThis sequence ensures efficient coordination, minimizes idle time, and leverages Bob's actions. Alice's path avoids conflicts, and the pot is filled optimally.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn 8: } L \\\\\n\\text{Turn 9: } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn 10: } I \\\\\n\\text{Turn 11: } L \\\\\n\\text{Turn 12: } D \\\\\n\\text{Turn 13: } D \\\\\n\\text{Turn 14: } R \\\\\n\\text{Turn 15: } D \\\\\n\\text{Turn 16: } I \\\\\n\\text{Turn 17: } L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 11. We need to plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob) to maximize the reward. However, note that we can only control Alice's actions, but we should consider Bob's actions and state for coordination.\n\nGiven the environment:\n- Onion dispensers at (2,4) and (4,4)\n- Plate dispenser at (0,2)\n- Pots at (2,0) and (4,0)\n- Serving counter at (6,2)\n\nRecipe: 3 onions -> soup that cooks in 5 turns, reward 20.\n\nCurrent state:\n- Alice: at (3,3), facing left, holding nothing.\n- Bob: at (2,1), facing right, holding one onion.\n\nWe note that the pots are empty and the kitchen counters are empty.\n\nGoal: Make and deliver onion soup.\n\nPlan:\nWe need to get 3 onions into a pot. Bob already has one onion. So we need two more onions.\n\nSteps:\n1. Bob is holding an onion and is at (2,1). He can move to the pot at (2,0) (which is directly below him) and add the onion. But note: he is facing right. To interact with the pot at (2,0), he must be adjacent and facing it. He is at (2,1) and the pot is at (2,0). So he is adjacent (above the pot). But he is facing right, so he is not facing the pot (which is south). He needs to face down to interact.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can move down to (2,0) and then he would be on the same tile as the pot? But note: the pot is a non-empty tile. Players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles. So Bob cannot step on (2,0). He must stay at (2,1) and face down to interact with the pot at (2,0).\n\nBut note: the pot is at (2,0). Bob is at (2,1). The tile (2,0) is a pot, so it is non-empty. Bob cannot walk onto it. He must be adjacent and facing it to interact.\n\nTherefore, Bob must face down and then interact to put the onion into the pot at (2,0).\n\nHowever, we are only controlling Alice. We cannot directly control Bob. But we can assume that Bob is a teammate and we can coordinate. The problem says \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". Since we are not given Bob's future actions, we must assume that Bob will act reasonably. We can plan for Alice and also suggest what Bob should do, but the answer format is only for Alice's actions? The problem says \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice\".\n\nBut note: the task says \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\", so we can assume that Bob will also be trying to complete the recipe. We can plan Alice's actions considering what Bob is likely to do.\n\nGiven Bob's state and action history, we can infer that Bob is bringing an onion to a pot. He is at (2,1) holding an onion. The closest pot is (2,0). So it is reasonable that Bob will put his onion in the pot at (2,0) soon.\n\nSo let's assume Bob will put his onion in the pot at (2,0) in the next few turns.\n\nThen we need two more onions. Alice is at (3,3) holding nothing. She can go to an onion dispenser. The nearest onion dispenser is at (2,4) or (4,4). (2,4) is closer? Let's compute:\n\nAlice at (3,3):\n- To (2,4): left then up -> 2 steps? Actually, from (3,3) to (2,4): one left to (2,3) then one up to (2,4). But note: we must check the path. The grid has kitchen counters at various positions. We have a list of kitchen counters. Let me map the grid:\n\nWe are not given the entire grid layout, but we know the non-empty tiles. We assume that all other tiles are empty and walkable.\n\nKitchen counters: \n[(0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), \n(0,1), (6,1), \n(2,2), (3,2), (4,2), \n(0,3), (6,3), \n(0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)]\n\nPots: (2,0) and (4,0) are pots, so non-empty.\n\nSo for Alice at (3,3):\n- To (2,4): \n  - Move left to (2,3): is (2,3) empty? We don't have any non-empty tile at (2,3) in the list, so yes.\n  - Then move up to (2,4): (2,4) is an onion dispenser, which is non-empty? But note: dispensers are non-empty tiles, so Alice cannot walk onto (2,4). She must stand adjacent and face it to interact.\n\nSo to get an onion from (2,4):\n- Alice must be at (2,3) and face up, or at (1,4) and face right, or at (3,4) and face left? But (3,4) is a kitchen counter, which is non-empty so she cannot stand there.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) is a kitchen counter, so she cannot stand there.\n\nSo the only adjacent empty tile to (2,4) is (2,3). Therefore, Alice must be at (2,3) and face up to interact with the onion dispenser at (2,4).\n\nSimilarly for (4,4): adjacent empty tiles? \n- (4,3) is empty? We don't see it in the kitchen counters, so yes.\n- (3,4) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty.\n- (5,4) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty.\n- (4,5) is not in the grid? We don't know the grid boundaries. The problem doesn't specify, but from the given coordinates, we assume the grid is from x=0 to 6 and y=0 to 4? Because the highest y is 4. So (4,4) is at the top. So only (4,3) is adjacent below.\n\nTherefore, to get an onion from (4,4), Alice must be at (4,3) and face up.\n\nNow, Alice is at (3,3). \n- To (2,4): she can go left to (2,3) and then face up -> 2 actions: move left and then interact? But note: after moving left to (2,3), she is facing left? Then she must change orientation to up? Or she can interact? She is at (2,3) and the dispenser is at (2,4) which is above. So she must be facing up to interact. So she must change orientation to up and then interact.\n\nSimilarly, to (4,4): she can go right to (4,3) then change orientation to up and interact.\n\nWhich is closer? Both are 2 steps (one move and then one orientation change and interact? Actually, the move is one action, then changing orientation is another action? But note: when she moves, she changes her position and orientation. The action: if she moves left from (3,3) to (2,3), then she ends up at (2,3) facing left. Then she must change orientation to up (which is an action) and then interact.\n\nAlternatively, she can change orientation first? But she is at (3,3) facing left. To go to (2,4), she can change orientation to up? Then she is at (3,3) facing up. Then she can move up? But (3,4) is a kitchen counter (non-empty) so she cannot move up. So she must first move left to (2,3) and then change orientation to up and then interact.\n\nSo 3 actions: move left, change orientation to up, interact.\n\nSimilarly for (4,4): move right to (4,3) [if (4,3) is empty? We don't see it in non-empty, so yes], then change orientation to up, then interact.\n\nBoth are the same distance. But note: the pot we want to use. Bob is going to put an onion in the pot at (2,0). So it would be better to use the same pot to avoid having two partially filled pots.\n\nSo we should use the pot at (2,0). Therefore, Alice should go to (2,4) to get an onion and then bring it to the pot at (2,0).\n\nBut note: after getting an onion, she must go to the pot at (2,0). The pot at (2,0) is adjacent to (2,1) and (1,0) and (3,0). But (1,0) and (3,0) are kitchen counters? Yes, (1,0) and (3,0) are kitchen counters. So the only adjacent empty tile is (2,1). So she must be at (2,1) and face down to interact with the pot.\n\nSo plan for Alice:\n\nStep 1: Go to (2,4) to get an onion.\n  - From (3,3): move left to (2,3) -> now at (2,3) facing left? Actually, when she moves left from (3,3), she ends at (2,3) and her orientation becomes left? Or does the move action change the orientation to the direction of movement? The problem says: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" So when she moves left, she becomes at (2,3) and oriented left.\n\n  Then she must change orientation to up (action U? But note: the actions are: U, D, L, R for move or change orientation? The problem says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" So to change orientation without moving, we use the same letter? But how to distinguish? Actually, the action set is {U, D, L, R, I, S}. \n\n  Important: The same action letter (e.g., U) can mean either:\n    - If the adjacent tile in that direction is empty, then it's a move (and the orientation becomes that direction).\n    - Otherwise, it's just a change of orientation to that direction.\n\n  But in this case, when Alice is at (2,3) and facing left, if she does U (meaning \"up\"), then:\n    - The adjacent tile in the up direction is (2,4) which is an onion dispenser -> non-empty. So she cannot move up. Therefore, the action U at (2,3) will only change her orientation to up.\n\n  Then she can interact (I) to grab an onion.\n\n  So actions for Alice to get an onion at (2,4):\n    - Turn 11: L (move left to (2,3) and face left)\n    - Turn 12: U (change orientation to up, because (2,4) is non-empty so cannot move up)\n    - Turn 13: I (grab onion)\n\n  Now she is holding an onion.\n\nStep 2: Bring the onion to the pot at (2,0). She is at (2,3) holding an onion.\n\n  She needs to go to (2,1) to be able to interact with the pot at (2,0). Why (2,1)? Because from (2,1) she can face down to interact with the pot at (2,0). Note: she cannot stand on (2,0) because it's a pot.\n\n  Path: from (2,3) to (2,1): two moves down. But check the tiles:\n    - (2,2) is a kitchen counter? Yes, (2,2) is in the kitchen counter list -> non-empty. So she cannot step on (2,2).\n\n  Alternative path: \n    - Move right to (3,3) then down? But that might be longer.\n\n  What are the adjacent tiles to (2,3)? \n    - Left: (1,3) -> is it empty? We don't see (1,3) in non-empty, so yes.\n    - Right: (3,3) -> empty? Yes.\n    - Up: (2,4) -> non-empty.\n    - Down: (2,2) -> non-empty (kitchen counter).\n\n  So she cannot move down. She must go left or right.\n\n  Let me check the grid:\n\n  We have kitchen counters at (0,3) and (6,3). So (1,3) and (3,3) are empty? Yes.\n\n  So from (2,3):\n    - Option 1: left to (1,3)\n    - Option 2: right to (3,3)\n\n  Then from (1,3), she can go down to (1,2)? But (1,2) is not in the kitchen counter list? So it's empty? Then to (1,1)? Also empty? Then to (1,0)? But (1,0) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty. So she can't go to (1,0). Then from (1,1) she can go right to (2,1)? (2,1) is empty? We don't see it in non-empty, so yes.\n\n  Similarly, from (3,3) she can go down to (3,2)? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty. So she cannot go down. Then she must go to (4,3) or (2,3) again? \n\n  Alternatively, from (2,3) to (3,3) (which is where she started) and then right to (4,3) and then down? But then she would have to go around.\n\n  The direct way is via the left: (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1).\n\n  Check (1,2): not in kitchen counter list -> empty.\n  (1,1): not in list -> empty.\n\n  Steps:\n    - From (2,3): move left to (1,3) -> now at (1,3) facing left.\n    - Then move down to (1,2) -> now at (1,2) facing down.\n    - Then move down to (1,1) -> now at (1,1) facing down.\n    - Then move right to (2,1) -> now at (2,1) facing right.\n\n  Then she must face down to interact with the pot at (2,0). So:\n    - Change orientation to down (action D? But note: if she does D, since the tile below (2,0) is non-empty? Actually, (2,1) is adjacent to (2,0) below. But (2,0) is non-empty, so she cannot move down. Therefore, D action at (2,1) will only change her orientation to down.\n\n  Then interact to add the onion.\n\n  So actions:\n    - Turn 14: L (move left to (1,3))\n    - Turn 15: D (move down to (1,2))\n    - Turn 16: D (move down to (1,1))\n    - Turn 17: R (move right to (2,1))\n    - Turn 18: D (change orientation to down, because cannot move down)\n    - Turn 19: I (add onion to pot)\n\n  That is 9 actions (from turn 11 to 19) just for Alice to add one onion. Meanwhile, Bob is at (2,1) at turn 11. He is holding an onion and facing right. He can add his onion to the pot at (2,0) in two actions: \n      - Turn 11: D (change orientation to down, because he is at (2,1) and (2,0) is below -> non-empty, so he changes orientation to down without moving)\n      - Turn 12: I (add onion)\n\n  Then the pot at (2,0) will have one onion (from Bob) at turn 12.\n\n  Then at turn 19, Alice adds the second onion. But we need three onions. So we are still missing one.\n\n  Also, note that Bob is now free. He can go get another onion.\n\n  After Bob adds his onion (at turn 12), he is at (2,1) holding nothing. Then he can go to (2,4) to get another onion? But the same path issue: he cannot go through (2,2) because it's a kitchen counter. So he must go left or right.\n\n  Alternatively, he can go to the other onion dispenser at (4,4). But let's see.\n\n  However, we are only planning for Alice. So we must focus on Alice.\n\n  Alternatively, Alice can get two onions? But she can only carry one at a time.\n\n  So after Alice adds her onion (at turn 19), the pot has two onions. Then Bob (if he is coordinated) should get the third onion.\n\n  But we are not controlling Bob. We can only plan for Alice.\n\n  Alternatively, we can have Alice get two onions: after adding the first one, she can go back to get another one.\n\n  But that would take even more turns.\n\n  Another idea: use the pot at (4,0) as well? But then we would have two pots with one onion each and one with two? That is inefficient.\n\n  Or, after Bob adds his onion at turn 12, the pot has one onion. Then Alice adds at turn 19 -> two onions. Then Bob (if he goes to get another onion) can add the third.\n\n  But we need to plan Alice's actions. After she adds the onion at turn 19, what should she do? She can go get a plate? Because once the pot has three onions, it will cook for 5 turns and then become ready. Then someone needs to get a plate and serve.\n\n  So let's assume that Bob will get the third onion and add it to the pot at (2,0). Then the soup will start cooking at, say, turn 20 (if Bob is efficient). Then it will be ready at turn 25.\n\n  Meanwhile, Alice can go get a plate and be ready to serve.\n\n  Steps for Alice after adding the onion (turn 19: she is at (2,1) holding nothing, facing down):\n\n  She needs to go to the plate dispenser at (0,2). \n\n  Path from (2,1) to (0,2):\n    - (2,1) to (1,1) -> left (if facing down, she can move left? But she must change orientation to left? Or move left? The move left action will change her orientation to left and move to (1,1) if the tile is empty. (1,1) is empty? Yes.\n    - Then from (1,1) to (0,1)? But (0,1) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty. So she cannot go to (0,1).\n    - Alternatively, from (1,1) to (1,2) (up) -> (1,2) is empty? Yes.\n    - Then from (1,2) to (0,2)? But (0,2) is the plate dispenser -> non-empty. So she must stand adjacent and face it. The adjacent empty tile to (0,2) is (0,1) and (0,3) and (1,2). But (0,1) and (0,3) are kitchen counters? \n        - (0,1): kitchen counter -> non-empty, so she cannot stand there.\n        - (0,3): kitchen counter -> non-empty.\n        - (1,2): is the one she is at? So she is at (1,2) and (0,2) is left. So she can face left and interact.\n\n  So:\n    - Turn 20: L (from (2,1) move left to (1,1)) -> now at (1,1) facing left.\n    - Turn 21: U (move up to (1,2)) -> now at (1,2) facing up? But when she moves up, she becomes facing up? But we want to face left to interact with (0,2). So:\n    - Then she must change orientation to left? But she is at (1,2) and (0,2) is left. So action L: since (0,2) is non-empty, she cannot move left, so she changes orientation to left.\n    - Then interact.\n\n  So:\n    - Turn 20: L (move left to (1,1))\n    - Turn 21: U (move up to (1,2)) -> now facing up? Actually, the move up action: she moves to (1,2) and her orientation becomes up.\n    - Turn 22: L (change orientation to left, because (0,2) is non-empty so she doesn't move)\n    - Turn 23: I (grab a plate)\n\n  Now she is holding a plate.\n\n  Then she must go to the pot at (2,0) to serve the soup? But the soup may not be ready yet. We assumed Bob adds the third onion at around turn 20, then cooking starts at turn 20, so ready at turn 25. At turn 23, the soup is not ready. So she must wait.\n\n  But she can wait at (1,2) or move closer to the pot.\n\n  The pot at (2,0) is adjacent to (2,1). So she can go to (2,1) and wait there until the soup is ready.\n\n  From (1,2) to (2,1):\n    - Move right to (2,2)? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty. Cannot.\n    - Move down to (1,1) -> already at (1,2) so down to (1,1) -> then right to (2,1).\n\n  So:\n    - Turn 24: D (move down to (1,1)) -> facing down.\n    - Turn 25: R (move right to (2,1)) -> facing right.\n\n  Now at (2,1) at turn 25. The soup should be ready at turn 25? Since it started at turn 20 (if Bob added at turn 20) then at turn 25 it's ready. So at turn 25, she can interact with the pot? But she is at (2,1) and facing right. The pot is at (2,0) below. So she must face down.\n\n    - Turn 26: D (change orientation to down)\n    - Turn 27: I (interact: with a plate, she will take the soup and become holding a soup in a plate)\n\n  Then she must deliver the soup at the serving counter at (6,2). \n\n  From (2,1) to (6,2):\n    - Path: \n        - (2,1) -> (3,1): move right -> (3,1) is empty? Yes.\n        - (3,1) -> (4,1): move right -> (4,1) is not in non-empty? Yes, empty.\n        - (4,1) -> (5,1): move right -> (5,1) is not in non-empty? But we have (5,0) and (5,4) as kitchen counters. (5,1) is not listed -> empty.\n        - (5,1) -> (6,1): move right -> (6,1) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty. Cannot.\n        - Alternatively, from (5,1) to (5,2): move up -> (5,2) is not in non-empty? We have (5,4) and (3,2), (4,2). (5,2) is not listed -> empty.\n        - Then (5,2) to (6,2): move right? (6,2) is the serving counter -> non-empty. So she must stand adjacent and face it. Adjacent tiles: (5,2) is adjacent to (6,2) to the right. So she can be at (5,2) and face right, then interact.\n\n  So:\n    - Turn 28: R (from (2,1) move right to (3,1)) -> facing right.\n    - Turn 29: R (move right to (4,1)) -> facing right.\n    - Turn 30: R (move right to (5,1)) -> facing right.\n    - Turn 31: U (move up to (5,2)) -> facing up? But we need to face right for (6,2). So:\n        - At (5,2) she is facing up. Then she must change orientation to right? Action R: since (6,2) is non-empty, she changes orientation to right without moving.\n    - Turn 32: R (change orientation to right)\n    - Turn 33: I (deliver soup)\n\n  This is a long sequence and we are at turn 33. But note: we are only required to plan for several turns (H turns). We don't have to complete the entire recipe necessarily, but we want to maximize reward. However, the recipe is the only one and it takes time.\n\n  But we must consider: Bob might be getting the third onion earlier. Also, we assumed Bob adds the third onion. But what if Bob doesn't? Then we might need Alice to get the third onion as well.\n\n  Alternatively, we can have Alice get two onions and Bob get one? But Bob already has one and is about to add it.\n\n  Let me re-think: at turn 11, Bob is at (2,1) holding an onion. He can add it in two turns (turn 11: face down, turn 12: interact). Then the pot has one onion.\n\n  Then Bob is free. He can go get another onion. So we don't need Alice to get two onions.\n\n  Therefore, the plan for Alice:\n\n  - Get one onion from (2,4) and add it to the pot at (2,0). Then get a plate and serve the soup when ready.\n\n  But note: the cooking time is 5 turns. So after the third onion is added, we wait 5 turns.\n\n  We don't know exactly when Bob will add the third onion. But we can plan Alice's actions independently.\n\n  Revised plan for Alice (only):\n\n  Step 1: Get an onion from (2,4)\n    - Turn 11: L (move left to (2,3)) -> now at (2,3), facing left.\n    - Turn 12: U (change orientation to up) -> still at (2,3), facing up.\n    - Turn 13: I (grab onion) -> now holding onion.\n\n  Step 2: Go to (2,1) to add onion to pot at (2,0). But we cannot go down because (2,2) is blocked. So go via (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) to (2,1).\n    - Turn 14: L (move left to (1,3)) -> facing left.\n    - Turn 15: D (move down to (1,2)) -> facing down.\n    - Turn 16: D (move down to (1,1)) -> facing down.\n    - Turn 17: R (move right to (2,1)) -> facing right.\n\n    Now at (2,1) holding onion. She must face down to interact with the pot.\n    - Turn 18: D (change orientation to down) -> facing down.\n    - Turn 19: I (add onion) -> now holding nothing.\n\n    Now the pot has two onions (if Bob added one at turn 12). We hope Bob adds the third soon.\n\n  Step 3: Go to the plate dispenser at (0,2) to get a plate.\n    - From (2,1): \n        - Turn 20: L (move left to (1,1)) -> facing left.\n        - Turn 21: U (move up to (1,2)) -> facing up.\n        - Now at (1,2). The plate dispenser is at (0,2) to the left. So:\n        - Turn 22: L (change orientation to left) -> because (0,2) is non-empty, so she doesn't move, just faces left.\n        - Turn 23: I (grab plate) -> holding a plate.\n\n  Step 4: Wait until the soup is ready. But we don't know exactly when. We know that the third onion must be added by Bob. Let's assume Bob adds it at turn 20 (he has to go get another onion and come back). Then the soup starts cooking at turn 20 and is ready at turn 25.\n\n  So Alice must wait until at least turn 25. She can wait at (1,2) or move to (2,1) to be closer.\n\n    - Turn 24: D (move down to (1,1)) -> facing down.\n    - Turn 25: R (move right to (2,1)) -> facing right.\n\n    Now at (2,1) at turn 25. The soup should be ready. But she is facing right. She must face down to interact with the pot.\n\n    - Turn 26: D (change orientation to down)\n    - Turn 27: I (take the soup) -> now holding a soup on a plate.\n\n  Step 5: Deliver to serving counter at (6,2).\n    - From (2,1) to (6,2): \n        - We go: (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (5,2) -> then face right and interact with (6,2).\n        - Turn 28: R (move right to (3,1))\n        - Turn 29: R (move right to (4,1))\n        - Turn 30: R (move right to (5,1))\n        - Turn 31: U (move up to (5,2)) -> now at (5,2) facing up.\n        - Then change orientation to right: \n            - Turn 32: R (change orientation to right)\n            - Turn 33: I (deliver) -> reward 20.\n\n  This is 23 actions? We started at turn 11 and went to turn 33. But we are only planning for the next several turns. The problem says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\". We can choose H. But we want to complete the delivery to get the reward.\n\n  However, the problem says \"maximize total reward\", and we are delivering one soup. So we should plan until the delivery.\n\n  But note: we are at turn 11. We plan for turns 11 to ...? We can set H to 22 (so up to turn 33) to complete the delivery.\n\n  However, we don't control Bob, so if Bob doesn't add the third onion, the soup won't cook. But we have to assume that Bob will do his part.\n\n  Alternatively, we can have Alice get the third onion too? But that would be inefficient because she would have to make two trips for onions and then the plate. And the pot might start cooking earlier if Bob does his part.\n\n  Since Bob is already holding an onion and is near the pot, and then he is free to get another, it is reasonable to assume he will.\n\n  So I will output the sequence for Alice from turn 11 to turn 33? That's 23 actions. But the problem doesn't specify H, so we can choose a reasonable H to cover the delivery.\n\n  Alternatively, we can break the plan into phases and plan for a shorter horizon? But the soup delivery is the goal.\n\n  Considering that we are only required to plan for Alice, and we are at turn 11, we can plan the next 10-15 turns? But then we might not complete the delivery.\n\n  However, the problem says \"maximize the total reward\", and we are in the middle of the game. We might deliver multiple soups? But the recipe only requires one soup for now? Actually, we can make multiple soups. But the pots are empty now. We are starting the first soup.\n\n  But to be safe, we can plan for the next 10 turns? Then replan later? But the problem doesn't say. It says \"plan a sequence of actions ... over next several turns\".\n\n  Let me see: we have to at least get the onion and add it. That takes 9 turns (turn 11 to 19). Then we can plan to get the plate (takes 4 more turns: 20-23). Then we wait and serve. But the serving part is after turn 25.\n\n  So for the next 13 turns (from turn 11 to 23) we can plan: \n      - Get onion and add it to pot (turns 11-19)\n      - Get plate (turns 20-23)\n\n  Then at turn 23, she has a plate and is at (1,2). Then we can stop and replan? But the problem doesn't specify.\n\n  However, to show the entire process, I will write until the delivery, but note that the delivery happens at turn 33 which is 22 turns from turn 11.\n\n  But 22 turns might be too long for \"several turns\". So we might have to break.\n\n  Alternatively, we can plan until she adds the onion (turn 19) and then stop? But that doesn't get the plate.\n\n  Since the problem says \"several turns\", let's plan for the next 10 turns: from turn 11 to turn 20.\n\n  But then at turn 20, she is at (1,1) on the way to the plate dispenser? That doesn't complete the plate.\n\n  I think we should plan until she has added the onion and is about to go for the plate. That is 9 actions (turn 11 to 19). Then we can output that.\n\n  But note: after adding the onion, she is at (2,1) and then we want her to go to the plate dispenser. We can plan the next move.\n\n  Alternatively, we can plan for 10 turns: turn 11 to 20.\n\n  At turn 20, she would be at (1,1) after moving left from (2,1). Then in the next plan we can continue.\n\n  But to be safe, I'll plan for 10 turns: from turn 11 to turn 20.\n\n  So:\n    Turn 11: L\n    Turn 12: U\n    Turn 13: I\n    Turn 14: L\n    Turn 15: D\n    Turn 16: D\n    Turn 17: R\n    Turn 18: D\n    Turn 19: I\n    Turn 20: L   (start going to the plate dispenser)\n\n  Then at turn 20, she is at (1,1) facing left.\n\n  But we must ensure that Bob has added the first onion and will add the third. We are relying on Bob.\n\n  Alternatively, we can have Alice go to the other onion dispenser at (4,4) if it's faster? But it's symmetric.\n\n  Another idea: after getting the onion at (2,4), instead of going the long way to (2,1), is there a faster way? We cannot go through (2,2) because it's blocked. \n\n  Or use the kitchen counter? But kitchen counters are for temporary storage, but we don't need to store now.\n\n  Alternatively, we can have Alice go to the pot at (4,0) instead? Then she doesn't have to go around.\n\n  Let me check: from (2,3) holding an onion, go to the pot at (4,0).\n\n  The pot at (4,0) is adjacent to (4,1). So she must be at (4,1) and face down to interact.\n\n  Path from (2,3) to (4,1):\n    - (2,3) -> (3,3) (right) -> (3,3) is empty.\n    - Then (3,3) -> (4,3) (right) -> (4,3) is empty.\n    - Then (4,3) -> (4,2)? But (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty. Cannot.\n    - So she must go (4,3) -> (5,3)? But (5,3) is not in non-empty? We have (5,4) and (5,0). (5,3) is empty? Yes.\n    - Then (5,3) -> (5,2)? (5,2) is empty? Yes.\n    - Then (5,2) -> (5,1)? (5,1) is empty? Yes.\n    - Then (5,1) -> (4,1)? left -> (4,1) is empty.\n\n  That's 5 moves: right, right, down, down, left. Then at (4,1) she faces down and interacts.\n\n  Compare to the other path which took 4 moves (L, D, D, R) from (2,3) to (2,1) but we couldn't use it because of (2,2) blocked, so we went the long way (3 moves to (2,1) via (1,3),(1,2),(1,1)) plus the orientation change and interact.\n\n  The direct path to (4,1) from (2,3): \n      - Turn 14: R (to (3,3))\n      - Turn 15: R (to (4,3))\n      - Turn 16: D (cannot move down to (4,2) because blocked? (4,2) is kitchen counter. So she must go around: \n          - Instead, from (4,3) move right to (5,3): \n              Turn 16: R (to (5,3))\n      - Turn 17: D (to (5,2))\n      - Turn 18: D (to (5,1))\n      - Turn 19: L (to (4,1))\n      - Turn 20: D (change orientation to down)\n      - Turn 21: I (add onion)\n\n  This is 7 actions from turn 14 to 21, plus the first 3 actions to get the onion (turns 11-13), so total 10 actions to add the onion at turn 21. And then she is at (4,1). But this is longer than the previous path to (2,0) (which was 6 actions after getting the onion: turns 14-19).\n\n  The previous path for the same pot took 6 actions (turns 14-19) to add. So it's better to use the pot at (2,0) and go the long way around.\n\n  Therefore, I'll stick with the initial plan for Alice to go to (2,0) via (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1).\n\n  Final sequence for the next 10 turns (turn 11 to 20):\n\n    Turn 11: L   (move left to (2,3))\n    Turn 12: U   (change orientation to up)\n    Turn 13: I   (grab onion from (2,4))\n    Turn 14: L   (move left to (1,3))\n    Turn 15: D   (move down to (1,2))\n    Turn 16: D   (move down to (1,1))\n    Turn 17: R   (move right to (2,1))\n    Turn 18: D   (change orientation to down)\n    Turn 19: I   (add onion to pot at (2,0))\n    Turn 20: L   (move left to (1,1))   [starting to go to the plate dispenser]\n\n  This gets her to (1,1) at turn 20, holding nothing, facing left.\n\n  Then in the next planning phase, she can continue to the plate dispenser.\n\n  But note: at turn 19, she added an onion. The pot now has two onions (if Bob added one at turn 12). So we hope Bob is getting the third onion.\n\n  This plan is for 10 actions.\n\n  We output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: L\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: I\nTurn 14: L\nTurn 15: D\nTurn 16: D\nTurn 17: R\nTurn 18: D\nTurn 19: I\nTurn 20: L\n}\n\n  Note: The orientation changes and movements are as described.\n\n  Let me double-check the path:\n\n    - Turn 11: Alice at (3,3) facing left -> move left to (2,3), now facing left.\n    - Turn 12: U -> since (2,4) is non-empty, she doesn't move, changes orientation to up. Now at (2,3) facing up.\n    - Turn 13: I -> facing up, so interacts with (2,4) (onion dispenser) -> grabs an onion. Now holding an onion.\n    - Turn 14: L -> move left to (1,3) [since (1,3) is empty], now facing left.\n    - Turn 15: D -> move down to (1,2) [empty], now facing down.\n    - Turn 16: D -> move down to (1,1) [empty], now facing down.\n    - Turn 17: R -> move right to (2,1) [empty], now facing right.\n    - Turn 18: D -> change orientation to down (since (2,0) is non-empty, she doesn't move), now facing down.\n    - Turn 19: I -> facing down, so interacts with (2,0) (pot) -> adds onion. Now holding nothing.\n    - Turn 20: L -> move left to (1,1) [empty], now facing left.\n\n  This is valid.\n\n  We assume Bob has added his onion at turn 12 and is now getting the third onion.\n\n  This plan sets Alice up to go to the plate dispenser next.\n\n  We have maximized progress towards the soup delivery.\n\n  So we output the above.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice and Bob should collaborate to prepare and deliver an onion soup (requiring 3 onions, cooking for 5 turns, and yielding a reward of 20). Given the current state:\n- Bob is near the pot at (2,0) holding an onion and can add it quickly.\n- Alice is at (3,3) and should fetch an onion from (2,4) and add it to the pot at (2,0), then prepare to serve the soup.\n\n### Optimized Action Plan for Alice (Turns 11-20):\n1. **Turn 11 (L)**: Move left to (2,3), facing left.  \n2. **Turn 12 (U)**: Change orientation to up (facing onion dispenser at (2,4)).  \n3. **Turn 13 (I)**: Interact to grab an onion.  \n4. **Turn 14 (L)**: Move left to (1,3), facing left.  \n5. **Turn 15 (D)**: Move down to (1,2), facing down.  \n6. **Turn 16 (D)**: Move down to (1,1), facing down.  \n7. **Turn 17 (R)**: Move right to (2,1), facing right.  \n8. **Turn 18 (D)**: Change orientation to down (facing pot at (2,0)).  \n9. **Turn 19 (I)**: Interact to add onion to the pot (now 2/3 onions, assuming Bob added his at turn 12).  \n10. **Turn 20 (L)**: Move left to (1,1), facing left (starting the path to the plate dispenser at (0,2)).  \n\n### Coordination & Next Steps:\n- **Bob's Role**: After adding his onion (turn 12), he should fetch the third onion from (4,4) and add it to the pot at (2,0) by ~turn 20, starting the 5-turn cook.  \n- **Alice's Continuation**: After turn 20, Alice will proceed to (0,2) to grab a plate, return to (2,1), and serve the soup at (6,2) once cooked (reward captured by turn ~33).  \n\nThis sequence ensures efficient division of labor (Alice: 1 onion + plate; Bob: 2 onions) and minimizes idle time. The pot starts cooking by turn 20, with delivery maximizing the reward.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: L\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: I\nTurn 14: L\nTurn 15: D\nTurn 16: D\nTurn 17: R\nTurn 18: D\nTurn 19: I\nTurn 20: L\n}",

The goal is to maximize the total reward by delivering soup recipes.\n\nFirst, note the recipe information: only one recipe is given, which requires 3 onions and cooks in 5 turns for a reward of 20.\n\nLooking at the current state:\n\n- Alice is at (2,3) facing left, holding nothing.\n- Bob is at (5,1) facing right, holding one onion.\n\nThe tile types:\n\n- Onion dispensers at (2,4) and (4,4)\n- Plate dispenser at (0,2)\n- Pots at (2,0) and (4,0)\n- Serving counter at (6,2)\n\nKitchen counters are all empty, and pots are empty.\n\nWe need to deliver a soup. Since the recipe requires 3 onions, we can make onion soup.\n\nPlan:\n\n1. We need to get 3 onions into a pot. Currently, Bob already has one onion. So we need two more onions.\n\n2. We have two onion dispensers: (2,4) and (4,4). Alice is at (2,3) which is below (2,4). Bob is at (5,1) which is away from the onion dispensers.\n\n3. We have two pots: (2,0) and (4,0). We can choose one to use.\n\n4. After cooking, we need a plate to serve the soup. The plate dispenser is at (0,2).\n\n5. Then deliver at (6,2).\n\nSteps:\n\n- Bob is holding an onion. He should go to a pot and put the onion in. The closest pot to Bob? Bob is at (5,1). The pots are at (2,0) and (4,0). (4,0) is closer (distance: |5-4| + |1-0| = 1+1=2). (2,0) is |5-2|+|1-0|=3+1=4. So Bob should go to (4,0).\n\n  Bob's path: from (5,1) to (4,0): \n    - First, move down to (5,0) [if that tile is walkable?]. But note the tile types: (5,0) is a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters are at (0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0). So (5,0) is a kitchen counter and is non-empty? But the problem says \"non-empty\" kitchen counters are listed, and it says all kitchen counters are empty. So that means they are empty and therefore walkable? But note: players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles. Since the kitchen counter is empty, it is walkable? Actually, the tile type is kitchen counter, which is a non-empty tile? Or is it that the kitchen counter is a tile that can have an item on it? The rules say:\n\n    - Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\n\n    And for movement: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" But a kitchen counter is a tile that can be occupied by an item? However, the problem states: \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter: All kitchen counters are empty.\" So the kitchen counters are empty, meaning no items on them. Therefore, they are walkable? Actually, the rules say:\n\n    \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\"\n\n    And the tile types are: Empty Tile, Dispensers, Pot, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter.\n\n    But note: the kitchen counter is a type of tile that is not empty? The rule says \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and then the others are non-empty? Actually, the rules say:\n\n    \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\"\n\n    And the tile types are listed, so presumably the non-empty tiles are the ones that are not empty tiles. But the kitchen counter is a tile type that is not empty? However, the problem says \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" meaning it's a tile that can have an item? But the movement rule says you cannot walk on non-empty tiles. So if the kitchen counter has an item, you cannot walk on it? But if it's empty, then it is walkable? The rules don't explicitly say, but logically:\n\n    - Empty Tile: walkable.\n    - Dispensers, Pot, Serving Counter: non-empty, so not walkable? But wait, the rules say \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles\", meaning tiles that are occupied by an object? But note that the player must be adjacent to interact with a dispenser, pot, etc. So the player must stand on an adjacent empty tile.\n\n    Therefore, the non-empty tiles (dispensers, pots, serving counters, and kitchen counters that have an item) are obstacles. But the kitchen counters without an item are walkable? The problem doesn't explicitly state, but we can assume that:\n\n    - The base tile type is either empty or non-empty (like dispenser, pot, etc.). The kitchen counter is a non-empty tile? Or is it that the kitchen counter is a tile that is walkable when empty and not when it has an item? The rules are ambiguous.\n\n    However, the problem states: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and then in the constraints: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" And the tile types are listed separately. The kitchen counter is listed as a tile type. So I think we must assume that the kitchen counter is a non-empty tile (because it's not an empty tile) and therefore not walkable. But then how can a player interact with it? They must stand adjacent.\n\n    But note the movement rule: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\" and then \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This is confusing.\n\n    Actually, the rule says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This seems to be about the change orientation action? Or is it about the move action?\n\n    Let me re-read:\n\n    \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\"\n\n    Then: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This is a separate action. But the description of the change orientation action says: \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This doesn't make sense because changing orientation doesn't move? I think there might be a misunderstanding.\n\n    Actually, the rule for movement: when you move, you change position and orientation. But if the tile you are moving to is not walkable (i.e., not empty and not a tile you can walk on), then the move fails? But the rule doesn't say. However, the constraint says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So we must assume that movement is only possible to empty tiles? Or to any tile that is walkable? The rules say:\n\n    \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\"\n\n    So only empty tiles are walkable? Then dispensers, pots, serving counters, and kitchen counters are not walkable? But then how do players get to them? They must be adjacent? That is correct.\n\n    So:\n\n    - Only empty tiles are walkable.\n\n    Therefore, the kitchen counter tiles are not walkable? But the problem says \"Kitchen Counter\" is a tile type. So if it's not an empty tile, then it's not walkable.\n\n    But note: the kitchen counter is listed in the tile types, and the problem states the positions of kitchen counters. So (5,0) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty tile -> not walkable.\n\n    Therefore, Bob at (5,1) cannot move down to (5,0) because that is a kitchen counter -> non-empty -> not walkable.\n\n    How can Bob get to the pot at (4,0)? He must go around.\n\n    Let me map the grid:\n\n    We have a grid? The problem doesn't give the entire grid, but we know the positions of non-empty tiles.\n\n    We know the kitchen counters: [(0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)]\n\n    Pots: (2,0) and (4,0)\n\n    Onion dispensers: (2,4), (4,4)\n\n    Plate dispenser: (0,2)\n\n    Serving counter: (6,2)\n\n    We also need to know which tiles are empty and walkable.\n\n    Since the grid is not fully specified, we must assume that any tile not listed as one of these non-empty types is empty? But note the dispensers, pots, serving counters, and kitchen counters are non-empty. So the rest are empty? But what about the positions of the players? They are on empty tiles? The rules say: players are on empty tiles.\n\n    Alice is at (2,3): is (2,3) a non-empty tile? The non-empty tiles are the ones listed. (2,3) is not in the kitchen counter list? Let me check: kitchen counters are at (0,0), (1,0), ... (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4). So (2,3) is not listed -> so it is an empty tile? Similarly, Bob is at (5,1) -> not in the kitchen counter list? The kitchen counters include (0,1) and (6,1) but not (5,1). So (5,1) is empty.\n\n    Therefore, the grid:\n\n    Let me try to sketch a 7x5 grid? (x from 0 to 6, y from 0 to 4)\n\n    But we don't have the entire grid, but we can infer walkable tiles.\n\n    Bob at (5,1) wants to go to (4,0). The direct path would be left to (4,1) and then down to (4,0). But (4,1) is not listed as non-empty -> so empty? Then walkable. (4,0) is a pot -> non-empty, so Bob cannot walk on it. He must be adjacent to interact.\n\n    So Bob can go to (4,1) (which is empty) and then interact with the pot at (4,0) by facing down? But Bob is at (5,1) and facing right. He can move left to (4,1) and then change orientation to down to face the pot at (4,0). Then interact.\n\n    Steps for Bob:\n\n    - Turn 14: move left to (4,1) -> action L.\n    - Then at (4,1), he is holding an onion. He needs to face down to interact with the pot at (4,0). So at the next turn, he can change orientation to down? But note: he can also do it in the same turn? No, each turn one action.\n\n    Alternatively, after moving to (4,1), he is at (4,1) and his orientation? After moving left, his orientation becomes left? Because the move action also changes orientation to the direction of movement. So after moving left, he is facing left. Then he needs to face down to interact with the pot below? So he must use a change orientation action to face down.\n\n    Then at the next turn, he can interact.\n\n    So Bob:\n\n    Turn 14: L (move left to (4,1), now facing left)\n    Turn 15: D (change orientation to down? But the change orientation action uses the same letters? The actions are: U, D, L, R for both move and change orientation? Actually, the problem says:\n\n    - Move (L/R/U/D): changes position and orientation.\n    - Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): no move, only changes orientation.\n\n    So to change orientation to down, Bob would use the action 'D'. But that is the same as moving down? How to distinguish? The problem lists the actions as U, D, L, R, I, S. And then explains:\n\n    - Move: uses L/R/U/D and changes position and orientation.\n    - Change Orientation: uses L/R/U/D and only changes orientation (if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty? Actually, the rule says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This is confusing.\n\n    Let me read carefully:\n\n    \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\n    This seems to imply that when you use the change orientation action, it doesn't move, but the condition \"if the adjacent tile is not an empty one\" might be a mistake? Or does it mean that the orientation change is only allowed if the adjacent tile in that direction is empty? That doesn't make sense because you can face a non-empty tile to interact.\n\n    I think there might be a misinterpretation. Let me re-read the entire action description:\n\n    \"Each player (Alice/Bob) can:\n    - Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\n    - Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\n    - Interact (I): ...\"\n\n    The change orientation action: the phrase \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one\" is confusing. It might mean that the change orientation action does not cause a move, regardless of the adjacent tile? But the condition is unclear.\n\n    Alternatively, it might be a typo and it should say: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): Changes orientation without moving, regardless of adjacent tiles.\"\n\n    But the rule as written is ambiguous.\n\n    Given the ambiguity, I will assume that the change orientation action always changes the orientation to the specified direction, without any condition (because the condition about the adjacent tile doesn't make sense for an orientation change). Therefore, Bob can change his orientation to down even if the tile below is non-empty.\n\n    So Bob:\n\n    Turn 14: L (move left to (4,1), now facing left)\n    Turn 15: D (change orientation to down) -> now facing the pot at (4,0)\n    Turn 16: I (interact) -> put the onion into the pot.\n\n    But note: the pot is empty. Putting one onion in.\n\n    Now, the pot has one onion. We need two more.\n\n    Meanwhile, Alice is at (2,3) facing left. She can go to the onion dispenser at (2,4). But note: (2,4) is an onion dispenser -> non-empty tile. She must be adjacent and facing it to interact.\n\n    Alice at (2,3): the tile above (2,4) is adjacent? But (2,4) is above (2,3). So she can move up to (2,4)? But (2,4) is non-empty -> cannot walk. So she must stand adjacent. The adjacent empty tiles to (2,4) are:\n\n    - (1,4): kitchen counter -> non-empty? (1,4) is in the kitchen counter list -> non-empty -> not walkable.\n    - (3,4): kitchen counter -> non-empty.\n    - (2,3): empty? Yes, and she is there.\n    - (2,5): out of bounds? The grid y from 0 to 4? So (2,5) doesn't exist.\n\n    So the only adjacent empty tile to (2,4) is (2,3) and (1,4) and (3,4) are non-empty. (2,5) doesn't exist. So Alice is at (2,3) which is adjacent to (2,4). But she is facing left. To interact with (2,4) which is above, she must face up.\n\n    Steps for Alice:\n\n    Turn 14: change orientation to up? But the action for change orientation to up is 'U'. But if she does 'U', that would be a move? The move action is the same letter. How to do change orientation to up? The problem does not distinguish between move and change orientation by the letter. It says the actions are in the set {U, D, L, R, I, S}. And the meaning:\n\n    - If the player intends to move, they use U/D/L/R and that moves them and changes orientation.\n    - If the player intends to change orientation without moving, they use U/D/L/R and that only changes orientation? But the rule says for change orientation: \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This is confusing.\n\n    I think we must interpret:\n\n    When a player uses U, D, L, R:\n\n        - If the adjacent tile in that direction is empty, then it moves the player and sets the orientation to that direction.\n        - Otherwise, if the adjacent tile is non-empty, then it does not move and only changes the orientation to that direction.\n\n    But that would be a combined action? The problem lists two separate actions: \"Move\" and \"Change Orientation\". But then the action set is the same letters? This is ambiguous.\n\n    After re-reading: the problem says:\n\n    \"Each player (Alice/Bob) can:\n    - Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\n    - Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\n    And then the action set is {U, D, L, R, I, S}. So the same letter is used for two different actions? That doesn't make sense.\n\n    Alternatively, the action set {U, D, L, R, I, S} corresponds to:\n\n        U: either move up or change orientation to up? But how is it decided?\n\n    I think the intended meaning is:\n\n        - When a player uses U, D, L, R, it is an attempt to move in that direction. If the tile in that direction is empty, then the player moves and their orientation becomes that direction. If the tile is non-empty, then the player does not move but still changes their orientation to that direction.\n\n    This matches the description of the change orientation action: because if the adjacent tile is non-empty, then the player doesn't move and only changes orientation.\n\n    Therefore, the same action U/D/L/R can either move (if the target tile is empty) or just change orientation (if the target tile is non-empty).\n\n    So for Alice at (2,3) facing left:\n\n        She wants to face up to interact with the dispenser at (2,4). The tile above (2,4) is out of bounds? But (2,4) is at the top? The grid y goes from 0 to 4, so (2,4) is the top row. The tile above (2,4) doesn't exist. But she is at (2,3) and wants to face up to interact with (2,4). The tile above her (at (2,4)) is non-empty (onion dispenser). So if she uses 'U':\n\n            - The adjacent tile in the U direction is (2,4) -> non-empty -> so she doesn't move, but changes her orientation to up.\n\n        So action: U -> changes orientation to up.\n\n    Then, since she is now at (2,3) facing up and adjacent to the dispenser, she can interact to grab an onion.\n\n    So:\n\n        Turn 14: U -> changes orientation to up (because the tile above is non-empty) -> now facing up.\n\n        Turn 15: I -> interact with the dispenser above -> grabs an onion.\n\n    Then she is holding an onion. She needs to take it to the pot. Which pot? We have two pots: (2,0) and (4,0). The pot at (2,0) is closer to her? She is at (2,3). The pot at (2,0) is below.\n\n    How to get to (2,0)? \n\n        (2,3) to (2,2): (2,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty -> not walkable. So she cannot go down to (2,2).\n\n    So she must go around.\n\n    Path from (2,3) to (2,0):\n\n        Option: go left to (1,3) -> (1,3) is not a kitchen counter? Kitchen counters: (0,3) and (6,3) -> so (1,3) is empty? Then down to (1,2) -> (1,2) is not in the kitchen counter list? Kitchen counters: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) -> so (1,2) is empty? Then down to (1,1) -> (1,1) is not listed -> empty? Then right to (2,1) -> (2,1) not listed -> empty? Then down to (2,0) -> but (2,0) is a pot -> non-empty, so she can only go to (2,1) and then face down to interact with the pot.\n\n    Alternatively, she could go right to (3,3) -> (3,3) not listed -> empty? Then down to (3,2) -> (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty -> not walkable. So that doesn't work.\n\n    So the path via (1,3) is possible.\n\n    Steps:\n\n        From (2,3) to (1,3): move left -> L. Then she is at (1,3) facing left.\n        Then down to (1,2): D -> (1,2) is empty? Yes. Then at (1,2) facing down.\n        Then down to (1,1): D -> (1,1) is empty? Yes. Then at (1,1) facing down.\n        Then right to (2,1): R -> (2,1) is empty? Yes. Then at (2,1) facing right.\n        Then down to (2,0)? But (2,0) is non-empty -> cannot walk. So she must stop at (2,1) and face down to interact with the pot at (2,0).\n\n    That is 4 moves to get to (2,1). Then one action to change orientation to down? But after moving right to (2,1), she is facing right. Then she must change orientation to down. Since the tile below (2,0) is non-empty, using 'D' will only change orientation to down without moving.\n\n    Then interact.\n\n    Alternatively, after (1,1), she could go down to (1,0) but (1,0) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty -> not walkable. So that is blocked.\n\n    So the path to (2,1) is the only way.\n\n    But note: we have another pot at (4,0). Maybe that is easier? From (2,3) to (4,0):\n\n        (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (4,3) -> (4,2) is kitchen counter -> non-empty. So she cannot go down at (4,3) to (4,2). So she must go:\n\n        (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) is non-empty -> so she cannot go down from (3,3). So she must go:\n\n        (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> then from (4,1) she can interact with (4,0) by facing down.\n\n    That is longer.\n\n    Therefore, it's better to use the pot at (2,0) via (2,1).\n\n    So for Alice:\n\n        Turn 14: U (to face up, because above is non-empty)\n        Turn 15: I (grab onion)\n        Then she is at (2,3) holding an onion, facing up.\n\n        Turn 16: L (move left to (1,3), now facing left)\n        Turn 17: D (move down to (1,2), now facing down)\n        Turn 18: D (move down to (1,1), now facing down)\n        Turn 19: R (move right to (2,1), now facing right)\n        Turn 20: D (change orientation: since below is non-empty, this will change orientation to down without moving -> now facing the pot at (2,0))\n        Turn 21: I (put the onion into the pot)\n\n    Now, the pot at (2,0) has one onion from Alice? But Bob put one onion in the pot at (4,0). We need to have one pot with three onions.\n\n    We have two pots: one at (2,0) and one at (4,0). Bob put one onion in (4,0). Alice is putting one onion in (2,0). We need two more onions? Actually, we need two more onions to complete the recipe in one pot.\n\n    We want one pot to have three onions. So we should choose one pot and both contribute to it.\n\n    Since Bob started with one onion and put it in (4,0), it would be better to continue with (4,0). But Alice is going to (2,0). That will split the ingredients.\n\n    Alternatively, we can have Alice go to (4,0) instead? But that is farther.\n\n    Let me recast: we should coordinate to use the same pot.\n\n    Bob is going to put his onion in (4,0). Then we need two more onions. Alice can get one onion and put it in (4,0). And then someone (Bob or Alice) gets another onion and puts it in (4,0).\n\n    How about:\n\n        Bob: \n            Turn 14: L -> to (4,1) [facing left]\n            Turn 15: D -> change orientation to down (facing the pot at (4,0))\n            Turn 16: I -> put the onion -> now pot at (4,0) has 1 onion.\n\n        Then Bob is free. He can go to get another onion.\n\n        Alice:\n            Turn 14: U -> face up (to face the dispenser at (2,4))\n            Turn 15: I -> grab an onion.\n\n        Then Alice can go to (4,0) to put her onion? But that is far.\n\n        Alternatively, Bob can get the second onion? Bob is at (4,1) after putting the onion. He can go to the onion dispenser at (4,4). But (4,4) is above. From (4,1):\n\n            To (4,4): \n                (4,1) -> (4,2) is kitchen counter -> blocked. \n                So he must go around: \n                    (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) is kitchen counter -> blocked? \n                    (3,1) is empty? Then (3,1) -> (3,0) is kitchen counter? (3,0) is kitchen counter -> non-empty. \n                    So he cannot go down.\n\n            Alternatively, go up? But (4,2) is blocked. So he must go:\n\n                (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (5,2): (5,2) is not listed? But (5,4) is kitchen counter, (5,0) is kitchen counter, (5,1) is empty? Then (5,1) to (5,2): is (5,2) a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) -> so (5,2) is not listed -> empty? Then (5,2) -> (5,3) -> empty? Then (5,3) -> (5,4) -> kitchen counter -> non-empty -> cannot walk. But the dispenser at (4,4) is adjacent to (4,3)? (4,3) is empty? Then Bob can go to (4,3) and face up to interact.\n\n            Path for Bob from (4,1) to (4,3):\n\n                (4,1) to (5,1): R -> (5,1) is empty? Yes, Bob was there earlier.\n                (5,1) to (5,2): U -> (5,2) is empty? Yes.\n                (5,2) to (5,3): U -> (5,3) is empty? Yes.\n                (5,3) to (4,3): L -> (4,3) is empty? Yes.\n\n            Then at (4,3), he can face up to interact with the dispenser at (4,4). But (4,4) is above (4,3). So he uses U: but the tile above is non-empty -> so he changes orientation to up without moving. Then interact.\n\n            Steps for Bob after putting the first onion:\n\n                Turn 17: R (to (5,1)) facing right.\n                Turn 18: U (to (5,2)) facing up.\n                Turn 19: U (to (5,3)) facing up.\n                Turn 20: L (to (4,3)) facing left.\n                Turn 21: U (change orientation to up, because above is non-empty) -> now facing up.\n                Turn 22: I (grab onion)\n\n            That is 6 turns after turn 16.\n\n        Meanwhile, Alice:\n\n            After grabbing an onion at turn 15, she is at (2,3) holding an onion, facing up.\n\n            She can go to (4,0) to put it? But that is far. Alternatively, she can put it in the pot at (2,0) and then we have two pots with one onion each? Not good.\n\n        Alternatively, she can go to (4,0) but that will take many steps.\n\n        Or, she can drop the onion on a kitchen counter? But there is a kitchen counter at (0,3) and (6,3) and (2,2) etc. But (2,2) is adjacent? But she is at (2,3) and (2,2) is below -> kitchen counter. She can face down and interact to place the onion on the kitchen counter? Then she becomes free.\n\n        Then later, Bob or she can pick it up and put it in the pot at (4,0).\n\n        Steps for Alice:\n\n            Turn 16: D (change orientation to down? Because below is (2,2) non-empty -> so she changes to face down without moving)\n            Turn 17: I -> place the onion on the kitchen counter at (2,2). Now she is holding nothing.\n\n        Then she can go to get another onion? Or Bob can pick up that onion later.\n\n        But then we have an onion at (2,2). Bob is at (4,1) and then he goes to get another onion. He is going to (4,3) to get an onion. Then he has an onion. He can then go to (2,2) to pick up the onion? But that is inefficient.\n\n        Alternatively, after Alice drops the onion, she can go to get another onion and then both go to the pot at (4,0).\n\n        Let's try to have the pot at (4,0) get three onions.\n\n        Currently:\n\n            Turn 16: Bob has put one onion in (4,0).\n\n            Turn 17: Alice drops her onion at (2,2).\n\n        Then Alice can go to get another onion from (2,4):\n\n            Turn 18: U (she is at (2,3) and facing down? After interacting, she is still at (2,3) and facing down? Then to interact with the dispenser above, she must face up.\n\n            Turn 18: U (change orientation to up, because above is non-empty) -> now facing up.\n            Turn 19: I -> grab an onion.\n\n        Then she is holding an onion again. Now she can go to (4,0) to put it? But that is far.\n\n        Meanwhile, Bob is getting an onion from (4,4) as planned? But that takes until turn 22.\n\n        We need to get the onion from the kitchen counter (2,2) to the pot. Who does that?\n\n        Alice, after grabbing the second onion, can go to the pot at (4,0). But she is at (2,3) holding an onion.\n\n        Path: (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (4,3) -> then to (4,1) is blocked by kitchen counter at (4,2). So she must go:\n\n            (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) is kitchen counter -> blocked. \n            So go via (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> then face down to interact with (4,0).\n\n        That is 6 moves.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Turn 20: L (to (1,3)) facing left.\n            Turn 21: D (to (1,2)) facing down.\n            Turn 22: D (to (1,1)) facing down.\n            Turn 23: R (to (2,1)) facing right.\n            Turn 24: R (to (3,1)) facing right.\n            Turn 25: R (to (4,1)) facing right.\n            Turn 26: D (change orientation to down) -> facing the pot.\n            Turn 27: I -> put the onion.\n\n        So at turn 27, the pot gets the second onion.\n\n        Then we need a third onion. Bob is at turn 22: he has just grabbed an onion at (4,3). He can then go to (4,1) to put it in the pot:\n\n            Turn 23: D (change orientation to down? But he is at (4,3) facing up. To move down, he can use D: but the tile below is (4,2) which is kitchen counter -> non-empty. So using D will only change orientation to down without moving.\n            Then he needs to move down to (4,2)? But (4,2) is non-empty -> cannot walk. So he must go around.\n\n            Path: (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (5,2) -> (5,1) -> (4,1). Then face down to interact.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                Turn 23: R (move right to (5,3)) facing right.\n                Turn 24: D (move down to (5,2)) facing down.\n                Turn 25: D (move down to (5,1)) facing down.\n                Turn 26: L (move left to (4,1)) facing left.\n                Turn 27: D (change orientation to down) -> facing the pot.\n                Turn 28: I -> put the onion.\n\n        So at turn 28, the pot has three onions. Then it starts cooking. Cooking time is 5 turns. So it will be ready at turn 33.\n\n        Then we need to serve it.\n\n        We need a plate. The plate dispenser is at (0,2). Alice is at (4,1) after putting the onion at turn 27. Bob is at (4,1) at turn 28? No, Bob is at (4,1) at turn 26? Let me recount:\n\n            Bob's timeline:\n\n                Turn 14: L -> (4,1) [facing left]\n                Turn 15: D -> face down\n                Turn 16: I -> put onion in (4,0) -> now holding nothing.\n                Turn 17: R -> to (5,1) [facing right]\n                Turn 18: U -> to (5,2) [facing up]\n                Turn 19: U -> to (5,3) [facing up]\n                Turn 20: L -> to (4,3) [facing left]\n                Turn 21: U -> face up (no move)\n                Turn 22: I -> grab onion at (4,4)\n                Turn 23: R -> to (5,3) [facing right]\n                Turn 24: D -> to (5,2) [facing down]\n                Turn 25: D -> to (5,1) [facing down]\n                Turn 26: L -> to (4,1) [facing left]\n                Turn 27: D -> face down (no move) [facing the pot]\n                Turn 28: I -> put onion.\n\n        Alice's timeline:\n\n            Turn 14: U -> face up\n            Turn 15: I -> grab onion\n            Turn 16: D -> face down\n            Turn 17: I -> put onion on kitchen counter at (2,2)\n            Turn 18: U -> face up\n            Turn 19: I -> grab onion (from (2,4))\n            Turn 20: L -> to (1,3) [facing left]\n            Turn 21: D -> to (1,2) [facing down]\n            Turn 22: D -> to (1,1) [facing down]\n            Turn 23: R -> to (2,1) [facing right]\n            Turn 24: R -> to (3,1) [facing right]\n            Turn 25: R -> to (4,1) [facing right]\n            Turn 26: D -> face down (no move) [facing the pot? But she is at (4,1) and the pot is at (4,0) below, so she is facing down after this action]\n            Turn 27: I -> put onion\n\n        After turn 27, Alice is at (4,1) facing down, holding nothing.\n\n        After turn 28, Bob is at (4,1) facing down, holding nothing.\n\n        But note: players cannot occupy the same tile. At turn 27, Alice is at (4,1). Then at turn 28, Bob moves to (4,1)? That is not allowed.\n\n        We have a conflict at (4,1) at turn 28.\n\n        How to resolve? We must avoid that.\n\n        Alice is at (4,1) at turn 27. Bob is moving to (4,1) at turn 26? Bob's turn 26: he moves to (4,1). But at turn 26, Alice is at (4,1) from turn 25? Alice's turn 25: she moves to (4,1). Then at turn 26, she does D (change orientation to down). So she is still at (4,1). Then Bob at turn 26: he moves to (4,1) -> but Alice is there -> cannot walk. So the move fails? The rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through each other.\" So Bob's move to (4,1) at turn 26 would fail? Then he remains at (5,1) and facing left? But then he is not at (4,1) to interact.\n\n        This is a problem.\n\n        We need to coordinate the paths to avoid collision.\n\n    Given the complexity and the potential for collision, and the fact that we are only planning for Alice, we can focus on Alice and let Bob do his thing independently? But the problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But it says \"for Alice\", and optionally Bob, but the answer format is only for Alice? The answer format is:\n\n        Turn t_1: a_{t_1}   [for Alice]\n        Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}   [for Alice]\n\n    So we only need to output Alice's actions.\n\n    Therefore, we can plan for Alice and assume Bob will do something reasonable. But we need to coordinate to avoid collisions and to work together.\n\n    Alternatively, we can try a simpler plan: both players work on the same pot (4,0) and Alice goes to (4,0) from the beginning.\n\n    Revised plan for Alice:\n\n        Goal: get two onions and put them in the pot at (4,0) (which will have Bob's first onion).\n\n        Step 1: Alice grabs an onion from (2,4) at turns 14-15.\n\n        Then she goes to (4,0) to put it. But the path is long and blocked.\n\n    Another idea: Alice goes to the other onion dispenser at (4,4) to get an onion, which is closer to the pot at (4,0).\n\n    Alice is at (2,3). She can go to (4,4) to grab an onion.\n\n        Path: (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (4,3) -> then face up to interact with (4,4).\n\n        But (4,3) to (4,4): (4,4) is non-empty, so she can stand at (4,3) and face up.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Turn 14: R (move right to (3,3)) facing right.\n            Turn 15: R (move right to (4,3)) facing right.\n            Turn 16: U (change orientation to up, because above is non-empty) -> facing the dispenser.\n            Turn 17: I -> grab onion.\n\n        Then she is at (4,3) holding an onion. She can go to (4,1) to interact with the pot at (4,0):\n\n            From (4,3) to (4,1): but (4,2) is kitchen counter -> blocked. So she must go around:\n\n                (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (5,2) -> (5,1) -> (4,1).\n\n            Steps:\n\n                Turn 18: R (to (5,3)) facing right.\n                Turn 19: D (to (5,2)) facing down.\n                Turn 20: D (to (5,1)) facing down.\n                Turn 21: L (to (4,1)) facing left.\n                Turn 22: D (change orientation to down) -> facing the pot.\n                Turn 23: I -> put onion.\n\n        So at turn 23, she puts the onion in the pot. But Bob will have put his onion earlier at turn 16.\n\n        So the pot has two onions at turn 23. We need one more onion.\n\n        Then Alice or Bob can get the third onion.\n\n        Alice is free at (4,1) holding nothing. She can go to get another onion.\n\n        She can go to (4,4) again:\n\n            Turn 24: U (change orientation to up) -> she is at (4,1) facing down. To move, she needs to go up? But above is (4,2) non-empty -> cannot. So she must go around to (4,3) again.\n\n            Turn 24: U (facing down -> using U will change orientation to up? But then she doesn't move. Or to move up, she would use U, but the tile above is non-empty, so she only changes orientation to up.\n\n            Then she is facing up. Then she can move up? But the tile above is non-empty -> cannot. So she must leave (4,1) horizontally.\n\n            Turn 24: R (move right to (5,1)) facing right.\n            Turn 25: U (move up to (5,2)) facing up.\n            Turn 26: U (move up to (5,3)) facing up.\n            Turn 27: L (move left to (4,3)) facing left.\n            Turn 28: U (change orientation to up) -> facing the dispenser.\n            Turn 29: I -> grab onion.\n\n        Then she can go back to (4,1) to put it:\n\n            Turn 30: R (to (5,3)) facing right.\n            Turn 31: D (to (5,2)) facing down.\n            Turn 32: D ( to (5,1)) facing down.\n            Turn 33: L ( to (4,1)) facing left.\n            Turn 34: D (change orientation to down) -> facing the pot.\n            Turn 35: I -> put onion.\n\n        So at turn 35, the pot gets the third onion. Then it cooks for 5 turns, ready at turn 40.\n\n        Meanwhile, Bob is free after turn 16. He can help to get the third onion. For example, after putting his onion at turn 16, he can go to get another onion.\n\n        Bob's timeline (after turn 16):\n\n            Turn 17: R (move right to (5,1)) facing right.\n            Turn 18: U ( to (5,2)) facing up.\n            Turn 19: U ( to (5,3)) facing up.\n            Turn 20: L ( to (4,3)) facing left.\n            Turn 21: U (change orientation to up) -> facing dispenser.\n            Turn 22: I -> grab onion.\n            Then he can put it in the pot:\n\n                Turn 23: R ( to (5,3)) facing right.\n                Turn 24: D ( to (5,2)) facing down.\n                Turn 25: D ( to (5,1)) facing down.\n                Turn 26: L ( to (4,1)) facing left.\n                Turn 27: D (change orientation to down) -> facing the pot.\n                Turn 28: I -> put onion.\n\n        So at turn 28, the pot has three onions (Bob's second onion).\n\n        This is earlier than if Alice does it.\n\n        Therefore, with this plan:\n\n            Alice: \n                Turn 14: R\n                Turn 15: R\n                Turn 16: U\n                Turn 17: I\n                Turn 18: R\n                Turn 19: D\n                Turn 20: D\n                Turn 21: L\n                Turn 22: D\n                Turn 23: I   [puts the second onion]\n\n            Then Alice is at (4,1) holding nothing. The pot has two onions.\n\n            Bob will put the third onion at turn 28.\n\n        Then the soup cooks from turn 28 to turn 33 (28+5=33).\n\n        Then we need to serve it.\n\n        Serving requires a plate with the soup. Steps:\n\n            - Someone gets a plate from (0,2).\n            - Someone uses the plate to serve the soup from the pot at (4,0) -> must be adjacent and facing the pot, holding the plate with the soup? Actually, to serve the soup, you must be holding a clean plate and interact with the pot that has cooked soup. The interaction will put the soup in the plate? Then you must take it to the serving counter.\n\n        But the recipe: when you interact with the pot with a clean plate, you get the soup in the plate. Then you take it to the serving counter and interact.\n\n        The serving counter is at (6,2).\n\n        Alice is at (4,1) after turn 23. She can go to get a plate.\n\n        Path to (0,2): \n            (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) is kitchen counter -> non-empty. So cannot walk. But (0,1) is non-empty, so she must go to (0,2) from (0,1) is not possible. How about:\n\n            (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (0,2) but (0,2) is the plate dispenser -> non-empty. She can only be adjacent. The adjacent empty tiles to (0,2) are:\n\n                (0,1): kitchen counter -> non-empty.\n                (0,3): kitchen counter -> non-empty.\n                (1,2): empty? Yes.\n\n            So she can go to (1,2) and then face left to interact with (0,2).\n\n        Path:\n\n            Turn 24: L ( from (4,1) to (3,1) ) facing left.\n            Turn 25: L ( to (2,1) ) facing left.\n            Turn 26: L ( to (1,1) ) facing left.\n            Turn 27: U ( to (1,2) ) facing up.\n            Turn 28: L (change orientation to left, because west is (0,2) non-empty) -> so this action changes orientation to left without moving.\n            Turn 29: I -> grab a plate.\n\n        Then she is holding a plate. Now she must go to the pot at (4,0) to get the soup. But the soup won't be ready until turn 33.\n\n        She can wait or move to the pot area.\n\n        Alternatively, after getting the plate, she can go to (4,1) and wait.\n\n        Path from (1,2) to (4,1):\n\n            (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1)\n\n            Turn 30: D ( to (1,1) ) facing down.\n            Turn 31: R ( to (2,1) ) facing right.\n            Turn 32: R ( to (3,1) ) facing right.\n            Turn 33: R ( to (4,1) ) facing right.\n            Turn 34: D (change orientation to down) -> facing the pot.\n\n        Then at turn 33, the soup is ready. At turn 34, she is facing the pot. Then:\n\n            Turn 35: I -> interact: since she is holding a clean plate and the pot has cooked soup, she will get the soup in the plate.\n\n        Then she is holding a plate with soup. She must deliver it to the serving counter at (6,2).\n\n        Path from (4,1) to (6,2):\n\n            (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (6,1) is kitchen counter -> non-empty. So she must go:\n\n            (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (5,2) -> (6,2) but (6,2) is serving counter -> non-empty. So she can only go to (5,2) and then face right to interact with (6,2) or to (6,1) and then face up? Let's see:\n\n            The serving counter at (6,2) is adjacent to (5,2) (left), (6,1) (below), and (6,3) (above). (6,1) and (6,3) are kitchen counters -> non-empty. (5,2) is empty.\n\n            So she can go to (5,2) and face east to interact.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                Turn 36: R ( to (5,1) -> no, she is at (4,1) after turn 33. At turn 34 she changes orientation, still at (4,1). Then turn 35: interact -> at (4,1) holding soup.\n\n                Turn 36: R ( move right to (5,1) ) facing right.\n                Turn 37: U ( move up to (5,2) ) facing up.\n                Turn 38: R ( change orientation to right, because east is (6,2) non-empty -> only changes orientation) -> now facing east.\n                Turn 39: I -> deliver the soup.\n\n        So at turn 39, they get the reward.\n\n    This seems feasible.\n\n    Summary for Alice:\n\n        Turn 14: R (move to (3,3))\n        Turn 15: R (move to (4,3))\n        Turn 16: U (change orientation to up)\n        Turn 17: I (grab onion)\n        Turn 18: R (move to (5,3))\n        Turn 19: D (move to (5,2))\n        Turn 20: D (move to (5,1))\n        Turn 21: L (move to (4,1))\n        Turn 22: D (change orientation to down)\n        Turn 23: I (put onion in pot)\n        Turn 24: L (move to (3,1))\n        Turn 25: L (move to (2,1))\n        Turn 26: L (move to (1,1))\n        Turn 27: U (move to (1,2))\n        Turn 28: L (change orientation to left)\n        Turn 29: I (grab plate)\n        Turn 30: D (move to (1,1))\n        Turn 31: R (move to (2,1))\n        Turn 32: R (move to (3,1))\n        Turn 33: R (move to (4,1))\n        Turn 34: D (change orientation to down)\n        Turn 35: I (pick up soup from pot)\n        Turn 36: R (move to (5,1))\n        Turn 37: U (move to (5,2))\n        Turn 38: R (change orientation to right)\n        Turn 39: I (deliver soup)\n\n    But note: at turn 23, Alice puts the onion, and the pot then has two onions (along with Bob's first onion). But Bob's first onion was put at turn 16. Then at turn 28, Bob puts the third onion. So the pot has three onions at turn 28. It cooks from turn 28 to turn 33 (28,29,30,31,32 -> ready at turn 33). So when Alice interacts at turn 35 (which is after turn 33), the soup is ready.\n\n    However, at turn 33, Alice moves to (4,1). The soup becomes ready at the start of turn 33? Or at the end of turn 32? The cooking time is 5 turns. If the third onion is put at turn 28, then the cooking completes at turn 33 (28+5=33). So at turn 33, the soup is ready. Alice interacts at turn 35, which is after, so it's fine.\n\n    This plan has Alice busy for 26 turns (from turn 14 to turn 39). But we are only required to plan for several turns. We can plan for a horizon H, but the problem doesn't specify H. We can output until she delivers the soup.\n\n    However, the problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... over next several turns (say, H turns)\". We can choose H=26? But that is long.\n\n    Alternatively, we can plan until she puts her onion in the pot (turn 23) and then assume she will do the rest, but the problem asks for a sequence.\n\n    Given the complexity, and since we are only planning for Alice, we can output a sequence until she has put the onion and then stop? But that might not be optimal.\n\n    But the task is to maximize the total reward, and this plan delivers one soup.\n\n    We must output a sequence for Alice. Let's output until turn 14 to turn 23 (10 turns) and then she can wait or something? But then the soup won't be delivered.\n\n    Alternatively, we can output the entire sequence until the delivery.\n\n    However, the problem says \"over next several turns\", so perhaps not too long. Let's output 10 turns: from turn 14 to turn 23.\n\n    But then the job is not done.\n\n    Given the instructions, and since the problem doesn't specify H, I will output a sequence that sets up for the soup delivery, and then we can assume we continue.\n\n    But to maximize the reward, we should complete the soup.\n\n    I think it's better to output the sequence until the delivery.\n\n    But it's 26 actions. Perhaps we can output in chunks.\n\n    Since the answer format is a sequence of actions for Alice, we will output from turn 14 to turn 39.\n\n    However, note that the game state may change (Bob's actions) and we haven't modeled Bob's actions beyond turn 28. But we assumed he puts the third onion at turn 28. And the planning is for Alice only.\n\n    Given the complexity, I will output the sequence for Alice as above.\n\n    But let's double-check the path for Alice to (4,3) at the beginning:\n\n        Alice starts at (2,3) facing left.\n        Turn 14: R -> moves right to (3,3), facing right.\n        Turn 15: R -> moves right to (4,3), facing right. (4,3) is empty? Yes.\n        Turn 16: U -> since the tile above (4,4) is non-empty, she changes orientation to up without moving. Now facing up.\n        Turn 17: I -> grabs onion from (4,4). Now holding onion.\n        Turn 18: R -> moves right to (5,3), facing right.\n        Turn 19: D -> moves down to (5,2), facing down.\n        Turn 20: D -> moves down to (5,1), facing down.\n        Turn 21: L -> moves left to (4,1), facing left.\n        Turn 22: D -> changes orientation to down (because below is non-empty pot) without moving. Now facing down.\n        Turn 23: I -> puts the onion in the pot at (4,0). Now holding nothing.\n\n        Then she goes for the plate.\n\n    This seems correct.\n\n    We'll output the actions for Alice from turn 14 to turn 39.\n\n    But note: turn 14 is the current turn, so we start with turn 14.\n\n    However, the current turn is turn 14, and we are to plan from turn 14 onward.\n\n    So the actions for Alice:\n\n        Turn 14: R\n        Turn 15: R\n        Turn 16: U\n        Turn 17: I\n        Turn 18: R\n        Turn 19: D\n        Turn 20: D\n        Turn 21: L\n        Turn 22: D\n        Turn 23: I\n        Turn 24: L\n        Turn 25: L\n        Turn 26: L\n        Turn 27: U\n        Turn 28: L\n        Turn 29: I\n        Turn 30: D\n        Turn 31: R\n        Turn 32: R\n        Turn 33: R\n        Turn 34: D\n        Turn 35: I\n        Turn 36: R\n        Turn 37: U\n        Turn 38: R\n        Turn 39: I\n\n    This is 26 actions.\n\n    But note: at turn 28, she is at (1,2) and does L (change orientation to left) to face the plate dispenser. Then turn 29: I to grab the plate.\n\n    And at turn 38, she is at (5,2) and does R to change orientation to right (facing the serving counter at (6,2)), then turn 39: I to deliver.\n\n    This should work.\n\n    However, there might be a simpler plan. Given that Bob already has an onion, and Alice is near an onion dispenser, they could use the closer pot at (2,0) if we can clear the path. But the kitchen counter at (2,2) blocks the direct path.\n\n    Therefore, the above plan is submitted.\n\n    Note: We assumed Bob's actions as described, but since we are only planning for Alice, and Bob's actions are not under our control, we must hope that Bob will do his part. Alternatively, we can plan without depending on Bob for the third onion, but that would take longer.\n\n    Given the time, we output this sequence.\n\n    Final answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 14: R\nTurn 15: R\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: I\nTurn 18: R\nTurn 19: D\nTurn 20: D\nTurn 21: L\nTurn 22: D\nTurn 23: I\nTurn 24: L\nTurn 25: L\nTurn 26: L\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: L\nTurn 29: I\nTurn 30: D\nTurn 31: R\nTurn 32: R\nTurn 33: R\nTurn 34: D\nTurn 35: I\nTurn 36: R\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: R\nTurn 39: I\n}\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward by delivering onion soup (3 onions, reward 20), Alice and Bob must coordinate to fill a pot with 3 onions, cook the soup, and deliver it. Given the current state (turn 14), Alice is at (2,3) holding nothing, and Bob is at (5,1) holding an onion. The optimal plan focuses on Alice's actions, leveraging Bob to contribute the first onion to the pot at (4,0) and later the third onion, while Alice handles the second onion and the entire serving process.\n\n### Alice's Action Plan (Turns 14 to 39):\n1. **Grab an onion from (4,4)** (closer to the target pot at (4,0)):\n   - Turn 14: Move right to (3,3), facing right.\n   - Turn 15: Move right to (4,3), facing right.\n   - Turn 16: Change orientation up (facing onion dispenser at (4,4)).\n   - Turn 17: Interact to grab an onion.\n\n2. **Deliver onion to pot at (4,0)**:\n   - Turn 18: Move right to (5,3), facing right.\n   - Turn 19: Move down to (5,2), facing down.\n   - Turn 20: Move down to (5,1), facing down.\n   - Turn 21: Move left to (4,1), facing left.\n   - Turn 22: Change orientation down (facing pot at (4,0)).\n   - Turn 23: Interact to place onion in pot (pot now has 2 onions, including Bob's).\n\n3. **Get a plate from (0,2)** for serving:\n   - Turn 24: Move left to (3,1), facing left.\n   - Turn 25: Move left to (2,1), facing left.\n   - Turn 26: Move left to (1,1), facing left.\n   - Turn 27: Move up to (1,2), facing up.\n   - Turn 28: Change orientation left (facing plate dispenser at (0,2)).\n   - Turn 29: Interact to grab a plate.\n\n4. **Return to pot at (4,0) to pick up cooked soup** (soup ready by turn 33 after Bob adds third onion at turn 28):\n   - Turn 30: Move down to (1,1), facing down.\n   - Turn 31: Move right to (2,1), facing right.\n   - Turn 32: Move right to (3,1), facing right.\n   - Turn 33: Move right to (4,1), facing right.\n   - Turn 34: Change orientation down (facing pot).\n   - Turn 35: Interact to pick up soup (now holding plated soup).\n\n5. **Deliver soup to serving counter at (6,2)**:\n   - Turn 36: Move right to (5,1), facing right.\n   - Turn 37: Move up to (5,2), facing up.\n   - Turn 38: Change orientation right (facing serving counter at (6,2)).\n   - Turn 39: Interact to deliver soup (reward 20 obtained).\n\n### Coordination with Bob:\n- Bob delivers his onion to pot (4,0) by turn 16 (actions: L to (4,1), D to face down, I to place).\n- Bob then gets a third onion from (4,4) (actions after turn 16: R to (5,1), U to (5,2), U to (5,3), L to (4,3), U to face up, I to grab, then path to (4,1) to place by turn 28).\n- Soup cooks for 5 turns (ready at turn 33) while Alice fetches the plate.\n\nThis plan avoids player collisions, utilizes efficient paths, and maximizes reward by completing one soup delivery by turn 39. Alice's actions are optimized based on her starting position and the game layout.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 14: R\nTurn 15: R\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: I\nTurn 18: R\nTurn 19: D\nTurn 20: D\nTurn 21: L\nTurn 22: D\nTurn 23: I\nTurn 24: L\nTurn 25: L\nTurn 26: L\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: L\nTurn 29: I\nTurn 30: D\nTurn 31: R\nTurn 32: R\nTurn 33: R\nTurn 34: D\nTurn 35: I\nTurn 36: R\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: R\nTurn 39: I\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 18. The goal is to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes.\n\nFirst, let's understand the current state:\n\n- Alice (me) is at (2,3), facing right (R), holding one onion.\n- Bob is at (4,3), facing left (L), holding nothing.\n\nTile types:\n- Kitchen Counters: (0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)\n- Onion Dispensers: (2,4) and (4,4)\n- Plate Dispenser: (0,2)\n- Pots: (2,0) and (4,0)\n- Serving Counter: (6,2)\n\nRecipe: Only one recipe is given: 3 onions, 0 tomatoes; reward 20; cooking time 5 turns.\n\nCurrent non-empty kitchen counter: (6,1) has an onion.\n\nPots are empty.\n\nWe need to plan for Alice (and optionally Bob) for the next several turns (H turns). Since the recipe requires 3 onions, we need to get onions into a pot. We have two pots: (2,0) and (4,0). Also, we have two onion dispensers: (2,4) and (4,4).\n\nAlice is holding an onion and is at (2,3). She is facing right. The pot at (2,0) is below her. Let's see the grid:\n\nWe can consider the layout:\n\nRow y=4: ... (1,4) [KC], (2,4) [Onion Disp], (3,4) [KC], (4,4) [Onion Disp], (5,4) [KC], (6,4) [KC]\nRow y=3: (0,3) [KC], ... Alice at (2,3) [empty?], ... Bob at (4,3) [empty?], ... (6,3) [KC]\nRow y=2: (0,2) [Plate Disp], (2,2) [KC], (3,2) [KC], (4,2) [KC], (6,2) [Serving]\nRow y=1: (0,1) [KC], (6,1) [KC with onion]\nRow y=0: (0,0) [KC], (1,0) [KC], (2,0) [Pot], (3,0) [KC], (4,0) [Pot], (5,0) [KC], (6,0) [KC]\n\nAlice is at (2,3). To get to the pot at (2,0), she needs to go down three times: to (2,2), then (2,1), then (2,0). However, (2,2) is a kitchen counter, which is non-empty? Actually, kitchen counters are walkable? The rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" But note that kitchen counters are non-empty only if they have an item? The tile (2,2) is a kitchen counter, but currently it is empty? The non-empty kitchen counter is only at (6,1) (with an onion). So other kitchen counters are empty and hence walkable? Actually, the tile types are fixed, but the non-empty state is separate. The rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So if a kitchen counter is empty, it is walkable? But typically in Overcooked, counters are walkable. Let me check the rules.\n\nThe rules say: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and then other tiles (Dispensers, Pot, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter) are non-empty? But note: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and it is listed as a tile type. The rule for movement: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\" and constraint: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and \"Players cannot walk onto/through each other.\"\n\nSo what is a non-empty tile? It means a tile that has an item on it? Or the tile type itself is non-walkable? The rules are ambiguous. But note: the tile types are fixed. The rule says: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\nSo the player must stand on an empty tile (which is walkable) and adjacent to the non-empty tile (which is the object they want to interact with). Therefore, the non-empty tile (like dispenser, pot, serving counter, kitchen counter that has an item) is not walkable? But the rule says \"adjacent\", meaning the player cannot stand on it.\n\nTherefore, the grid has:\n- Empty tiles: walkable and without any object? But dispensers, pots, counters are fixed on the map. So actually, the \"non-empty tile\" in the interact rule refers to an object (dispenser, pot, serving counter, or kitchen counter that has an item). And these are not walkable? Or are they?\n\nLooking at the constraint: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So non-empty tiles (which are the ones that are not just empty space) are not walkable? But then how do players get to interact? They must be adjacent. So the player must be on an empty tile adjacent to the non-empty tile.\n\nTherefore, the tiles that are not empty (i.e., have an object: dispenser, pot, serving counter, kitchen counter) are not walkable. So the player cannot step on (2,0) because it's a pot? But wait, the pot is at (2,0). Then how do we interact? We must be adjacent. So Alice cannot go to (2,0) because it's a pot? But then she must be at (2,1) or (1,0) or (3,0) to interact? Similarly, (2,1) is an empty tile? Let me see: (2,1) is not listed in any non-empty tile? The non-empty kitchen counter is only at (6,1). So (2,1) is an empty tile? Because it's not in the list of kitchen counters? Actually, the list of kitchen counters is given, but they are fixed. However, the rule says the tile is non-empty (so not walkable) only if it has an item? Or the tile type itself makes it non-walkable?\n\nThis is critical. Let me re-read:\n\n\"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and \"non-empty tiles\" are defined by the tile types? Or by the state (if they contain an item)?\n\nThe tile types are: Empty Tile, Dispensers, Pot, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter. The rules say \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" Then for the others, they are non-empty? So they are not walkable? Then how do we interact? By standing adjacent and facing them.\n\nTherefore, the only walkable tiles are the empty tiles. The rest (dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters) are non-walkable.\n\nBut note: the kitchen counter is a tile that can be empty (no item) or have an item. But the tile itself is non-walkable? The rule says: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and it is listed as a tile type. And the movement constraint says non-empty tiles (which I think refers to non-empty tile types, not the state) are not walkable.\n\nSo, to clarify, the grid has:\n- Empty tiles: walkable.\n- Non-empty tiles (dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters): not walkable.\n\nBut then, a kitchen counter without an item is still a non-empty tile? Or is it considered empty? The rules don't say. But the interact rule says \"non-empty tile\", which in context might mean a tile that has an object (like dispenser, pot, etc.) regardless of whether it has an item or not.\n\nSo, I think we must assume that the fixed objects (dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters) are non-walkable. Therefore, players can only stand on empty tiles.\n\nNow, let's see the grid around Alice (2,3). What are the adjacent tiles?\n- Left: (1,3) -> is it a kitchen counter? The list includes (0,3) and (6,3) but not (1,3). So (1,3) is an empty tile? Similarly, right: (3,3) -> not in the kitchen counter list? The kitchen counters are at (0,3) and (6,3) in row y=3. So (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) are empty? (But Bob is at (4,3), so that's occupied by Bob? But Bob is a player, so we cannot walk on him.)\n\nSo (2,3) is empty? Yes, because it's not listed as a non-empty tile. Similarly, (3,3) is empty. (4,3) has Bob. (1,3) is empty? (0,3) is kitchen counter (non-walkable) and (6,3) is kitchen counter. So (1,3) is empty? Similarly, (5,3) is empty? But we don't have information about (1,3) and (5,3) in the kitchen counter list? The kitchen counter list: (0,0), (1,0), ... (0,3), (6,3) ... So (1,3) is not listed -> so it's an empty tile.\n\nTherefore, the grid:\n\nAt row y=3: \n- (0,3): kitchen counter (non-walkable)\n- (1,3): empty (walkable)\n- (2,3): empty (Alice is here)\n- (3,3): empty\n- (4,3): empty (Bob is here? But Bob is a player, so the tile is occupied by Bob and not walkable by Alice)\n- (5,3): empty\n- (6,3): kitchen counter (non-walkable)\n\nSimilarly, row y=2:\n- (0,2): plate dispenser (non-walkable)\n- (1,2): ? not listed -> empty?\n- (2,2): kitchen counter (non-walkable) -> so cannot walk on (2,2)\n- (3,2): kitchen counter (non-walkable)\n- (4,2): kitchen counter (non-walkable)\n- (5,2): ? not listed -> empty?\n- (6,2): serving counter (non-walkable)\n\nRow y=1:\n- (0,1): kitchen counter\n- (1,1): ? not listed -> empty?\n- (2,1): ? not listed -> empty?\n- (3,1): ? not listed -> empty?\n- (4,1): ? not listed -> empty?\n- (5,1): ? not listed -> empty?\n- (6,1): kitchen counter (and it has an onion, so non-walkable? Actually, the tile type is kitchen counter and it's non-walkable regardless of the item)\n\nRow y=0:\n- (0,0): kitchen counter\n- (1,0): kitchen counter\n- (2,0): pot (non-walkable)\n- (3,0): kitchen counter\n- (4,0): pot (non-walkable)\n- (5,0): kitchen counter\n- (6,0): kitchen counter\n\nSo for Alice at (2,3) to get to the pot at (2,0), she cannot go straight down because (2,2) is a kitchen counter (non-walkable). So she must go around.\n\nPossible path: \nFrom (2,3) she can go left to (1,3) (empty), then down to (1,2) (empty? we think), then down to (1,1) (empty), then right to (2,1) (empty). Then she is at (2,1), which is adjacent to the pot at (2,0). She is facing? She would need to face down to interact with the pot.\n\nAlternatively, she can go right to (3,3) (empty), then down to (3,2) but (3,2) is kitchen counter (non-walkable) -> blocked. Then she must go to (3,3) then right? But (4,3) has Bob. So she cannot go to (4,3). So the left path is better.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (4,3). He is facing left. He is holding nothing.\n\nWe need to get three onions into a pot. There are two pots: (2,0) and (4,0). We can choose one.\n\nAlice is already holding an onion. She can put it into the pot at (2,0) by going to (2,1) and facing down to interact. But we need two more onions.\n\nBob can get onions from the onion dispensers. The onion dispensers are at (2,4) and (4,4).\n\nBob is at (4,3). He can go up to (4,4) (onion dispenser) but (4,4) is non-walkable. So he must stand adjacent. He can go to (3,4) (kitchen counter? (3,4) is in the list -> non-walkable) or (5,4) (kitchen counter? (5,4) is in the list -> non-walkable) or (4,3) itself? He is already at (4,3). To interact with (4,4), he must be at (4,3) and facing up? Because (4,4) is directly above (4,3). But (4,3) is empty? Yes, and he is on it. So he can face up and interact to get an onion? But he is holding nothing -> so yes, he can grab an onion from the dispenser.\n\nSimilarly, for the dispenser at (2,4), Alice could do it, but she is already holding an onion.\n\nSo plan:\n\n1. Alice moves to (1,3) then (1,2) then (1,1) then (2,1). Then faces down and interacts to put her onion into the pot at (2,0).\n\n2. Bob, from (4,3), can face up and interact (I) to grab an onion from (4,4). Then he needs to bring it to the pot at (2,0) or (4,0). Since the pot at (4,0) is closer? But we want to use the same pot? We can use either.\n\nBut note: the pot at (2,0) is the one Alice is going to. So let's use (2,0) for both.\n\nBob at (4,3) holding an onion: he needs to go to (2,0) area. But he cannot go straight left because (3,3) is empty but (2,3) is occupied by Alice? At turn 18, Alice is at (2,3). But Alice will move away.\n\nWe must coordinate.\n\nAlso, we need three onions. So after Bob gets one, we need one more. Either Alice or Bob can get the third one.\n\nBut Alice will be at (2,1) after delivering the first onion. Then she can go to get another onion? But she will be empty-handed after putting the onion in the pot.\n\nAfter Alice puts the onion in the pot, she is empty. Then she can go to an onion dispenser to get another one.\n\nThe closest onion dispenser to (2,1) is (2,4). So she can go from (2,1) to (2,2)? But (2,2) is non-walkable (kitchen counter). So she must go around: (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)? But (2,4) is non-walkable. So to interact with (2,4), she must be at (2,3) and facing up? Because (2,4) is above (2,3). But (2,3) is an empty tile? Yes.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,1) she can go to (3,1) (if empty) then (3,2) is non-walkable, so then (3,3) -> (4,3) but Bob might be there? Complicated.\n\nBetter: after Alice puts the onion in the pot at (2,0) from (2,1), she can go to (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3). Then at (2,3) she can face up (U) to interact with (2,4) to get an onion. Then she needs to put it in the pot again: so back to (2,1) and face down to interact.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can get an onion from (4,4) and then go to (4,3) -> (3,3) -> (2,3) but (2,3) might be occupied by Alice? And then to (2,2) is blocked, so he must go to (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1). Then at (2,1) face down to interact with the pot.\n\nBut note: the pot at (2,0) can hold up to 3 ingredients. After Alice puts the first onion, it has 1. Then Bob or Alice can put the next ones.\n\nWe need to avoid collisions and coordinate.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can use the other pot at (4,0). But then we would have two pots with one onion each? Not efficient because we need three in one pot to start cooking.\n\nSo let's stick to one pot: (2,0).\n\nStep-by-step for the next few turns:\n\nTurn 18 (current turn we are planning for the next action, so we start from turn 18).\n\nWe are at turn 18. We need to output actions for Alice (and optionally Bob, but the task says \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\"). The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=1}^{H-1} for Alice\". So only for Alice? But it says \"and optionally Bob\", meaning we can plan for both? The answer format only shows one action per turn? But it says \"each action a_t\", but it doesn't specify for which player? The problem says: \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But the answer format only has one line per turn. So I think we are only to output Alice's actions? But then how to coordinate with Bob? The problem says: \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\", so we must consider Bob's actions but we only output Alice's? Or do we output both? The answer format is:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\n...\n\nAnd it says \"each action a_t ∈ {U, D, L, R, I, S}\" for Alice? It doesn't mention Bob. So I think we are only to output Alice's actions. But we must consider Bob's actions in the plan to avoid conflicts and to coordinate.\n\nSo we will plan Alice's actions, and assume Bob will act reasonably? Or we can control Bob? The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But the answer format doesn't have Bob. So I think we are only required to output Alice's actions. But we can assume Bob is also trying to help? Or we have to design Alice's actions with the expectation of Bob's behavior.\n\nGiven the action history for Bob: R, I, U, U, L (most recent last). But it's not clear what Bob is doing.\n\nTo maximize the reward, we need to get three onions into the pot at (2,0) as quickly as possible, then cook for 5 turns, then serve.\n\nAfter the pot has three onions, it will start cooking automatically. Then after 5 turns, it is cooked. Then someone needs to get a plate, put it in the pot (by interacting with the pot while holding a plate) to get the soup, then take it to the serving counter at (6,2).\n\nWe have a plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nSo overall plan:\n\nPhase 1: Put three onions in the pot at (2,0).\n  - Alice (at (2,3) holding onion) moves to (2,1) via (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) and puts the onion in the pot.\n  - Then Alice goes to (2,3) to get another onion from (2,4).\n  - Bob (at (4,3) holding nothing) gets an onion from (4,4) (by facing up and interacting) and then moves to the pot at (2,0) via (3,3), (2,3) [if free], then to (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1) and puts the onion. But if Alice is using (2,3) at the same time, there might be conflict.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can get an onion and put it in the pot at (2,0) but we must avoid blocking.\n\nWe can assign Bob to get the third onion? But Bob is at (4,3). After Bob gets an onion from (4,4), he can go to (4,0) and put it? But then we have two pots with one onion each. Not good.\n\nSo we must use the same pot.\n\nLet's break down the turns:\n\nTurn 18 (t1=18):\n\nAlice: at (2,3), holding onion, facing R.\nShe needs to go to (1,3) first. So move left (L). Then she will be at (1,3), facing left? The move action changes position and orientation. So if she moves left, she goes to (1,3) and faces left.\n\nBob: at (4,3), holding nothing, facing L. He can interact with the onion dispenser at (4,4) by facing up? But he is facing left. So first he must change orientation to up (U) or move up? But (4,4) is above, so if he moves up, he cannot because (4,4) is non-walkable. So he must change orientation to up (without moving) and then interact.\n\nBut the action: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" Actually, change orientation doesn't require an empty adjacent tile? It just changes orientation without moving. Then he can interact.\n\nSo for Bob, ideally at turn 18: change orientation to up (U) so that he is facing the dispenser.\n\nBut we are only controlling Alice? So we don't specify Bob's actions. We only plan Alice's.\n\nSo for Alice, at turn 18: move left (L) to (1,3), facing left.\n\nThen turn 19: Alice is at (1,3), facing left. Now she needs to go down to (1,2). So she should change orientation to down? Or move down? To move down, she must change orientation to down? The move action moves in the direction she is facing? Or she can move in any direction?\n\nThe move action: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" So when we output an action of L, R, U, D, it moves in that direction and sets the orientation to that direction.\n\nSo Alice can move down (D) from (1,3) to (1,2)? But is (1,2) walkable? We think it is empty (not listed as non-empty). So yes. Then she moves down to (1,2) and faces down.\n\nBut (1,2) is adjacent to the plate dispenser at (0,2) to the left? But we don't care.\n\nTurn 19: Alice moves down (D) to (1,2), facing down.\n\nTurn 20: Alice is at (1,2), facing down. Now she can move down to (1,1) (if empty). So move down (D) to (1,1), facing down.\n\nTurn 21: Alice at (1,1), facing down. Now she needs to go to (2,1). So she must change orientation to right? Because to move right, she must face right? Then move right.\n\nSo turn 21: change orientation to right (R). This doesn't move her, just changes orientation to right.\n\nTurn 22: now she is at (1,1), facing right. Then move right (R) to (2,1), facing right.\n\nBut note: (2,1) is adjacent to the pot at (2,0) to the south? So she needs to face down to interact with the pot.\n\nTurn 23: change orientation to down (D). Now she is facing down.\n\nTurn 24: interact (I) to put the onion into the pot. Now the pot has one onion. Alice is now holding nothing.\n\nNow, she needs to get another onion. The closest onion dispenser is (2,4). So from (2,1), she can go to (2,2)? But (2,2) is non-walkable. So she must go via (1,1) and (1,2) to (1,3) and then to (2,3).\n\nFrom (2,1):\nTurn 25: change orientation to up? Or left? To go to (1,1), she can move left (L) because she is facing right? After turn 24, she is at (2,1) facing down? After interacting, her orientation remains down.\n\nTo move to (1,1), she must face left? Because (1,1) is to the left.\n\nTurn 25: change orientation to left (L). Now facing left.\n\nTurn 26: move left (L) to (1,1), facing left.\n\nThen from (1,1) to (1,2): she is facing left, so she must face up to move up? Or can she move up without changing orientation? The move action specifies the direction, so she can move up (U) regardless of current orientation? The move action: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" So if she moves up (U), she goes to (1,2) and faces up.\n\nTurn 27: move up (U) to (1,2), facing up.\n\nThen from (1,2) to (1,3): move up (U) to (1,3), facing up.\n\nTurn 28: move up (U) to (1,3)? But she is already at (1,2). Moving up (U) would go to (1,3). Yes.\n\nThen at (1,3), she needs to go to (2,3). So she must face right? Then move right.\n\nTurn 29: change orientation to right (R). Facing right.\n\nTurn 30: move right (R) to (2,3), facing right.\n\nNow at (2,3), she can interact with the onion dispenser at (2,4) by facing up.\n\nTurn 31: change orientation to up (U). Facing up.\n\nTurn 32: interact (I) to grab an onion.\n\nNow she is holding an onion. Then she needs to go back to the pot at (2,0) via the same path: (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) and then face down to interact.\n\nThis is taking too many turns. And we haven't considered Bob.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can be getting the other onions. But we are not controlling Bob.\n\nAlso, note that there is an onion on the kitchen counter at (6,1). That onion can be used. But (6,1) is a kitchen counter, so someone can pick it up if they are adjacent and facing it.\n\nBut (6,1) is at the bottom right. Alice is at (2,3) and Bob at (4,3). It's far.\n\nBob might be able to get it? But we don't control Bob.\n\nTo speed up, after Alice puts the first onion, she can get the onion from the kitchen counter at (6,1) instead of going to (2,4)? But (6,1) is far.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (6,1): \n(2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (6,1) but (6,1) is non-walkable? It's a kitchen counter, so she must be adjacent. She can go to (6,0) or (5,1) or (6,2)? But (6,0) is kitchen counter? (6,0) is in the list -> non-walkable. (6,2) is serving counter -> non-walkable. (5,1) is empty? Then she can be at (5,1) and face right to interact with (6,1). But (6,1) is at the right of (5,1)? (5,1) and (6,1) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nBut from (2,1) to (5,1): \n(2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1). Then at (5,1) face right to interact with (6,1) to pick up the onion.\n\nBut is (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) empty? We think so.\n\nBut then she has to come back to the pot at (2,0). That's even farther.\n\nSo it's better to get onions from the dispensers.\n\nBut let's see if Bob can help. Bob is at (4,3) at turn 18. He is facing left. We are not controlling him, but we can assume he will act rationally? Or we can infer from his action history.\n\nBob's action history: R, I, U, U, L (most recent last). So at turn 17 (last action) he did L. Before that U, U, I, R.\n\nWhat could he have been doing? He started from some position. But we don't know.\n\nAt turn 18, he is at (4,3) facing left. He might be planning to go to the onion dispenser at (4,4) by facing up and interacting.\n\nSo let's assume Bob does:\n\nTurn 18: Bob changes orientation to up (U) to face the dispenser.\nTurn 19: Bob interacts (I) to grab an onion.\n\nThen he is holding an onion. Now, he needs to take it to the pot. He can go to the pot at (4,0) or (2,0). (4,0) is closer for him.\n\nTo go to (4,0): from (4,3) he can go down to (4,2)? But (4,2) is kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So he must go around. He can go to (3,3) then (3,2) is non-walkable, then (3,1) -> (4,1) -> then to (4,0)? But (4,0) is non-walkable. So he must be adjacent. He can go to (3,0) or (5,0) or (4,1). (4,1) is empty? Then from (4,1) he can face down to interact with the pot at (4,0).\n\nSo path for Bob:\n- Turn 18: change to up (U) [assumed]\n- Turn 19: interact (I) to grab onion.\n- Turn 20: move left (L) to (3,3), facing left.\n- Turn 21: move down (D) to (3,2)? But (3,2) is non-walkable -> cannot. So he must go down from (3,3) to (3,2) is blocked. So he must go to (3,3) then down is blocked, so he must go to (2,3) or (4,3) but (4,3) is where he came from? Or to (3,4) but (3,4) is kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So the only way is to go to (2,3) or (4,3)? But (2,3) might be occupied.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nBob can go to (5,3) then down to (5,2) (empty? (5,2) is not listed -> empty), then down to (5,1), then left to (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,3) to (5,3): move right (R) to (5,3), facing right.\nThen down to (5,2) (move down D), then down to (5,1) (D), then left to (4,1) (L).\n\nThen at (4,1) face down to interact with the pot at (4,0).\n\nSo that's 4 moves and then interact.\n\nBut if he chooses the pot at (2,0), it would be longer.\n\nGiven the complexity, and since we are only controlling Alice, we focus on Alice.\n\nAlice's plan to put the first onion and then get a second one.\n\nBut we need three. Bob might put one in the same pot.\n\nLet's assume Bob will put one onion in the pot at (2,0) as well.\n\nSo after Alice puts the first onion at turn 24, the pot has one onion.\n\nThen Bob might put one in at some point.\n\nThen Alice puts the second one, making it three.\n\nThen the pot starts cooking.\n\nThe cooking time is 5 turns. So at turn 24 + 5 = 29, the soup is cooked? But turn 24 is when Alice puts the first onion. But if Bob puts one at turn 25, then at turn 25 the pot has two. Then Alice puts the third at turn 32 (as per our earlier plan), then the soup starts cooking at turn 32, and will be ready at turn 37.\n\nThen we need to serve it.\n\nBut this is too many turns. We need to optimize.\n\nAlternative plan for Alice:\n\nAfter putting the first onion at (2,0), instead of going to (2,4) for another onion, she can go to the plate dispenser at (0,2) to get a plate, so that when the soup is ready, she can serve it.\n\nBut the soup is not ready yet, and we don't have three onions.\n\nThis is not efficient.\n\nAnother idea: Alice, after putting the first onion, can go to the kitchen counter at (6,1) to pick up the onion there and bring it to the pot.\n\nBut it's far.\n\n Let's calculate the distance.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (6,1): \n- (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (6,1) but cannot stand on (6,1), so stop at (5,1). Then interact with (6,1) to pick up the onion. That's 3 moves to (5,1), then interact. Then from (5,1) back to (2,1): (5,1) -> (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> then interact with pot. Total moves: 3+4=7 moves, plus orientations and interacts.\n\nCompared to going to (2,4): from (2,1) to (2,3): we had 5 moves (including orientation changes) to get to (2,3) and interact, then back to (2,1) would be another 5 moves? But we are already at (2,3) after getting the onion, then to (2,1) is 3 moves: (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) and then face down. That's 4 moves (including the move to (2,1) and then face down?).\n\nLet's count from after turn 24 (Alice at (2,1) holding nothing):\n\nOption 1: get onion from (2,4):\n- Turn 25: change orientation to up? (not needed immediately) to move to (1,1): we did change to left (L) [orientation] at turn 25.\n- Turn 26: move left to (1,1)\n- Turn 27: move up to (1,2)\n- Turn 28: move up to (1,3)\n- Turn 29: change orientation to right (R)\n- Turn 30: move right to (2,3)\n- Turn 31: change orientation to up (U)\n- Turn 32: interact (I) to grab onion. Now holding onion.\n- Then from (2,3) to (2,1): \n  Turn 33: change orientation to down (D)\n  Turn 34: move down? But (2,2) is blocked, so cannot. So must go via (1,3): \n  Turn 33: change orientation to left (L) [to face left]\n  Turn 34: move left to (1,3)\n  Turn 35: change orientation to down (D)\n  Turn 36: move down to (1,2)\n  Turn 37: move down to (1,1)\n  Turn 38: change orientation to right (R)\n  Turn 39: move right to (2,1)\n  Turn 40: change orientation to down (D)\n  Turn 41: interact (I) to put onion.\n\n This is 17 turns from turn 25 to 41 for the second onion. Too long.\n\nOption 2: get the onion from (6,1):\n- Turn 25: change orientation to right (R) [to face east]\n- Turn 26: move right to (3,1) [assuming (3,1) is empty]\n- Turn 27: move right to (4,1)\n- Turn 28: move right to (5,1)\n- Turn 29: change orientation to right (R) to face (6,1)\n- Turn 30: interact (I) to pick up the onion from the kitchen counter.\n- Now holding onion.\n- Then return: \n  Turn 31: change orientation to left (L) [face west]\n  Turn 32: move left to (4,1)\n  Turn 33: move left to (3,1)\n  Turn 34: move left to (2,1)\n- Then at (2,1) she is facing left, so she needs to face down to interact with the pot.\n  Turn 35: change orientation to down (D)\n  Turn 36: interact (I) to put onion.\n\nTotal turns for the second onion: 12 turns (turn 25 to 36). Better than 17.\n\nSo better to get the onion from (6,1) for the second onion.\n\nThen the pot will have two onions (one from Alice at turn 24, and one from Alice at turn 36). Then we need a third onion.\n\nBob might have put one in between. If not, then Alice or Bob must put the third.\n\nBut let's assume Bob will put the third one.\n\nSo at turn 36, the pot has two onions. If Bob puts one before turn 36, then at turn 36 when Alice puts hers, it would be the third, and the soup starts cooking.\n\nBut if not, then after turn 36, Alice can go to get a third onion.\n\nBut to be safe, after Alice puts the second onion, she can go to get a plate, so that when the soup is ready, she can serve.\n\nThe plate dispenser is at (0,2).\n\nFrom (2,1) to (0,2): \n- (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) [empty] -> then at (1,2), she can interact with the plate dispenser at (0,2) by facing west? Because (0,2) is to the left of (1,2).\n\nSo:\n- Turn 37: change orientation to left (L) [at (2,1)]\n- Turn 38: move left to (1,1)\n- Turn 39: move up to (1,2) [now at (1,2)]\n- Turn 40: change orientation to left (L) to face (0,2)\n- Turn 41: interact (I) to grab a plate.\n\nThen she needs to be at the pot when the soup is ready to serve it.\n\nThe soup will be ready 5 turns after the third onion is put in.\n\nBut when is the third onion put in? If Bob puts it at say turn 25 (for example), then the soup is ready at turn 30. But at turn 30, Alice is at (5,1) or somewhere.\n\nSo we need to synchronize.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that we only control Alice, let's focus on Alice's actions for the next 10-15 turns.\n\nAt turn 18, Alice is at (2,3) holding onion, facing right.\n\nObjective: put the onion in the pot at (2,0) as quickly as possible.\n\nSo for the next turns:\n\nTurn 18: move left (L) to (1,3), facing left.\nTurn 19: move down (D) to (1,2), facing down.\nTurn 20: move down (D) to (1,1), facing down.\nTurn 21: change orientation to right (R) to face east.\nTurn 22: move right (R) to (2,1), facing right.\nTurn 23: change orientation to down (D) to face down (towards the pot).\nTurn 24: interact (I) to put the onion in the pot. Now holding nothing.\n\nNow, then she should go to (6,1) to get the onion there for the second onion.\n\nTurn 25: change orientation to right (R) to face east (since she is at (2,1) and wants to go east).\nTurn 26: move right (R) to (3,1), facing right.\nTurn 27: move right (R) to (4,1), facing right.\nTurn 28: move right (R) to (5,1), facing right.\nTurn 29: change orientation to right (R) again? She is already facing right. So she can interact with (6,1) to the right? But (6,1) is at (6,1), which is east of (5,1). She is facing east, so she can interact.\n\nTurn 29: interact (I) to pick up the onion from the kitchen counter at (6,1). Now holding onion.\n\nThen she needs to go back to the pot at (2,0) to put this onion.\n\nTurn 30: change orientation to left (L) to face west.\nTurn 31: move left (L) to (4,1), facing left.\nTurn 32: move left (L) to (3,1), facing left.\nTurn 33: move left (L) to (2,1), facing left.\nTurn 34: change orientation to down (D) to face down.\nTurn 35: interact (I) to put the onion in the pot. Now the pot has two onions (assuming no one else has added).\n\nThen she can go to get a plate from (0,2) while waiting for the third onion and the cooking.\n\nTurn 36: change orientation to left (L) to face west.\nTurn 37: move left (L) to (1,1), facing left.\nTurn 38: move up (U) to (1,2), facing up.\nTurn 39: change orientation to left (L) to face west towards (0,2).\nTurn 40: interact (I) to grab a plate.\n\nNow she is at (1,2) holding a plate.\n\nThen when the soup is ready, she can go to (2,1) and face down to interact with the pot to get the soup, then take it to the serving counter at (6,2).\n\nBut the soup may not be ready yet. If the third onion is added by Bob at turn 25, then the soup is ready at turn 30, but at turn 30 Alice is at (5,1) holding an onion, so she can't serve. So we need to time it.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, we output Alice's actions for the next 10 turns or so.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify H. So let's output for the next 10 turns: from turn 18 to 27.\n\nSo:\nTurn 18: L\nTurn 19: D\nTurn 20: D\nTurn 21: R   [change orientation to right]\nTurn 22: R   [move right to (2,1)]\nTurn 23: D   [change orientation to down]\nTurn 24: I   [interact to put onion]\nTurn 25: R   [change orientation to right]\nTurn 26: R   [move to (3,1)]\nTurn 27: R   [move to (4,1)]\n\nThen we can continue to 28,29, etc.\n\nBut let's see if we can do better.\n\nAlternatively, after turn 24, instead of going east, she can go north to (1,2) and then to (0,2) to get a plate first, then later get the onion from (6,1) and put it, then serve. But that might be less efficient.\n\nGiven the time, we'll output the first 10 actions.\n\nBut 10 turns might not be enough to see the soup delivered.\n\nSince the task is to maximize reward, and we are only doing a partial plan, we do our best.\n\nAnother idea: Alice can try to get Bob to help more by being at positions that don't block him.\n\nBut without controlling Bob, it's hard.\n\nWe'll output Alice's actions for turns 18 to 27.\n\nActions:\nTurn 18: L (move left to (1,3))\nTurn 19: D (move down to (1,2))\nTurn 20: D (move down to (1,1))\nTurn 21: R (change orientation to right)\nTurn 22: R (move right to (2,1))\nTurn 23: D (change orientation to down)\nTurn 24: I (interact to put onion in pot)\nTurn 25: R (change orientation to right)\nTurn 26: R (move right to (3,1))\nTurn 27: R (move right to (4,1))\n\nFor turn 28: move right to (5,1) (R)\nTurn 29: interact to grab the onion from (6,1) (I)\n\nBut we are only asked to plan for several turns. 10 turns might be reasonable.\n\nSo up to turn 27.\n\nBut let's write for turns 18 to 27.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 18: L\nTurn 19: D\nTurn 20: D\nTurn 21: R\nTurn 22: R\nTurn 23: D\nTurn 24: I\nTurn 25: R\nTurn 26: R\nTurn 27: R\n}\n\nThis gets Alice to (4,1) by turn 27, ready to go to (5,1) and interact with the kitchen counter at (6,1).\n\nThis is a partial plan. In the next turns, she would move to (5,1) and interact to get the onion, then return to the pot.\n\nHopefully, Bob will have put one onion in the pot already, so that when Alice puts the second onion, it becomes three (if Bob put one) or at least two.\n\nIf not, then Alice or Bob will need to put a third.\n\nBut with this plan, Alice will have contributed two onions.\n\nThen later, she can get a plate and serve.\n\nThis seems reasonable.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice and Bob must coordinate to fill a pot with three onions (as per Recipe 1: 3 onions, reward 20, cooking time 5 turns), cook the soup, and deliver it to the serving counter. Given the current state (turn 18), Alice is holding an onion at (2, 3) facing right, and Bob is at (4, 3) facing left holding nothing. The closest pot is at (2, 0), and there is an available onion on the kitchen counter at (6, 1) for efficient use. Alice's immediate goals are:\n1. Deliver her onion to the pot at (2, 0) via a path avoiding non-walkable tiles (e.g., kitchen counters at (2, 2)).\n2. Retrieve the onion from (6, 1) to contribute to the pot.\n3. Assume Bob will independently gather one onion (e.g., from (4, 4)) and deliver it to the same pot, as this is the most efficient coordination.\n\nAlice's path to (2, 0):\n- From (2, 3), move left to (1, 3) (empty tile), then down to (1, 2) (empty), then down to (1, 1) (empty), then right to (2, 1) (empty). At (2, 1), face down to interact with the pot.\n\nAfter delivering the onion, Alice moves to (6, 1) to retrieve the available onion:\n- From (2, 1), face right, move right to (3, 1), (4, 1), and (5, 1) (all empty). At (5, 1), face right to interact with (6, 1).\n\nThe sequence for Alice over the next 10 turns (turns 18 to 27) is optimized for this plan. Bob is expected to gather an onion and deliver it to the pot concurrently, ensuring the pot reaches three onions quickly. After this sequence, Alice will be at (4, 1) holding nothing, ready to move to (5, 1) and interact with (6, 1) on turn 28.\n\n**Action Sequence for Alice (turns 18 to 27):**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 18: L  \\text{ (move left to (1, 3), facing left) }\nTurn 19: D  \\text{ (move down to (1, 2), facing down) }\nTurn 20: D  \\text{ (move down to (1, 1), facing down) }\nTurn 21: R  \\text{ (change orientation to right) }\nTurn 22: R  \\text{ (move right to (2, 1), facing right) }\nTurn 23: D  \\text{ (change orientation to down) }\nTurn 24: I  \\text{ (interact to put onion in pot at (2, 0)) }\nTurn 25: R  \\text{ (change orientation to right) }\nTurn 26: R  \\text{ (move right to (3, 1), facing right) }\nTurn 27: R  \\text{ (move right to (4, 1), facing right) }\n}\n\n**Next Steps (beyond turn 27):**\n- Turn 28: Move right to (5, 1) (action: `R`).\n- Turn 29: Interact with (6, 1) to pick up the onion (action: `I`).\n- Turn 30: Change orientation to left (action: `L`), then move left to (4, 1), (3, 1), and (2, 1) (actions: `L`, `L`, `L`).\n- Turn 34: Change orientation to down (action: `D`) and interact to put the onion in the pot (action: `I`).\n\nBy turn 35, the pot will have at least two onions (Alice's contributions), and Bob's expected delivery should complete the recipe. Cooking starts automatically when the third onion is added. Alice can then get a plate from (0, 2) and serve the soup at (6, 2) once cooked (after 5 turns). This plan maximizes efficiency by utilizing the available onion at (6, 1) and coordinating with Bob's expected actions.",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes. The only recipe given is Recipe 1: 3 onions, 0 tomatoes; reward 20; cooking time 5 turns. Since there are no tomato dispensers, we can only make onion soup. Also, the plate dispenser is at (0,2).\n\nCurrent turn is t_1 = 21. Alice is at (2,3) facing left, holding one onion. Bob is at (5,3) facing right, holding one onion. There's an onion on the kitchen counter at (6,1).\n\nPots are at (2,0) and (4,0), both empty.\n\nAction histories: Alice: L, R, R, U, L – so her last action was L, which might be moving left or changing orientation. Similarly for Bob: U, L, U, I, R – last action R.\n\nBut I need to plan actions for Alice starting from turn 21, for several turns, say H=10 or something? The task doesn't specify H, but I should plan for a sequence that can complete a soup delivery. Since cooking takes 5 turns, and we need to gather ingredients, I should aim to deliver one soup as soon as possible.\n\nLet me sketch the grid based on tile types:\n\n- Kitchen Counters: (0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)\n\n- Onion Dispensers: (2,4), (4,4)\n\n- Plate Dispenser: (0,2)\n\n- Pot: (2,0), (4,0)\n\n- Serving Counter: (6,2)\n\nAlice at (2,3), Bob at (5,3).\n\nAlice holding onion, Bob holding onion.\n\nOnion on kitchen counter at (6,1).\n\nBoth pots empty.\n\nTo make onion soup, we need 3 onions in a pot. Cooking takes 5 turns, then we need a plate to serve it, and deliver to serving counter at (6,2).\n\nSince Alice and Bob each have one onion, that's two onions already. We need one more onion. There's an onion at (6,1) on a kitchen counter, which can be picked up.\n\nAlso, plates are available at (0,2).\n\nPossible plan: put the onions into a pot. But we need to choose which pot to use.\n\nPots are at (2,0) and (4,0).\n\nAlice is at (2,3), which is above (2,2), but (2,2) is a kitchen counter, not directly above the pot at (2,0). Let's see the positions.\n\nGrid layout: I should think in terms of coordinates.\n\nAssume x from 0 to 6, y from 0 to 4? Tile types list y=0 to y=4.\n\nFor example, (2,0) is a pot, (2,2) is a kitchen counter, (2,3) is Alice.\n\nSimilarly, (4,0) is pot, (4,2) is kitchen counter, (4,4) is onion dispenser.\n\nServing counter at (6,2).\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nAlice at (2,3) facing left, holding onion.\n\nTo interact with the pot at (2,0), she needs to be adjacent and facing it.\n\nFrom (2,3), she can move down to (2,2), but (2,2) is a kitchen counter, which is not empty, so she cannot walk onto it. Tile types: kitchen counter is not walkable? The rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" And kitchen counter is non-empty tile? No, kitchen counter is a tile type that can be occupied or not, but the tile itself is a counter, so I think players cannot walk on it.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\"\n\n- Other tiles like dispensers, pot, serving counter, kitchen counter are not walkable. Players can only be on empty tiles and interact with adjacent tiles.\n\nYes: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" And non-empty tiles include dispensers, counters, pots, etc.\n\nAlso, for interaction: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\nSo, for Alice to interact with the pot at (2,0), she needs to be on an adjacent empty tile facing it.\n\nAdjacent tiles to (2,0): possible positions: (1,0), (3,0), (2,1), but (1,0) and (3,0) are kitchen counters? Tile list: (1,0) is kitchen counter, (3,0) is kitchen counter, (2,1) – what is (2,1)? Not listed in any, so it must be an empty tile? Tile types only list non-empty or special tiles. The list given is for non-empty tiles or specific types.\n\nLet's list all mentioned tiles:\n\n- Kitchen Counter: (0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)\n\n- Onion Dispenser: (2,4), (4,4)\n\n- Plate Dispenser: (0,2)\n\n- Pot: (2,0), (4,0)\n\n- Serving Counter: (6,2)\n\nAny tile not listed is probably an empty tile, walkable.\n\nFor example, (2,1) is not listed, so it should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1), (3,1), etc.\n\nNow, for pot at (2,0), adjacent positions:\n\n- North: (2,1) – not listed, so empty tile\n\n- South: not applicable, y=0 min? Assuming y from 0 to 4, so south of (2,0) might be out of bound, so no.\n\n- West: (1,0) – kitchen counter, not empty, cannot stand there\n\n- East: (3,0) – kitchen counter, not empty\n\nSo only possible access is from north, (2,1), which is empty.\n\nSimilarly for other pots.\n\nFor serving counter at (6,2), adjacent: (5,2), (6,1), (6,3), (7,2) but x=6 max? Probably x=0-6, y=0-4, so (5,2), (6,1), (6,3) are possible.\n\n(6,1) is kitchen counter, not empty, so cannot stand there.\n\n(6,3) is kitchen counter, not empty.\n\n(5,2) – what is it? Not listed, so empty tile? (5,2) is not in kitchen counter list? Kitchen counters include (5,0), (5,4), but not (5,2). (5,2) not listed, so empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, (7,2) out of bound.\n\nSo for serving counter (6,2), accessible from (5,2) or (6,1) or (6,3), but (6,1) and (6,3) are kitchen counters, not walkable, so only from (5,2), which is east, facing west to interact.\n\n(5,2) is west of (6,2), so from (5,2), facing east to interact with (6,2).\n\nSimilarly, for pot at (2,0), accessible from (2,1) facing south.\n\n(2,1) is north of (2,0), so facing south to interact.\n\nBack to planning.\n\nAlice at (2,3) holding onion, facing left.\n\nShe wants to put onion into a pot. Nearest pot is (2,0) or (4,0).\n\nTo reach (2,0), she needs to go to (2,1) and face south.\n\nFrom (2,3), she can move down to (2,2), but (2,2) is a kitchen counter, not walkable, so she cannot move there.\n\nPositions: Alice at (2,3). Below is (2,2), which is kitchen counter, cannot walk.\n\nLeft: (1,3) – what is (1,3)? Not listed, so empty? Kitchen counters include (1,4) and (1,0), but (1,3) not listed, so empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, right: (3,3) – not listed, empty.\n\nUp: (2,4) – but (2,4) is onion dispenser, not walkable.\n\nSo from (2,3), Alice can move left to (1,3), right to (3,3), or down? Down to (2,2) not possible, up not possible. So only left or right.\n\nFacing left currently.\n\nTo reach the area near pot (2,0), she needs to go to (2,1).\n\nHow to get to (2,1)?\n\nFrom (2,3), she can go right to (3,3), then down to (3,2)? (3,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\n(3,2) is listed as kitchen counter.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) kitchen counter.\n\nSo row y=2 has kitchen counters at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), and also (0,2) plate dispenser, (6,2) serving counter, but (0,2) and (6,2) are not kitchen counters, but still not walkable.\n\nFor y=2: (0,2) plate dispenser, (2,2) kitchen counter, (3,2) kitchen counter, (4,2) kitchen counter, (6,2) serving counter. So (1,2), (5,2) not listed, so empty.\n\n(1,2) not listed, empty; (5,2) not listed, empty.\n\nSimilarly, y=1: (0,1) kitchen counter, (6,1) kitchen counter, so (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) should be empty.\n\ny=3: (0,3) kitchen counter, (6,3) kitchen counter, so (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) should be empty? (2,3) is Alice, empty tile; (5,3) Bob, empty tile.\n\ny=4: (0,4) kitchen counter, (1,4) kitchen counter, (3,4) kitchen counter, (5,4) kitchen counter, (6,4) kitchen counter, and (2,4) onion dispenser, (4,4) onion dispenser. So only (3,4) is kitchen counter, but (4,4) is dispenser, etc. No empty on y=4 except possibly (3,4) but listed, not empty.\n\n(3,4) is kitchen counter, not walkable. So y=4 has no empty tiles; all occupied by counters or dispensers.\n\nSimilarly y=0: all kitchen counters or pots, no empty except between? (0,0) K, (1,0) K, (2,0) P, (3,0) K, (4,0) P, (5,0) K, (6,0) K. So no empty tiles on y=0.\n\nBack to Alice at (2,3). She can move to (1,3) or (3,3) or stay.\n\n(2,3) is empty, she is there.\n\nTo reach (2,1), which is empty, she needs to go through (2,2) but cannot, so must go around.\n\nPossible paths: from (2,3) move left to (1,3), then down to (1,2)? (1,2) is empty? Yes, not listed.\n\nThen from (1,2) to (1,1), which is empty.\n\nThen from (1,1) to (2,1), which is adjacent to pot (2,0).\n\n(2,1) to (2,0) is south, so from (2,1) face south to interact with pot.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,3) move right to (3,3), then down to (3,2) but (3,2) kitchen counter, cannot. So to (3,3) then? (3,3) to (4,3) or down? No down, (3,2) blocked. So from (3,3) move down not possible, so left to (2,3) or right to (4,3), or up to (3,4) but (3,4) kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nSo from (3,3), can go to (4,3) or back to (2,3).\n\nTo reach (2,1), better to go left via (1,3) and down.\n\nSimilarly for Bob at (5,3) holding onion.\n\nBob can go to pot at (4,0).\n\nPot at (4,0) accessible from (4,1), facing south.\n\n(4,1) is empty.\n\nBob at (5,3), can move down to (5,2)? (5,2) is empty, since not listed.\n\nThen from (5,2) to (5,1), empty.\n\nThen to (4,1)? (4,1) is adjacent to (5,1), but (4,1) to (4,0) pot.\n\nFrom (5,2) to (4,2) but (4,2) kitchen counter, cannot walk.\n\nSo Bob can go to (5,2), then to (5,1), then to (4,1) or (6,1) but (6,1) kitchen counter, so to (4,1).\n\nThen from (4,1) face south to interact with pot at (4,0).\n\nAlso, there is an onion on kitchen counter at (6,1), which can be picked up if someone is adjacent and facing it.\n\n(6,1) is kitchen counter, so to interact, need to be on adjacent empty tile facing it.\n\nAdjacent positions: north (6,2) but (6,2) serving counter, not empty; south (6,0) kitchen counter; west (5,1); east out of bound.\n\nSo only from (5,1), facing east to interact with (6,1).\n\nFrom (5,1), interact to pick up the onion if holding nothing, but currently both are holding onions.\n\nFirst, let's think about adding onions to a pot.\n\nWe have two onions: Alice has one, Bob has one. We need a third onion for soup.\n\nThird onion can be from the one on (6,1) kitchen counter, or from dispensers at (2,4) or (4,4).\n\nBut dispensers require someone to grab, and they might be holding something.\n\nAlso, the onion on counter is available now.\n\nBut to pick it up, someone needs to be empty-handed and at (5,1) facing east.\n\nCurrently both holding onions, so they need to put down their onions first or something.\n\nBut we need to put onions into pot for cooking.\n\nSince cooking takes 5 turns, we should start as soon as possible.\n\nAlso, we need a plate to serve the soup later.\n\nPlates at (0,2).\n\nNow, for efficiency, Alice and Bob can work on different tasks.\n\nFor example, one can handle adding onions to a pot, the other can get a plate or something.\n\nBut since both have onions, they should both add to the same pot to start cooking faster.\n\nWe have two pots, but we only need one soup for now.\n\nLet's choose a pot. Pot at (2,0) or (4,0). Both similar, but Alice is closer to (2,0), Bob to (4,0)? Alice at (2,3), Bob at (5,3).\n\nDistance to (2,0): Alice can go via (1,3)-(1,2)-(1,1)-(2,1), that's 3 moves to reach (2,1), then interact.\n\nSimilarly, Bob to (4,0): from (5,3) to (5,2) to (5,1) to (4,1), 3 moves to (4,1), then interact.\n\nBut they need to add three onions, but only two now. Third onion needed.\n\nThe onion on (6,1) can be used, but to pick it up, someone needs to be empty.\n\nAfter adding their onions, they will be empty, so can pick up the third one.\n\nLet's plan step by step.\n\nFirst, Alice can add her onion to pot at (2,0).\n\nTo do that, she needs to go to (2,1) and face south.\n\nFrom (2,3), she can move left to (1,3), then down to (1,2), then down to (1,1), then right to (2,1). That's three moves: L, D, D to (1,1)? From (2,3) move L to (1,3), then D to (1,2), then D to (1,1)? (1,1) is at y=1, x=1.\n\nThen from (1,1) move R to (2,1). Now at (2,1), facing? She needs to face south to interact with (2,0).\n\nCurrently, after moving, her orientation might need changing.\n\nEach move action changes position and orientation. Or she can change orientation separately.\n\nActions: Move L/R/U/D changes both position and orientation to that direction.\n\nOr Change Orientation L/R/U/D without moving, if adjacent tile not empty.\n\nOr Interact or Stay.\n\nSo to go from (2,3) to (2,1) via (1,3)-(1,2)-(1,1)-(2,1).\n\nStart: (2,3), facing L.\n\nAction 1: Move L to (1,3), now facing left.\n\n(1,3) is empty, so can move.\n\nAction 2: Move D to (1,2), now facing down. (1,2) empty.\n\nAction 3: Move D to (1,1), facing down.\n\nAction 4: Move R to (2,1), facing right. Now at (2,1), facing right.\n\nBut to interact with pot at (2,0) south, she needs to face south. Currently facing right (east), so she needs to change orientation to down.\n\nAction 5: Change orientation D (down), no move since south tile is (2,0) pot, not empty.\n\nThen Action 6: Interact to add onion to pot.\n\nBut pot is empty, adding one onion, so now pot has one onion.\n\nSimilarly, Bob can add to pot at (4,0).\n\nBob at (5,3), facing R (right).\n\nMove to (4,1) via: from (5,3) move D to (5,2), facing down; then D to (5,1), facing down; then L to (4,1)? From (5,1) move L to (4,1), facing left (west).\n\n(4,1) empty, yes.\n\nAt (4,1), facing west, but pot (4,0) is south, so need to face down.\n\nAction: change orientation D, then interact to add onion.\n\nBut if they add to different pots, each pot has one onion, not full, cooking not started.\n\nWe need three in one pot.\n\nSo better to coordinate to use one pot.\n\nSay, both add to pot at (4,0) for example, since Bob is closer.\n\nAlice at (2,3) is farther from (4,0) than from (2,0).\n\nSimilarly, Bob closer to (4,0).\n\nBut Alice can go to (4,0) but longer path.\n\nSince Alice is near (2,0), and Bob near (4,0), and we have an onion on counter at (6,1), which is near Bob.\n\nLet's have both add to the same pot, say (4,0), since Bob can quickly add, and Alice can come, but it might take time.\n\nAfter Bob adds, he can pick up the onion from counter.\n\nLet's think.\n\nOption: Alice adds her onion to pot at (2,0), then she is empty, can go to get the third onion or plate.\n\nBut the third onion is at (6,1) or from dispenser.\n\nSimilarly for Bob.\n\nBut the onion at (6,1) is available now, so we can use that.\n\nSo, let's have Bob add his onion to pot at (4,0), then he is empty, then he can go to (5,1) and pick up onion from (6,1).\n\nThen add that onion to pot.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice can add her onion to pot at (2,0) or also to (4,0).\n\nBut if Alice adds to (2,0), then pot has one onion, not cooking, and we need two more, but we only have one more from counter, so not enough, we need to get from dispenser.\n\nBetter to have both add to the same pot.\n\nLet's choose pot at (4,0) for example.\n\nAlice at (2,3) holding onion.\n\nShe needs to go to (4,1) to add to pot (4,0).\n\nPath: from (2,3) move R to (3,3), then R to (4,3), then D to (4,2)? (4,2) kitchen counter, cannot. So from (4,3) cannot down.\n\nFrom (4,3) move R to (5,3)? But (5,3) is occupied by Bob? Players cannot walk through each other, and positions must be empty.\n\nAt turn 21, Bob is at (5,3), so Alice cannot move to (5,3).\n\nFrom (4,3), she can move D? No, (4,2) blocked. So only left to (3,3) or right to (5,3) but occupied.\n\nSo she is stuck at (4,3) if she goes there, but she can go to (3,3) then to (3,2) blocked, or (3,3) to (3,4) blocked, or to (2,3).\n\nSo from (2,3), to reach (4,1), she needs to go down first to lower y.\n\nFor example, from (2,3) move L to (1,3), then D to (1,2), then D to (1,1), then R to (2,1), then R to (3,1)? (3,1) empty, then R to (4,1), but (4,1) is the position for pot access.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (1,3): move L\n\n(1,3) to (1,2): move D\n\n(1,2) to (1,1): move D\n\n(1,1) to (2,1): move R\n\n(2,1) to (3,1): move R\n\n(3,1) to (4,1): move R\n\nAt (4,1), facing right (east).\n\nThen need to face south to interact with pot (4,0).\n\nSo change orientation D, then interact.\n\nThat's 6 actions to add onion: moves L, D, D, R, R, R to (4,1), then change D, then I.\n\nBut she is at (4,1) after 6 moves.\n\nFrom (2,1) she could go to (3,1) directly, but still multiple moves.\n\nWhereas to pot at (2,0), only 4 actions as before.\n\nSo better for Alice to use pot at (2,0).\n\nSimilarly, Bob use pot at (4,0).\n\nBut then each pot has one onion, not cooking.\n\nWe need to add the third onion to one pot.\n\nSo, after Alice adds to (2,0), she is empty, can go to get the onion from (6,1) or from dispenser.\n\nBut (6,1) is kitchen counter with onion, so she can pick it up if she goes to (5,1) and faces east.\n\nSimilarly, Bob after adding to (4,0) is empty, can do that.\n\nBut (5,1) is near Bob.\n\nBob at (5,3), after adding to (4,0), he is at (4,1) or wherever, empty.\n\nThen he can move to (5,1) and face east to pick up onion from (6,1).\n\nThen he can add that onion to pot at (4,0) or (2,0).\n\nBut pot at (4,0) has one onion from Bob, so adding the third makes it cook.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nLet's outline a sequence.\n\nFirst, for Alice: add onion to pot at (2,0).\n\nActions for Alice:\n\nTurn 21: Move L to (1,3)  (from (2,3) to (1,3), facing left)\n\nTurn 22: Move D to (1,2)  (facing down)\n\nTurn 23: Move D to (1,1)  (facing down)\n\nTurn 24: Move R to (2,1)  (facing right)\n\nTurn 25: Change orientation D (to face down)\n\nTurn 26: Interact to add onion to pot at (2,0). Now pot has one onion, Alice empty.\n\nSimilarly, for Bob: add onion to pot at (4,0).\n\nBob at (5,3), facing right.\n\nTurn 21: Move D to (5,2)  (facing down)\n\nTurn 22: Move D to (5,1)  (facing down)\n\nTurn 23: Move L to (4,1)  (facing left? Move L to (4,1), since from (5,1) move L to (4,1), facing left)\n\nAt (4,1), facing left, but pot (4,0) south, so need face down.\n\nTurn 24: Change orientation D\n\nTurn 25: Interact to add onion to pot (4,0). Now pot has one onion, Bob empty.\n\nBut at turn 21, both are acting simultaneously? No, the game is turn-based, but players act per turn, so each turn, both Alice and Bob perform an action.\n\nThe task is to plan for Alice, and optionally for Bob, but since we need coordination, I should plan for both.\n\nThe task says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", so I can include Bob's actions.\n\nFor turn 21, Alice and Bob both act.\n\nAfter turn 25, both pots have one onion each.\n\nNow, we need to add the third onion to one pot.\n\nThe onion is at (6,1) on kitchen counter.\n\nBob is at (4,1) after adding, empty.\n\nHe can go to (5,1) to pick up the onion.\n\nFrom (4,1), turn 26: Move R to (5,1)  (facing right? Move R to (5,1), facing right)\n\nThen at (5,1), facing right, and (6,1) is east, so he can interact to pick up the onion.\n\nTurn 27: Interact to pick up onion from (6,1). Now Bob holding onion.\n\nThen he can add to pot, say to (4,0) which has one onion.\n\nFrom (5,1), he can move to (4,1) if not there, but at turn 27 he is at (5,1).\n\nAfter pick up, at (5,1) holding onion.\n\nMove to (4,1): turn 28: Move L to (4,1), facing left.\n\nThen turn 29: Change orientation D to face down (if not already, but after move, facing left, so need to face down).\n\nTurn 30: Interact to add onion to pot (4,0). Now pot has three onions, cooking starts.\n\nCooking time for onion soup is 5 turns, so after 5 turns, it will be cooked.\n\nBut at which turn did we add the third onion? At turn 30.\n\nSo cooking starts at turn 30, will be ready at turn 35.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice is at (2,1) after adding, empty.\n\nShe can do something else, like get a plate for later.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nAlice at (2,1), can go to (0,2).\n\nPath: from (2,1) to (1,1) to (1,2) to (0,2)? But (0,2) is plate dispenser, not walkable.\n\nTo interact with plate dispenser at (0,2), need adjacent empty tile facing it.\n\nAdjacent positions: north (0,3) but (0,3) kitchen counter, not empty; south (0,1) kitchen counter; east (1,2); west out of bound.\n\nSo only from (1,2), facing west to interact.\n\n(1,2) is empty tile.\n\nAlice at (2,1), can go to (1,1), then to (1,2).\n\nFrom (2,1), turn 26: since at turn 25 she added onion, at (2,1) empty.\n\nTurn 26: Move L to (1,1)  (facing left? Move L to (1,1), facing left)\n\nAt (1,1), facing left.\n\nThen turn 27: Move U to (1,2)  (facing up? Move U to (1,2), facing up)\n\nNow at (1,2), facing up, but need to face west to interact with (0,2).\n\n(0,2) is west of (1,2), so face west.\n\nTurn 28: Change orientation L (left)\n\nTurn 29: Interact to grab a plate. Now Alice holding a clean plate.\n\nThen she can wait or something for the soup to cook.\n\nBut soup cooking at (4,0), will be ready at turn 35.\n\nAlice can go towards the serving area.\n\nServing counter at (6,2), accessible from (5,2) facing east.\n\nAlice at (1,2) holding plate.\n\nShe can go to (5,2).\n\nPath: from (1,2) to (1,1) or to (1,3), but (1,3) is above.\n\n(1,2) to (2,2) but (2,2) kitchen counter, cannot.\n\nSo from (1,2) move D to (1,1), facing down.\n\nThen to (2,1), etc.\n\nTo go east.\n\nFrom (1,2) move U to (1,3)? (1,3) empty, yes.\n\nThen to (2,3), (3,3), etc.\n\nBut let's not rush, soup not ready yet.\n\nAfter turn 30, soup starts cooking, ready at turn 35.\n\nAt turn 35, someone needs to serve the soup with a plate.\n\nAlice has a plate, she can do it.\n\nBut she needs to be near the pot to serve.\n\nTo serve soup from pot, need to interact with pot while holding a clean plate.\n\nFrom the rules: for pot, \"Serve soup (if player is holding a clean plate and pot has cooked soup).\"\n\nSo at turn 35, when soup is cooked, someone with plate can serve it.\n\nThen take it to serving counter.\n\nNow, Alice has plate, but she is at (1,2) after turn 29.\n\nAt turn 30, Bob adds third onion, cooking starts.\n\nAlice can go towards pot (4,0) to serve later.\n\nBut pot at (4,0), accessible from (4,1).\n\nAlice at (1,2), let's get her to (4,1) by turn 35 or so.\n\nPath: from (1,2) at turn 29, after grabbing plate.\n\nTurn 30: Move U to (1,3)  (facing up)\n\nTurn 31: Move R to (2,3)  (facing right)\n\nTurn 32: Move R to (3,3)  (facing right)\n\nTurn 33: Move R to (4,3)  (facing right)\n\nNow at (4,3), cannot move down to (4,2) blocked.\n\nTo reach (4,1), she needs to go to (3,3) or something.\n\nFrom (4,3) move R to (5,3)? But Bob might be there or not.\n\nBob is at (4,1) after turn 30? At turn 30, Bob added onion at (4,1), then he is there, empty? After adding, he is at (4,1), not holding anything.\n\nBut positions: Alice moving to (5,3) might be occupied if Bob is there, but Bob can move.\n\nWe need to coordinate positions.\n\nAt turn 30, Bob is at (4,1) after adding onion.\n\nHe can stay or move.\n\nAlice at turn 33 is at (4,3), but (4,3) is empty, Bob not there.\n\nFrom (4,3), she cannot go down, so she needs to go to (5,3) or (3,3).\n\nThen to lower y.\n\nFor example, to (5,3), then down to (5,2), etc.\n\nBut to reach (4,1), she can go to (3,3) then to (3,2) blocked, or to (3,1) via (3,3) to (3,2) no.\n\nFrom (4,3) move to (5,3) if empty.\n\nTurn 34: Move R to (5,3)  (facing right)\n\nThen turn 35: Move D to (5,2)  (facing down)\n\nThen turn 36: Move D to (5,1)  (facing down)\n\nThen at (5,1), but to serve soup, she needs to be at (4,1) facing south to pot.\n\nSo from (5,1) move L to (4,1), turn 37: Move L to (4,1), facing left\n\nThen turn 38: Change orientation D to face down\n\nThen turn 39: Interact to serve soup, now she has soup on plate.\n\nThen deliver to serving counter at (6,2).\n\nFrom (4,1), she can go to (5,1), then to (5,2), face east to interact with (6,2).\n\nServing counter at (6,2), from (5,2) facing east.\n\nAt (4,1), move to (5,1): turn 40: Move R to (5,1), facing right\n\nThen turn 41: Move U to (5,2), facing up? Move U to (5,2), facing up\n\nAt (5,2), facing up, but need to face east to serve.\n\n(6,2) is east, so face right.\n\nTurn 42: Change orientation R\n\nTurn 43: Interact to deliver soup.\n\nBut this is many turns, and soup was ready at turn 35, but served at turn 39, delivered at turn 43.\n\nCooking started at turn 30, ready at turn 35, so from turn 35 to 39 is waiting, but she was moving.\n\nBut we can optimize.\n\nSince Bob is already near, after adding the third onion at turn 30, he is at (4,1) empty, he can get a plate and serve.\n\nBut plate dispenser at (0,2), far.\n\nAlice has the plate, so better for Alice to serve.\n\nBut Alice is far at first.\n\nAt turn 26, Alice is at (1,2) with plate, after turn 29.\n\nTurn 29: Alice at (1,2) with plate.\n\nInstead of going via (1,3), she can go directly to (4,1) but need path.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (1,1) to (2,1) to (3,1) to (4,1).\n\n(3,1) and (4,1) empty.\n\nSo shorter.\n\nTurn 30: Move D to (1,1)  (facing down)\n\nTurn 31: Move R to (2,1)  (facing right)\n\nTurn 32: Move R to (3,1)  (facing right)\n\nTurn 33: Move R to (4,1)  (facing right)\n\nNow at (4,1), facing right, but need to face down for pot.\n\nTurn 34: Change orientation D (down)\n\nNow soup is ready at turn 35, so at turn 35, she can interact to serve soup.\n\nBut cooking starts at turn 30, ready at turn 35, so at turn 35, it is ready.\n\nSo turn 35: Interact to serve soup, now holding soup on plate.\n\nThen deliver to (6,2).\n\nFrom (4,1), to (5,1): turn 36: Move R to (5,1), facing right\n\nThen to (5,2): turn 37: Move U to (5,2), facing up\n\nThen at (5,2), face east to serve: turn 38: Change orientation R (right)\n\nTurn 39: Interact to deliver to serving counter.\n\nReward obtained.\n\nTotal turns from start.\n\nBut we need to start from turn 21.\n\nAlso, Bob after turn 25 is at (4,1) empty.\n\nFrom turn 26 to 30, he was adding the onion, but at turn 25 he added, so turn 26 he can do something.\n\nAfter turn 25, Bob at (4,1) empty.\n\nHe can stay or help with delivery.\n\nBut Alice is getting plate and coming.\n\nIn this plan, at turn 30, Bob is at (4,1), but Alice comes to (4,1) at turn 33, so Bob should move away to avoid blocking.\n\nFor example, Bob can go to (5,1) or something.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nNow, let's list all actions turn by turn for both.\n\nFirst, define the sequence.\n\nTurn 21:\n\nAlice: Move L to (1,3)  // from (2,3)\n\nBob: Move D to (5,2)  // from (5,3)\n\nTurn 22:\n\nAlice: Move D to (1,2)\n\nBob: Move D to (5,1)\n\nTurn 23:\n\nAlice: Move D to (1,1)\n\nBob: Move L to (4,1)  // to access pot\n\nTurn 24:\n\nAlice: Move R to (2,1)  // now at (2,1)\n\nBob: Change orientation D (to face down for pot)\n\nAt turn 24, Alice moving to (2,1), Bob changing orientation.\n\nTurn 25:\n\nAlice: Change orientation D (to face down)\n\nBob: Interact to add onion to pot (4,0)  // pot now has one onion, Bob empty\n\nAlice changes orientation, not interact yet.\n\nTurn 25:\n\nAlice: Change D\n\nBut after change, she can interact at same turn? No, each action per turn.\n\nAt turn 25, Alice changes to face down, then at turn 26 she interacts.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTurn 25:\n\nAlice: Change orientation D  // now facing down at (2,1)\n\nBob: Interact to add onion to pot (4,0)  // pot (4,0) has one onion, Bob empty\n\nTurn 26:\n\nAlice: Interact to add onion to pot (2,0)  // pot (2,0) has one onion, Alice empty\n\nBob: Move R to (5,1)  // to access (6,1) counter\n\nAfter add, Bob at (4,1), move R to (5,1), facing right.\n\nTurn 27:\n\nAlice: Move L to (1,1)  // to go to plate dispenser\n\nBob: Interact to pick up onion from (6,1) kitchen counter  // now Bob holding onion\n\nAlice: from (2,1) move L to (1,1), facing left.\n\nTurn 28:\n\nAlice: Move U to (1,2)  // to (1,2), facing up\n\nBob: Move L to (4,1)  // to go back to pot, from (5,1) move L to (4,1), facing left\n\nTurn 29:\n\nAlice: Change orientation L (to face west for plate dispenser)\n\nBob: Change orientation D (to face down for pot)\n\nTurn 30:\n\nAlice: Interact to grab plate from (0,2) dispenser  // now Alice holding clean plate\n\nBob: Interact to add onion to pot (4,0)  // now pot has three onions (one from Bob turn 25, one from this, and one? Wait no)\n\nPot (4,0): at turn 25, Bob added one onion. Then at turn 30, Bob adds another onion, so now two onions? But we need three.\n\nMistake.\n\nAt turn 25, Bob added one onion to (4,0), so one onion.\n\nAt turn 30, Bob adds another onion, so now two onions, not three.\n\nBut we need three to start cooking.\n\nI forgot the third onion.\n\nBob picked up the onion from counter at turn 27, so he has it, then at turn 30 he adds it, so if pot had one, now two, but not three.\n\nAt turn 25, only one added.\n\nWe need the third onion.\n\nInitially, pots empty.\n\nAfter Alice adds to (2,0) at turn 26, pot has one.\n\nBob adds to (4,0) at turn 25, pot has one.\n\nThen Bob adds another at turn 30 to (4,0), so now (4,0) has two onions.\n\nStill not three.\n\nBut we have only two players, each added one, and Bob added one more, but that's the third for (4,0)? Let's count.\n\n- Turn 25: Bob adds one to (4,0), pot has one.\n\n- Turn 30: Bob adds another to (4,0), pot has two.\n\nNot three.\n\nAlice added to (2,0), not to (4,0).\n\nSo (4,0) has only two onions after turn 30.\n\nBut we need three.\n\nThe onion from counter is the third for (4,0), but Bob added it, so now two in (4,0), since only one was there.\n\nAt turn 25, one onion; turn 30, add second; missing one.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nIn the plan, only Bob is adding to (4,0), Alice to (2,0).\n\nFor (4,0) to have three, we need three additions.\n\nBut only Bob is adding, and he added twice, but first time at turn 25, second at turn 30, so two onions.\n\nThe pot was empty, so after two adds, two onions, not full.\n\nTo start cooking, need three.\n\nSo mistake.\n\nBetter to have both add to the same pot.\n\nLet's restart.\n\nChoose one pot, say (4,0) for both.\n\nAlice at (2,3) holding onion, go to (4,1) to add.\n\nPath: as before, (2,3) to (1,3) to (1,2) to (1,1) to (2,1) to (3,1) to (4,1), 5 moves.\n\nThen add.\n\nBob at (5,3) go to (4,1) to add, shorter.\n\nBut (4,1) can be occupied.\n\nFirst, Bob can add quickly.\n\nTurn 21:\nAlice: Move L to (1,3)  // start moving to (4,1)\nBob: Move D to (5,2)\n\nTurn 22:\nAlice: Move D to (1,2)\nBob: Move D to (5,1)\n\nTurn 23:\nAlice: Move D to (1,1)\nBob: Move L to (4,1)  // at (4,1)\n\nTurn 24:\nAlice: Move R to (2,1)\nBob: Change orientation D  // face down\n\nTurn 25:\nAlice: Move R to (3,1)\nBob: Interact to add onion to pot (4,0)  // pot has one, Bob empty\n\nTurn 26:\nAlice: Move R to (4,1)  // at (4,1), facing right\nBob: Move R to (5,1)  // to pick up onion from counter\n\nAlice at (4,1), facing right, but to add onion to pot, need face down.\n\nBob at (5,1), facing right after move.\n\nTurn 27:\nAlice: Change orientation D  // face down\nBob: Interact to pick up onion from (6,1)  // now Bob holding onion\n\nTurn 28:\nAlice: Interact to add onion to pot (4,0)  // now pot has two onions (one from Bob, one from Alice)\nBob: Move L to (4,1)  // to add onion, but (4,1) is occupied by Alice?\n\nAt turn 27, Alice is at (4,1) changing orientation, then at turn 28 she interacts, still at (4,1).\n\nBob at turn 27 is at (5,1) interacting, then at turn 28 move L to (4,1), but (4,1) has Alice, so cannot, since players cannot occupy same tile.\n\nProblem.\n\nBob cannot move to (4,1) if Alice is there.\n\nSo conflict.\n\nAfter Alice adds at turn 28, she can move away.\n\nTurn 28: Alice interacts to add onion, so pot now has two onions.\n\nThen Alice is at (4,1) empty.\n\nBob at (5,1) holding onion, wants to add to pot, but needs to be at (4,1) facing down.\n\nBut (4,1) occupied.\n\nSo Alice must move away.\n\nTurn 29:\nAlice: Move to some other place, say Move R to (5,1)? But Bob is there or moving.\n\nAt turn 28, after interact, Alice at (4,1) empty.\n\nBob at (5,1) holding onion.\n\nTurn 29:\nAlice: Move R to (5,1)? But (5,1) Bob is there, cannot.\n\nMove U to (4,2) but blocked, or Move L to (3,1), etc.\n\nSay Alice Move L to (3,1)  // facing left? Move L to (3,1), facing left\n\nThen Bob can Move L to (4,1)  // from (5,1) move L to (4,1), facing left\n\nTurn 30:\nBob: Change orientation D (to face down)\nAlice: at (3,1), can stay or something.\n\nTurn 31:\nBob: Interact to add onion to pot (4,0)  // now three onions, cooking starts at turn 31.\n\nCooking time 5 turns, ready at turn 36.\n\nAlice at (3,1) empty, she can go get a plate.\n\nPlate at (0,2).\n\nFrom (3,1) to (2,1) to (1,1) to (1,2) then interact as before.\n\nTurn 31: Alice Move L to (2,1)  // to west\n\nTurn 32: Move L to (1,1)  // facing left\n\nTurn 33: Move U to (1,2)  // facing up\n\nTurn 34: Change orientation L (to face west)\n\nTurn 35: Interact to grab plate  // now holding plate\n\nThen go to (4,1) to serve when ready.\n\nAt turn 36, soup ready.\n\nAlice at (1,2), far.\n\nPath to (4,1): from (1,2) to (1,1) to (2,1) to (3,1) to (4,1)\n\nTurn 36: Move D to (1,1)\n\nTurn 37: Move R to (2,1)\n\nTurn 38: Move R to (3,1)\n\nTurn 39: Move R to (4,1)  // facing right\n\nTurn 40: Change orientation D\n\nTurn 41: Interact to serve soup  // now holding soup\n\nThen to serving counter.\n\nTurn 42: Move R to (5,1)  // facing right\n\nTurn 43: Move U to (5,2)  // facing up\n\nTurn 44: Change orientation R  // face east\n\nTurn 45: Interact to deliver.\n\nBut this is late, and Bob is idle.\n\nBob can get the plate.\n\nAfter adding the third onion at turn 31, Bob at (4,1) empty.\n\nHe can go to get plate.\n\nPlate at (0,2), far.\n\nFrom (4,1) to (3,1) to (2,1) to (1,1) to (1,2) then grab.\n\nTurn 32: Bob Move L to (3,1)\n\nTurn 33: Move L to (2,1)\n\nTurn 34: Move L to (1,1)\n\nTurn 35: Move U to (1,2)  // facing up\n\nTurn 36: Change orientation L\n\nTurn 37: Interact to grab plate\n\nThen back to pot, but soup ready at turn 36, so at turn 37 he has plate, but at (1,2), far.\n\nSame issue.\n\nTo save time, Alice can get the plate while Bob is adding the last onion.\n\nIn the first part, Alice was getting plate early.\n\nLet's go back to the initial approach but with one pot.\n\nSet pot at (4,0).\n\nAlice goes to add onion, but takes time.\n\nBob adds first, then picks up onion from counter and adds.\n\nAlice adds her onion to the same pot.\n\nBut with position conflict.\n\nTo avoid conflict, have Alice add first or something.\n\nSince the onion on counter is available, and both have onions, have one player add to pot, the other put onion on counter near pot, then first player pick it up and add.\n\nFor example, Bob at (5,3) can go to (5,1) and put the onion on the kitchen counter at (6,1)? But (6,1) already has an onion, and kitchen counter can hold items, but I think only one item per counter.\n\nRules: \"Kitchen Counter: Pick up items (if player is empty-handed and counter is occupied) or place items (if player is holding an item and counter is empty).\"\n\nSo if counter is occupied, cannot place; if empty, can place.\n\nAt (6,1), it is occupied with an onion, so Bob cannot place another onion there.\n\nOther counters might be empty.\n\nFor example, kitchen counters: many are listed, but some may be empty.\n\nThe state says \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter: (6,1): contains a onion\"\n\nSo other kitchen counters are empty, I assume.\n\nFor example, near pot, (3,0) is kitchen counter, but not walkable, so to place, need adjacent position.\n\nFor pot at (4,0), kitchen counter at (3,0), (5,0), but not adjacent empty tiles directly.\n\nAccess from (3,1) or (4,1) etc.\n\nBut complicated.\n\nSimplest way: have Alice add her onion to pot at (2,0), then she is empty, go to (5,1) pick up onion from (6,1), then add to pot at (2,0) if it has one, but need another.\n\nPot at (2,0) has one, she adds second, then need third.\n\nThen she can get from dispenser.\n\nBut dispensers at (2,4) or (4,4), far.\n\nBob can add his onion to pot at (2,0) after.\n\nLet's calculate the fastest way.\n\nStart with both adding to pot at (2,0).\n\nAlice at (2,3), go to (2,1) to add.\n\nAs first plan: 4 actions to reach (2,1), then change orientation, interact, so turn 26 she adds.\n\nBob from (5,3) to (2,1) far.\n\nBob to (2,1): from (5,3) to (5,2) to (5,1) to (4,1) to (3,1) to (2,1), 5 moves, then add.\n\nBut Alice is there or not.\n\nOr both to (4,0), similar.\n\nUse the existing onion on counter as the third.\n\nSo have one player add their onion, then pick up the counter onion and add to same pot.\n\nFor example, Bob adds to (4,0) quickly.\n\nTurn 21:\nAlice: Stay or start moving, but for now, she can wait or move towards counter.\nBob: Move D to (5,2)\n\nTurn 22:\nBob: Move D to (5,1)\n\nTurn 23:\nBob: Move L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 24:\nBob: Change orientation D\n\nTurn 25:\nBob: Interact to add onion to pot (4,0) // pot has one, Bob empty\n\nThen Bob can pick up the onion from (6,1).\n\nTurn 26:\nBob: Move R to (5,1) // already at (4,1), move R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 27:\nBob: Change orientation R (if not, but after move facing right)\nInteract to pick up onion from (6,1) // now holding onion\n\nTurn 28:\nBob: Move L to (4,1) // to add to pot\n\nTurn 29:\nBob: Change orientation D\n\nTurn 30:\nBob: Interact to add onion to pot (4,0) // now pot has two onions\n\nAlice has an onion, she can add to the same pot.\n\nAlice at (2,3), holding onion.\n\nShe needs to go to (4,1).\n\nPath: (2,3) to (3,3) to (4,3) then stuck, or via (1,3)-(1,2)-(1,1)-(2,1)-(3,1)-(4,1)\n\nTurn 21: Move L to (1,3)\n\nTurn 22: Move D to (1,2)\n\nTurn 23: Move D to (1,1)\n\nTurn 24: Move R to (2,1)\n\nTurn 25: Move R to (3,1)\n\nTurn 26: Move R to (4,1) // at (4,1), facing right\n\nAt turn 26, Bob is at (5,1) or moving.\n\nAt turn 26, Bob moves to (5,1), so (4,1) is empty.\n\nAlice at turn 26 to (4,1).\n\nBut at turn 28, Bob moves to (4,1), so turn 28 Alice and Bob both want (4,1), conflict.\n\nTurn 28: Bob Move L to (4,1)\n\nBut Alice is at (4,1) at turn 26.\n\nAt turn 26: Alice at (4,1)\n\nShe can add onion to pot.\n\nBut need to face down.\n\nTurn 27: Alice Change orientation D\n\nTurn 28: Alice Interact to add onion to pot (4,0) // now pot has three onions (Bob added one at turn 25, Bob added another at turn 30? No.\n\nAt turn 25, Bob added one, so one onion.\n\nAt turn 30, Bob adds second.\n\nAlice at turn 28 adds her onion, so if pot had one, now two, or if Bob added at turn 25, and no other, pot has one, Alice adds second.\n\nThen at turn 30 Bob adds third.\n\nBut at turn 28, Alice adds, so pot has two (from Bob turn 25 and Alice turn 28).\n\nThen at turn 30, Bob adds third, cooking starts.\n\nBut positions: at turn 28, Alice at (4,1) adding, then she is there.\n\nBob at turn 28 is moving to (4,1), but occupied, so cannot.\n\nTurn 28: Alice interacts at (4,1), so she is there.\n\nBob at turn 28 wants to move to (4,1) from (5,1), but occupied, so he must do something else.\n\nTurn 28: Bob can stay or change action.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nTo avoid, have Alice add her onion to the pot after Bob adds the second, but she needs to be there.\n\nPerhaps have Alice go directly to pick up the counter onion first, but she is holding onion, so she must put it down or add to pot first.\n\nI think the best is to have Alice add to pot (2,0), then Bob add to pot (2,0), then someone add the counter onion to (2,0).\n\nBut (2,0) is far from (6,1).\n\nLet's accept that for pot (4,0), cooking starts at turn 30 or 31.\n\nThen Alice can get the plate early.\n\nFrom turn 21, Alice goes to get plate while Bob handles the onions.\n\nAlice at (2,3) holding onion, she can go to (0,2) to get plate, but she is holding onion, so she must put it down or use it.\n\nShe can place the onion on a kitchen counter near, then go get plate.\n\nFor example, kitchen counter at (2,2), but (2,2) is at (2,2), not walkable, so to interact, need adjacent.\n\nFrom (2,3), she can face down to interact with (2,2) kitchen counter, if it is empty.\n\nIs (2,2) empty? The state says \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter: (6,1): contains a onion\" so other counters are empty, I assume.\n\nSo (2,2) kitchen counter is empty.\n\nFrom (2,3), facing down, she can interact with (2,2) below.\n\nShe is facing left, so first change orientation.\n\nTurn 21: Alice Change orientation D (to face down)\n\nThen Turn 22: Interact to place onion on (2,2) kitchen counter. // now Alice empty\n\nThen she can go to get plate.\n\nTurn 23: Move L to (1,3)  // or directly to (1,2)\n\nFrom (2,3) to (1,3) to (1,2)\n\nTurn 23: Move L to (1,3)\n\nTurn 24: Move D to (1,2)  // at (1,2)\n\nTurn 25: Change orientation L (to face west)\n\nTurn 26: Interact to grab plate from (0,2) // now holding plate\n\nThen she can go back or to the pot area.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can handle the pot.\n\nBob at (5,3) holding onion.\n\nHe can add to pot (4,0).\n\nTurn 21: Bob Move D to (5,2)\n\nTurn 22: Move D to (5,1)\n\nTurn 23: Move L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 24: Change orientation D\n\nTurn 25: Interact to add onion to pot (4,0) // pot has one, Bob empty\n\nThen pick up onion from (6,1).\n\nTurn 26: Move R to (5,1) // if not there, but at (4,1), move R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 27: Interact to pick up onion from (6,1) // holding onion\n\nThen add to pot.\n\nTurn 28: Move L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 29: Change orientation D\n\nTurn 30: Interact to add onion to pot (4,0) // now two onions\n\nNeed third onion.\n\nAlice has the plate, and there is an onion on (2,2) that she placed.\n\nAlice at (1,2) with plate, can go to (2,2) to pick up the onion, but (2,2) is kitchen counter, so from adjacent.\n\nFrom (1,2), she can face east to interact with (2,2)? (2,2) is east of (1,2), so at (1,2) face east to interact.\n\nBut she is holding plate, so to pick up onion, she needs to be empty-handed.\n\nShe has plate, so she cannot pick up onion unless she puts down the plate.\n\nSo she can place the plate on another counter or something.\n\nComplicated.\n\nAt turn 26, Alice has plate at (1,2), she can go to (2,3) to pick up the onion from (2,2).\n\nFrom (1,2) move U to (1,3) turn 27, then R to (2,3) turn 28.\n\nAt (2,3), facing down to interact with (2,2) to pick up onion.\n\nBut she has plate, so she needs to put down the plate first.\n\nPlace plate on another counter, e.g. at (1,2) or (2,3) but (2,3) is empty, not counter.\n\nShe can place on kitchen counter at (1,2), but (1,2) is the tile she is on? No, she is on empty tile, counters are separate.\n\nTo place on kitchen counter, she needs to be adjacent and facing it.\n\nFor example, at (1,2), she can face west to place on (0,2) but (0,2) is plate dispenser, not kitchen counter.\n\nKitchen counters are at (0,0) etc, far.\n\nNearby kitchen counter at (0,3) or (2,2), but (2,2) has onion now.\n\n(0,3) is at (0,3), accessible from (1,3) facing west.\n\nSo from (1,2), she can move to (1,3), then face west to place plate on (0,3) kitchen counter.\n\nThen pick up the onion.\n\nBut this takes time.\n\nPerhaps it's better to have Alice go directly to the pot area after getting plate, and Bob can add the third onion from dispenser or something.\n\nI think for simplicity, let's use the initial plan with one pot and Alice getting plate early.\n\nAssume we use pot at (4,0).\n\nAlice goes to add onion to (4,0) but takes time.\n\nBob adds quickly, then picks up counter onion and adds.\n\nAlice adds her onion.\n\nWith timing to avoid conflict.\n\nFrom turn 21:\n\nAlice: Move L to (1,3)\n\nBob: Move D to (5,2)\n\nTurn 22:\n\nAlice: Move D to (1,2)\n\nBob: Move D to (5,1)\n\nTurn 23:\n\nAlice: Move D to (1,1)\n\nBob: Move L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 24:\n\nAlice: Move R to (2,1)\n\nBob: Change orientation D\n\nTurn 25:\n\nAlice: Move R to (3,1)\n\nBob: Interact to add onion to pot (4,0)  // Bob added one, pot has one, Bob empty\n\nTurn 26:\n\nAlice: Move R to (4,1)  // at (4,1), facing right\n\nBob: Move R to (5,1)  // at (5,1), facing right\n\nTurn 27:\n\nAlice: Change orientation D  // face down at (4,1)\n\nBob: Interact to pick up onion from (6,1)  // now Bob holding onion\n\nTurn 28:\n\nAlice: Interact to add onion to pot (4,0)  // Alice adds, pot now has two onions (Bob's and Alice's)\n\nBob: Move L to (4,1)  // but (4,1) has Alice, so cannot move there. So Bob Stay or other action.\n\nSince cannot move, Bob can Change orientation or Stay.\n\nTurn 28: Bob Stay or change, say Stay.\n\nThen at turn 29:\n\nAlice: after adding, she is at (4,1) empty, so she can Move R to (5,1)  // but (5,1) has Bob? Bob is at (5,1).\n\nPositions: at turn 27, Alice at (4,1), Bob at (5,1).\n\nTurn 28: Alice interacts, still at (4,1).\n\nBob at (5,1), since he cannot move to (4,1), he can do nothing or change orientation.\n\nSay Bob Change orientation L or something, but not useful.\n\nThen turn 29:\nAlice: Move R to (5,1)  // but (5,1) Bob is there, cannot. So Alice Move to (3,1) or U to (4,2) blocked, so Move L to (3,1)  // facing left\n\nBob: Move L to (4,1)  // now (4,1) empty, so Bob moves to (4,1), facing left\n\nTurn 30:\nBob: Change orientation D  // face down\n\nTurn 31:\nBob: Interact to add onion to pot (4,0)  // now three onions, cooking starts at turn 31.\n\nAlice at (3,1) empty, she can go get plate.\n\nBut she can get plate earlier.\n\nFrom turn 29, Alice at (3,1), she can go to (1,2) to get plate.\n\nTurn 30: Alice Move L to (2,1)\n\nTurn 31: Move L to (1,1)\n\nTurn 32: Move U to (1,2)  // at (1,2)\n\nTurn 33: Change orientation L\n\nTurn 34: Interact to grab plate\n\nThen at turn 35, move towards (4,1).\n\nBut soup ready at turn 36, so she needs to be at (4,1) by turn 36.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (1,1) to (2,1) to (3,1) to (4,1)\n\nTurn 35: Move D to (1,1)\n\nTurn 36: Move R to (2,1)\n\nTurn 37: Move R to (3,1)\n\nTurn 38: Move R to (4,1)  // at (4,1), facing right\n\nTurn 39: Change orientation D\n\nTurn 40: Interact to serve soup (since ready at turn 36, but she serves at turn 40)\n\nThen deliver.\n\nTurn 41: Move R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 42: Move U to (5,2)\n\nTurn 43: Change orientation R\n\nTurn 44: Interact to deliver.\n\nReward at turn 44.\n\nSince cooking started at turn 31, ready at turn 36, served at turn 40, delivered at turn 44.\n\nTotal turns from 21 to 44, 23 turns for one soup.\n\nBut we can optimize delivery.\n\nAfter serving, at (4,1) with soup, to (5,2) to deliver.\n\nInstead of to (5,1), directly to (5,2).\n\nFrom (4,1) to (4,2) blocked, so to (5,1) then (5,2).\n\nOr from (4,1) to (5,1) to (5,2).\n\nMinimum.\n\nBob can deliver, but he is not holding plate.\n\nAlice has the plate.\n\nSo this is the best I can think of.\n\nFor the answer, I need to list Alice's actions for H turns, say H=20 or something.\n\nBut the task says \"over next several turns(say, H turns)\", not specified, so I can choose H to cover the delivery.\n\nSince the soup is delivered at turn 44, from turn 21, 23 actions, but I can list until the soup is delivered or for a shorter horizon.\n\nBut to maximize reward, we should complete the soup.\n\nAlso, there might be more, but for now, one soup.\n\nSo let's list Alice's actions from turn 21.\n\nBased on the last plan.\n\nAlice actions:\n\nTurn 21: Move L  // to (1,3)\n\nTurn 22: Move D  // to (1,2)\n\nTurn 23: Move D  // to (1,1)\n\nTurn 24: Move R  // to (2,1)\n\nTurn 25: Move R  // to (3,1)\n\nTurn 26: Move R  // to (4,1)\n\nTurn 27: Change orientation D\n\nTurn 28: Interact  // add onion to pot\n\nTurn 29: Move L  // to (3,1)\n\nTurn 30: Move L  // to (2,1)\n\nTurn 31: Move L  // to (1,1)\n\nTurn 32: Move U  // to (1,2)\n\nTurn 33: Change orientation L\n\nTurn 34: Interact  // grab plate\n\nTurn 35: Move D  // to (1,1)\n\nTurn 36: Move R  // to (2,1)\n\nTurn 37: Move R  // to (3,1)\n\nTurn 38: Move R  // to (4,1)\n\nTurn 39: Change orientation D\n\nTurn 40: Interact  // serve soup\n\nTurn 41: Move R  // to (5,1)\n\nTurn 42: Move U  // to (5,2)\n\nTurn 43: Change orientation R\n\nTurn 44: Interact  // deliver\n\nBut this is for Alice only, and Bob's actions are not specified, but for the plan, I can include both or just Alice.\n\nThe task is to plan for Alice, so perhaps only Alice's actions.\n\nBut to coordinate, it's better to have Bob's, but the answer format is for Alice.\n\nAnswer format: only Alice's actions.\n\nSo I need to plan Alice's actions assuming Bob cooperates or something.\n\nIn the context, Bob is teammate, so we can assume he will help.\n\nFor Alice, she can focus on getting the plate and serving.\n\nIn the above, she also added an onion.\n\nBut she can only get the plate.\n\nLet's have Alice go get the plate directly from turn 21.\n\nAlice at (2,3) holding onion.\n\nFirst, she needs to put down the onion.\n\nTurn 21: Change orientation D  // to face down for (2,2)\n\nTurn 22: Interact to place onion on (2,2) kitchen counter  // now empty\n\nTurn 23: Move L to (1,3)  // to (1,3)\n\nTurn 24: Move D to (1,2)  // to (1,2)\n\nTurn 25: Change orientation L  // face west\n\nTurn 26: Interact to grab plate from (0,2)  // now holding plate\n\nThen she can go to the serving area or to the pot.\n\nBut the pot may not be ready.\n\nBob can make the soup at (4,0).\n\nBob at (5,3) holding onion.\n\nTurn 21: Move D to (5,2)\n\nTurn 22: Move D to (5,1)\n\nTurn 23: Move L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 24: Change orientation D\n\nTurn 25: Interact to add onion to pot (4,0)  // one onion\n\nTurn 26: Move R to (5,1)  // to pick up counter onion\n\nTurn 27: Interact to pick up onion from (6,1)  // holding onion\n\nTurn 28: Move L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 29: Change orientation D\n\nTurn 30: Interact to add onion to pot (4,0)  // two onions\n\nNeed third onion.\n\nHe can go to (2,2) to pick up the onion Alice placed.\n\nBut (2,2) at (2,2), accessible from (2,3) or (1,2) or (2,1) or (3,2).\n\nFrom (4,1), to (3,1) to (2,1) to (2,2) blocked, or to (3,2) blocked.\n\nFrom (2,3) above.\n\nBob at (4,1), turn 31: Move R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 32: Move U to (5,2)\n\nTurn 33: Move U to (5,3)  // at (5,3)\n\nTurn 34: Move L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 35: Move L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 36: Move L to (2,3)  // at (2,3)\n\nTurn 37: Change orientation D  // face down to (2,2)\n\nTurn 38: Interact to pick up onion from (2,2)  // holding onion\n\nTurn 39: Move R to (3,3)  // start back to pot\n\n...\n\nTakes too long.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo better to have Alice add her onion to the pot early and get plate.\n\nI think the first sequence is acceptable.\n\nFor the answer, I'll list Alice's actions for 20 turns or until delivery.\n\nSince the task is to plan for Alice, I'll provide a sequence for Alice to contribute to the soup.\n\nFinal decision:\n\nAlice will add her onion to pot at (2,0), then get the plate, then serve when ready.\n\nWith Bob handling the other onions.\n\nBut for pot (2,0), cooking may not start soon.\n\nLet's do for pot (2,0).\n\nAlice at (2,3) holding onion.\n\nTurn 21: Move L to (1,3)\n\nTurn 22: Move D to (1,2)\n\nTurn 23: Move D to (1,1)\n\nTurn 24: Move R to (2,1)\n\nTurn 25: Change orientation D\n\nTurn 26: Interact to add onion to pot (2,0)  // one onion, Alice empty\n\nThen she goes to get plate.\n\nTurn 27: Move L to (1,1)\n\nTurn 28: Move U to (1,2)\n\nTurn 29: Change orientation L\n\nTurn 30: Interact to grab plate  // holding plate\n\nThen she can wait or go to serving area.\n\nBob can add his onion to pot (2,0) and add the counter onion.\n\nBob at (5,3) to (2,1).\n\nTurn 21: Bob Move D to (5,2)\n\nTurn 22: Move D to (5,1)\n\nTurn 23: Move L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 24: Move L to (3,1)\n\nTurn 25: Move L to (2,1)  // at (2,1)\n\nTurn 26: Change orientation D\n\nTurn 27: Interact to add onion to pot (2,0)  // now two onions, Bob empty\n\nThen Bob can go to (5,1) to pick up counter onion.\n\nTurn 28: Move R to (3,1)\n\nTurn 29: Move R to (4,1)\n\nTurn 30: Move R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 31: Change orientation R\n\nTurn 32: Interact to pick up onion from (6,1)  // holding onion\n\nTurn 33: Move L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 34: Move L to (3,1)\n\nTurn 35: Move L to (2,1)\n\nTurn 36: Change orientation D\n\nTurn 37: Interact to add onion to pot (2,0)  // three onions, cooking starts at turn 37.\n\nReady at turn 42.\n\nAlice has plate, she can serve at turn 42.\n\nAlice at (1,2) with plate, can go to (2,1) to serve.\n\nTurn 31: Alice at (1,2) with plate, after turn 30.\n\nShe can move to (1,1) turn 31, to (2,1) turn 32.\n\nBut at turn 32, (2,1) may have Bob moving.\n\nTurn 31: Alice Move D to (1,1)\n\nTurn 32: Move R to (2,1)  // at (2,1)\n\nBut at turn 32, Bob is at (5,1) or moving, not at (2,1).\n\nAt turn 32, Bob at (5,1) interacting, so (2,1) empty.\n\nAlice at (2,1) with plate, facing right after move.\n\nTurn 33: Change orientation D\n\nThen at turn 42, soup ready, she can interact to serve.\n\nTurn 42: Interact to serve soup\n\nThen deliver to (6,2).\n\nFrom (2,1) to (3,1) to (4,1) to (5,1) to (5,2) then serve.\n\nTurn 43: Move R to (3,1)\n\nTurn 44: Move R to (4,1)\n\nTurn 45: Move R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 46: Move U to (5,2)\n\nTurn 47: Change orientation R\n\nTurn 48: Interact to deliver.\n\nLonger.\n\nSo the first pot (4,0) plan is faster.\n\nI think for the answer, I'll provide Alice's actions for the first part.\n\nPerhaps for turn 21 to 40 or something.\n\nSince the task is to maximize reward, and we deliver one soup, it's fine.\n\nI'll box the Alice actions from the first sequence I had.\n\nFrom the very first attempt:\n\nAlice actions to add onion to (2,0) and get plate:\n\nTurn 21: L (move left to (1,3))\n\nTurn 22: D (move down to (1,2))\n\nTurn 23: D (move down to (1,1))\n\nTurn 24: R (move right to (2,1))\n\nTurn 25: D (change orientation down)  // in actions, D can be move or change, but in list, it's the same symbol, need to specify.\n\nIn action list, U/D/L/R can be move or change orientation.\n\nIn the sequence, when she moves, it's move, when not, it's change orientation.\n\nIn this case, turn 25: she changes orientation, so it's Change D.\n\nBut in the answer format, it's just the letter, so for change orientation, it's still D, but it doesn't move if not possible.\n\nSimilarly for interact.\n\nSo for turn 25: D (change orientation to down)\n\nTurn 26: I (interact to add onion)\n\nThen turn 27: L (move left to (1,1))\n\nTurn 28: U (move up to (1,2))\n\nTurn 29: L (change orientation left)\n\nTurn 30: I (interact to grab plate)\n\nThen she can stay or move towards the pot, but for H turns, say up to turn 30 or 35.\n\nBut to complete, let's say for 10 turns.\n\nI think it's better to provide a sequence that leads to the soup.\n\nPerhaps the assistant should output Alice's actions for the next few turns to initiate the collaboration.\n\nSince the task says \"plan a sequence of actions ... over next several turns\", I'll do for H=10 turns from turn 21 to 30.\n\nSo Alice actions:\n\nTurn 21: L (move to (1,3))\n\nTurn 22: D (move to (1,2))\n\nTurn 23: D (move to (1,1))\n\nTurn 24: R (move to (2,1))\n\nTurn 25: D (change orientation to down)\n\nTurn 26: I (add onion to pot at (2,0))\n\nTurn 27: L (move to (1,1))\n\nTurn 28: U (move to (1,2))\n\nTurn 29: L (change orientation to left)\n\nTurn 30: I (grab plate from (0,2))\n\nThen she has plate, and can go to serve later.\n\nFor Bob, he can add his onion and the counter onion to pot (4,0) to start cooking.\n\nBut for Alice's actions, this is fine.\n\nSo in the box.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 21: \\text{L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: \\text{R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: \\text{I} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: \\text{L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29: \\text{L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 30: \\text{I} \\end{array} }\n\nActions: Turn 25 D is change orientation, not move, since she is at (2,1) and moving down not possible, so it's change orientation. Similarly, Turn 29 L is change orientation at (1,2).\n\nThis should work.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes in Overcooked, Alice and Bob must coordinate to prepare and deliver onion soup (the only available recipe, requiring 3 onions with a 5-turn cook time and 20 reward). The current state (turn 21) has Alice at (2,3) holding one onion and facing left, and Bob at (5,3) holding one onion and facing right. An additional onion is available on the kitchen counter at (6,1). Both pots are empty, and the plate dispenser is at (0,2). The serving counter is at (6,2).\n\n### Coordination Plan\n- **Objective**: Deliver one onion soup as quickly as possible. This requires:\n  - Adding 3 onions to a single pot (chosen as pot at (4,0) for efficiency, as Bob is closer to it and the onion on (6,1)).\n  - Cooking for 5 turns once the pot has 3 onions.\n  - Using a clean plate to serve the cooked soup at the pot.\n  - Delivering the soup to the serving counter at (6,2).\n- **Roles**:\n  - **Alice**: Focus on obtaining a plate from (0,2) early, as she is farther from the pot. After adding her onion to the pot, she moves to get the plate and positions herself to serve the soup once cooked.\n  - **Bob**: Focuses on the pot at (4,0). He adds his onion first, then picks up the onion from (6,1) and adds it to the same pot. He adds a second onion (the third for the pot) to start cooking.\n- **Key Coordination**:\n  - Alice adds her onion to pot (4,0) by turn 28, then gets the plate by turn 30.\n  - Bob adds his onion by turn 25, picks up the onion from (6,1) by turn 27, and adds it to the pot by turn 31 to start cooking at turn 31.\n  - Cooking starts at turn 31, so soup is ready at turn 36. Alice serves it at turn 40 and delivers by turn 44 for a reward of 20.\n- **Path and Action Rationale for Alice**:\n  - Alice starts at (2,3) and moves via empty tiles to access pot (4,0) from (4,1), facing south to interact.\n  - After adding her onion, she moves to the plate dispenser at (0,2), accessing it from (1,2) facing west.\n  - She then positions near the pot to serve when the soup is ready.\n- **Assumed Bob Actions for Coordination** (not part of answer, but included for context):\n  - Turn 21: D (to (5,2))\n  - Turn 22: D (to (5,1))\n  - Turn 23: L (to (4,1))\n  - Turn 24: D (change orientation down)\n  - Turn 25: I (add onion to pot (4,0))\n  - Turn 26: R (to (5,1))\n  - Turn 27: I (pick up onion from (6,1))\n  - Turn 28: L (to (4,1); note: Alice moves away this turn to avoid conflict)\n  - Turn 29: D (change orientation down)\n  - Turn 30: I (add onion to pot (4,0); pot now has 2 onions)\n  - Turn 31: I (add onion; pot has 3 onions, cooking starts)\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence (Turns 21 to 30)\nAlice's actions for the next 10 turns (H=10) are planned to add her onion to pot (4,0) and obtain a plate. This sets up for serving the soup around turn 40. The sequence is optimized based on the grid layout and collaboration with Bob.\n\n- **Turn 21**: Move left (L) to (1,3). (Begins path to pot (4,0) via empty tiles.)\n- **Turn 22**: Move down (D) to (1,2). (Continues path toward pot access point.)\n- **Turn 23**: Move down (D) to (1,1). (Nears pot access route.)\n- **Turn 24**: Move right (R) to (2,1). (Moves east toward pot area.)\n- **Turn 25**: Move right (R) to (3,1). (Continues to pot access point at (4,1).)\n- **Turn 26**: Move right (R) to (4,1). (Now adjacent to pot (4,0); facing right, but pot is south.)\n- **Turn 27**: Change orientation down (D). (Faces south to interact with pot.)\n- **Turn 28**: Interact (I) to add onion to pot (4,0). (Pot now has 2 onions including Bob's; Alice empty.)\n- **Turn 29**: Move left (L) to (3,1). (Moves away to avoid blocking Bob; he adds the third onion later.)\n- **Turn 30**: Move left (L) to (2,1). (Positions to get plate; next step would be move to (1,1) then (1,2) for plate.)\n\n### Additional Notes\n- **Beyond Turn 30**: Alice should continue to the plate dispenser (turns 31-34: move to (1,1), then (1,2), change orientation left, interact to grab plate). By turn 36, she moves to (4,1) to serve the soup at turn 40 and deliver by turn 44.\n- **Efficiency**: This sequence starts soup cooking by turn 31 and delivers by turn 44, yielding 20 reward. Further optimization (e.g., Bob delivering) is possible but not needed for H=10.\n- **Constraints**: Actions avoid non-walkable tiles (e.g., kitchen counters) and player collisions. Orientation changes are used when movement is blocked.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 21: \\text{L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: \\text{R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: \\text{R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: \\text{R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: \\text{I} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29: \\text{L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 30: \\text{L} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 26. Alice is at (3,3) holding an onion, facing left. Bob is at (2,1) holding an onion, facing left.\n The goal is to maximize the reward by delivering soup. The only recipe is 3 onions, which cooks in 5 turns and gives 20 reward.\n\n Available resources:\n   - Onion dispensers at (2,4) and (4,4)\n   - Plate dispenser at (0,2)\n   - Pots at (2,0) and (4,0)\n   - Serving counter at (6,2)\n\n Current state:\n   - Both players are holding one onion each.\n   - There is an onion on the kitchen counter at (6,1). But note: we can use kitchen counters to store items temporarily.\n\n Steps to make soup:\n   - We need to put 3 onions in a pot. Then the pot will cook for 5 turns. Then we need to serve it with a plate.\n\n Since there are two pots, we can use either. Let's plan:\n\n Option 1: Use the pot at (2,0) or (4,0). We have two players, so we can coordinate.\n\n Steps for Alice and Bob:\n\n 1. Both players are holding an onion. We need one more onion to complete a recipe (3 onions). We can get the third onion by:\n    - One of the players (or both) going to an onion dispenser to get another onion? But note: they are already holding one. So they must first put their onion somewhere (either in a pot or on a kitchen counter) to get another one.\n\n However, note: we cannot put an onion directly into a pot unless we are adjacent and facing it. Also, a pot can hold up to 3 ingredients.\n\n Let's think of a plan:\n\n Since both players have an onion, if they both put their onions in the same pot, we only need one more onion.\n\n Steps:\n\n  - Alice and Bob should both go to the same pot and put their onions. Then one of them can get the third onion and put it in.\n\n But note: the pot is at (2,0) and (4,0). Bob is at (2,1) and Alice at (3,3). Bob is closer to (2,0) and Alice is closer to (4,0). However, we want to use the same pot.\n\n Let's choose the pot at (2,0) because Bob is very close.\n\n Plan:\n\n  - Bob: at (2,1) holding onion. He can move down to (2,0) to get adjacent to the pot? But note: (2,0) is a pot tile. He must stand on an adjacent empty tile and face the pot.\n\n    The tiles adjacent to (2,0) are:\n        (1,0): kitchen counter (non-empty? we don't know but it's a counter so we can't stand on it) -> not walkable\n        (2,1): where Bob is -> but (2,0) is below (2,1). So Bob is at (2,1). He is above the pot. To interact with (2,0), he needs to face down.\n\n    So Bob should:\n        - Turn to face down (if not already) and then interact. But currently Bob is facing left. So he must change orientation to down.\n\n    Steps for Bob at (2,1):\n        - First, change orientation to down (D? but note: the action for changing orientation to down is 'D'? Actually, the actions are:\n            Move: L, R, U, D (which change position and orientation)\n            Change Orientation: But the problem says we can change orientation without moving by using L, R, U, D? Actually, the description says:\n                \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\n            However, note: if Bob issues a 'D' (which is a move down) but (2,0) is a pot (non-empty) so he cannot move down. Then the action 'D' would be interpreted as a change in orientation to down? \n\n            The rules: \n                - Move: if the adjacent tile in the direction is empty and walkable, then move and change orientation to that direction.\n                - If the adjacent tile is not empty (or not walkable), then it's just a change in orientation to that direction.\n\n            So Bob can do:\n                - Action 'D' at (2,1) facing left: since (2,0) is non-empty (pot), he cannot move down. So he changes orientation to down.\n\n            Then, next turn, he can interact because he is adjacent to (2,0) and facing it.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do two steps: first change orientation to down (by issuing 'D' without moving) and then interact.\n\n        But note: the action set is {U, D, L, R, I, S}. So we have to use these.\n\n        So for Bob:\n            Turn 26: D -> this will change his orientation to down (because he can't move down to a non-empty tile) and now he is facing the pot at (2,0).\n            Turn 27: I -> interact to put the onion into the pot.\n\n        Then the pot will have one onion.\n\n  - Alice: at (3,3) holding an onion. She needs to go to the same pot at (2,0). But note: Bob is going to be at (2,1) for at least two turns? And we don't want to block.\n\n    Path for Alice: (3,3) to (2,0). But note: she must avoid Bob and non-empty tiles.\n\n    The grid: we don't have a full map, but we know the non-empty tiles (counters, dispensers, etc.) and the positions of the players.\n\n    Let me sketch a grid (from the tile types given):\n\n        x: 0 to 6, y: 0 to 4.\n\n        Kitchen Counters: (0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)\n        Onion Dispensers: (2,4), (4,4)\n        Plate Dispenser: (0,2)\n        Pots: (2,0), (4,0)\n        Serving Counter: (6,2)\n\n    So the walkable tiles are the ones not in the above and not occupied by another player.\n\n    Alice at (3,3). She needs to go to (2,0). One possible path:\n\n        (3,3) -> (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> not walkable. So she must go around.\n\n        Alternative: \n          Option 1: (3,3) -> (4,3) [if (4,3) is empty? We don't have a kitchen counter at (4,3) so it should be empty?] \n          Then (4,3) -> (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> blocked.\n\n        So let's check the kitchen counters: (0,3) and (6,3) are counters, but (4,3) is not listed so it should be walkable? Similarly, (5,3) is not listed -> walkable.\n\n        Then: \n          (3,3) -> (4,3) [right] -> (5,3) [right] -> (5,4) is a kitchen counter -> so (5,3) to (5,2) is blocked by kitchen counter (5,4) is at y=4, so (5,2) is not a counter? Wait, kitchen counters at (5,0) and (5,4) but (5,1), (5,2), (5,3) are not listed -> so they are walkable? \n\n        Actually, the list of kitchen counters does not include (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). So they are empty.\n\n        Then from (5,3) to (5,2) is a kitchen counter? Yes, (5,2) is not in the list? Wait: the kitchen counters at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) -> so (5,2) is not a kitchen counter? Then it should be walkable.\n\n        But note: the serving counter is at (6,2) and that's non-empty? But it's a counter so we can't walk on it, but we can walk on (5,2) because it's not listed as any non-empty tile? \n\n        However, we must note: the only non-empty tiles are the ones that are fixed (dispensers, counters, pots, serving) and the ones that have items (like the onion on (6,1)). But the kitchen counter at (6,1) has an onion, but it's still a counter so we cannot walk on it.\n\n        So the grid:\n\n          Row y=0: [K, K, P, K, P, K, K]  -> (0,0) to (6,0): K at (0,0), (1,0), (3,0) is K? Actually (3,0) is listed as kitchen counter -> so it's non-walkable. Similarly, (5,0) and (6,0) are K. But (2,0) and (4,0) are pots -> non-walkable.\n\n          Row y=1: [K, ... , K] -> (0,1) and (6,1) are kitchen counters. (6,1) has an onion, but still non-walkable. The rest? (1,1) to (5,1) are not listed -> walkable.\n\n          Row y=2: [P, K, K, K, S] -> (0,2) is plate dispenser -> non-walkable? Actually, dispensers are non-walkable. Then (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) are kitchen counters -> non-walkable. (6,2) is serving counter -> non-walkable. So only (1,2) and (5,2) are walkable? But (1,2) is not listed as anything? So it should be walkable. Similarly, (5,2) is walkable.\n\n          Row y=3: [K, ... , K] -> (0,3) and (6,3) are kitchen counters. The rest (1,3) to (5,3) are walkable.\n\n          Row y=4: [K, K, O, K, O, K, K] -> (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4) are kitchen counters. (2,4) and (4,4) are onion dispensers.\n\n        So Alice at (3,3) (y=3, x=3) cannot go to (3,2) because it's a kitchen counter. She must go around.\n\n        Path: \n          Option 1: \n            (3,3) -> (4,3) [R] -> (5,3) [R] -> (5,2) [D] -> (5,1) [D] -> (5,0) is kitchen counter -> blocked.\n\n        Alternatively, from (5,2) we can go left to (4,2) but that's a kitchen counter -> blocked.\n\n        Option 2: go left from (3,3) to (2,3) [L] -> (1,3) [L] -> (1,2) [D] -> (1,1) [D] -> (1,0) is kitchen counter -> blocked.\n\n        Option 3: go down from (3,3) to (3,2) is blocked. So we must go around via the top? But we are at y=3 and we need to go down to y=0.\n\n        Another idea: go to (4,3) then (4,4) is an onion dispenser? But we don't need to go there. Instead, we can go from (4,3) to (4,2) is blocked. So we go to (4,3) then to (4,4) is non-walkable? So that's not helpful.\n\n        How about going to (2,3) then (2,4) is an onion dispenser? Also non-walkable.\n\n        So we must use the middle row? But row y=1 is walkable? We can go to (3,3) -> (3,4) is a kitchen counter? So (3,3) can only go to (2,3), (4,3), and (3,2) is blocked, (3,4) is blocked.\n\n        Then from (2,3): (2,2) is kitchen counter -> blocked. So we go to (1,3) then (1,2) is walkable? Then (1,2) to (1,1) [D] -> (1,1) to (2,1) [R] -> but Bob is at (2,1) at turn 26 and will be there at least until turn 27? So we cannot go to (2,1) at turn 27.\n\n        Alternatively, from (1,2) we can go to (0,2) is plate dispenser -> non-walkable. Then we can go to (1,1) and then (2,1) is occupied by Bob? So we have to avoid.\n\n        Let me think of a longer path:\n\n          (3,3) -> (4,3) [R] \n          (4,3) -> (5,3) [R]\n          (5,3) -> (5,2) [D] -> (5,2) is walkable? Yes, because it's not listed as non-empty? \n          (5,2) -> (5,1) [D] -> (5,1) is walkable? Yes.\n          (5,1) -> (4,1) [L] -> (4,1) is walkable? Yes.\n          (4,1) -> (3,1) [L] -> (3,1) is walkable? Yes.\n          (3,1) -> (2,1) [L] -> but Bob is at (2,1) at turn 26. At turn 27, Bob will be at (2,1) but then he does an interact? So at turn 27, Bob is still at (2,1) and then turn 28? We don't know when he leaves.\n\n        But we are planning for Alice. Bob will be at (2,1) for two turns (turn 26: orientation change, turn 27: interact). Then on turn 28, Bob can move away.\n\n        So Alice cannot be at (2,1) until turn 28 at the earliest.\n\n        So Alice's path:\n\n          Turn 26: R (to (4,3)) -> but note: we are at (3,3) and we move right to (4,3). Orientation becomes right.\n          Turn 27: R (to (5,3))\n          Turn 28: D (to (5,2)) -> now at (5,2), facing down.\n          Turn 29: D (to (5,1)) -> facing down.\n          Turn 30: L (to (4,1)) -> facing left.\n          Turn 31: L (to (3,1)) -> facing left.\n          Turn 32: L (to (2,1)) -> but wait, Bob might have left (2,1) by turn 32? We don't know Bob's actions beyond turn 27.\n\n        We are only planning for Alice? The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\".\n\n        We can plan for both to coordinate.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the other pot at (4,0). Then we don't have to go to (2,0). Let's consider:\n\n          Pot at (4,0): adjacent positions are (4,1) (above), (3,0) (left) -> but (3,0) is a kitchen counter, so only (4,1) is adjacent and empty.\n\n          Alice is at (3,3). She can go to (4,0) via:\n\n            (3,3) -> (4,3) [R] -> (4,2) is kitchen counter -> blocked.\n\n          So the same problem: she must go around.\n\n        The path to (4,0) from (3,3):\n\n          (3,3) -> (4,3) [R]\n          (4,3) -> (5,3) [R]\n          (5,3) -> (5,2) [D]\n          (5,2) -> (5,1) [D]\n          (5,1) -> (4,1) [L] -> (4,1) is adjacent to (4,0) (which is a pot). So at (4,1) she can face down to interact with (4,0).\n\n          Steps: \n            Turn 26: R (to (4,3))\n            Turn 27: R (to (5,3))\n            Turn 28: D (to (5,2))\n            Turn 29: D (to (5,1))\n            Turn 30: L (to (4,1)) -> now at (4,1), facing left? But we need to face down to interact with (4,0).\n\n          Then on turn 31: she can change orientation to down (by trying to move down to (4,0) which is non-empty -> so it becomes a change to down) and then interact on turn 32.\n\n        But note: we want to put two onions in the same pot. So if Alice goes to (4,0) and Bob goes to (2,0), then we have two pots with one onion each. That doesn't help.\n\n        Therefore, we must coordinate to use the same pot.\n\n        Let's stick with the pot at (2,0). We can have Bob put his onion in (2,0) and then move away so Alice can come to (2,0) to put hers? But then we still need a third onion.\n\n        Alternatively, Bob puts his onion in the pot at (2,0) and then goes to get another onion? Then Alice can also come to put her onion and then Bob comes with the third.\n\n        Revised plan:\n\n          Step 1: Bob puts his onion in the pot at (2,0) at turn 27 (as described: turn 26: D -> changes orientation to down; turn 27: I -> puts onion).\n          Then the pot has 1 onion.\n\n          Step 2: Bob then goes to get another onion. The nearest onion dispenser is at (2,4). So Bob at (2,1) after turn 27:\n\n            Turn 28: Bob moves up to (2,2) -> but (2,2) is a kitchen counter? Yes, so he cannot move up. Then he must go around? \n\n            Alternatively, he can go right to (3,1) [R] -> then up to (3,2) is kitchen counter -> blocked.\n\n            How about going left? (2,1) to (1,1) [L] -> (1,1) to (1,2) [U] -> (1,2) is walkable? Then (1,2) to (1,3) [U] -> (1,3) to (1,4) is kitchen counter? (1,4) is kitchen counter -> so (1,3) to (1,4) blocked.\n\n            Then from (1,2) he can go to (0,2) is plate dispenser -> non-walkable. So he must go to (1,1) and then (0,1) is kitchen counter? So he is stuck?\n\n          This is a problem. So maybe Bob should not use the pot at (2,0) because it's surrounded by counters.\n\n          Let's try the pot at (4,0). \n\n          Bob is at (2,1). How to get to (4,0)? \n\n            Bob: (2,1) -> (3,1) [R] -> (4,1) [R] -> then at (4,1) he can face down to interact with (4,0).\n\n          Steps for Bob:\n\n            Turn 26: R (to (3,1)) -> now at (3,1), facing right? \n            Turn 27: R (to (4,1)) -> now at (4,1), facing right.\n            Turn 28: D (to change orientation to down? But he can move down? (4,0) is a pot -> non-walkable, so he changes orientation to down without moving.\n            Turn 29: I -> put onion in the pot at (4,0).\n\n          Then the pot at (4,0) has 1 onion.\n\n          Meanwhile, Alice can go to the same pot at (4,0) to put her onion. But note: Alice is at (3,3). She can go:\n\n            (3,3) -> (4,3) [R] -> (4,3) to (4,2) is kitchen counter -> blocked.\n\n          So she must take the long route as before to (4,1). It will take her 5 moves to get to (4,1) (as above: R, R, D, D, L -> but the last L is from (5,1) to (4,1)).\n\n          So:\n\n            Turn 26: R (to (4,3))\n            Turn 27: R (to (5,3))\n            Turn 28: D (to (5,2))\n            Turn 29: D (to (5,1))\n            Turn 30: L (to (4,1)) -> now at (4,1) at turn 30.\n\n          Then at turn 31: she changes orientation to down (by trying to move down to (4,0) -> non-walkable, so changes to down) and then turn 32: I -> puts onion.\n\n          Now the pot at (4,0) has 2 onions (from Bob and Alice).\n\n          Then we need a third onion. One of them must go to an onion dispenser to get another onion and put it in.\n\n          Let Bob do that because he is already at (4,1) after turn 29. After putting the onion at turn 29, Bob is at (4,1) holding nothing. Then:\n\n            Turn 30: Bob moves to (4,2) is blocked -> kitchen counter. So he must go to (3,1) [L] or (5,1) [R]. \n\n          The onion dispensers are at (2,4) and (4,4). (4,4) is above (4,3). But (4,3) is walkable? Yes. \n\n          Bob at (4,1) after turn 29 (after interacting at turn 29) -> at turn 30, he can move up? But (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> blocked. So he must move left to (3,1) or right to (5,1).\n\n          Let him go to (5,1) [R] at turn 30.\n          Then turn 31: U to (5,2) -> but (5,2) is walkable? Yes.\n          Then turn 32: U to (5,3) [U]\n          Then turn 33: L to (4,3) [L]\n          Then turn 34: U to (4,4) [U] -> now adjacent to the onion dispenser at (4,4)? The dispenser is at (4,4) so he must stand adjacent and face it. (4,4) is above (4,3). So at (4,3) he can face up to interact.\n\n          But note: (4,4) is an onion dispenser. To grab an onion, he must be empty-handed and adjacent and facing it.\n\n          At turn 34: he is at (4,3) and can face up (by trying to move up to (4,4) -> non-walkable, so change orientation to up) at turn 34? Then turn 35: interact to get an onion.\n\n          Then he must bring it back to the pot at (4,0). So:\n\n            Turn 35: D to (4,2) is blocked -> so he changes orientation to down? Then he is at (4,3) facing down. Then he can move down? (4,2) is blocked -> so he must go around? \n\n          Alternatively, from (4,3) he can go left to (3,3) [L] then down to (3,2) is blocked -> so he must go to (3,3) then (3,4) is blocked -> so he must go down via the same route? \n\n          How about: \n            Turn 35: R (to (5,3)) \n            Turn 36: D (to (5,2))\n            Turn 37: D (to (5,1))\n            Turn 38: L (to (4,1)) -> now at (4,1) holding onion.\n\n          Then turn 39: change orientation to down (if not already) and then interact to put the onion.\n\n          This is very long.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the onion that is already on the kitchen counter at (6,1). But (6,1) is a kitchen counter and has an onion. So if a player is empty-handed and adjacent and facing (6,1), they can pick it up.\n\n        How to get there? \n\n          After putting their onions, Alice and Bob are at (4,1) (Alice at turn 30, Bob at turn 29). Then one of them can go to (6,1) to pick up the onion and bring it to the pot.\n\n        Let Alice do that because she is already at (4,1) at turn 30 (if we adjust the plan). But in the above, Alice is at (4,1) at turn 30 and then she is going to put her onion at turn 31 and 32? \n\n        Revised for Alice:\n\n          Turn 26: R (to (4,3))\n          Turn 27: R (to (5,3))\n          Turn 28: D (to (5,2))\n          Turn 29: D (to (5,1))\n          Turn 30: L (to (4,1)) -> at (4,1), holding onion.\n\n          Then she doesn't put it immediately? Because if she puts it at turn 31 and 32, then the pot has 2 onions (from Bob and Alice). Then she can go to get the onion from (6,1).\n\n          But note: Bob is also moving. Bob will have put his onion at turn 29 (at pot (4,0)) and then at turn 30, Bob can start moving to get the third onion.\n\n        Alternatively, after Alice arrives at (4,1) at turn 30, she can put her onion:\n\n          Turn 31: change orientation to down (by 'D' -> cannot move down so becomes facing down) \n          Turn 32: I -> put onion, so now the pot has 2 onions.\n\n          Then she is empty-handed at (4,1). She can go to (6,1) to pick up the onion there.\n\n          Path from (4,1) to (6,1):\n\n            (4,1) -> (5,1) [R] -> (6,1) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So she must be adjacent to (6,1). The adjacent empty tiles are (5,1) and (6,0) and (6,2) but (6,0) is kitchen counter, (6,2) is serving counter -> non-walkable. So only (5,1) is adjacent.\n\n          So Alice can go to (5,1) [R] at turn 33. Then she is at (5,1) and can face left to interact with (6,1)? But (6,1) is to the right of (5,1). So she needs to face right.\n\n          At turn 33: she moves to (5,1) and her orientation becomes right (because she moved right). Then she can interact at turn 34: I -> picks up the onion from (6,1).\n\n          Then she needs to bring it back to the pot at (4,0). So:\n\n            Turn 35: L (move left to (4,1)) -> now at (4,1), facing left.\n            Turn 36: change orientation to down (by 'D') -> because she can't move down, so now facing down.\n            Turn 37: I -> put the onion in the pot.\n\n          Then the pot will have 3 onions and start cooking at turn 37.\n\n        Then the cooking time is 5 turns, so it will be ready at turn 42.\n\n        After that, someone needs to get a plate and serve it.\n\n        But we are only planning for H turns? We don't know H. The problem says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\". We should plan until the soup is started? Or until delivered? But the reward comes at delivery.\n\n        Given the complexity, let's plan until we have put the third onion.\n\n        But note: the players must then get a plate and serve. However, we might be planning for a limited horizon.\n\n        Alternatively, we can have one player (Bob) after putting his onion, go to get a plate and then be ready to serve.\n\n        However, the plate dispenser is at (0,2). \n\n        Bob after turn 29 (put onion at (4,0)) is at (4,1) empty-handed. Then:\n\n          Turn 30: R (to (5,1))\n          Turn 31: U (to (5,2))\n          Turn 32: U (to (5,3))\n          Turn 33: L (to (4,3))\n          Turn 34: U (to (4,4)) -> but (4,4) is an onion dispenser? And we don't need an onion. We need a plate.\n\n          Alternatively, go to (0,2) for a plate:\n\n            From (4,1) to (0,2): \n              (4,1) -> (3,1) [L] -> (2,1) [L] -> (1,1) [L] -> (0,1) is kitchen counter -> blocked.\n\n          How about via the top? \n\n            (4,1) -> (4,2) blocked -> so go to (3,1) [L] at turn 30.\n            (3,1) -> (3,2) is kitchen counter -> blocked.\n            (3,1) -> (2,1) [L] at turn 31.\n            (2,1) -> (1,1) [L] at turn 32.\n            (1,1) -> (1,2) [U] at turn 33.\n            (1,2) -> (0,2) is plate dispenser -> non-walkable. So at (1,2) he can face left to interact with (0,2) (the plate dispenser) if he is empty-handed.\n\n          So at turn 34: change orientation to left (by trying to move left to (0,2) -> non-walkable, so becomes facing left) and then turn 35: I -> grabs a plate.\n\n          Then he must bring the plate to the pot when the soup is ready. But the soup won't be ready until turn 42.\n\n        This is very long and we are only at turn 35 for Bob and the soup starts cooking at turn 37.\n\n        Given the complexity and the fact that we are at turn 26, and we are only to plan for several turns, perhaps we focus on getting the soup started.\n\n        Let's choose the following plan:\n\n          - Bob goes to pot at (4,0) to put his onion.\n          - Alice goes to (4,0) to put her onion (via the long path).\n          - Then Alice goes to (6,1) to get the onion that is there and puts it in the pot.\n\n        We'll plan for Alice until she has put the third onion.\n\n        Steps for Alice (from turn 26 to turn 37):\n\n          Turn 26: R (to (4,3))\n          Turn 27: R (to (5,3))\n          Turn 28: D (to (5,2))\n          Turn 29: D (to (5,1))\n          Turn 30: L (to (4,1))   [now at (4,1) holding onion]\n          Turn 31: D (change orientation to down because move down is blocked) -> now facing down\n          Turn 32: I (put onion in pot at (4,0)) -> now empty-handed\n          Turn 33: R (to (5,1))   [facing right after move]\n          Turn 34: I (interact with (6,1) to pick up the onion) -> now holding the onion from (6,1)\n          Turn 35: L (to (4,1))   [facing left after move]\n          Turn 36: D (change orientation to down) -> facing down\n          Turn 37: I (put onion in pot) -> now the pot has 3 onions and starts cooking.\n\n        Steps for Bob (optional, but to coordinate):\n\n          Turn 26: R (move to (3,1), facing right)\n          Turn 27: R (move to (4,1), facing right)\n          Turn 28: D (change orientation to down) [because move down to (4,0) is blocked]\n          Turn 29: I (put onion in pot at (4,0)) -> now empty-handed\n          Then Bob can either go to get a plate or help with the third onion? But we are using the onion at (6,1) so he doesn't need to.\n\n          Since we want to maximize, after turn 29, Bob can go to get a plate so that when the soup is ready, he can serve it.\n\n          Path for Bob to plate dispenser at (0,2):\n\n            Turn 30: L (move to (3,1), facing left)\n            Turn 31: L (move to (2,1), facing left)\n            Turn 32: L (move to (1,1), facing left)\n            Turn 33: U (move to (1,2), facing up)\n            Turn 34: L (change orientation to left) [because (0,2) is not walkable] -> now facing left\n            Turn 35: I (grab plate from dispenser at (0,2)) -> now holding a plate.\n\n          Then he must wait until the soup is ready at turn 42. He can then go to the pot at (4,0) to serve the soup? But to serve, he needs to be at (4,1) facing down and interact. But he is at (1,2) holding a plate.\n\n          The path from (1,2) to (4,1) is:\n\n            (1,2) -> (1,1) [D] -> (2,1) [R] -> (3,1) [R] -> (4,1) [R]\n\n          So 4 moves. He can start moving at turn 36.\n\n          Turn 36: D (to (1,1))\n          Turn 37: R (to (2,1))\n          Turn 38: R (to (3,1))\n          Turn 39: R (to (4,1)) -> now at (4,1) holding a plate.\n\n          Then at turn 42, the soup is ready. He can:\n\n            Turn 42: D (change to facing down) \n            Turn 43: I -> serve the soup (which requires: holding a plate and the pot has cooked soup) -> he will pick up the soup and then deliver it? Actually, the interact at the pot when holding a plate and the soup is cooked: it puts the soup on the plate. Then he must deliver it to the serving counter.\n\n          But then he is holding the soup on a plate. He must go to the serving counter at (6,2). \n\n          From (4,1) to (6,2):\n\n            (4,1) -> (5,1) [R] \n            (5,1) -> (5,2) [U] -> (5,2) is walkable? Yes.\n            (5,2) -> (6,2) is serving counter -> non-walkable. So he must be adjacent to (6,2). The adjacent tiles are (5,2) and (6,1) and (6,3). (6,1) is kitchen counter (non-walkable), (6,3) is kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So only (5,2) is adjacent.\n\n          So at (5,2) he can face right to interact with (6,2). \n\n          Steps:\n\n            Turn 44: R (to (5,1))? No, he is at (4,1) at turn 39. We are at turn 39, and the soup is ready at turn 42. He can wait until turn 42 to interact with the pot.\n\n            After serving the soup into the plate at turn 43, he is at (4,1) holding the soup. Then:\n\n              Turn 44: R (to (5,1)) \n              Turn 45: U (to (5,2))\n              Turn 46: R (change orientation to right) [because moving right to (6,2) is blocked] -> becomes facing right.\n              Turn 47: I -> deliver the soup.\n\n          This is beyond our current planning horizon.\n\n        Given the problem, we are to plan for Alice for the next several turns. We can set H=12 (from turn 26 to turn 37) to cover until she puts the third onion.\n\n        So for Alice, from turn 26 to turn 37 (12 turns):\n\n          Turn 26: R\n          Turn 27: R\n          Turn 28: D\n          Turn 29: D\n          Turn 30: L\n          Turn 31: D   (change orientation to down)\n          Turn 32: I   (put onion in pot)\n          Turn 33: R\n          Turn 34: I   (pick up onion from (6,1))\n          Turn 35: L\n          Turn 36: D   (change orientation to down)\n          Turn 37: I   (put onion in pot)\n\n        But note: at turn 34, when Alice is at (5,1) and facing right (from the move R at turn 33), she can interact with (6,1) which is to her right? Yes, because (6,1) is adjacent to (5,1) and she is facing right (because she moved right to (5,1) at turn 33 and then at turn 34 she does an interact without moving, so she is still facing right). So no need to change orientation.\n\n        Similarly, after turn 35: she moves left to (4,1) and is facing left. Then at turn 36, she does a 'D' to change orientation to down (because she cannot move down). Then at turn 37, she interacts to put the onion.\n\n        This plan works.\n\n        However, we must check for conflicts with Bob. Bob will be moving as well. In the same timeframe:\n\n          Bob:\n            Turn 26: R -> to (3,1)\n            Turn 27: R -> to (4,1) -> but Alice is at (5,1) at turn 29 and 30? And then at turn 30 Alice is moving to (4,1) at the same time that Bob might be at (4,1)? \n\n          At turn 26: \n            Alice: (3,3) -> moves R to (4,3)\n            Bob: (2,1) -> moves R to (3,1)\n\n          Turn 27:\n            Alice: (4,3) -> moves R to (5,3)\n            Bob: (3,1) -> moves R to (4,1)\n\n          Turn 28:\n            Alice: (5,3) -> moves D to (5,2)\n            Bob: (4,1) -> does D (which is change orientation to down, no move)\n\n          Turn 29:\n            Alice: (5,2) -> moves D to (5,1)\n            Bob: (4,1) -> does I (interact to put onion) -> remains at (4,1)\n\n          Turn 30:\n            Alice: (5,1) -> moves L to (4,1) -> but Bob is at (4,1) at turn 29 and remains there at turn 30? So they would collide.\n\n        Therefore, we need to adjust.\n\n        How to avoid collision at (4,1) at turn 30?\n\n          Bob, after putting the onion at turn 29, can move away at turn 30. For example, Bob can move left to (3,1) at turn 30.\n\n          Then at turn 30, Alice can move to (4,1) without collision.\n\n        So we add for Bob:\n\n          Turn 30: L (move to (3,1))\n\n        Then Alice at turn 30: L to (4,1) is clear.\n\n        Then Bob can continue to get the plate.\n\n        So the full plan for Alice (for 12 turns) and we also specify Bob's actions for the first few turns to avoid collision.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". We can optionally include Bob.\n\n        Let me write the actions for Alice for turns 26 to 37, and for Bob for turns 26 to 30 (to avoid collision and to put his onion).\n\n        Alice's actions:\n\n          Turn 26: R\n          Turn 27: R\n          Turn 28: D\n          Turn 29: D\n          Turn 30: L\n          Turn 31: D   (change orientation to down)\n          Turn 32: I   (put onion in pot at (4,0))\n          Turn 33: R   (move to (5,1))\n          Turn 34: I   (pick up onion from (6,1))\n          Turn 35: L   (move to (4,1))\n          Turn 36: D   (change orientation to down)\n          Turn 37: I   (put onion in pot)\n\n        Bob's actions (optional, to coordinate):\n\n          Turn 26: R   (move to (3,1))\n          Turn 27: R   (move to (4,1))\n          Turn 28: D   (change orientation to down)\n          Turn 29: I   (put onion in pot at (4,0))\n          Turn 30: L   (move to (3,1))   [to get out of Alice's way]\n\n        Then Bob can proceed to get the plate on his own.\n\n        This avoids the collision.\n\n        Therefore, we output the actions for Alice.\n\n        Note: We assume that the kitchen counter at (6,1) still has the onion at turn 34. Since no one else is taking it, it should be there.\n\n        Let's write the answer.\n\n        We are at turn 26, so we start from turn 26.\n\n        Answer format:\n\n          Turn 26: R\n          Turn 27: R\n          Turn 28: D\n          Turn 29: D\n          Turn 30: L\n          Turn 31: D\n          Turn 32: I\n          Turn 33: R\n          Turn 34: I\n          Turn 35: L\n          Turn 36: D\n          Turn 37: I\n\n        We plan for 12 turns (up to turn 37).\n\n        If we are to plan for a shorter horizon, we might adjust, but the problem says \"over next several turns\", so 12 is several.\n\n        This plan should result in the soup being started at turn 37.\n\n        We don't include Bob in the answer because the problem says \"for Alice\", but we showed the coordination.\n\n        We output only Alice's actions.\n\n        However, note that at turn 31, Alice does a 'D' to change orientation. This is because she is at (4,1) and wants to face down to interact with the pot at (4,0). She cannot move down (because (4,0) is non-walkable), so the 'D' action changes her orientation to down without moving.\n\n        Similarly for turn 36.\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        Let's output.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice and Bob should collaborate to prepare and deliver a 3-onion soup, which yields a reward of 20. The plan involves both players depositing their held onions into the pot at (4,0), then Alice retrieving an additional onion from the kitchen counter at (6,1) to complete the recipe. The soup will cook for 5 turns once started, and future actions (beyond the planned horizon) will involve serving it. Alice's actions are optimized to avoid collisions with Bob and navigate efficiently.\n\n### Alice's Action Plan (Turns 26–37):\n- **Turn 26: R**  \n  Move right to (4,3), facing right.  \n  *(Avoids Bob moving to (3,1); positions for path to pot area.)*\n\n- **Turn 27: R**  \n  Move right to (5,3), facing right.  \n  *(Continues path around kitchen counters.)*\n\n- **Turn 28: D**  \n  Move down to (5,2), facing down.  \n  *(Navigates toward (5,1) to access the pot area.)*\n\n- **Turn 29: D**  \n  Move down to (5,1), facing down.  \n  *(Reaches adjacency to pot at (4,0) via (4,1).)*\n\n- **Turn 30: L**  \n  Move left to (4,1), facing left.  \n  *(Bob moves left to (3,1) simultaneously, avoiding collision.)*\n\n- **Turn 31: D**  \n  Change orientation to down (no move).  \n  *(Faces pot at (4,0) for interaction.)*\n\n- **Turn 32: I**  \n  Interact to deposit onion into pot at (4,0).  \n  *(Pot now contains 2 onions; Alice is empty-handed.)*\n\n- **Turn 33: R**  \n  Move right to (5,1), facing right.  \n  *(Positions to access onion at (6,1).)*\n\n- **Turn 34: I**  \n  Interact to pick up onion from kitchen counter at (6,1).  \n  *(Alice now holds an onion; counter is emptied.)*\n\n- **Turn 35: L**  \n  Move left to (4,1), facing left.  \n  *(Returns to pot adjacency.)*\n\n- **Turn 36: D**  \n  Change orientation to down (no move).  \n  *(Faces pot for final interaction.)*\n\n- **Turn 37: I**  \n  Interact to deposit onion into pot at (4,0).  \n  *(Pot now has 3 onions; cooking starts and completes in 5 turns.)*\n\n### Coordination Notes:\n- **Bob's Actions (Turns 26–30 for collision avoidance):**  \n  - Turn 26: R (to (3,1))  \n  - Turn 27: R (to (4,1))  \n  - Turn 28: D (face down toward pot)  \n  - Turn 29: I (deposit onion into pot at (4,0))  \n  - Turn 30: L (move to (3,1) to clear (4,1) for Alice).  \n  Bob then proceeds independently to fetch a plate from (0,2) for future serving.\n\n- **Outcome:**  \n  - By turn 37, the pot at (4,0) contains 3 onions and starts cooking (ready at turn 42).  \n  - Total reward of 20 is achievable if the soup is served afterward (outside this horizon).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn 26: R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 27: R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 28: D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 29: D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 30: L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 31: D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 32: I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 33: R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 34: I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 35: L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 36: D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 37: I}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 29. We need to plan for Alice (and optionally Bob) for the next several turns (H turns). Let's set H to a reasonable horizon, say 10 turns, to complete a soup delivery.\n\nGoal: Maximize total reward. The only recipe is 3 onions for 20 points (cooking time 5 turns).\n\nCurrent state:\n- Alice: at (4,3), facing right (R), holding one onion.\n- Bob: at (1,1), facing left (L), holding nothing.\n\nKitchen Counters with items:\n- (6,1): onion\n- (2,2): onion\n\nPots: both empty (at (2,0) and (4,0))\n\nWe need to make a soup with 3 onions and deliver it. Since we have two onions already on counters (at (6,1) and (2,2)) and Alice is holding one, we have 3 onions available. But note: the pots are at (2,0) and (4,0). We must put the onions into a pot, wait 5 turns, then serve with a plate and deliver.\n\nSteps:\n1. Get the onions into a pot. We have one onion in hand (Alice). We need two more.\n2. We can use the onions on the counters. However, note the positions.\n\nLet's plan:\n\nOption 1: Use the pot at (4,0) because it is closer to Alice.\n\nAlice is at (4,3). She is holding an onion. She can move down to (4,2) (which is a kitchen counter? Let's check the tile types: (4,2) is a kitchen counter, but it's empty? The non-empty counters are only (6,1) and (2,2). So (4,2) is empty and walkable? Actually, kitchen counters are walkable and can be used to place/pick up items. But (4,2) is a kitchen counter and currently empty? The list of non-empty counters only lists (6,1) and (2,2), so (4,2) is empty.\n\nBut note: the pots are at (2,0) and (4,0). Alice is at (4,3). To get to (4,0) from (4,3), she must go down three times: (4,3) -> (4,2) -> (4,1) -> (4,0). However, (4,1) is not listed as a non-empty tile? The grid has:\n- Kitchen Counters: (0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)\n- Onion Dispensers: (2,4), (4,4)\n- Plate Dispenser: (0,2)\n- Pot: (2,0), (4,0)\n- Serving Counter: (6,2)\n\nSo (4,1) is not listed, meaning it is an empty tile? Actually, the tile types list only non-empty tiles? Actually, the tile types are defined by their function. The grid has both empty and non-empty. The non-empty tiles are the ones listed (counters, dispensers, pots, serving counter). So (4,1) is an empty tile (walkable).\n\nSo Alice can move down to (4,2) (which is a kitchen counter, but she can walk on it because it's a counter? Actually, the rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" But note: non-empty tiles are those that have an object (like a dispenser, pot, counter with item, etc.). However, the tile types are fixed. The kitchen counter is a tile type that is walkable? The rules say: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and it is listed as a tile type. The movement rule: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are those that are not empty? But the tile types include empty tile as walkable. The kitchen counter is a tile that can be walked on? Yes, because it's a temporary storage and players can stand on it to interact with adjacent tiles? Actually, the interaction rule says: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\nSo, for a kitchen counter, if it has an item, then it is non-empty? But the tile itself is a counter. The rule says: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" meaning that when an item is placed on it, it becomes non-empty? And when empty, it's just a walkable tile? Actually, the movement constraint: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" Here, non-empty tiles are those that are not of type \"Empty Tile\". But the dispenser, pot, serving counter, and kitchen counter are non-empty tiles? Or is the kitchen counter walkable?\n\nLooking at the rules: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and then the others are non-empty. So players cannot walk onto a dispenser, pot, serving counter, or kitchen counter? But that doesn't make sense because the kitchen counter is for temporary storage and must be accessible. Also, the interaction rule requires the player to be on an adjacent empty tile.\n\nRe-read: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\nThis implies that the player must be on an empty tile to interact. Therefore, the kitchen counter is a non-empty tile? But then how do you place an item on it? You must stand next to it? Similarly, you cannot walk on it.\n\nSo the grid has:\n- Empty tiles: walkable, and you can stand on them.\n- Non-empty tiles: you cannot walk on them, and you must be adjacent to them to interact.\n\nTherefore, Alice at (4,3) is on an empty tile? Because (4,3) is not listed in the non-empty tiles? The non-empty tiles are the ones listed in the \"Tile Types\" section. The list of kitchen counters, dispensers, etc. are the non-empty tiles. So (4,3) is not listed, so it's an empty tile? But (4,3) is not in the kitchen counter list? The kitchen counters are at specific coordinates. So (4,3) is not a kitchen counter? Then it must be an empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) is listed as a kitchen counter -> non-empty tile. So Alice cannot walk onto (4,2). She must go around? But she is at (4,3) and wants to go to (4,0). The path is blocked by (4,2) which is a kitchen counter? Then she must go around.\n\nAlternative path: from (4,3) move left to (3,3) -> which is a kitchen counter? (3,3) is not listed? The kitchen counters are at (0,3) and (6,3) and (3,2) and (4,2). (3,3) is not listed -> empty tile? Then she can move left to (3,3). Then from (3,3) she can move down to (3,2) -> but (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, so she cannot step on it. Then she must go to (3,1)? (3,1) is not listed -> empty? Then (3,0) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty. So she can stand at (3,1) and then interact with the pot at (4,0)? But (4,0) is adjacent to (3,1)? (3,1) is adjacent to (3,0) (east? no, (3,0) is at (3,0), (3,1) is north of (3,0)) and (4,1) (east of (3,1)) and (3,2) (north, but non-empty) and (2,1) (west). (4,0) is at (4,0) and (3,1) is not adjacent to (4,0) (they are diagonal). Adjacent means sharing an edge: (3,1) is adjacent to (3,0) (south), (4,1) (east), (2,1) (west), (3,2) (north). So (3,1) is not adjacent to (4,0). Therefore, to interact with the pot at (4,0), she must be at (4,1) (north of the pot) or (3,0) (west) or (5,0) (east) but (5,0) is a kitchen counter? (5,0) is in the kitchen counter list -> non-empty. Similarly, (3,0) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty. So the only adjacent empty tile to (4,0) is (4,1) (north) and (4,-1) but that doesn't exist. Also, (5,0) is non-empty. So the only adjacent tile is (4,1). Therefore, to use the pot at (4,0), Alice must stand at (4,1) and face down (south) to interact.\n\nSimilarly, for the pot at (2,0): adjacent empty tiles are (2,1) and (1,0) (but (1,0) is kitchen counter -> non-empty) and (3,0) (non-empty) and (2,-1) doesn't exist. So only (2,1) is adjacent.\n\nTherefore, to use the pot at (4,0), Alice must get to (4,1). But how? From (4,3) to (4,1): \n- (4,3) -> (4,2) is blocked (kitchen counter). \n- So go left to (3,3) -> which is empty? Then down to (3,2) -> blocked (kitchen counter). \n- Then left to (2,3)? (2,3) is not listed -> empty? Then down to (2,2) -> blocked (kitchen counter, and it has an onion). \n- Then down to (2,1) -> empty? Then she can interact with the pot at (2,0) from (2,1) by facing down.\n\nAlternatively, from (3,3) she can go down to (3,1) (if (3,1) is empty) and then right to (4,1) (if (4,1) is empty). Then face down to interact with the pot at (4,0).\n\nBut (3,3) to (3,2) is blocked, so she must go left or right? Actually, from (3,3) she can only go left to (2,3) or right to (4,3) (but (4,3) is where she started) or down to (3,2) is blocked. So she must go left to (2,3). Then from (2,3) she can go down to (2,2) -> blocked? Then she must go down to (2,1) (if (2,1) is empty). Then she can use the pot at (2,0) from (2,1).\n\nSo let's check the path for Alice to the pot at (2,0):\n- Step 1: from (4,3) move left to (3,3) [empty] -> action L.\n- Step 2: from (3,3) move left to (2,3) [empty] -> action L.\n- Step 3: from (2,3) move down to (2,2) -> but (2,2) is a kitchen counter (non-empty) -> cannot walk. So she must move down to (2,1) directly? But (2,3) to (2,2) is blocked, so she can only move to (1,3) or (3,3) or (2,4) but (2,4) is an onion dispenser? (2,4) is non-empty. So she is stuck? \n\nWait, (2,3) is adjacent to (1,3) and (3,3) and (2,4) and (2,2). But (2,2) is non-empty (kitchen counter with onion) and (2,4) is non-empty (onion dispenser). So the only moves from (2,3) are left to (1,3) and right to (3,3). (1,3) is a kitchen counter? (1,3) is not listed? The kitchen counters are at (0,3) and (6,3) and others. (1,3) is not listed -> empty? Then she can go to (1,3). Then from (1,3) she can go down to (1,2) -> is (1,2) empty? (1,2) is not listed -> empty? Then to (1,1) -> but Bob is at (1,1). They cannot be on the same tile. So if Bob is at (1,1), then Alice cannot go to (1,1). So she must avoid (1,1). Alternatively, from (1,3) she can go down to (1,2) and then right to (2,2) -> blocked? Or down to (1,1) -> blocked by Bob. So she cannot use the pot at (2,0) via (2,1) because she cannot get to (2,1) from (2,3) because (2,2) is blocking.\n\nTherefore, the only option is to use the pot at (4,0) via (4,1). How to get to (4,1)? \nFrom (4,3): \n- Move left to (3,3) -> empty, action L.\n- Then move down to (3,2) -> blocked? (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, cannot walk. \n- Then move down to (3,1) -> but she is at (3,3), so move down to (3,2) is blocked. \nAlternative: from (3,3) move left to (2,3) -> empty, then down? blocked by (2,2). \nFrom (4,3) move right to (5,3)? (5,3) is not listed -> empty? Then down to (5,2)? (5,2) is not listed -> empty? Then down to (5,1)? (5,1) not listed -> empty? Then left to (4,1) -> empty? Then she can face down to interact with the pot at (4,0).\n\nSo path for Alice:\nTurn 29: move right (R) to (5,3)\nTurn 30: move down (D) to (5,2)\nTurn 31: move down (D) to (5,1)\nTurn 32: move left (L) to (4,1)\nTurn 33: change orientation to down (D) to face the pot at (4,0) [but note: changing orientation does not move, so she must face down to interact with the pot below her at (4,0). But the rule: she must be adjacent and facing it. (4,1) is adjacent to (4,0) (south). So facing down (south) then interact.\nBut she is holding an onion, so she can add it to the pot.\n\nBut note: the pot is empty. Adding one onion. Then we need two more onions.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob is at (1,1) holding nothing. We can have Bob help by bringing the onions from the counters.\n\nThere are two onions: one at (6,1) and one at (2,2). We need to get them to the pot at (4,0).\n\nBut note: the onion at (2,2) is on a kitchen counter. Bob is at (1,1). He can pick up the onion at (2,2) if he goes to (2,1) or (1,2) or (3,2) or (2,3) and faces the counter. But (2,2) is a kitchen counter. The adjacent empty tiles are: (2,1), (1,2), (3,2) [but (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty? Actually, (3,2) is a kitchen counter, so it's non-empty and Bob cannot stand on it. Similarly, (1,2) and (2,1) are empty? (1,2) is not listed -> empty. (2,1) is not listed -> empty.\n\nSo Bob can go to (1,2) and face right (east) to interact with (2,2)? Or to (2,1) and face up (north) to interact with (2,2).\n\nSimilarly, the onion at (6,1) is on a kitchen counter. Adjacent empty tiles: (6,0) is kitchen counter -> non-empty, (5,1) -> empty? (5,1) is not listed -> empty, (6,2) is serving counter -> non-empty, (7,1) doesn't exist. So only (5,1) is adjacent. So to get the onion at (6,1), one must be at (5,1) and face east.\n\nBut note: Alice is going to be at (5,1) on turn 31? We have to coordinate.\n\nPlan for Bob:\n\nBob is at (1,1). He can pick up the onion at (2,2) by:\n- Move right to (2,1) -> empty, action R. Then face up (U) to interact with (2,2) and pick up the onion.\n\nThen he can carry the onion to the pot at (4,0). But how? From (2,1) to (4,0): \n- He must go to (3,1) then (4,1). But (3,1) is empty? Then (4,1) is empty. But Alice will be at (4,1) on turn 32. So they might collide.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can go to the other onion at (6,1) but it's farther.\n\nBetter: Bob picks up the onion at (2,2) and then goes to the pot at (2,0) because it's closer? But we are using the pot at (4,0). Or we can use the pot at (2,0)? But then we need to get the other onions there.\n\nBut we have three onions: one with Alice (to be put in pot at (4,0)), one at (2,2) (to be picked by Bob), and one at (6,1). We can put two onions in one pot and the third in the same pot? We need one pot with three onions.\n\nWe can use the pot at (4,0) for all three. So Bob should bring his onion to (4,0). But then we also need the onion at (6,1). Who will get that? We can have Alice, after putting her onion, go get the onion from (6,1) and bring it? Or Bob can get both? But Bob can only carry one at a time.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Alice put her onion in the pot at (4,0) and then go to (6,1) to get that onion and bring it back. Meanwhile, Bob picks up the onion at (2,2) and puts it in the pot.\n\nBut Bob is at (1,1). He can go to (2,1) and pick the onion at (2,2) by facing up. Then he can go to (3,1) and then (4,1). Then face down to put the onion in the pot at (4,0). But note: when he is at (4,1), he is adjacent to the pot (south) and can interact to add the onion.\n\nBut Alice is also going to (4,1) at turn 32. We must avoid conflict.\n\nTimeline:\n\nTurn 29:\n- Alice: R (to (5,3))\n- Bob: let's plan for Bob to start moving to (2,1) and then pick up the onion at (2,2)\n\nBob's actions:\nTurn 29: move right to (2,1) [from (1,1) to (2,1): right] -> action R.\n\nTurn 30: Bob is at (2,1). He needs to face up to interact with (2,2). So change orientation to up (U). Then interact? But the action is per turn: one action per turn. So he must do:\n- Turn 30: change orientation to up (U) [now facing (2,2)]\n- Turn 31: interact (I) to pick up the onion from (2,2). Now Bob is holding an onion.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice:\nTurn 29: R -> (5,3)\nTurn 30: D -> (5,2)\nTurn 31: D -> (5,1)\n\nNow Bob at (2,1) holding onion, facing up. He needs to go to (4,1) to put the onion in the pot at (4,0). Path: from (2,1) move right to (3,1) -> empty? Then to (4,1). But (4,1) is where Alice will be? On turn 32, Alice moves to (4,1). But on turn 31, Alice is at (5,1). And Bob is at (2,1). \n\nTurn 31: Bob can move right to (3,1) -> action R.\nTurn 32: Bob moves right to (4,1) -> but Alice is moving to (4,1) at the same turn? They cannot be on the same tile. So conflict.\n\nTo avoid, we can have Bob go to (3,1) on turn 31, then on turn 32, Alice is moving to (4,1) and Bob to (4,1) at the same time -> collision. So we must have one of them wait.\n\nAlternatively, Alice can wait at (5,1) for one turn? Then Bob can go to (4,1) first.\n\nRevised:\n\nTurn 31:\n- Alice: at (5,1). Instead of moving to (4,1) on turn 32, she can wait one turn? Or do something else.\n\nBut note: on turn 32, Alice is scheduled to move left to (4,1). But if Bob moves to (4,1) on turn 32, then they both try to occupy (4,1) -> not allowed.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 32: \n- Alice: stay (S) at (5,1) to avoid conflict.\n- Bob: move to (4,1) from (3,1) [action R? Actually, from (3,1) to (4,1) is right? But his orientation? He was facing up at (2,1) and then moved right to (3,1) so now facing right? Then at (3,1) he can move right to (4,1) without changing orientation? But he doesn't need to face a direction to move, only for interact. So he can move to (4,1) on turn 32.\n\nThen on turn 32, Bob is at (4,1) holding an onion. He needs to face down to interact with the pot at (4,0). So on turn 33: Bob changes orientation to down (D) and then on turn 34: interact (I) to put the onion in the pot.\n\nBut Alice is still at (5,1) on turn 32. Then on turn 33, Alice can move left to (4,1) but Bob is there? Bob is at (4,1) until at least turn 34. So Alice cannot move to (4,1) until Bob leaves.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nAlternative plan: use both pots? But we only need one soup. We can put two onions in one pot and one in the other, but then we have two incomplete pots. Not useful.\n\nBetter: have Bob bring the onion to the pot at (2,0) instead? Then we have two pots: one with one onion (from Alice at (4,0)) and one with one onion (from Bob at (2,0)) and we need to combine? But we cannot move items between pots. So we must put all three in one pot.\n\nSo we must use one pot. Let's use the pot at (4,0). \n\nAfter Alice puts her onion in the pot at (4,0) (on turn 33: she is at (4,1) on turn 32? Let me reassign Alice's actions:\n\nInstead of going to (5,1) and then left to (4,1), she can go a different route? But the only way is through (5,1) to (4,1).\n\nWe can have Alice wait at (5,1) until Bob has put his onion and left (4,1). But Bob will be at (4,1) until turn 34 (if he puts on turn 34). Then Alice can move to (4,1) on turn 34.\n\nBut then Alice's schedule:\n\nTurn 29: R to (5,3)\nTurn 30: D to (5,2)\nTurn 31: D to (5,1)\nTurn 32: S (stay) to let Bob use (4,1)\nTurn 33: S? Because Bob is at (4,1) on turn 33 and will interact on turn 34? On turn 33, Bob is at (4,1) and changes orientation to down. Then on turn 34, he interacts. So on turn 33, Alice can still stay? Then on turn 34, Bob interacts and then moves away? But he doesn't need to move away immediately. But Alice needs to use (4,1) to put her onion? But she is holding an onion and wants to put it in the pot. But the pot already has one onion (from Alice on turn 33? No, let's see.\n\nActually, Alice hasn't put her onion yet. She is at (5,1) holding an onion. She needs to be at (4,1) to put it in the pot.\n\nSo after Bob has put his onion (on turn 34), he can move away on turn 35, and then Alice can move to (4,1) on turn 35 and then face down and interact on turn 36.\n\nBut this is taking too many turns. And we also need the third onion.\n\nMoreover, the pot will have two onions after Bob's addition, then Alice adds the third, which starts the cooking (5 turns).\n\nBut we have one more onion at (6,1). We need to get that into the pot as well? No, the pot only holds up to three. We are adding three: Alice's one, Bob's one, and then we need the third. But we have only two so far? We have Alice's onion and Bob's onion, that's two. We need a third. The third is at (6,1) or on the counter at (6,1). And there's another onion at (2,2) but Bob picked that up and put it in the pot. So we have two onions in the pot after Bob's action. Then we need the third.\n\nSo after Bob puts the onion, the pot has two. Then Alice puts hers to make three.\n\nBut Alice is holding one onion, which is the third.\n\nSo after Alice puts hers, the pot has three and starts cooking.\n\nThen we need to wait 5 turns, then serve with a plate and deliver.\n\nBut first, let's get the actions for turns 29-34:\n\nTurn 29:\n- Alice: R (to 5,3)\n- Bob: R (to 2,1)\n\nTurn 30:\n- Alice: D (to 5,2)\n- Bob: U (change orientation to up to face (2,2))\n\nTurn 31:\n- Alice: D (to 5,1)\n- Bob: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\n\nTurn 32:\n- Alice: S (stay at 5,1) to avoid collision with Bob moving to (4,1)\n- Bob: R (move to 3,1)\n\nTurn 33:\n- Alice: S (still at 5,1) because Bob is at (4,1) and will change orientation.\n- Bob: R (move to 4,1)\n\nTurn 34:\n- Alice: S (still waiting) because Bob is interacting at (4,1)\n- Bob: D (change orientation to down to face the pot)\n\nTurn 35:\n- Alice: S? Or move? Bob is at (4,1) and will interact.\n- Bob: I (put onion in pot at (4,0)) -> now the pot has one onion? Wait, no: initially empty, then Alice hasn't put any yet. This is the first onion? No, Alice hasn't put any. So after Bob, the pot has one onion.\n\nBut we want to put three. Alice is holding the second onion? And we need a third.\n\nMistake: Alice is holding an onion and hasn't put it. Bob is bringing the second onion? But there is a third onion at (6,1). So after Bob puts one, the pot has one. Then Alice puts hers -> two. Then we need the third.\n\nSo after turn 35, the pot has two onions. We need the third.\n\nWho gets the third? The onion at (6,1) is on the counter. Bob is now free (holding nothing) at (4,1). He can go get the onion at (6,1). But (6,1) is adjacent to (5,1) and Alice is at (5,1). So they might conflict again.\n\nAlternatively, Alice, after putting her onion, can go get the onion at (6,1). But she would be holding an onion and then put it? But she is already at (4,1) and can put her onion first.\n\nLet's continue:\n\nTurn 35:\n- Bob: I (put onion in pot at (4,0)) -> pot now has one onion.\n- Alice: move left to (4,1)? But Bob is at (4,1) until turn 35? On turn 35, Bob is interacting, so he remains at (4,1). Then after that, he can move away.\n\nTurn 36:\n- Bob: move away, say to (3,1) (left) to free (4,1) for Alice.\n- Alice: move left to (4,1) from (5,1) -> action L.\n\nBut on turn 36, Alice moves to (4,1) and Bob moves to (3,1). No conflict.\n\nTurn 37:\n- Alice: change orientation to down (D) to face the pot.\n- Bob: can start moving to get the third onion.\n\nTurn 38:\n- Alice: I (put her onion in the pot) -> now the pot has two onions (one from Bob, one from Alice). We need one more.\n- Bob: move from (3,1) to (4,1) -> but Alice is at (4,1)? Alice is at (4,1) until at least turn 38. So Bob cannot move to (4,1).\n\nBob's path to (6,1): from (3,1) he can move right to (4,1) but it's occupied. He can move up to (3,2) -> blocked (kitchen counter). Or down to (3,0) -> blocked (kitchen counter). Or right to (4,1) -> occupied. Or left to (2,1). Then to (2,0) is pot, not helpful. Then to (1,1) -> empty? Then to (1,0) -> kitchen counter, non-empty. Then he must go up to (1,2) -> empty, then right to (2,2) -> blocked, then to (3,2) blocked, then to (4,2) blocked, then to (5,2) -> empty, then to (5,1) -> but Alice is at (4,1) and (5,1) is empty? Then to (6,1) is non-empty, so he must go to (5,1) and face east to interact with (6,1).\n\nSo it's a long path.\n\nAlternatively, after turn 36, Bob is at (3,1). He can move up? But blocked. So only options are left to (2,1) or right to (4,1) (occupied). So he must go left to (2,1) on turn 36.\n\nThen on turn 37, from (2,1) move up? But (2,2) is blocked, so move left to (1,1) -> empty.\nTurn 38: from (1,1) move up to (1,2) -> empty.\nTurn 39: from (1,2) move right to (2,2) -> blocked? Cannot. So move up to (1,3) -> empty.\nTurn 40: from (1,3) move right to (2,3) -> empty.\nTurn 41: from (2,3) move down to (2,2) -> blocked. So move right to (3,3) -> empty.\nTurn 42: from (3,3) move right to (4,3) -> empty.\nTurn 43: move down to (4,2) -> blocked. So move right to (5,3) -> empty.\nTurn 44: move down to (5,2) -> empty.\nTurn 45: move down to (5,1) -> empty.\nTurn 46: face east (R) to face (6,1).\nTurn 47: interact to pick up the onion from (6,1).\n\nThen he must bring it back to the pot. This is too long.\n\nInstead, after the pot has two onions (after Alice puts hers on turn 38), then Alice can go get the third onion from (6,1) and put it in the pot.\n\nAlice after turn 38: she is at (4,1) and has just put her onion, so now holding nothing. The pot has two onions. She can go to (6,1) to get the onion and bring it back.\n\nPath from (4,1) to (6,1): \n- Move right to (5,1) -> empty.\n- Then move right to (6,1) -> but (6,1) is a kitchen counter (non-empty) -> cannot walk. She must be at (5,1) and face east to interact with (6,1) to pick up the onion.\n\nThen she can bring it back to (4,1) and put it in the pot.\n\nSo:\n\nAfter turn 38 (Alice just put her onion, so holding nothing):\nTurn 39: Alice move right to (5,1) -> action R.\nTurn 40: Alice change orientation to east (R) to face (6,1) if not already facing? Currently, after move right to (5,1), she might be facing east? The move action also changes orientation. The rules: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position *and* orientation.\" So if she moves right to (5,1), she is now at (5,1) facing east. So she is facing (6,1) which is east of her.\n\nTurn 40: interact (I) to pick up the onion from (6,1). Now she is holding an onion.\n\nTurn 41: move left to (4,1) -> action L (which changes orientation to west? But she needs to face down to interact with the pot).\n\nTurn 42: change orientation to down (D) to face the pot.\nTurn 43: interact (I) to put the onion in the pot. Now the pot has three onions and cooking starts.\n\nCooking time: 5 turns. So after turn 43, the soup will be ready at turn 48.\n\nThen we need to serve it: get a plate, put the soup on a plate, and deliver.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2). We can have Bob do that since he is free.\n\nBob after turn 36: he is at (3,1) -> moved to (3,1) on turn 36. Then on turn 37 he can start moving to get a plate.\n\nPath for Bob to plate dispenser at (0,2):\n- From (3,1) to (0,2): \n  - Turn 37: move left to (2,1) -> action L.\n  - Turn 38: move left to (1,1) -> L.\n  - Turn 39: move up to (1,2) -> U.\n  - Turn 40: move left to (0,2) -> but (0,2) is the plate dispenser -> non-empty, cannot walk. So he must stand adjacent. The adjacent tiles to (0,2): (0,1) is kitchen counter -> non-empty, (0,3) kitchen counter -> non-empty, (1,2) is empty. So he can be at (1,2) and face west to interact with (0,2).\n\nSo:\nTurn 40: Bob is at (1,2) (after move left from (1,1) on turn 39). Then turn 40: change orientation to west (L) to face (0,2).\nTurn 41: interact (I) to get a plate.\n\nThen he needs to bring the plate to the pot at (4,0). Path: from (1,2) to (4,0):\n- Turn 42: move right to (2,2) -> blocked, so move down to (1,1) -> D.\n- Turn 43: move right to (2,1) -> R.\n- Turn 44: move right to (3,1) -> R.\n- Turn 45: move right to (4,1) -> R.\n- Turn 46: change orientation to down (D) to face the pot.\n- Turn 47: interact (I) to serve the soup (if it's cooked and he is holding a plate and the pot has cooked soup).\n\nBut the soup will be ready at turn 48 (if started cooking at turn 43). So on turn 47, the soup is not ready yet. He must wait.\n\nCooking started at turn 43 (when the third onion was put). So ready at turn 43 + 5 = turn 48.\n\nSo on turn 48, the soup is ready.\n\nBob can be at (4,1) on turn 47, then on turn 48 he can interact to serve the soup? But he needs to hold a plate and interact with the pot to serve the soup (which means putting the plate with the soup into his hand? Then he can deliver it.\n\nBut when he interacts with the pot while holding a plate and the soup is cooked, he serves the soup into the plate. Then he is holding the soup on a plate. Then he needs to deliver it to the serving counter at (6,2).\n\nServing counter at (6,2). Adjacent empty tiles: (6,1) is kitchen counter -> non-empty, (6,3) is kitchen counter -> non-empty, (5,2) -> empty, (7,2) doesn't exist. So only (5,2) is adjacent.\n\nSo from (4,1) holding the soup:\n- Turn 48: after serving the soup into the plate, he is at (4,1) holding the soup. He needs to go to (5,2) to deliver.\n- Move right to (5,1) -> R.\n- Turn 49: move up to (5,2) -> U. Then face east to interact with (6,2)? (6,2) is east of (5,2). \n- Turn 50: change orientation to east (R) [if not already] and interact (I) to deliver.\n\nBut this is taking many turns and we are only planning for H turns, say 10, but this is up to turn 50. We might want a shorter plan.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Alice get the plate since she is closer after putting the third onion? But she is at (4,1) after turn 43.\n\nAfter turn 43: Alice at (4,1), holding nothing. The soup is cooking. She can go get a plate.\n\nBut Bob is already on his way to get the plate.\n\nTo optimize, let's have Alice get the plate.\n\nAfter turn 43: Alice at (4,1), holding nothing.\nPath to plate dispenser at (0,2):\n- Turn 44: move left to (3,1) -> L.\n- Turn 45: move left to (2,1) -> L.\n- Turn 46: move left to (1,1) -> L.\n- Turn 47: move up to (1,2) -> U.\n- Turn 48: change orientation to west (L) to face (0,2).\n- Turn 49: interact (I) to get a plate.\n- Then she needs to bring it back to (4,1) to serve the soup.\n\nBut the soup is ready at turn 48. So on turn 49, she gets the plate, then she must go back.\n\nTurn 50: move right to (2,2) -> blocked, so move down to (1,1) -> D.\nTurn 51: move right to (2,1) -> R.\nTurn 52: move right to (3,1) -> R.\nTurn 53: move right to (4,1) -> R.\nTurn 54: change orientation to down (D).\nTurn 55: interact (I) to serve the soup (put the plate of soup in her hand).\nThen deliver to (6,2):\nTurn 56: move right to (5,1) -> R.\nTurn 57: move up to (5,2) -> U.\nTurn 58: change orientation to east (R) and interact (I) to deliver.\n\nThis is even longer.\n\nTherefore, the initial plan with Bob getting the plate might be better, but we have to wait for the soup to cook.\n\nBut in the interest of time and within a horizon of 10 turns, we might not complete the delivery. We can only get the pot started.\n\nSince we are at turn 29, and we want to plan for the next 10 turns (up to turn 39), we can focus on getting the three onions into the pot and starting the cooking.\n\nSo within 10 turns:\n\n- Alice puts her onion in the pot at (4,0) by turn 33.\n- Bob brings the onion from (2,2) to the pot by turn 35.\n- Then Alice goes to get the onion from (6,1) and puts it by turn 38 or 39.\n\nBut turn 29 to 39 is 10 turns.\n\nLet's outline Alice's actions for 10 turns:\n\nTurn 29: R (to 5,3)\nTurn 30: D (to 5,2)\nTurn 31: D (to 5,1)\nTurn 32: S (stay, to avoid conflict with Bob moving to 4,1)\nTurn 33: L (move to 4,1) [because on turn 33, Bob is moving to 4,1, so we wait until turn 33 for Alice to move? But on turn 33, Bob is moving to 4,1, so Alice cannot move to 4,1 on the same turn. So she must stay again.\n\nWe need to sequence carefully.\n\nRevised plan for Alice and Bob to achieve three onions in the pot by turn 39.\n\nTurn 29:\n- Alice: R ( to (5,3) )\n- Bob: R ( to (2,1) )\n\nTurn 30:\n- Alice: D ( to (5,2) )\n- Bob: U ( face up to interact with (2,2) )\n\nTurn 31:\n- Alice: D ( to (5,1) )\n- Bob: I ( pick up onion from (2,2) )\n\nTurn 32:\n- Alice: S ( stay at (5,1) )\n- Bob: R ( to (3,1) )\n\nTurn 33:\n- Alice: S ( stay )\n- Bob: R ( to (4,1) )\n\nTurn 34:\n- Alice: S ( stay )\n- Bob: D ( face down to interact with pot at (4,0) )\n\nTurn 35:\n- Alice: S ( stay )\n- Bob: I ( put onion in pot) -> pot now has one onion.\n\nOn turn 35, Bob is done and moves away. Alice can then move to (4,1) on turn 36.\n\nTurn 36:\n- Alice: L ( move to (4,1) from (5,1) )\n- Bob: L ( move to (3,1) to free space )\n\nTurn 37:\n- Alice: D ( face down to interact )\n- Bob: (free to move, but we might not need to plan Bob's actions beyond this if we only care about Alice)\n\nTurn 38:\n- Alice: I ( put her onion in the pot) -> pot now has two onions.\n\nThen for the third onion, Alice can go to (6,1) to get it.\n\nTurn 39: Alice move right to (5,1) -> action R.\n\nBut at this point, we've used 10 turns (29 to 39) and the pot has two onions. We haven't gotten the third.\n\nSo within 10 turns, we only have two onions in the pot.\n\nTo get the third, we need more turns.\n\nPerhaps have Alice, after turn 38, on turn 39 face east (but she is at (4,1) and (6,1) is not adjacent) or move to (5,1) and then interact on turn 40.\n\nBut we are only asked to plan for Alice for several turns. We can plan for Alice for the next 10 turns and assume Bob will be controlled by the user or we can suggest.\n\nSince the task says \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", we can focus on Alice.\n\nSo for Alice, from turn 29 to 38 (10 actions):\n\nTurn 29: R\nTurn 30: D\nTurn 31: D\nTurn 32: S\nTurn 33: S\nTurn 34: S\nTurn 35: S\nTurn 36: L\nTurn 37: D\nTurn 38: I\n\nThen on turn 39: she can move to (5,1) (R) to get ready to pick up the onion at (6,1).\n\nBut this is not efficient. We can improve by having Alice help with the third onion earlier.\n\nAlternative: after Alice puts her onion in the pot (at turn 38), then she can go to (6,1) for the third onion. But that's beyond turn 38.\n\nAnother idea: Alice doesn't wait for Bob; she goes directly to put her onion in the pot, then goes to get the onion from (6,1) while Bob is getting the onion from (2,2).\n\nFor example:\n\nAlice:\nTurn 29: L ( to (3,3) ) [instead of right]\nTurn 30: D ( to (3,2) ) -> but (3,2) is kitchen counter -> cannot walk. So invalid.\n\nThen she must go the right way.\n\nPerhaps give up on using the onion at (2,2) within the first 10 turns and focus on the onion at (6,1) for the third.\n\nBut then we have to get it.\n\nGiven the complexity, and that we are to provide a sequence for Alice for the next few turns, let's aim to have Alice put her onion in the pot and then start toward the third onion.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 29: R ( to (5,3) )\nTurn 30: D ( to (5,2) )\nTurn 31: D ( to (5,1) )\nTurn 32: L ( to (4,1) ) -> we hope that Bob is not there, but we can assume that in this turn, Bob is elsewhere. In our earlier plan, on turn 32, Bob is at (3,1) ( if he moved on turn 31 to (3,1) ). In our first plan, on turn 32, Bob is moving to (3,1) ( from turn 32 action R from (2,1) to (3,1) ), so (4,1) is free. So Alice can move to (4,1) on turn 32.\n\nTurn 33: D ( face down )\nTurn 34: I ( put onion in pot) -> pot now has one onion.\nTurn 35: R ( move to (5,1) )\nTurn 36: R ( face east, if not already) [after move to (5,1), she is facing east]\nTurn 37: I ( pick up onion from (6,1) ) -> now holding onion.\nTurn 38: L ( move to (4,1) )\nTurn 39: D ( face down )\nTurn 40: I ( put onion in pot) -> now two onions in pot. ( but we need three)\n\nSo by turn 40, the pot has two onions.\n\nThen we need the third from Bob.\n\nBut within 10 turns (29-38), we have Alice putting one onion and picking up another.\n\nSo for turns 29 to 38 (10 actions) for Alice:\n\nTurn 29: R\nTurn 30: D\nTurn 31: D\nTurn 32: L\nTurn 33: D\nTurn 34: I\nTurn 35: R\nTurn 36: S ( because at (5,1) and facing east, so no need to change orientation; interact on next turn? But we can do interact on turn 36 if she is already facing east. Since she moved right to (5,1) on turn 35, she is facing east. So on turn 36, she can interact.\n\nSo:\nTurn 36: I (pick up onion from (6,1))\nTurn 37: L (move to (4,1))\nTurn 38: D (face down)\n\nThen on turn 39: I to put the second onion in the pot.\n\nSo for a 10-turn plan for Alice ( turns 29 to 38 ):\n\nTurn 29: R\nTurn 30: D\nTurn 31: D\nTurn 32: L\nTurn 33: D\nTurn 34: I\nTurn 35: R\nTurn 36: I\nTurn 37: L\nTurn 38: D\n\nAnd then on turn 39: I (not in the plan).\n\nThis has Alice putting one onion ( turn 34 ) and then picking up another ( turn 36 ) and moving to put it ( turn 39 ).\n\nWithin the 10 turns, the pot has one onion from Alice and she is holding another onion ready to put.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can be bringing the onion from (2,2) to the pot.\n\nSince the task is to plan for Alice, and optionally for Bob, we can provide only Alice's actions.\n\nSo the answer for Alice for turns 29 to 38:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 29: R\nTurn 30: D\nTurn 31: D\nTurn 32: L\nTurn 33: D\nTurn 34: I\nTurn 35: R\nTurn 36: I\nTurn 37: L\nTurn 38: D\n}\n\nThis gets Alice to (4,1) holding an onion, facing down, ready to interact with the pot on turn 39 to add the second onion. Then the third onion can be added by Bob or Alice later.\n\nNote: on turn 32, when Alice moves L to (4,1), it is assumed that (4,1) is empty. Given that Bob might be moving to (3,1) on turn 32 (if he follows the earlier plan), then (4,1) is free.\n\nWe can include a note that this assumes Bob is not blocking (4,1) on turn 32.\n\nTo be safe, we could have Alice wait if necessary, but in the plan, we don't have that flexibility.\n\nSince the task is to provide a sequence, we'll provide the above.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice and Bob should collaborate to prepare and deliver a soup recipe (3 onions for 20 points) as efficiently as possible. Given the current state (turn 29), Alice is at (4,3) holding an onion, and Bob is at (1,1) holding nothing. The plan focuses on Alice's actions for the next 10 turns (turns 29 to 38), with Bob assisting by fetching the onion from (2,2) and delivering it to the pot at (4,0). The sequence ensures Alice deposits her onion, retrieves the onion from (6,1), and prepares to add it to the pot, while Bob handles the second onion.\n\n### Alice's Action Plan (Turns 29–38)\n- **Turn 29 (R)**: Move right to (5,3). This starts Alice's path toward (5,1) for pot access.\n- **Turn 30 (D)**: Move down to (5,2). Continues the path.\n- **Turn 31 (D)**: Move down to (5,1). Positions Alice to access (4,1) and (6,1).\n- **Turn 32 (L)**: Move left to (4,1). Alice is now adjacent to the pot at (4,0) (south).\n- **Turn 33 (D)**: Change orientation to down (faces pot at (4,0)).\n- **Turn 34 (I)**: Interact to add held onion to the pot at (4,0). Pot now has 1 onion. Alice is empty-handed.\n- **Turn 35 (R)**: Move right to (5,1). Positions Alice to access the onion at (6,1) (east).\n- **Turn 36 (I)**: Interact to pick up onion from (6,1) (facing east after move). Alice now holds an onion.\n- **Turn 37 (L)**: Move left to (4,1). Returns to the pot access point.\n- **Turn 38 (D)**: Change orientation to down (faces pot). Ready to add the onion on turn 39.\n\n### Bob's Suggested Actions (Optional but Recommended)\n- **Turns 29–31**: Move to (2,1), face up, and interact to pick up the onion from (2,2).\n- **Turns 32–35**: Move to (4,1), face down, and interact to add the onion to the pot at (4,0) (completes by turn 35). This ensures the pot has 2 onions by turn 35.\n- **Turns 36+**: After turn 35, Bob should move away (e.g., to (3,1)) to avoid blocking Alice, then fetch a plate from (0,2) for future serving.\n\n### Outcome by Turn 38\n- **Pot state**: 2 onions (1 from Alice on turn 34, 1 from Bob by turn 35).\n- **Alice**: At (4,1) holding an onion, facing down. On turn 39, she can interact to add the third onion, starting the 5-turn cooking process.\n- **Next steps**: \n  - Turn 39: Alice adds third onion (pot starts cooking, ready at turn 44).\n  - Bob retrieves a plate from (0,2) (turns 36–41).\n  - After cooking, Bob serves the soup at (4,0) and delivers to (6,2) for 20 points.\n\nThis plan maximizes efficiency by parallelizing tasks (Alice handles two onions, Bob handles one and plates) and avoids collisions. The horizon of 10 turns sets up the soup for completion with minimal delay.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 29: R \\\\\nTurn 30: D \\\\\nTurn 31: D \\\\\nTurn 32: L \\\\\nTurn 33: D \\\\\nTurn 34: I \\\\\nTurn 35: R \\\\\nTurn 36: I \\\\\nTurn 37: L \\\\\nTurn 38: D\n}",

The goal is to plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob) to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes.\n\nFirst, let's understand the environment and current state:\n\n### Tile Types (as given):\n- Kitchen Counters: at (0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)\n- Onion Dispensers: at (2,4) and (4,4)\n- Plate Dispenser: at (0,2)\n- Pots: at (2,0) and (4,0)\n- Serving Counter: at (6,2)\n\n### Recipe Information:\n- Only one recipe: 3 onions, 0 tomatoes -> reward 20, cooking time 5 turns.\n\n### Current Game State (turn 32):\n- Alice:\n  - Position: (5,2)\n  - Orientation: R (right)\n  - Holding: one onion\n  - Action History: D, R, R, D, R (most recent last)\n\n- Bob:\n  - Position: (2,3)\n  - Orientation: R (right)\n  - Holding: nothing\n  - Action History: I, L, U, U, R (most recent last)\n\n### Non-empty Kitchen Counters:\n- (6,1): contains an onion\n- (2,2): contains an onion\n\n### Pots:\n- Both pots (at (2,0) and (4,0)) are empty.\n\n### Objective:\nWe need to deliver as many onion soups as possible. Since the recipe requires 3 onions and the cooking time is 5 turns, we have to put 3 onions in a pot, wait 5 turns, and then serve the cooked soup on a plate to the serving counter (6,2).\n\n### Current Resources:\n- Alice is holding one onion.\n- There are two onions already on kitchen counters: at (6,1) and (2,2). We can use these.\n\n### Steps to make a soup:\n1. Fill a pot with 3 onions.\n2. Wait 5 turns for cooking.\n3. Get a plate (from the plate dispenser at (0,2)).\n4. Use the plate to serve the cooked soup from the pot.\n5. Deliver the soup (to the serving counter at (6,2)).\n\nWe have two pots, so we can potentially cook two soups simultaneously.\n\n### Current Positions:\n- Alice is at (5,2). She is holding an onion. She is one step left of (6,2) (the serving counter) and one step above (5,1) which is a kitchen counter (but (5,0) is also a kitchen counter, but (5,1) is not listed as a kitchen counter? Let me check the kitchen counter list: (5,0) and (6,0) are kitchen counters, but (5,1) is not listed. The kitchen counters are at the positions listed above.\n\nLooking at the grid:\n\nWe can sketch a grid for clarity:\n\nRow y=4: [KC, KC, OnionD, KC, OnionD, KC, KC] -> (0,4) KC, (1,4) KC, (2,4) Onion Dispenser, (3,4) KC, (4,4) Onion Dispenser, (5,4) KC, (6,4) KC\nRow y=3: [KC, ... , KC] -> (0,3) KC and (6,3) KC. The rest? Not specified, so empty? Actually, only the listed ones are non-empty? The tile types are fixed, but the kitchen counters are only at the listed positions.\n\nBut note: the non-empty kitchen counters are only (6,1) and (2,2) with onions. The rest are empty? We can use them to place items.\n\nNow, let's see Alice at (5,2). What is around her?\n- (5,2): Alice is here. \n- Adjacent: \n  - Left: (4,2) -> kitchen counter (but currently empty? because non-empty ones are only (6,1) and (2,2))\n  - Right: (6,2) -> serving counter\n  - Up: (5,3) -> not specified, so probably empty tile? \n  - Down: (5,1) -> not a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters include (5,0) and (6,0) at y=0, and (6,1) is a kitchen counter (with an onion). (5,1) is not listed as a kitchen counter, so it must be an empty tile? \n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (2,3). Adjacent:\n- Left: (1,3) -> not listed, so empty?\n- Right: (3,3) -> not listed, so empty?\n- Up: (2,4) -> Onion Dispenser\n- Down: (2,2) -> kitchen counter (with an onion)\n\n### Plan:\n\nWe need to get 3 onions into a pot. We have:\n- Alice holding one onion.\n- One onion at (6,1) (kitchen counter)\n- One onion at (2,2) (kitchen counter)\n\nWe need one more onion. We can get it from an onion dispenser at (2,4) or (4,4).\n\nWe have two pots: at (2,0) and (4,0). We can choose which one to use.\n\n### Strategy:\n\nSince Alice is at (5,2) and holding an onion, she can move to the pot at (4,0) to put the onion. But let's see the path:\n\nFrom (5,2) to (4,0): \n- First, she must go left to (4,2) (kitchen counter, but empty) -> then down to (4,1) (empty tile) -> then down to (4,0) (pot). \nBut note: (4,1) is not a kitchen counter, so it's walkable. And (4,0) is a pot.\n\nAlternatively, she could go down to (5,1) (empty) -> then left to (4,1) -> then down to (4,0). \n\nBut note: Bob is at (2,3). He can help by getting the onion from the kitchen counter at (2,2) and bringing it to a pot. Also, he can get the extra onion we need.\n\nLet's assign tasks:\n\nOption 1: Use the pot at (4,0) because it's closer to Alice.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Alice: put her onion into the pot at (4,0). To do that, she needs to move to (4,0) and face the pot. Currently at (5,2), facing right.\n\n   - First, she must change orientation or move. To go down, she can turn down? But she can only interact if adjacent and facing. So she needs to move to (4,0) and face the pot? The pot is at (4,0). When she is at (4,0), she is standing on the pot? No, because pots are non-empty tiles and players cannot walk on non-empty tiles. So she must stand adjacent and face the pot.\n\n   The pot at (4,0) has adjacent tiles: (4,1) (above), (3,0) (left, which is a kitchen counter), (5,0) (right, kitchen counter). So she can stand at (4,1) and face down to interact with the pot.\n\n   So Alice must be at (4,1) and facing down to put the onion in the pot at (4,0).\n\n   How to get to (4,1) from (5,2)?\n   - Option: move left to (4,2) -> then down to (4,1). \n     - Turn 32: Alice is at (5,2) facing R. To move left, she can do L (which changes position to (4,2) and orientation to L? But the action L means: move left and change orientation to left? The action \"Move L\" means: changes position to (x-1, y) and orientation to L. Similarly for others.\n\n   Alternatively, she can change orientation without moving? There is an action for changing orientation only, but that requires that the adjacent tile in the direction of movement is not empty? Actually, the rule says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" But that seems misstated. Actually, the change orientation action doesn't move, so it doesn't matter what is adjacent. The rule says: \"Change Orientation: No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> I think it's meant for the move action? Let me reread.\n\n   The move action: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\" \n   And then: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This is confusing. Actually, the change orientation action doesn't move, so it doesn't require the adjacent tile to be empty? But the rule says \"No move if ...\", meaning that if you try to change orientation and the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty, then you don't move? But that doesn't make sense because changing orientation doesn't move. I think there might be a misunderstanding.\n\n   Let me clarify the rules:\n\n   - **Move (L/R/U/D)**: This action moves the player one step in the specified direction and changes their orientation to that direction. This move is only possible if the target tile is empty (walkable) and not blocked by another player or non-empty tile.\n\n   - **Change Orientation (L/R/U/D)**: This action only changes the player's orientation to the specified direction without moving. There is no condition about adjacent tiles for changing orientation? The rule says: \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This might be a typo? Because changing orientation doesn't involve moving. I think it should be: for the move action, the move doesn't happen if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty. For change orientation, it always happens.\n\n   Given that, we can change orientation freely.\n\n   So, for Alice at (5,2) facing R, to go left to (4,2), she can do:\n     - Action: L (move left) -> this will move her to (4,2) and face left.\n\n   Then from (4,2), she can do D (move down) to (4,1) and face down.\n\n   Then she is at (4,1) facing down. Now she can interact (I) with the pot at (4,0) because she is adjacent and facing it.\n\n   So that takes 2 moves and then an interact.\n\n   But note: at (4,1) she is on an empty tile? Yes, because (4,1) is not listed as any non-empty tile (it's not a kitchen counter, dispenser, etc.). So it's walkable.\n\n2. Meanwhile, Bob can be doing something. Bob is at (2,3) facing R, holding nothing.\n\n   He can go to the kitchen counter at (2,2) (which is one step down) and pick up the onion there.\n\n   How?\n     - Move down (D) to (2,2)? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter and non-empty (it has an onion). Players cannot walk on non-empty tiles? The rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So he cannot step on (2,2). Therefore, he must stand adjacent and face the counter to interact.\n\n   The kitchen counter at (2,2) is adjacent to (2,1) (below), (2,3) (above), (1,2) (left), (3,2) (right). Bob is at (2,3) above it. He is facing right. He can change orientation to down? Then interact? But he is at (2,3) and the counter is at (2,2) below him. So if he faces down, he is facing the counter? Then he can interact.\n\n   So Bob at (2,3) facing R: \n     - Change orientation to D (down) -> now facing down towards (2,2). Then Interact (I) to pick up the onion from the kitchen counter.\n\n   That takes 2 actions: first change orientation to D, then I.\n\n3. Now, we have two onions in the pot at (4,0) (if Alice put one) and Bob is holding one onion. We need one more onion.\n\n   We can get it from an onion dispenser. The dispensers are at (2,4) and (4,4). Bob is at (2,3) and holding an onion. He can move to (2,4) to get another onion? But he is already holding one, so he cannot grab another. He must put the onion he is holding somewhere first? Or we can have Alice get the third onion? But Alice just put an onion and is now empty? Let's see the timeline.\n\n   After Alice puts her onion at (4,0) (at turn 32+2 = turn 34), she is empty. Then she can go to an onion dispenser to get another onion.\n\n   Alternatively, Bob can put his onion in the pot at (4,0). But he is at (2,3) and the pot at (4,0) is far. Or we can use the other pot? But we want to fill one pot first.\n\n   Alternatively, Bob can put the onion he is holding on an empty kitchen counter near him? Then go to get another onion? But that might be inefficient.\n\n   Let's think: we have two onions already (Alice put one, and the one Bob picked up is one, but we need three). The one at (6,1) is also available.\n\n   We can have Alice, after putting her onion, go to (6,1) to pick up the onion there and bring it to the pot? (6,1) is a kitchen counter with an onion. Alice at (4,1) after putting the onion:\n\n     - She can move right to (5,1) -> then right to (6,1) (but (6,1) is a kitchen counter and non-empty? So she cannot step on it. She must stand adjacent and face it.\n\n     Adjacent to (6,1): (6,0) (below, kitchen counter), (6,2) (above, serving counter), (5,1) (left, empty tile). So she can stand at (5,1) and face right to interact with (6,1). \n\n     How to get to (5,1) from (4,1)? \n        - Move right (R) to (5,1) and face right. Then interact to pick up the onion from (6,1).\n\n     Then she is holding an onion. Then she can go back to (4,1) (move left) and face down to put it in the pot? \n\n     Steps for Alice after putting the first onion (at turn 34: she is at (4,1) and empty):\n        Turn 34: R -> move to (5,1), facing right.\n        Turn 35: I -> pick up the onion from (6,1) (if she is facing right, then (6,1) is to her right? Actually, (5,1) to the right is (6,1) which is adjacent? Yes, because (5,1) and (6,1) are adjacent horizontally. So she can interact to pick up the onion.\n        Then turn 36: L -> move left to (4,1), facing left? But then she needs to face down to interact with the pot. So at (4,1) she is facing left. Then she must change orientation to down? Or move down? But she is already at (4,1). So:\n        Turn 37: D (but D would move her to (4,0) if possible? But (4,0) is a pot, non-empty, so she cannot move there. So she must change orientation to down without moving: use the change orientation action? The change orientation action is specified by direction. So we can do: change orientation to D (down). Then she is facing down. Then turn 38: I to put the onion in the pot.\n\n     So that's 4 more actions (turns 34-37) and then interact at turn 38. Then the pot has 2 onions? But we want 3. We have only put two so far (one by Alice initially and this one). We need a third.\n\n   Alternatively, Bob can get the third onion. After Bob picks up the onion at (2,2) (at turn 33: he does change orientation to D and then I, so at turn 33 he has the onion). Then he can go to an onion dispenser to get another? But he is holding an onion, so he cannot. He must put it first.\n\n   We can have Bob put the onion he is holding into the pot at (4,0) as the third onion? But he is at (2,3) and the pot at (4,0) is at (4,0). He would have to go: \n        from (2,3): move right to (3,3) -> right to (4,3) -> down to (4,2) -> down to (4,1) -> then face down and interact to put in the pot at (4,0). That's 4 moves and then an interact. \n\n   Then the pot would have 3 onions and start cooking.\n\n   But note: at (4,2) there is a kitchen counter? Yes, (4,2) is a kitchen counter (from the list). But it is empty? The non-empty ones are only (6,1) and (2,2). So (4,2) is empty? So Bob can walk on (4,2)? No, because kitchen counters are non-empty tiles? The rule says: non-empty tiles cannot be walked on. But the kitchen counter is a tile type that can be non-empty (if it has an item) or empty. The rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So if the kitchen counter is empty, it is walkable? Actually, the tile type is \"Kitchen Counter\", and it is always a non-empty tile? Or is it that the tile is a kitchen counter and then it can be in two states: empty or occupied?\n\n   The rule says: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and in the non-empty kitchen counter list, we see two that are occupied. The others are not mentioned, so they are empty. \n\n   But the rule for walking: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and a kitchen counter is a tile type that is non-empty when it has an item? Actually, the tile types are fixed, but the walkability depends on whether the tile is occupied? \n\n   The rule says: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and then the others are non-empty? But the dispenser, pot, serving counter, and kitchen counter are non-empty? Or are they walkable when empty? \n\n   The rule: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are defined as tiles that are not empty? And the tile types: \n        - Empty Tile: walkable.\n        - Others: non-empty? \n\n   But the kitchen counter is listed as a tile type. So regardless of whether it has an item, it is non-empty? That would mean players cannot walk on any kitchen counter, even if empty. Similarly, dispensers, pots, serving counters are non-empty and cannot be walked on.\n\n   So Bob cannot walk through (4,2) because it's a kitchen counter (non-empty tile). Therefore, he cannot take the direct path. He must go around? \n\n   The grid: \n        At (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, so blocked. \n        How else can he go? \n            From (2,3): \n            Option 1: down to (2,2) -> but (2,2) is a kitchen counter and non-empty (has an onion) -> blocked.\n            Option 2: right to (3,3) -> then down to (3,2) -> (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> blocked? \n            (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty? Yes, so blocked.\n\n        Then how to get to (4,1)? \n            He can go: (2,3) -> right to (3,3) -> then right to (4,3) -> then down to (4,2) is blocked -> but (4,3) is empty? Then he can go down? (4,3) to (4,2) is blocked. \n            Alternatively, from (4,3) he can go down? But (4,2) is blocked. He can go left? Not helpful.\n\n        Actually, the only way is to go around the top? \n            (2,3) -> up to (2,4) -> but (2,4) is an onion dispenser -> non-empty, so blocked. \n            Or (2,3) -> right to (3,3) -> up to (3,4) -> (3,4) is a kitchen counter -> blocked.\n\n        This seems problematic. Maybe we are misunderstanding the walkability.\n\n   Let me re-read: \n        \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" \n        \"Dispensers: Sources for items ...\" -> non-empty? \n        \"Pot: ...\" -> non-empty? \n        \"Serving Counter: ...\" -> non-empty? \n        \"Kitchen Counter: ...\" -> non-empty? \n\n   The rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So only empty tiles are walkable. Therefore, any tile that is not an empty tile (i.e., dispenser, pot, serving counter, kitchen counter) is non-empty and cannot be walked on.\n\n   Therefore, the grid has obstacles at all non-empty tiles. The only walkable tiles are the empty ones and possibly the ones not listed? But the kitchen counters are at specific positions and are non-empty, so they are obstacles.\n\n   This means that the kitchen counters, even if empty, are non-empty tiles? Because they are of type \"Kitchen Counter\", not \"Empty Tile\". So they are always non-empty? \n\n   This is a critical point. The tile type determines if it is non-empty. So a kitchen counter tile is always non-empty (even if it doesn't have an item) because it is not an empty tile. Similarly for the others.\n\n   Therefore, Bob cannot walk on any kitchen counter, dispenser, pot, or serving counter. Only the empty tiles are walkable.\n\n   So the grid has fixed obstacles at the non-empty tile positions.\n\n   Now, let's see the path from Bob at (2,3) to (4,1). The empty tiles are the ones not listed? We have to infer.\n\n   We know the non-empty tiles (from the tile types list) are at:\n        - Kitchen Counters: 17 positions\n        - Onion Dispensers: 2 positions\n        - Plate Dispenser: 1 position\n        - Pots: 2 positions\n        - Serving Counter: 1 position\n\n   The rest are empty.\n\n   So the grid (7x5? from (0,0) to (6,4)):\n\n   Let me try to sketch (with x from 0 to 6, y from 0 to 4):\n\n   y=0: [KC, KC, Pot, KC, Pot, KC, KC] -> (0,0) KC, (1,0) KC, (2,0) Pot, (3,0) KC, (4,0) Pot, (5,0) KC, (6,0) KC\n   y=1: [KC, ... , KC] -> (0,1) KC, (6,1) KC (with onion)\n   y=2: [PlateD, KC, KC, KC, ...] -> (0,2) Plate Dispenser, (2,2) KC (with onion), (3,2) KC, (4,2) KC, (6,2) Serving Counter\n   y=3: [KC, ... , KC] -> (0,3) KC, (6,3) KC\n   y=4: [KC, KC, OnionD, KC, OnionD, KC, KC] -> (0,4) KC, (1,4) KC, (2,4) OnionD, (3,4) KC, (4,4) OnionD, (5,4) KC, (6,4) KC\n\n   Now, the empty tiles (walkable) are the ones not in the above.\n\n   For example, at y=1: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) are empty? \n   y=2: (1,2) is empty? (5,2) is empty? (6,2) is serving counter -> non-empty.\n   y=3: (1,3), (2,3) (but Bob is here), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) are empty? \n   y=4: no empty tiles? Because every x has a non-empty tile.\n\n   Actually, (2,3) is empty? Because it's not listed as non-empty? Bob is standing on (2,3) which is an empty tile? Yes, because it's not in the non-empty tile list. So it's walkable.\n\n   Now, Bob at (2,3) (empty tile) wants to go to (4,1) (empty tile). The path:\n\n        (2,3) -> (3,3) (empty) -> (4,3) (empty) -> (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, obstacle. So cannot go down from (4,3). \n        Alternatively, (2,3) -> (2,2) is kitchen counter -> obstacle, cannot go down.\n        (2,3) -> (2,4) is onion dispenser -> obstacle, cannot go up.\n\n   So Bob is stuck in the top row? Only (2,3) and (3,3) and (4,3) are empty? Then he can go to (3,3) and (4,3), but then cannot go down because (4,2) is blocked and (3,2) is blocked. \n\n   How about (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (5,2) -> but (5,2) is empty? Yes, and then (5,1) -> empty. Then (4,1) is empty.\n\n   So path for Bob: \n        (2,3) -> R to (3,3)\n        (3,3) -> R to (4,3)\n        (4,3) -> D to (4,2) is blocked? (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> obstacle, so cannot move down. \n        Instead, from (4,3) -> R to (5,3) -> then D to (5,2) (empty) -> then D to (5,1) (empty) -> then L to (4,1).\n\n   That is: \n        (2,3) -> R (to (3,3))\n        -> R (to (4,3))\n        -> R (to (5,3))\n        -> D (to (5,2))\n        -> D (to (5,1))\n        -> L (to (4,1))\n\n   That's 5 moves. Then at (4,1) he can face down and interact to put the onion in the pot.\n\n   But this is a long path.\n\n   Alternatively, we can have Bob put the onion he is holding on a kitchen counter near him? But the only kitchen counter near him is (2,2) but it already has an onion and is non-empty, so he cannot put it there? He can only put an item on an empty kitchen counter. \n\n   The kitchen counters that are empty: for example, (3,2) is a kitchen counter and empty? Yes, because non-empty ones are only (6,1) and (2,2). So (3,2) is empty. But (3,2) is adjacent to (3,3)? Yes, above it.\n\n   Bob at (2,3) holding an onion: \n        - Move right to (3,3) (now at (3,3))\n        - Then face down (change orientation to D) and interact to place the onion on the kitchen counter at (3,2). \n\n   That takes 2 moves: R (to (3,3)) and then change orientation to D and I? But the change orientation is one action and interact is another, so 3 actions: \n        Turn 33: R (move to (3,3), facing right)\n        Turn 34: D (change orientation to down? but the action D for move would be down, but we want to change orientation without moving? So we need to use the change orientation action: specify the direction? The actions are: U, D, L, R for move, and also for change orientation? The answer format uses the same letters, but we need to distinguish? \n\n   The actions are: \n        Move: U, D, L, R\n        Change Orientation: ? The problem says the action set is {U, D, L, R, I, S}. How do we express change orientation? \n\n   The rule says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" \n\n   But in the answer format, we only have the letters. So when we output 'D', it could be either move down or change orientation to down? How to disambiguate?\n\n   Let me read carefully: \n\n   \"Each player (Alice/Bob) can:\n    - Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\n    - Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one. \n    - Interact (I): ...\n    - Stay (S): ...\"\n\n   This is ambiguous. But the rule for change orientation says: \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" which suggests that when you try to change orientation, it might attempt to move? That doesn't make sense. \n\n   I think there might be a misinterpretation. In the Overcooked game, typically, the move actions also change orientation, and there is a separate action for interacting and staying. But here, it seems they have separate actions for changing orientation without moving.\n\n   However, in the action set provided in the answer format, it's {U, D, L, R, I, S}. And the move action is defined as changing position and orientation, while the change orientation action is also labeled with U/D/L/R. But how to differentiate in the output?\n\n   The problem states: \"Where each action \\(a_t \\in \\{U, D, L, R, I, S\\}\\).\"\n\n   And for move, it uses U/D/L/R, and for change orientation, it also uses U/D/L/R. So the same letter is used for two different actions? That is confusing.\n\n   Let me read the rule again: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This suggests that the change orientation action might be intended to be a move action that fails if the adjacent tile is not empty? But that would be the same as the move action. \n\n   I think there might be a mistake in the problem statement. Given the ambiguity, I will assume that:\n        - The actions U, D, L, R are used for moving in that direction (which also changes orientation to that direction). If the move is not possible (because the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty), then it becomes a change orientation action? Or it fails and only changes orientation? The rule for change orientation says \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one\", which sounds like the condition for move failing.\n\n   But the move action is defined separately from change orientation. \n\n   Given the time, I will assume that the intended interpretation is:\n        - When a player issues a move action (U/D/L/R), they attempt to move in that direction. If the adjacent tile in that direction is empty and walkable, they move and their orientation becomes that direction. If not, then they do not move, but their orientation changes to that direction.\n\n   This is a common implementation. So essentially, every U/D/L/R action will change the orientation to that direction, and if the move is possible, they move.\n\n   This matches the rule for change orientation: because if you try to move and the tile is not empty, you don't move but still change orientation.\n\n   So we don't need a separate change orientation action. The move action already does that.\n\n   Therefore, for Bob at (2,3) facing R, to face down without moving, he can try to move down (D). But the tile below (2,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, so he cannot move. But he will change orientation to down.\n\n   So one action: D -> results in no move, but now facing down.\n\n   Then he can interact (I) to pick up the onion from (2,2) (because he is facing it).\n\n   Similarly, for placing an item on a kitchen counter below him, he would face down and interact.\n\n   So let's revise.\n\n   Bob at (2,3) facing R, holding nothing:\n        - Action: D -> cannot move down (because (2,2) is non-empty), so only changes orientation to down.\n        - Then I: interact with the kitchen counter (2,2) below him -> picks up the onion.\n\n   So at turn 33: Bob does D (changes to face down) and then I (picks up onion) at turn 34? But we are planning for Alice, and optionally Bob. The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But it doesn't say we control Bob? The user is Alice, so we only control Alice? Or can we coordinate with Bob? The problem says \"collaborate with Bob\", but we are only asked to plan for Alice. The answer format only shows actions for Alice? \n\n   The instruction: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can plan for both? But the answer format only shows actions, and it doesn't specify for which player. \n\n   Let me read: \"plan a sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=1}^{H-1}\\) for Alice (and optionally Bob)\"\n\n   And the answer format is:\n\n   \\boxed{\n   Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n   Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n   ...\n   }\n\n   It doesn't specify for which player. But typically, in such problems, we only control one agent. The problem says \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\", so we might only control Alice and assume Bob is controlled by another agent. But then we cannot plan for Bob.\n\n   However, the task says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". This is confusing.\n\n   Given the context, I think we are only to plan for Alice, and we have to assume that Bob will act independently. But then we have to coordinate by anticipating Bob's actions or by the plan being robust to Bob's actions.\n\n   But the problem also says: \"based on the current game state and action history of both players\". And we are to optimize coordination.\n\n   To simplify, I will assume that we can plan for both players. But the answer format does not distinguish between Alice and Bob. It just lists actions. So how to know which action is for which player?\n\n   I think the problem might have intended for us to only control Alice. Let me see the note: \"You (Alice)\" and \"Teammate (Bob)\". So we are Alice.\n\n   Therefore, we only output actions for Alice. Bob is not controlled by us.\n\n   So we must only plan for Alice, and hope that Bob will help or at least not hinder.\n\n   Given that, let's focus on Alice.\n\n   Alice is at (5,2) facing R, holding an onion.\n\n   We want to fill a pot with 3 onions. The closest pot is at (4,0) or (2,0). (4,0) is closer.\n\n   Steps for Alice:\n\n   1. Move to (4,1) and face down to interact with the pot at (4,0).\n\n      - From (5,2): \n          - Action: L (move left) -> to (4,2), facing left.\n          - Action: D (move down) -> to (4,1), facing down.\n\n      Then she is at (4,1) facing down. \n          - Action: I (interact) -> put the onion in the pot. Now the pot has 1 onion.\n\n      So by turn 34, she has put one onion in the pot.\n\n   2. Now, she is empty-handed. We need two more onions for this pot. There is an onion at (6,1) (kitchen counter) and one at (2,2) (kitchen counter). The one at (6,1) is closer.\n\n      - She is at (4,1) facing down.\n      - Move right (R) -> to (5,1), facing right.\n      - Then she is at (5,1) facing right. The kitchen counter at (6,1) is to her right. \n          - Action: I (interact) -> pick up the onion from (6,1). Now she is holding an onion.\n\n      Then she must go back to the pot to put it.\n\n          - Move left (L) -> to (4,1), facing left.\n          - Then change orientation to down? \n             - Try to move down (D): but (4,0) is non-empty, so she doesn't move but faces down.\n          - Then I (interact) -> put the onion in the pot. Now the pot has 2 onions.\n\n      This takes 4 actions: \n          Turn 34: R (to (5,1))\n          Turn 35: I (pick up onion from (6,1))\n          Turn 36: L (to (4,1))\n          Turn 37: D (face down, because cannot move down)\n          Turn 38: I (put onion)\n\n   3. We need one more onion. She can go to an onion dispenser. The closest is (4,4) or (2,4). (4,4) is closer to (4,1)?\n\n      - From (4,1) after putting the second onion (at turn 38: she is at (4,1) facing down, empty? no, after putting she becomes empty).\n\n      - Then she can go to (4,4) to get an onion.\n\n        Path: from (4,1) to (4,4): \n            - Move up to (4,2) -> but (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, cannot walk. \n            - So she must go around: \n                  (4,1) -> right to (5,1) -> up to (5,2) -> up to (5,3) -> right to (6,3) -> but (6,3) is kitchen counter -> blocked.\n            Alternatively: \n                  (4,1) -> up? cannot. \n                  (4,1) -> left to (3,1) -> up to (3,2) -> kitchen counter, blocked.\n            This is not working.\n\n      How about to (2,4): \n            (4,1) -> left to (3,1) [empty] -> left to (2,1) [empty] -> up to (2,2) kitchen counter blocked.\n            -> from (2,1) -> up to (2,2) blocked.\n\n      It seems difficult to reach the onion dispensers from here.\n\n   Alternatively, there is the onion at (2,2) on the kitchen counter. But it's far.\n\n   Given the complexity, and that Bob might be able to help, but we cannot control him, perhaps we should use the onion that is already at (2,2) by having Alice go there? But it's far.\n\n   Another idea: after the first onion, we could have Alice not go to (6,1) but to the dispenser directly? But she would need to make two trips.\n\n   Given the time constraints (we are at turn 32, and cooking takes 5 turns), we want to start cooking as soon as possible.\n\n   Perhaps a better plan is to use the pot at (2,0) instead, and have Alice deliver the onion she is holding to the kitchen counter at (6,1) or (2,2) and then go to a dispenser? But that might not be efficient.\n\n   Let's try a different approach:\n\n   Since there are two onions on kitchen counters, and Alice is holding one, we have three onions available if we can gather them in one pot.\n\n   Alice can put her onion on the kitchen counter at (5,0) or (6,0) or (3,0) etc.? But then she can go to the onion dispenser to get more.\n\n   Specifically, she is near (6,1) which has an onion, but she can also place her onion on an empty kitchen counter near her. For example, (5,0) is a kitchen counter and empty? Yes.\n\n   How to get to (5,0) from (5,2)? \n        - Move down to (5,1) [empty] -> then down to (5,0) [kitchen counter] -> but cannot walk on it. \n        So she must stand adjacent and face it. The adjacent tile to (5,0) is (5,1) (above) and (6,0) (right) and (4,0) (left) -> all non-empty except (5,1) is empty.\n\n   So she can stand at (5,1) and face down to interact with (5,0).\n\n   Steps:\n        - From (5,2): move down (D) to (5,1), facing down.\n        - Then I to place the onion on (5,0)? But she is facing down, and (5,0) is below (5,1), so yes.\n\n   Then she is empty. Then she can go to (6,1) to pick up the onion there: \n        - At (5,1) facing down, move right (R) to (6,1) -> but (6,1) is a kitchen counter and non-empty (has an onion), so cannot walk. \n        - So she must interact from (5,1) with (6,1) by facing right? \n              - Change orientation to right: try move right (R) -> cannot because (6,1) is non-empty, so only changes orientation to right.\n              - Then I: interact to pick up the onion from (6,1).\n\n   Then she is holding an onion. Then she can place it on another kitchen counter or in a pot.\n\n   This is getting complicated.\n\n   Given the time, I propose a simpler plan:\n\n   Since the serving counter is at (6,2), and Alice is at (5,2) facing right, she is adjacent to the serving counter. But she is holding an onion, not a soup, so she cannot deliver.\n\n   But she can use the kitchen counter at (6,1) to store the onion she is holding? \n\n   How? \n        - She is at (5,2) facing right. The kitchen counter at (6,1) is not adjacent to her? It is below and to the right. She is not adjacent to it. She is adjacent to (6,2) (serving counter) to her right.\n\n   To be adjacent to (6,1), she must be at (6,1) or at an adjacent tile. The adjacent tiles to (6,1) are: (6,0), (6,2), and (5,1). (6,0) is kitchen counter, (6,2) is serving counter, (5,1) is empty.\n\n   So she can stand at (5,1) and face east to interact with (6,1).\n\n   Steps for Alice:\n\n        - From (5,2): move down (D) to (5,1), facing down.\n        - Then change orientation to right: try move right (R) -> cannot walk to (6,1) (non-empty), so only changes orientation to right. Now she is at (5,1) facing right.\n        - Then I: interact with (6,1) -> since (6,1) has an onion, she would pick it up? But she is holding an onion, so she cannot. She must be empty to pick up.\n\n   So she must first deposit her onion somewhere. \n\n   She can deposit it on (5,0) from (5,1) by facing down and interacting, as above.\n\n   So:\n        - Turn 32: D (move to (5,1), facing down)\n        - Turn 33: D (change orientation to down? or move down? Move down would be to (5,0) -> cannot, so only change orientation to down. Then she is facing down.\n        - Turn 34: I (interact with (5,0)? But (5,0) is below (5,1), so she can place the onion on the kitchen counter at (5,0) if it is empty. It is empty, so she places the onion.\n        - Now she is empty.\n        - Turn 35: R (change orientation to right, because move right is not possible, so only faces right)\n        - Turn 36: I (interact with (6,1) -> pick up the onion from (6,1))\n        - Now she is holding an onion.\n\n   Then she can either put this onion in a pot or leave it on another counter.\n\n   But this has taken 5 turns and we only have two onions placed in the kitchen ( one at (5,0) and one at (6,1) is picked up, so (6,1) is now empty, and she is holding one onion). We haven't put any in the pot.\n\n   Given the complexity and the fact that we are limited in time, and we cannot control Bob, I think we should focus on getting at least one soup started as soon as possible.\n\n   Revised plan for Alice:\n\n   - Go to the pot at (4,0) and put the onion she is holding.\n   - Then go to the onion dispenser at (4,4) to get more onions, but as we saw, the path is blocked.\n\n   Alternatively, the pot at (2,0) might be easier to reach from other areas.\n\n   Perhaps with Bob's help, the onion at (2,2) can be used. Since Bob is at (2,3) and can pick up the onion at (2,2) and put it in the pot at (2,0) if he chooses.\n\n   For Alice, we can have her put her onion in the pot at (2,0) or (4,0). (4,0) is closer.\n\n   So let's do that:\n\n   Alice's plan:\n\n   Turn 32: L ( move left to (4,2) ) -> now at (4,2)? But (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, so she cannot move there. \n   This is a problem. (4,2) is a kitchen counter, so it's non-empty and cannot be walked on.\n\n   Therefore, from (5,2) she cannot move left to (4,2) because it's a kitchen counter.\n\n   So the only move is up, down, or right. \n        - Right: (6,2) -> serving counter, non-empty, cannot.\n        - Up: (5,3) -> empty? Let me check: (5,3) is not in the non-empty list, so empty. \n        - Down: (5,1) -> empty.\n\n   So she can move up or down.\n\n   To reach the pot at (4,0), she must go left, but (4,2) is blocked. The only way is to go down to (5,1) and then left to (4,1) (empty) and then to the pot.\n\n   So:\n        - Turn 32: D ( move down to (5,1) ) -> facing down.\n        - Turn 33: L ( move left to (4,1) ) -> facing left.\n        - Then she is at (4,1) and can face down to interact with the pot at (4,0): \n               - Turn 34: D ( try move down to (4,0) -> cannot, so only change orientation to down.\n               - Turn 35: I ( interact to put the onion in the pot.\n\n   So by turn 35, the pot at (4,0) has one onion.\n\n   Then she is empty. Then she can try to get another onion. The closest source is the onion at (6,1) or the onion dispenser.\n\n   For (6,1):\n        - She is at (4,1) facing down.\n        - Turn 36: R ( move right to (5,1) ) -> facing right.\n        - Turn 37: R ( try move to (6,1) -> cannot, so only change orientation to right. Now at (5,1) facing right.\n        - Turn 38: I ( interact to pick up the onion from (6,1) ) -> she is holding an onion.\n\n   Then she can go back to the pot to put it.\n\n        - Turn 39: L ( move left to (4,1) ) -> facing left.\n        - Turn 40: D ( change orientation to down )\n        - Turn 41: I ( put the onion in the pot ) -> now the pot has 2 onions.\n\n   Then she needs one more. She can go to an onion dispenser. The closest is (4,4) or (2,4). (4,4) is at (4,4). From (4,1) to (4,4): \n        - Must go to (4,2) -> kitchen counter, blocked.\n        - So go around: (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (5,2) -> (5,3) -> (4,3) -> (4,4) but (4,4) is onion dispenser, non-empty, so cannot walk. \n        - She can stand at (4,3) and face up to interact with (4,4) the dispenser.\n\n   How to get to (4,3) from (4,1) after turn 41:\n        - Turn 42: U ( move to (4,2) is blocked, so only face up)\n        - Cannot. from (4,1) to (4,2) is not walkable. \n\n        - So move right to (5,1) -> already at (4,1) -> move right to (5,1) ( turn 42: R to (5,1) )\n        - Then move up to (5,2) ( turn 43: U to (5,2) ) -> empty.\n        - Then move up to (5,3) ( turn 44: U to (5,3) ) -> empty.\n        - Then move left to (4,3) ( turn 45: L to (4,3) ) -> empty.\n        - Then face up (U) to change orientation to up ( turn 46: U -> cannot move up to (4,4) (non-empty), so only face up.\n        - Then interact ( turn 47: I ) -> grab an onion from the dispenser.\n\n   Then she can go back to the pot to put the third onion. This will take many turns.\n\n   Given the complexity and that we are only to plan for a few turns, perhaps we should for now focus on the first few steps.\n\n   Since the planning horizon H is not specified, but we are to plan for \"next several turns\", let's assume H=10.\n\n   So for the next 10 turns (t=32 to 41), we can plan:\n\n   Alice's actions:\n\n   Turn 32: D ( move to (5,1) )\n   Turn 33: L ( move to (4,1) )\n   Turn 34: D ( change orientation to down, because cannot move down)\n   Turn 35: I ( put onion in the pot at (4,0) )\n   Turn 36: R ( move to (5,1) )\n   Turn 37: R ( change orientation to right, because cannot move to (6,1))\n   Turn 38: I ( pick up onion from (6,1) )\n   Turn 39: L ( move to (4,1) )\n   Turn 40: D ( change orientation to down )\n   Turn 41: I ( put onion in the pot ) -> now the pot has 2 onions.\n\n   Then the next actions would be to get the third onion, but that would be beyond turn 41.\n\n   This is a partial plan. It gets two onions in the pot. Hopefully, Bob will deliver the third onion or we can in subsequent turns.\n\n   Given the constraints, this is a start.\n\n   So for turns 32 to 41 (10 actions), we have:\n\n   Turn 32: D\n   Turn 33: L\n   Turn 34: D\n   Turn 35: I\n   Turn 36: R\n   Turn 37: R\n   Turn 38: I\n   Turn 39: L\n  Turn 40: D\n   Turn 41: I\n\n   But note: at turn 32, we are at turn 32, so the first action for Alice is at turn 32.\n\n   And the answer should start from turn 32.\n\n   So:\n\n   \\boxed{\n   Turn 32: D\n   Turn 33: L\n   Turn 34: D\n   Turn 35: I\n   Turn 36: R\n   Turn 37: R\n   Turn 38: I\n   Turn 39: L\n   Turn 40: D\n   Turn 41: I\n   }\n\n   This is a 10-turn plan.\n\n   Note: This plan assumes that the kitchen counter at (6,1) still has the onion and that no one else takes it. It also assumes that the pot at (4,0) remains available.\n\n   We hope that Bob will add the third onion or we can plan further.\n\n   Given the complexity and the binding constraints, this is a workable plan to start.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice should focus on filling the pot at (4,0) with onions, leveraging nearby resources. Alice starts at (5,2) holding an onion. The plan is to deposit this onion into the pot, then collect the onion from the kitchen counter at (6,1) to add to the pot. This sets up the pot with 2 onions, and the third onion can be added later by Bob or in a subsequent plan.\n\n### Action Plan for Alice (Turns 32-41):\n- **Turn 32: D** - Move down to (5,1), facing down. This positions Alice to access the pot and kitchen counter.\n- **Turn 33: L** - Move left to (4,1), facing left. Alice is now adjacent to the pot at (4,0).\n- **Turn 34: D** - Attempt to move down; blocked by the pot, so orientation changes to down. Alice now faces the pot.\n- **Turn 35: I** - Interact with the pot at (4,0) to deposit the onion. The pot now has 1 onion, and Alice is empty-handed.\n- **Turn 36: R** - Move right to (5,1), facing right. This positions Alice to access the kitchen counter at (6,1).\n- **Turn 37: R** - Attempt to move right; blocked by the kitchen counter at (6,1), so orientation changes to right. Alice now faces (6,1).\n- **Turn 38: I** - Interact to pick up the onion from (6,1). Alice is now holding an onion.\n- **Turn 39: L** - Move left to (4,1), facing left. Alice returns to the pot-adjacent tile.\n- **Turn 40: D** - Attempt to move down; blocked by the pot, so orientation changes to down. Alice faces the pot.\n- **Turn 41: I** - Interact to deposit the onion into the pot. The pot now has 2 onions.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- **Path Efficiency**: The pot at (4,0) is closer to Alice's starting position than (2,0). Moving via (5,1) and (4,1) avoids non-walkable tiles.\n- **Resource Utilization**: The onion at (6,1) is used efficiently, reducing trips to dispensers. After this, the pot has 2 onions, requiring one more to start cooking.\n- **Collaboration**: Bob, positioned near (2,2) (which has an onion), can potentially add the third onion to this pot or start filling the other pot at (2,0). Alice’s actions free her to assist with the third onion or plate collection in later turns.\n- **Cooking Initiation**: With 2 onions in the pot, one more onion added within the next few turns will start cooking (5-turn timer), enabling soup delivery soon after.\n\nThis plan sets the foundation for high-reward soup delivery by efficiently using available resources and positioning.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 32: D\nTurn 33: L\nTurn 34: D\nTurn 35: I\nTurn 36: R\nTurn 37: R\nTurn 38: I\nTurn 39: L\nTurn 40: D\nTurn 41: I\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 36. The goal is to maximize the total reward by delivering soup recipes. The only recipe available is 3 onions, which gives 20 points and takes 5 turns to cook.\n\nCurrent state:\n- Alice (me) is at (4,1), facing down (D), holding one onion.\n- Bob is at (4,3), facing right (R), holding one onion.\n\nKitchen counters with items:\n- (6,1): has an onion\n- (2,2): has an onion\n\nPots are all empty.\n\nWe have two onion dispensers at (2,4) and (4,4). Plate dispenser at (0,2). Serving counter at (6,2). Pots at (2,0) and (4,0).\n\nSince the recipe requires 3 onions, we need to get onions into a pot. There are already two onions on counters (at (6,1) and (2,2)) and each player is holding one onion. So we have 4 onions available.\n\nWe need to get three onions into one pot. Then the pot will start cooking (after the third onion is added) and take 5 turns. Then we need to serve it with a plate.\n\nPlan:\n\nWe have two pots: one at (2,0) and one at (4,0). We can use either.\n\nConsider the positions:\n\nAlice is at (4,1) holding an onion. She can move down to (4,0) (which is a pot) and interact to put her onion in. But note: she is facing down. From (4,1), if she moves down to (4,0), she will be on the pot tile? But the pot is at (4,0) and she can only interact if she is adjacent and facing it. Actually, the rule says: to interact, the player must be on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and facing it.\n\nThe pot is at (4,0). Alice is at (4,1). She is adjacent (south) and if she is facing down, then she is facing the pot. So she can interact from (4,1) without moving? But the action \"Interact\" requires that she is standing on an adjacent empty tile and facing the tile. Currently, she is at (4,1) which is an empty tile? We don't have the full grid, but typically (4,1) should be empty. However, note that (4,1) is not listed as a non-empty tile (like counter, dispenser, etc.), so it's likely an empty tile. Therefore, Alice can interact right now (turn 36) to put her onion into the pot at (4,0). But wait, the pot is empty and can take up to 3 ingredients. So she can add her onion.\n\nBut note: the pot requires 3 onions to start cooking. Currently, the pot is empty. After Alice adds one onion, it will have one. Then we need two more.\n\nBob is at (4,3) holding an onion. He can move to (4,0) to add his onion? But he is at (4,3). He can move down to (4,2) and then to (4,1) and then to (4,0). But (4,2) is a serving counter? No, serving counter is at (6,2). So (4,2) is empty? Actually, the tile types: \n- Kitchen counters are at specific positions, and (4,2) is not listed as a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters are at: [(0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)].\n\n(4,2) is listed as a kitchen counter. So (4,2) is a kitchen counter. That means it's not walkable? But the rule says: players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles. So Bob cannot step on (4,2) because it's a kitchen counter? Actually, the rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and kitchen counters are non-empty? But note: the kitchen counter is a tile that is non-empty? Actually, the tile types are fixed. The kitchen counter is a type of tile that is not empty? But the problem says \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and it is listed as a tile type. Also, in the non-empty kitchen counter section, we have two that have items: (6,1) and (2,2). But (4,2) is a kitchen counter but currently empty? So can we walk on it?\n\nThe rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are defined as having an item? Or the tile type being non-walkable? The problem states:\n\n\"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\"\n\nAnd \"non-empty tiles\" are defined as tiles that are not \"Empty Tile\". Because the tile types are:\n\n- Empty Tile: Walkable space.\n- Dispensers, Pot, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter: these are non-empty? But the rule says \"non-empty tiles\" meaning they are occupied? Or they are inherently non-walkable?\n\nLooking at the constraints: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and the tile types are given. It's likely that only Empty Tiles are walkable. So dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters are not walkable. Therefore, Bob cannot walk through (4,2) because it's a kitchen counter.\n\nTherefore, Bob's path from (4,3) to (4,0) is blocked by the kitchen counter at (4,2). He must go around.\n\nAlternative: Bob can go west to (3,3) then north to (3,4)? But (3,4) is a kitchen counter (from the list). Then he can go west? Actually, let's see the grid:\n\nWe don't have the full grid, but we know the positions of non-empty tiles. We must assume that any tile not listed as empty (i.e., the ones that are dispensers, counters, etc.) are non-walkable. So:\n\n- The only walkable tiles are the ones that are not in the list of non-empty tile types? Actually, the game grid is made of these tiles. So:\n\n  - Empty tiles: walkable.\n  - Others: non-walkable.\n\nSo Bob at (4,3) can move:\n  - Left (L) to (3,3): is (3,3) empty? We don't have a list of empty tiles, but we know the non-empty ones. The non-empty tiles are the dispensers, counters, pots, etc. (3,3) is not in the kitchen counter list? The kitchen counters are at: ... (0,3) and (6,3) ... so (3,3) is not listed. Also, no dispenser or pot at (3,3). So (3,3) is an empty tile? Similarly, (3,2) is a kitchen counter? Yes, (3,2) is in the kitchen counter list. So Bob can move left to (3,3) (empty) and then down to (3,2)? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter and non-walkable. So he can't go down. Then he can go left to (2,3)? (2,3) is not listed as non-empty? Then (2,3) is empty. Then he can go down to (2,2)? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter and non-walkable. So he can't go down. Then he can go left? But that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can go right to (5,3). (5,3) is not in any non-empty list? Then (5,3) is empty. Then he can go down to (5,2)? (5,2) is not in the kitchen counter list? The kitchen counters are at: ... (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) ... so (5,2) is not listed? Then (5,2) is empty? Then he can go down to (5,1)? (5,1) is not listed? Then empty. Then left to (4,1)? But (4,1) is where Alice is? At turn 36, Alice is at (4,1). So Bob cannot step on (4,1) because Alice is there? The rule: \"Players cannot walk onto/through each other.\" So Bob cannot go to (4,1) if Alice is there.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can go down from (5,3) to (5,2) (if empty) then to (5,1) (if empty) then to (5,0)? (5,0) is a kitchen counter? Yes, (5,0) is in the kitchen counter list -> non-walkable. So Bob cannot go to (5,0). Then he can go left to (4,0) from (5,1)? But (4,0) is a pot -> non-walkable. So he can only interact from adjacent.\n\nTherefore, Bob cannot directly put his onion into the pot at (4,0) because the path is blocked by the kitchen counter at (4,2). Similarly, for the other pot at (2,0).\n\nAlternative plan: use the pot at (2,0). \n\nAlice is at (4,1) with an onion. She can move left to (3,1)? (3,1) is not listed as non-empty? Then empty. Then left to (2,1)? (2,1) is not listed? Then empty. Then down to (2,0) (pot). But (2,0) is non-walkable. So she must be adjacent and facing the pot to interact. From (2,1) (which is above (2,0)), if she faces down, she can interact to put her onion into the pot at (2,0).\n\nSimilarly, Bob can go to (2,0) to add his onion? But he is at (4,3). He can go west: (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,2) is blocked (kitchen counter) so he can go to (2,3) and then down to (2,2) is not allowed. Then he can go down from (2,3) to (2,2) is blocked. So he can go to (1,3)? (1,3) is not listed? Then empty. Then down to (1,2)? (1,2) is not listed? Then empty. Then left? But that's (0,2) which is plate dispenser -> non-walkable. Then down to (1,1)? (1,1) not listed -> empty. Then right to (2,1)? Then down to (2,0) is not walkable. So from (2,1) (if he is there) he can face down and interact with the pot at (2,0).\n\nBut note: we also have two onions on counters: one at (6,1) and one at (2,2). The one at (2,2) is a kitchen counter. So if we are using the pot at (2,0), we can use the onion at (2,2) which is adjacent to the pot? (2,2) is one tile above (2,1) and two above (2,0). So not adjacent. But a player can pick it up and then put it in the pot.\n\nBut we already have two players with onions. We need only one more onion for the pot (if we put two in, we need one more). So we can use one of the onions on the counter.\n\nLet's think of a coordinated plan:\n\nOption 1: Use the pot at (4,0). \n  - Alice is at (4,1) facing down. She can interact (I) to put her onion into the pot at (4,0). Now the pot has 1 onion.\n  - Then we need two more onions.\n\n  How to get the other two? Bob is holding one, and there's one at (6,1) and one at (2,2). But Bob cannot easily get to (4,0). So we might use the onion on (6,1) which is closer to (4,0)? \n\n  Bob can go to (6,1) to pick up the onion? But Bob is holding an onion. He must put down his onion first? Or he can't pick up because he is not empty-handed.\n\n  So Bob must put his onion somewhere. He can put it on a kitchen counter. The nearest kitchen counter? He is at (4,3). The kitchen counter at (3,4) is above? (3,4) is a kitchen counter? Yes, in the list. But (3,4) is at (3,4). Bob is at (4,3). He can move up to (4,4) but (4,4) is a kitchen counter? Yes, in the list -> non-walkable. So he can move left to (3,3) (empty) then up to (3,4) (kitchen counter, non-walkable) -> can't. Then right? (5,3) -> empty, then up? (5,4) is kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So the only kitchen counters near Bob are at (3,4), (4,4), (5,4) above, but he can't get there because (4,4) is non-walkable and blocks. \n\n  Alternatively, he can put his onion on the kitchen counter at (4,2) which is adjacent? But (4,2) is adjacent to (4,3)? (4,2) is directly below (4,3). But (4,2) is a kitchen counter, so non-walkable. Bob is at (4,3), facing right. If he turns down (changes orientation to D) and then interacts, he can interact with (4,2) because he is adjacent (south) and facing it. He can place his onion on (4,2) if it is empty? But (4,2) is a kitchen counter and currently empty? We know that (6,1) and (2,2) have onions, but (4,2) is not mentioned as having an item, so it is empty. So Bob can put his onion on (4,2).\n\n  Steps for Bob at turn 36:\n    - Change orientation to down (D) because currently facing right, and he needs to face down to interact with (4,2) below.\n    - Then interact (I) to place the onion on (4,2).\n\n  Then Bob is empty. He can then go to (6,1) to pick up the onion that is there? But (6,1) is a kitchen counter with an onion. Bob is at (4,3). He must go to (6,1). Path: \n      (4,3) -> (5,3) [R] -> (5,2) [D] (if (5,2) is empty? Yes) -> (5,1) [D] (if empty) -> (6,1) [R] (but (6,1) is non-walkable? He can only stand adjacent and interact. So he can stand at (5,1) and face east (R) to interact with (6,1). But (5,1) is empty? We don't know, but let's assume it is. Then he can pick up the onion at (6,1).\n\n  Then Bob can carry that onion to the pot at (4,0). But again, the pot is at (4,0) and Bob is at (5,1) after picking up. Then he can go to (4,1) but Alice might be there? We have to coordinate.\n\n  After Alice puts her onion in the pot (at turn 36), she will be at (4,1) holding nothing. Then she can move? But if we want to use the onion at (2,2) or (4,2), etc.\n\nAlternatively, after Alice puts her onion in the pot (turn 36), she can then move to pick up the onion at (4,2) that Bob just placed? But Bob placed it at (4,2). Alice is at (4,1). She can move up to (4,2)? But (4,2) is non-walkable. So she must interact from adjacent. She is at (4,1) and (4,2) is north. She is currently facing down. She needs to face up? Then interact.\n\nBut note: after Alice interacts (puts onion in pot) at turn 36, she is still at (4,1) and now holding nothing. Then she can change orientation to up (U) and then interact to pick up the onion from (4,2) if Bob has placed it there? But Bob will place it at turn 36? We are planning for the same turn? We are at turn 36 and we plan for Alice's actions. Bob's actions are optional to plan? The task says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can only plan for Alice? Or we can also suggest for Bob? But the answer format is for Alice only? The boxed answer only shows Alice's actions.\n\nThe problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But the answer format only shows actions for Alice? The example output only has \"Turn t: action\" without specifying the player. But the task says \"for Alice\", so the actions are for Alice.\n\nSo we only plan Alice's actions. Bob is controlled by someone else? But we can assume we can coordinate? Actually, the task says \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\", but we are only to output Alice's actions. So we must assume Bob will act reasonably? Or we can plan assuming Bob will follow a coordinated plan? But we cannot control Bob.\n\nTherefore, we must plan for Alice only, and hope that Bob will act in a way that helps.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use the pot at (2,0) and the onion at (2,2) which is close.\n\nRevised plan for Alice:\n\nSince Bob might not be predictable, Alice should try to complete the soup as much as possible.\n\nStep 1: Alice puts her onion into the pot at (4,0) at turn 36.\n\nThen, the pot has one onion. We need two more. There is an onion at (6,1) and one at (2,2). Alice is now at (4,1) holding nothing. She can go to (6,1) to pick up that onion? But (6,1) is a kitchen counter with an onion. She must be adjacent to it. The adjacent tiles: (5,1), (6,0), (6,2). (6,0) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. (6,2) is serving counter -> non-walkable. So only (5,1) is adjacent. Alice can go: \n  - Right to (5,1) [R] (if (5,1) is empty) -> then face right (R) to interact with (6,1) to pick up the onion.\n\nBut (5,1) is not listed as non-empty, so it should be empty. Then she can pick up the onion at (6,1). Then she can go back to (4,1) and put that onion in the pot? But she has to go back: (5,1) to (4,1) [L] and then interact (facing down) to put the onion in the pot.\n\nThen the pot has two onions. We need one more. Then Alice can go to (2,2) to pick up the onion? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter. She is at (4,1). She must go to (2,2). Path: (4,1) -> (3,1) [L] -> (2,1) [L] (if both are empty). Then from (2,1) she can face up to interact with (2,2) (which is north of (2,1)) to pick up the onion. Then she can go back to (4,0) pot? But she has to go to (4,1) and then put in the pot. That would be many moves.\n\nAlternatively, Bob might put his onion in the pot? But Bob is at (4,3) holding an onion. He can try to put it in the pot at (4,0). But he cannot because of the block at (4,2). So he might put it on a counter. Then Alice can use it.\n\nBut without controlling Bob, we cannot rely on that.\n\nAnother idea: use the pot at (2,0). Alice can go to (2,0) to put her onion? She is at (4,1). She can move left to (3,1) [L] -> (2,1) [L]. Then from (2,1) facing down (D) to interact with the pot at (2,0). Then the pot has one onion. Then she can pick up the onion at (2,2) which is adjacent? (2,2) is north of (2,1). So from (2,1) she can face up (U) and interact to pick up the onion from (2,2). Then she can put it into the pot at (2,0) by facing down and interacting. Then the pot has two onions. Then she needs one more. She can get the onion at (6,1) or Bob might put his.\n\nBut Bob is at (4,3) with an onion. If he can put it on (3,2) or (2,2) but (2,2) already has an onion? Actually, (2,2) has an onion, but when Alice picks it up, (2,2) becomes empty. Then Bob can put his onion there? But Bob is far and blocked.\n\nAlternatively, Bob might go to the other pot? But we are using (2,0). \n\nGiven the time, it might be faster to use the pot at (4,0) and have Alice put two onions and hope Bob brings the third.\n\nBut Bob is holding an onion and might put it in the pot if he can, but he cannot. So he might put it on a counter. The nearest counter to Bob is (4,2). He can put it on (4,2) by facing down and interacting.\n\nThen Alice can pick it up from (4,2). How? Alice is at (4,1) after putting her onion. She can face up (U) and interact to pick up from (4,2). Then she is holding an onion. Then she can put it in the pot at (4,0) by facing down and interacting. Then the pot has two onions. Then she needs one more.\n\nThen she can go get the onion at (6,1) or (2,2). (6,1) is closer? She is at (4,1). She can go to (5,1) [R] and then pick up from (6,1) by facing right. Then go back to (4,1) [L] and put in the pot. Then the pot has three onions and starts cooking.\n\nThen we need to get a plate and serve.\n\nBut this is taking many turns.\n\nAlternatively, after the pot has two onions, Bob might bring the third? But Bob is now empty (if he put his onion on (4,2)). Then he can go to (0,2) to get a plate? Or to get an onion? But we need an onion for the third. He can go to an onion dispenser. The onion dispensers are at (2,4) and (4,4). But (4,4) is above Bob? Bob is at (4,3). (4,4) is a kitchen counter? Yes, in the list -> non-walkable. So he cannot step there. He must go to (2,4). Path: (4,3) -> (3,3) [L] -> (2,3) [L] -> then up to (2,4) [U]. But (2,4) is an onion dispenser -> non-walkable. So he must stand adjacent and face it to interact. The adjacent tile to (2,4) is (2,3) (south). Bob can be at (2,3) and face up to grab an onion. Then he must bring it to the pot. But the pot is at (4,0) or (2,0). If we are using (4,0), then he must go from (2,3) to (4,0). That is long: (2,3) -> (3,3) [R] -> (4,3) [R] -> then he is blocked by (4,2). So he would have to go around: (4,3) to (5,3) [R] -> (5,2) [D] -> (5,1) [D] -> (4,1) [L]. Then at (4,1) face down to put in the pot.\n\nThis is very long.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's try to use the pot at (2,0) and the onion at (2,2) for efficiency.\n\nPlan for Alice:\n\nTurn 36: Alice is at (4,1) holding onion. She can start moving left to go to (2,1) to interact with the pot at (2,0).\n\nSteps:\n  Turn 36: Move left (L) to (3,1) -> now at (3,1)\n  Turn 37: Move left (L) to (2,1) -> now at (2,1)\n  Turn 38: Interact (I) with pot at (2,0) (facing down) -> put onion in pot. Now pot has 1 onion. Alice is empty.\n  Turn 39: Change orientation to up (U) to face (2,2) which is north.\n  Turn 40: Interact (I) to pick up the onion from (2,2). Now Alice is holding an onion.\n  Turn 41: Change orientation to down (D) to face the pot.\n  Turn 42: Interact (I) to put the onion in the pot. Now pot has 2 onions.\n\nNow we need one more onion. Alice is at (2,1) holding nothing (after putting). She can go to get another onion? There is one at (6,1). Or Bob might bring his.\n\nBut Bob is at (4,3) holding an onion. He can try to come to (2,0) to put his onion. How? \n  Bob is at (4,3). He can go west: (3,3) [L] -> (2,3) [L]. Then from (2,3) he can face down to interact with the pot at (2,0)? But he is at (2,3) and the pot is at (2,0) -> two tiles away. He must be at (2,1) or (1,0) or (3,0) to be adjacent. (1,0) is kitchen counter -> non-walkable. (3,0) is kitchen counter -> non-walkable. (2,1) is where Alice is? At turn 42, Alice is at (2,1). So Bob cannot be there. So he cannot put directly.\n\nBob can put his onion on a counter near the pot. The nearest counter is (2,2) but we just picked up the onion, so it's empty. Bob can go to (2,3) and face down to interact with (2,2)? But (2,2) is south of (2,3). So if he is at (2,3) and faces down (D), he can interact with (2,2) to place his onion. Then Alice can pick it up and put it in the pot.\n\nAlice is at (2,1). After Bob places the onion on (2,2), Alice can face up and interact to pick it up, then face down and interact to put in the pot.\n\nSo if Bob does that, then:\n\n  After turn 42, Alice is at (2,1) empty. She can:\n      Turn 43: Change orientation to up (U) to face (2,2)\n      Turn 44: Interact (I) to pick up the onion from (2,2) (placed by Bob)\n      Turn 45: Change orientation to down (D)\n      Turn 46: Interact (I) to put the onion in the pot.\n\nThen the pot has 3 onions and cooking starts at turn 46. It will be ready at turn 46+5 = 51.\n\nBut we cannot control Bob, so this might not happen.\n\nAlternatively, Alice can go to get the onion at (6,1) after she has two in the pot. But that is far.\n\nGiven the time, and that we are at turn 36, and we want to maximize reward, we should try to complete one soup quickly.\n\nBut there's another onion at (6,1). After Alice has put two onions in the pot at (2,0), she can go to (6,1) to pick up that onion and bring it to the pot.\n\nHow many turns?\n  From (2,1) to (6,1):\n      (2,1) -> (3,1) [R] -> (4,1) [R] -> (5,1) [R] -> then at (5,1) she can interact with (6,1) by facing east? But she is at (5,1) and (6,1) is east. So she needs to face right (R) and interact.\n\n  Steps:\n      Turn 43: Move right to (3,1)\n      Turn 44: Move right to (4,1)\n      Turn 45: Move right to (5,1)\n      Turn 46: Change orientation to right (R) to face (6,1)\n      Turn 47: Interact (I) to pick up the onion from (6,1)\n      Turn 48: Change orientation to left (L) to face west\n      Turn 49: Move left to (4,1)\n      Turn 50: Move left to (3,1)\n      Turn 51: Move left to (2,1)\n      Turn 52: Change orientation to down (D) to face the pot\n      Turn 53: Interact (I) to put the onion in the pot.\n\nThen the soup starts cooking at turn 53, ready at turn 58.\n\nThen we need to serve it. We need a plate. Plate dispenser at (0,2). Alice is at (2,1). She can go to (0,2) to get a plate? But (0,2) is a plate dispenser. She must be adjacent. Adjacent tiles: (0,1), (0,3), (1,2). (0,1) is kitchen counter -> non-walkable. (0,3) is kitchen counter -> non-walkable. (1,2) is empty? (1,2) is not listed as non-empty, so empty. So she can stand at (1,2) and face west to interact with (0,2).\n\n  Steps from (2,1) to (1,2):\n      (2,1) -> (2,2) is blocked (kitchen counter). So she must go up to (2,2)? No. Alternatively: (2,1) -> (1,1)? (1,1) is empty? Then (1,1) -> (1,2) [U]. Then at (1,2) face west (L) to interact.\n\n  So:\n      Turn 54: Move up to (2,2) is not allowed. Instead, move left to (1,1) [L] (if (1,1) is empty)\n      Turn 55: Move up to (1,2) [U]\n      Turn 56: Change orientation to left (L) to face (0,2)\n      Turn 57: Interact (I) to grab a plate.\n\nThen she must bring the plate to the pot at (2,0) to serve the soup. But the soup is at (2,0) and she is at (1,2). She can go:\n      (1,2) -> (1,1) [D] -> (2,1) [R] -> then at (2,1) face down to interact with the pot.\n\n  Turn 58: Move down to (1,1) [D]\n  Turn 59: Move right to (2,1) [R]\n  Turn 60: Change orientation to down (D) to face the pot\n  Turn 61: Interact (I) to serve the soup.\n\nThen she delivers the soup? No, she must take the soup (now in a plate) to the serving counter. The serving counter is at (6,2). So after she serves the soup from the pot to her plate, she is holding the soup. Then she must take it to (6,2). How?\n\n  From (2,1) to (6,2):\n      (2,1) -> (3,1) [R] -> (4,1) [R] -> (5,1) [R] -> (5,2) [U] -> then at (5,2) face east to interact with (6,2) (serving counter).\n\n  Steps:\n      Turn 62: Move right to (3,1)\n      Turn 63: Move right to (4,1)\n      Turn 64: Move right to (5,1)\n      Turn 65: Move up to (5,2)\n      Turn 66: Change orientation to right (R) to face (6,2)\n      Turn 67: Interact (I) to deliver.\n\nThis is turn 67, and the soup was ready at turn 58, so it's not burned? The soup doesn't burn? The problem doesn't say, but usually in Overcooked, soup doesn't burn. It just stays until served.\n\nBut this is very long and we only get one soup.\n\nAlternatively, after the soup is cooked, we can have Bob serve it? But we don't control Bob.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that we are only planning for Alice, and we want to maximize the reward, we should try to complete the soup as fast as possible with minimal reliance on Bob.\n\nBut the fastest way is to use the pot at (4,0) and hope that Bob puts his onion on (4,2) and then Alice can use it.\n\nPlan for Alice:\n\nTurn 36: Interact (I) to put onion in pot at (4,0). Now Alice is empty at (4,1).\n\nThen, she can wait for Bob to put his onion on (4,2). But we don't know if he will. If he does, then Alice can pick it up and put it in the pot.\n\nSo:\n  Turn 36: I\n\n  Then, if by turn 37, Bob has placed the onion on (4,2), then Alice can:\n      Turn 37: Change orientation to up (U) to face (4,2)\n      Turn 38: Interact (I) to pick up the onion\n      Turn 39: Change orientation to down (D)\n      Turn 40: Interact (I) to put the onion in the pot.\n\n  Now the pot has 2 onions. Then Alice can go to (6,1) to get the onion there.\n\n  Turn 41: Move right to (5,1) [R]\n  Turn 42: Change orientation to right (R) to face (6,1)\n  Turn 43: Interact (I) to pick up the onion\n  Turn 44: Change orientation to left (L)\n  Turn 45: Move left to (4,1) [L]\n  Turn 46: Change orientation to down (D)\n  Turn 47: Interact (I) to put the onion in the pot.\n\n  Now the pot has 3 onions at turn 47. Cooking starts and will be ready at turn 52.\n\n  Then Alice can go get a plate from (0,2) and then serve.\n\nBut again, long.\n\nHowever, if at turn 36 Alice puts her onion in the pot, and then immediately goes to (6,1) to get the onion there, then brings it back, that's:\n\n  Turn 36: I (put onion in pot at (4,0)) -> empty\n  Turn 37: Move right to (5,1) [R]\n  Turn 38: Change orientation to right (R) to face (6,1)\n  Turn 39: Interact (I) to pick up the onion at (6,1)\n  Turn 40: Change orientation to left (L)\n  Turn 41: Move left to (4,1) [L]\n  Turn 42: Change orientation to down (D)\n  Turn 43: Interact (I) to put onion in pot -> now pot has 2 onions.\n\nThen we need one more. She can go to (2,2) to get that onion.\n\n  Turn 44: Move left to (3,1) [L]\n  Turn 45: Move left to (2,1) [L]\n  Turn 46: Change orientation to up (U) to face (2,2)\n  Turn 47: Interact (I) to pick up the onion from (2,2)\n  Turn 48: Change orientation to down (D)\n  Turn 49: Move right to (3,1) [R]\n  Turn 50: Move right to (4,1) [R]\n  Turn 51: Change orientation to down (D)\n  Turn 52: Interact (I) to put onion in pot -> now 3 onions at turn 52. Cooking starts, ready at 57.\n\nThen get a plate and serve.\n\nStill long.\n\nPerhaps we can have Alice and Bob both work on different tasks. For example, after Alice puts her onion in the pot, she can go get a plate while Bob brings the remaining onions.\n\nBut we can't control Bob.\n\nGiven the time constraints, and that we are at turn 36, it might be better to start the soup with the pot at (4,0) and then have Alice focus on getting the plate and let Bob handle the ingredients.\n\nBut without knowing Bob's actions, it's risky.\n\nAnother idea: Alice can use the onion she is holding to start the soup, then go get a plate, and then when the soup is ready, she can serve it. But we need three onions in the pot. So if she only puts one, it doesn't start cooking.\n\nSo the only way is to get three onions in the pot.\n\nGiven that there are two onions on counters and two in players' hands, we can have both players work on filling the pot.\n\nBut for Alice's actions, the initial move should be to put her onion in the nearest pot.\n\nSo at turn 36: Alice should put the onion in the pot at (4,0) by interacting.\n\nThen, she can try to facilitate by going to pick up the onion at (6,1) or (2,2) or to get a plate.\n\nBut the most direct is to go for the onion at (6,1) because it's closer to the pot at (4,0).\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 36: I (put onion in pot at (4,0))\nTurn 37: R (move to (5,1))\nTurn 38: R (change orientation to right? But move actions change orientation too. \n The action \"Move\" (L/R/U/D) changes position and orientation. So if she moves right, she ends up facing right.\n\n So at turn 37: R -> move to (5,1) and face right.\n Then at (5,1) and facing right, she can interact with (6,1) to pick up the onion.\n Turn 38: I (pick up onion from (6,1))\n Then she is holding an onion. She must put it in the pot.\n Turn 39: L (change orientation to left? But move actions also change orientation. She can use a move left to go to (4,1) and face left, but then she would be facing west, not south. Then she would have to change orientation to south to interact with the pot.\n\n Alternatively, she can move left to (4,1) and then change orientation to down, then interact.\n\n So:\n Turn 39: L (move left to (4,1), now facing west)\n Turn 40: D (change orientation to down) [or use a move down? But move down would go to (4,0) which is non-walkable. So she can only change orientation.\n Turn 41: I (interact to put onion in pot)\n\n Now the pot has two onions.\n\n Then she can go to (2,2) to get the last onion.\n\n Turn 42: L (move left to (3,1), facing west)\n Turn 43: L (move left to (2,1), facing west)\n Turn 44: U (change orientation to up) to face (2,2)\n Turn 45: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\n Turn 46: D (change orientation to down)\n Turn 47: R (move right to (3,1), facing east)\n Turn 48: R (move right to (4,1), facing east)\n Turn 49: D (change orientation to down)\n Turn 50: I (put onion in pot)\n\n Now the pot has three onions at turn 50. Cooking starts, ready at turn 55.\n\n Then she can go get a plate.\n\nThis is still many turns.\n\nAlternatively, after the pot has two onions (at turn 41), if Bob has put his onion on (4,2), then Alice can pick it up from (4,1) by facing up.\n\nSo at turn 42: if (4,2) has an onion, Alice can:\n      Turn 42: U (change orientation to up)\n      Turn 43: I (pick up onion from (4,2))\n      Turn 44: D (change orientation to down)\n      Turn 45: I (put in pot)\n\n This is faster: at turn 45 the pot has 3 onions.\n\n So we can plan until turn 45 and hope that by turn 42, (4,2) has an onion placed by Bob.\n\n But if not, then at turn 42, if there's no onion, she must do something else.\n\n Given the uncertainty, but in the spirit of collaboration, we can assume that Bob will deposit his onion on (4,2) soon.\n\n Bob's action history: R, U, I, R, R. The last action is R (move right) at turn 35? Because turn 36 is current, and action history is for the passed turns.\n\n At turn 36, Bob might act. He is at (4,3) facing right, holding an onion. He might move or interact.\n\n If he is smart, he will deposit the onion on (4,2) by turning down and interacting.\n\n So possibly at turn 36, Bob will:\n      Change orientation to down (D) and then interact (I) to place the onion on (4,2).\n\n Then at turn 36, when Alice does her action (put in pot), then at the end of turn 36, the onion is on (4,2).\n\n Then at turn 37, Alice can face up and pick it up.\n\n So for Alice:\n\n Turn 36: I (put in pot at (4,0)) -> now empty.\n Turn 37: U (change orientation to up) to face (4,2)\n Turn 38: I (pick up onion from (4,2))\n Turn 39: D (change orientation to down)\n Turn 40: I (put in pot) -> now the pot has 2+1=3 onions (because she put one at turn 36, then the one from (4,2) at turn 40, and she also put one from her own hand at turn 36? No.\n\n Let's clarify:\n\n - At turn 36: Alice puts her onion in the pot. The pot then has 1 onion.\n - Then she picks up the onion from (4,2) (placed by Bob) at turn 38.\n - Then she puts that onion in the pot at turn 40. Now the pot has 2 onions.\n\n So we still need one more.\n\n This is because the onion from (4,2) is only one. We need two more after the first.\n\n So this only gives two in total.\n\n We need three. So after Alice puts the onion from (4,2) in, the pot has only two.\n\n So she still needs to get one more onion.\n\n Therefore, the earlier plan of going to (6,1) is still needed.\n\n Given the complexity, and that we must plan for Alice, and we are not sure about Bob, I think the best initial move is to put the onion in the nearest pot.\n\n So for turn 36: Alice should interact to put the onion in the pot at (4,0).\n\n Then, in the subsequent turns, she can go to (6,1) to pick up the onion there and bring it back.\n\n So the first few turns for Alice:\n\n Turn 36: I\n Turn 37: R (move to (5,1), facing right)\n Turn 38: I (interact with (6,1) to pick up the onion)\n Turn 39: L (move to (4,1), facing left) -> but then she is at (4,1) facing west, not south.\n Turn 40: D (change orientation to down)\n Turn 41: I (put onion in pot) -> now pot has 2 onions.\n\n Then she can go to (2,2) for the last onion, as in the long plan.\n\n But to save turns, after turn 38, when she picks up the onion at (6,1), she is at (5,1) facing right. She can then move left twice and then down to interact, but she can't move into the pot.\n\n So turn 39: L ( to (4,1), facing left)\n turn 40: D (change to down)\n turn 41: I (put in pot)\n\n Then for the last onion, she goes to (2,2).\n\n Turn 42: L ( to (3,1), facing left)\n Turn 43: L ( to (2,1), facing left)\n Turn 44: U (change to up)\n Turn 45: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\n Turn 46: D (change to down)\n Turn 47: R ( to (3,1), facing right)\n Turn 48: R ( to (4,1), facing right)\n Turn 49: D (change to down)\n Turn 50: I ( put in pot)\n\n Then at turn 50, the soup starts cooking.\n\n Then she can get a plate.\n\n Given the instruction to plan for the next several turns (H turns), and H is not specified, but we can plan for 15 turns or until we have the soup cooking.\n\n But the serving will be later.\n\n Since the task is to maximize the reward, and we are not sure if we can complete more than one soup, and the game might continue, but for now, we focus on this soup.\n\n Therefore, I will plan for Alice for turns 36 to 50.\n\n But the answer format only shows actions for Alice.\n\n So:\n\n Turn 36: I\n Turn 37: R\n Turn 38: I\n Turn 39: L\n Turn 40: D\n Turn 41: I\n Turn 42: L\n Turn 43: L\n Turn 44: U\n Turn 45: I\n Turn 46: D\n Turn 47: R\n Turn 48: R\n Turn 49: D\n Turn 50: I\n\n This is 15 actions.\n\n But note that at turn 41, the pot has 2 onions, and at turn 50, we add the third.\n\n However, between turn 36 and 50, Bob might have added his onion, but we can't rely on it.\n\n This is a conservative plan.\n\n Alternatively, after turn 41 ( when the pot has 2 onions), if (4,2) has an onion ( placed by Bob), then Alice can use that instead of going to (2,2).\n\n But since we can't branch in the plan, we must have a fixed sequence.\n\n Given the constraints, this is a solid plan.\n\n So the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 36: I\nTurn 37: R\nTurn 38: I\nTurn 39: L\nTurn 40: D\nTurn 41: I\nTurn 42: L\nTurn 43: L\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: I\nTurn 46: D\nTurn 47: R\nTurn 48: R\nTurn 49: D\nTurn 50: I\n}\n\n This gets the third onion into the pot at turn 50.\n\n Then the soup will be ready at turn 55, and Alice can then go get a plate and serve, but that is beyond turn 50.\n\n We have planned for 15 turns (36 to 50).\n\n We hope that in the meantime, Bob will do useful things.\n\n Note: This is a plan for Alice only.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice should focus on filling the pot at (4,0) with three onions to start cooking the soup recipe (3 onions, reward 20). The plan leverages existing onions on counters and minimizes movement by prioritizing nearby resources. Alice's current onion is added to the pot first. She then collects the onion at (6,1) and brings it back to the pot. Finally, she retrieves the onion from (2,2) to complete the pot. This sequence ensures the soup starts cooking efficiently, with the third onion added at turn 50.\n\n**Action Sequence for Alice (turns 36 to 50):**\n- **Turn 36:** Interact (`I`) to add Alice's onion to the pot at (4,0). The pot now has 1 onion.\n- **Turn 37:** Move right (`R`) to (5,1), facing right.\n- **Turn 38:** Interact (`I`) to pick up the onion from the kitchen counter at (6,1).\n- **Turn 39:** Move left (`L`) to (4,1), facing left.\n- **Turn 40:** Change orientation down (`D`) to face the pot.\n- **Turn 41:** Interact (`I`) to add the onion to the pot. The pot now has 2 onions.\n- **Turn 42:** Move left (`L`) to (3,1), facing left.\n- **Turn 43:** Move left (`L`) to (2,1), facing left.\n- **Turn 44:** Change orientation up (`U`) to face the kitchen counter at (2,2).\n- **Turn 45:** Interact (`I`) to pick up the onion from (2,2).\n- **Turn 46:** Change orientation down (`D`) to face the pot.\n- **Turn 47:** Move right (`R`) to (3,1), facing right.\n- **Turn 48:** Move right (`R`) to (4,1), facing right.\n- **Turn 49:** Change orientation down (`D`) to face the pot.\n- **Turn 50:** Interact (`I`) to add the onion to the pot. The pot now has 3 onions, and cooking starts (will finish at turn 55).\n\nAfter turn 50, the soup will be ready at turn 55. Alice should then focus on getting a plate from (0,2) and serving the cooked soup at (6,2) to claim the reward. This plan assumes Bob may independently contribute (e.g., by delivering the soup or assisting with plates), but it is self-contained for Alice.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 36: I\nTurn 37: R\nTurn 38: I\nTurn 39: L\nTurn 40: D\nTurn 41: I\nTurn 42: L\nTurn 43: L\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: I\nTurn 46: D\nTurn 47: R\nTurn 48: R\nTurn 49: D\nTurn 50: I\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 39. The goal is to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes.\n\nEnvironment:\n- Kitchen Counters: listed positions, some have onions (see state)\n- Onion Dispensers: (2,4) and (4,4)\n- Plate Dispenser: (0,2)\n- Pots: (2,0) and (4,0)\n- Serving Counter: (6,2)\n\nRecipe: Only one recipe defined: 3 onions, 5 turns cooking, reward 20.\n\nCurrent state:\n- Alice: at (3,1), facing down (D), holding nothing.\n- Bob: at (3,3), facing left (L), holding nothing.\n\nKitchen counters with onions: (6,1), (2,2), (4,2), (3,0) -> note (3,0) is a kitchen counter that has an onion.\n\nPots are empty.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob) for the next several turns (H turns). Since the recipe requires 3 onions and cooking time is 5 turns, we must plan carefully.\n\nStrategy:\n1. We have onions already available on some kitchen counters. We can use these to fill the pot without going to the dispenser.\n2. There are two pots: (2,0) and (4,0). We can use one of them.\n\nPlan for Alice and Bob:\n\nFirst, note the positions:\n- Alice is at (3,1). She is one step above the kitchen counter at (3,0) which has an onion. But she is facing down. To pick up the onion at (3,0), she needs to be adjacent and facing it. (3,0) is below (3,1). Since she is facing down, she is already facing (3,0). But she is at (3,1) and (3,0) is adjacent below. So she can interact to pick up the onion? However, note: (3,0) is a kitchen counter with an onion. So if Alice interacts while facing down at (3,1), she can pick up the onion from (3,0).\n\nBut let me check: the interaction rule: the player must be on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and facing it. (3,1) is above (3,0) and adjacent. She is facing down, so she is facing (3,0). So she can pick up the onion.\n\nSo at turn 39 (current turn), Alice can do:\nTurn 39: I -> interact to pick up the onion from (3,0).\n\nBut wait: the action history for Alice ends with I (which was at turn 38). Now at turn 39, we are planning the next action. So we are to plan starting at turn 39.\n\nHowever, note that the state is given at the beginning of turn 39. So we plan the action for turn 39.\n\nSo Alice at (3,1) facing down: she can interact to pick up the onion from (3,0). Then she will be holding an onion.\n\nThen what? We need to put the onion into a pot. The nearest pot is at (2,0) or (4,0). (2,0) is at left: from (3,1) to (2,0): move left to (2,1) then down to (2,0). But note (2,0) is a pot, so we can't step on it. We must be adjacent and facing it to interact.\n\nAlternatively, (4,0) is to the right: from (3,1) to (4,1) then down to (4,0).\n\nBut we have Bob at (3,3). He can help too.\n\nLet's assign roles:\n\nOption: Use the pot at (4,0) for cooking.\n\nPlan for Alice:\n1. At (3,1): pick up onion from (3,0) by interacting (I). Then she holds onion.\n2. Then she can go to (4,0) to put the onion in the pot. How?\n   - From (3,1) to (4,0): \n        Step 1: move right to (4,1) [action R]\n        Step 2: face down (if not already) and interact to put onion in pot at (4,0). But note: at (4,1) she is above (4,0) and facing down? After moving right to (4,1), her orientation is right? We must change orientation to down? Or we can change during the move? Actually, the move action changes position and orientation. So when she moves right to (4,1), she will be facing right. Then she must change orientation to down (action D? but D is move down, which would take her to (4,0) but (4,0) is a pot, so she cannot move there. So she must use a change orientation action? But the actions are: Move (which changes orientation) or Change Orientation (which doesn't move) or Interact.\n\nAlternatively, after moving to (4,1), she can use a separate action to change orientation to down (using the 'D' action? But note: the 'D' action without moving? Actually, the problem says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" But in this case, the adjacent tile (below) is (4,0) which is a pot (non-empty). So if she does a 'D' action, it will only change her orientation to down without moving. Then she can interact.\n\nSo:\n   Turn 39: I (pick up onion at (3,0))\n   Turn 40: R (move right to (4,1), now facing right)\n   Turn 41: D (change orientation to down, without moving because (4,0) is non-empty) -> now facing the pot at (4,0)\n   Turn 42: I (put onion into the pot)\n\nNow the pot at (4,0) has one onion. We need two more.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob is at (3,3). He can help by bringing another onion. There are onions available at:\n- (6,1): kitchen counter (but it's far)\n- (2,2): kitchen counter\n- (4,2): kitchen counter\n\nNearest to Bob: (3,3) is above (3,2) which is a kitchen counter? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter and according to the state, it is not listed as having an item? The non-empty kitchen counters are: (6,1) (onion), (2,2) (onion), (4,2) (onion), (3,0) (onion). Note (3,0) is now being taken by Alice at turn39, so after that it will be empty? But we don't know if it gets replenished? We don't have that info. So we rely on existing ones.\n\nAt (3,3), Bob is facing left. He can move to (2,3) or (4,3) or down to (3,2). But (3,2) is a kitchen counter. If it has an item? The state says non-empty kitchen counters include (2,2) and (4,2) and (6,1) and (3,0). (3,2) is a kitchen counter but it is not listed as having an item, so it is empty.\n\nSo Bob can go to (2,2) to get an onion? (2,2) is at (2,2). Bob at (3,3): \n- Move left to (2,3) [action L] -> now at (2,3) facing left.\n- Then move down to (2,2) [action D] -> but (2,2) is a kitchen counter and has an onion? Yes, according to state. But when he moves down from (2,3) to (2,2), that tile is non-empty? So he cannot move onto it. He must be adjacent and facing it to interact.\n\nSo better: from (3,3) facing left, move left to (2,3). Then at (2,3) he is above (2,2). He can change orientation to down (if he isn't already) and then interact to pick up the onion.\n\nBut after moving left to (2,3), he is facing left? Then he must change orientation to down (action D) without moving because (2,2) is non-empty? Then interact.\n\nSo Bob's plan:\nTurn 39: L (move left to (2,3), facing left)\nTurn 40: D (change orientation to down, now facing (2,2))\nTurn 41: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\n\nThen he is holding an onion. Then he can take it to the pot at (4,0) or (2,0). The pot at (2,0) is closer? (2,0) is at (2,0). From (2,3) to (2,0): \n- Move down to (2,2) -> but (2,2) is non-empty? He can't move onto it. So he must go around? Or use another route.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,3) to (3,3) to (3,2) but (3,2) is a kitchen counter (empty) so he can step on it? No, the problem says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and kitchen counters are non-empty? Actually, the tile types: kitchen counter is a non-empty tile? The problem says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and kitchen counters are one of the non-empty tiles. So he cannot step on (2,2) or any kitchen counter, pot, etc.\n\nSo he must go via (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) is a kitchen counter, so he cannot step on it. So he must go to (3,3) then (4,3) then (4,2) but (4,2) is a kitchen counter and non-empty? It has an onion, so he cannot step on it.\n\nSo the only way is to go down from (2,3) to (2,2) is blocked. He must go left/right and then down? But the grid: what are the walkable tiles?\n\nWe have:\n- The grid is 7x5? From (0,0) to (6,4). We have empty tiles and the non-empty ones are the counters, dispensers, pots, etc.\n\nActually, the only walkable tiles are the empty ones. So Bob at (2,3) is at an empty tile? We assume that (2,3) is an empty tile because it's not listed as non-empty. Similarly, (3,3) is not in the non-empty list? But the non-empty tiles are the ones with objects (like dispensers, counters, etc). The player positions are on empty tiles? Because they can't be on non-empty.\n\nSo Bob at (3,3) is on an empty tile. (2,3) is also empty? Then from (2,3) he can move down? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter (non-empty) so he cannot move down to (2,2). He must move to (2,4) or (1,3) but we don't know the layout of the grid beyond the given non-empty tiles.\n\nWe know the positions of non-empty tiles. The empty tiles are the rest. So to get from (2,3) to (2,0), he must go around. One way: \n(2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) but (1,0) is a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters are at: (0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), ... So (1,0) is a kitchen counter. So he can't step on (1,0). Similarly, (1,2) is not listed? So it might be empty.\n\nBut we don't have the full grid layout. We only know the non-empty tiles. So we must assume that any tile not in the non-empty list is empty and walkable.\n\nBut we know the non-empty tiles: the list provided. So (1,3) is not in the non-empty list? So it's empty. Similarly, (1,2) is not in the non-empty list? So it's empty. (1,1) is not in the non-empty list? So it's empty. But (1,0) is a kitchen counter (non-empty). So from (2,3) to (1,3) [left], then (1,2) [down], then (1,1) [down], then (2,1) [right]? Then (2,0) is below (2,1). But (2,0) is a pot (non-empty) so we can't step on it. So at (2,1) we can face down and interact with the pot at (2,0).\n\nBut that is a long path.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can go to the pot at (4,0) which might be easier? From (2,3) he can go right to (3,3), then right to (4,3), then down to (4,2) -> but (4,2) is non-empty (kitchen counter with onion) so he can't step on it. Then he must go around: (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (5,2) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) -> then to (4,0) by interacting from (4,1).\n\nBut that is also long.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can pick up the onion at (4,2) which is closer? He is at (3,3). He can move right to (4,3) [action R], then change orientation to down (action D) to face (4,2) and interact to pick up the onion. Then from (4,3) he can move down? But (4,2) is non-empty so he can't step there. Then he can go to (4,1) by: (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (5,2) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) -> then put the onion in the pot at (4,0) by facing down and interacting.\n\nBut again, long.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the kitchen counter at (4,2) and (2,2) as storage and have Alice and Bob collect the onions and then put them in the same pot.\n\nBut note: we have two pots. We can use both? But we only have one recipe? And we don't have multiple plate dispensers? Only one plate dispenser at (0,2). So we can only serve one soup at a time? Actually, we can have multiple plates? The plate dispenser can be used multiple times? But the problem doesn't say it runs out.\n\nBut to maximize reward, we want to deliver multiple soups? However, the recipe requires 3 onions per soup. We have 4 onions available (on counters: (6,1), (2,2), (4,2), and (3,0) which Alice is about to take). So we can make one soup with 3 onions and have one left.\n\nBut let's focus on one soup first.\n\nRevised plan:\n\nWe'll use the pot at (4,0). Alice will put one onion (from (3,0)) and then Bob will put one onion (from (4,2)) and then we need a third.\n\nBut who gets the third? Alice or Bob?\n\nAlternatively, after Alice puts her onion, she can get another onion from a counter and put it.\n\nBut she is near (4,0) after putting the first onion. Then she can go to (4,2) to pick up the onion? But (4,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion. From (4,1) (after putting the onion, she is at (4,1) facing down). She can move up to (4,2)? But (4,2) is non-empty? So she can't step on it. She must be adjacent and facing it. So from (4,1) she is below (4,2)? No, (4,2) is above? Because y increases upwards? The problem says: U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1). So (4,1) is at y=1, (4,2) is at y=2 (above). So she is at (4,1) and (4,2) is above. She is currently facing down? After putting the onion, she is still facing down. So she must change orientation to up? Then interact to pick up the onion at (4,2).\n\nSo:\nAfter Alice puts the onion at turn42 (at pot (4,0)), she is at (4,1) facing down.\nThen:\nTurn 43: U (change orientation to up, now facing (4,2))\nTurn 44: I (pick up onion from (4,2))\n\nThen she is holding an onion. Then she can put it in the pot at (4,0) again? But she is at (4,1) and the pot is below. So she must change orientation to down and interact? But she is facing up. So:\nTurn 45: D (change orientation to down, facing (4,0))\nTurn 46: I (put the second onion)\n\nBut we need a third. Meanwhile, Bob can get another onion.\n\nBob at (3,3) can go to (2,2) to get an onion? But as before, he must go via a long path? Alternatively, he can get the onion from (6,1) or (2,2). Let's try a shorter one: the onion at (2,2). How to get from (3,3) to (2,2) without stepping on non-empty? \n- (3,3) -> (2,3) [left] -> (2,2) is below but non-empty. So he must go to (1,3) then (1,2) then (1,1) then (2,1). Then at (2,1) he can face down to interact with the pot at (2,0)? Or face up to interact with (2,2)? (2,2) is above (2,1). So at (2,1) facing up, he can interact to pick up the onion at (2,2). Then he can put it in the pot at (2,0) or (4,0). But we are using (4,0). So he must go to (4,0) to put it? That would be a long path.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can go to the onion at (6,1): \n- From (3,3): move right to (4,3), then (5,3), then (6,3) [right, right]. Then at (6,3) he is above (6,2) which is the serving counter? But (6,2) is non-empty. Then he must go to (6,4)? But (6,4) is not in non-empty? Probably empty. Then down to (6,3) is already there? Wait: from (6,3) to (6,2) cannot because non-empty. So he must go to (6,4) [up]? But (6,4) is not listed as non-empty? Then from (6,4) he can move down? No, because (6,3) is empty and (6,2) is non-empty. So to get to (6,1), he must go: (6,3) -> (5,3) -> (5,2) -> (5,1) -> (6,1). But (5,2) and (5,1) are not non-empty? So they are empty. Then at (5,1) he can face right to interact with (6,1) which is the kitchen counter with onion? (6,1) is to the right of (5,1). So he can pick it up.\n\nBut that is also long.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Bob get the onion from (4,2) while Alice is doing her things? But Alice is going to take the onion at (4,2) in our plan above? So if Bob takes it, then Alice cannot.\n\nLet me change the plan:\n\nWe have two pots. We can use the pot at (2,0) for one soup and (4,0) for another? But we only have 4 onions: one already taken by Alice (from (3,0)), and three left on counters. We can put two onions in one pot and one in another? But we need three per soup.\n\nAlternatively, we can have one pot with three onions and the other with one? But the one with one won't cook because it needs three.\n\nSo better to focus on one soup.\n\nPlan for one soup in pot (4,0):\n\n- Alice: \n   Turn39: I (pick up onion from (3,0) at (3,1))\n   Then she holds onion.\n   Turn40: R (move right to (4,1), facing right)\n   Turn41: D (change orientation to down to face pot (4,0))\n   Turn42: I (put onion in pot at (4,0)) -> now pot has 1 onion.\n\n   Now Alice is at (4,1) facing down. She can get the onion from (4,2) above? \n   Turn43: U (change orientation to up to face (4,2))\n   Turn44: I (pick up onion from (4,2)) -> now holds onion.\n   Turn45: D (change orientation to down to face (4,0))\n   Turn46: I (put onion in pot) -> now pot has 2 onions.\n\n   Now she needs one more. The nearest available is at (2,2) or (6,1). (2,2) is closer? From (4,1) to (2,2):\n        Move left to (3,1) [action L] -> now at (3,1) facing left? \n        Then move up to (3,2) -> but (3,2) is a kitchen counter? And it is empty? So she can step on it? No, because it's non-empty? The kitchen counter is non-empty even if it doesn't have an item? The problem says: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and it is a tile type. So the tile is non-empty regardless of whether it holds an item? So she cannot step on (3,2). \n\n        So she must go around: \n        From (4,1): move up to (4,2) is not possible. So move left to (3,1) [action L] -> at (3,1) facing left.\n        Then move up to (3,2) -> cannot because non-empty. So move left to (2,1) [action L] -> at (2,1) facing left.\n        Then at (2,1) she is below (2,2) and can face up to interact? \n        Turn47: L (from (4,1) to (3,1)) -> but wait, she is at (4,1) at turn46 after putting the onion. Then:\n        Turn47: L (move left to (3,1), facing left)\n        Turn48: U (change orientation to up) -> now facing (3,2) but (3,2) is a kitchen counter (non-empty) and it is adjacent? (3,2) is above (3,1). But she is at (3,1) and facing up, so she is facing (3,2). But (3,2) is empty? The state says non-empty kitchen counters are the ones with items, but the tile itself is non-empty? So she cannot step on it, but can she interact? Yes, to pick up an item if present? But the state says (3,2) is a kitchen counter but not listed as having an item? So it is empty. Then she cannot pick up anything. \n\n        So she must go to (2,2) which has an onion. From (3,1) to (2,1) [action L] at turn48? Then at (2,1) she is below (2,2). \n        Turn48: L (from (3,1) to (2,1), facing left) \n        Turn49: U (change orientation to up, facing (2,2))\n        Turn50: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\n\n        Then she holds onion. Then she must go back to (4,0) to put it? That is long.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can be used to get the third onion.\n\nBob's plan in parallel:\n\nBob is at (3,3) at turn39. We can have him go to (2,2) to get the onion? But again, he can't step on (2,2). So he must go to (2,1) to interact with (2,2) from below.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (2,1):\n- Move left to (2,3) [L]\n- Move down? Can't to (2,2). So move to (1,3) [L again]? But (1,3) is empty? Then (1,2) [D], then (1,1) [D], then (2,1) [R]. \nSo:\nTurn39: L (to (2,3))\nTurn40: L (to (1,3)) -> facing left\nTurn41: D (to (1,2)) -> facing down\nTurn42: D (to (1,1)) -> facing down\nTurn43: R (to (2,1)) -> facing right\nTurn44: U (change orientation to up to face (2,2))\nTurn45: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\n\nThen he is holding an onion. Then he needs to put it in the pot at (4,0). From (2,1) to (4,0):\n- Move right to (3,1) [R] -> but (3,1) might be occupied by Alice? We have to coordinate.\n- Then to (4,1) [R], then face down and interact.\n\nBut at turn45, Alice is at turn46 in her plan? We need to synchronize.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Bob get the onion from (6,1) which might be easier? From (3,3) to (6,1):\n- Move right to (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) [R,R,R]\n- Then move down? Can't to (6,2). So move to (6,4) [U] if available? Then to (5,4) [L]? But (5,4) is not non-empty? Then (5,3) [D], (5,2) [D], (5,1) [D], then (6,1) is to the right. At (5,1) face right to interact with (6,1).\n\nBut that is very long.\n\nGiven the time, let's focus on Alice doing two onions and Bob doing one.\n\nBut Bob's path to (2,1) takes until turn45 to pick up the onion. Then he can go to (4,0) by:\n\nFrom (2,1) to (4,1): \n- Move right to (3,1) [R] -> turn46\n- Move right to (4,1) [R] -> turn47\n- Then face down [D] -> turn48\n- Interact to put onion [I] -> turn49\n\nMeanwhile, Alice after putting two onions at turn46 is at (4,1) (after turn46). But then she moves away to get the third onion. But at turn47 she moves to (3,1), turn48 to (2,1) (but then Bob is coming to (3,1) at turn46? We have to avoid collision.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative simpler plan: use the available onions and have both players work on the same pot.\n\nBut note: we have an onion at (6,1) and one at (2,2) and one at (4,2) and one at (3,0). Alice takes (3,0) and (4,2) for two onions, then the third from (2,2) or (6,1). But (2,2) is closer to the pot at (2,0) so we can use that pot instead.\n\nChange plan: use the pot at (2,0) for the soup.\n\nAlice's new plan:\nTurn39: I (pick up onion from (3,0) at (3,1))\nTurn40: L (move left to (2,1), facing left) -> because (2,0) is below (2,1)\nTurn41: D (change orientation to down to face (2,0))\nTurn42: I (put onion in pot (2,0)) -> now pot has 1 onion.\n\nThen she can get another onion. The closest is at (2,2): from (2,1) she is below (2,2). \nTurn43: U (change orientation to up to face (2,2))\nTurn44: I (pick up onion from (2,2)) -> holds onion.\nTurn45: D (change orientation to down to face (2,0))\nTurn46: I (put onion in pot) -> now 2 onions.\n\nThen she needs one more. The next closest is (4,2) or (3,0) is empty now? or (6,1). (4,2) is at (4,2). From (2,1) to (4,2):\n- Move right to (3,1) [R] -> turn47\n- Move right to (4,1) [R] -> turn48\n- Then face up to (4,2) [U] -> turn49\n- Interact to pick up [I] -> turn50\n- Then face down [D] -> turn51\n- Interact to put in pot at (2,0)? But she is at (4,1) and the pot is at (2,0) which is far. Alternatively, put in the pot at (4,0) which is below (4,1). But then we have two pots with 2 and 1 onions? Not good.\n\nBob can help by getting the third onion to (2,0).\n\nBob at (3,3) can go to (4,2) to get the onion and bring it to (2,0)? But (4,2) is east of (3,3). \nFrom (3,3) to (4,2):\n- Move right to (4,3) [R] -> turn39\n- Face down to (4,2) [D] (change orientation) -> turn40\n- Interact to pick up onion from (4,2) [I] -> turn41\n- Then he holds onion.\n- Then he must go to (2,0) to put it in the pot. From (4,3) to (2,0):\n      Move left to (3,3) [L] -> turn42 (but (3,3) is empty? But he is at (4,3), move left to (3,3))\n      Then to (3,2) cannot because non-empty. So go to (3,3) -> (2,3) [L] -> turn43\n      Then to (2,2) cannot. So go to (1,3) [L] -> turn44\n      Then (1,2) [D] -> turn45\n      Then (1,1) [D] -> turn46\n      Then (2,1) [R] -> turn47\n      Then at (2,1) face down [D] -> turn48\n      Interact to put in pot at (2,0) [I] -> turn49\n\nMeanwhile, Alice has put two onions by turn46. Then the third is put by Bob at turn49.\n\nThen the pot at (2,0) has 3 onions at turn49. It will start cooking at turn49 and cook for 5 turns, so ready at turn54.\n\nThen someone needs to get a plate and serve it.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2). Alice or Bob can get it.\n\nAlice after turn46 is at (2,1) facing down. She can go to (0,2) to get a plate.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (0,2):\n- Move left to (1,1) [L] -> turn47 (from (2,1) to (1,1), facing left)\n- Then move up to (1,2) [U] -> turn48\n- Then move left to (0,2) [L] -> turn49 -> but (0,2) is the plate dispenser, non-empty, so she can't step on it. She must be adjacent and facing it. (0,2) is at (0,2). She can be at (0,1) or (0,3) or (1,2) and facing it.\n\nFrom (1,2) (empty? we assume) she is at (1,2) and (0,2) is to the left. So at (1,2) facing left, she can interact to grab a plate.\n\nSo:\nTurn47: L (from (2,1) to (1,1)) -> facing left\nTurn48: U ( to (1,2)) -> facing up? Because move up changes orientation to up.\n Then she is at (1,2) facing up. But (0,2) is to the left, so she must face left.\nTurn49: L (change orientation to left) -> now facing (0,2)\nTurn50: I (grab plate)\n\nThen she holds a plate. Then she must go to the pot at (2,0) to serve the soup. But the soup will be ready at turn54. She can wait or do something else.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (2,0):\n- Move right to (2,2) cannot. So move down to (1,1) [D] -> turn51\n- Move right to (2,1) [R] -> turn52\n- Then face down [D] -> turn53\n- Then at turn54 the soup is ready, she can interact to serve the soup from the pot at (2,0) [I] -> turn54\n\nBut then she delivers the soup? No, she serves the soup into the plate? The interact with pot when holding a clean plate and the soup is cooked: it serves the soup into the plate. Then she must deliver it to the serving counter at (6,2).\n\nSo after getting the soup in the plate, she is holding a soup. Then she must go to (6,2) to deliver.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (6,2):\n- Move right to (3,1) [R] -> turn55\n- Move right to (4,1) [R] -> turn56\n- Move up to (4,2) cannot. So move to (5,1) [R] -> turn57\n- Move up to (5,2) [U] -> turn58\n- Move right to (6,2) cannot. So she must be at (6,1) or (5,2) and face (6,2). (6,2) is serving counter. From (5,2) she can face right to interact with (6,2) or from (6,1) face up to (6,2).\n\nSo from (5,2) (after turn58) she is at (5,2) and (6,2) is to the right.\nTurn59: R (change orientation to right) -> facing (6,2)\nTurn60: I (deliver soup)\n\nThis is very long and we haven't even cooked the soup yet.\n\nGiven the complexity and the turns, perhaps we should aim for a shorter sequence.\n\nBut the problem asks to plan for the next several turns, say H turns. We can choose H. Let's say H=10 turns.\n\nBut then we might not complete the soup.\n\nAlternatively, let's do what we can in 10 turns.\n\nAt turn39, Alice can start by picking up the onion at (3,0) and putting it in the nearest pot.\n\nThen, she can get another onion from a nearby counter.\n\nFor example:\n\nAlice:\nTurn39: I (pick up onion from (3,0))\nTurn40: L (move left to (2,1), facing left)\nTurn41: D (face down to (2,0))\nTurn42: I (put onion in pot (2,0))\n\nNow she is at (2,1) facing down.\nTurn43: U (face up to (2,2))\nTurn44: I (pick up onion from (2,2)) -> if it's still there. We assume no one else takes it.\n\nBob can be directed to get the onion from (4,2) and put it in the pot at (2,0) or (4,0).\n\nBob at (3,3):\nTurn39: R (move right to (4,3), facing right)\nTurn40: D (face down to (4,2))\nTurn41: I (pick up onion from (4,2))\nThen he needs to put it in a pot. The pot at (4,0) is closer.\n\nFrom (4,3) he is at (4,3) holding onion.\nTurn42: S (stay) or move? He can move down to (4,2) cannot. So he must go to (4,4) if available? Or around.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (4,0) via:\n- Move down to (4,2) -> blocked.\n- So move right to (5,3) [R] -> turn42\n- Then (5,2) [D] -> turn43\n- Then (5,1) [D] -> turn44\n- Then (4,1) [L] -> turn45\n- Then face down [D] -> turn46\n- Interact to put in pot at (4,0) [I] turn47\n\nBut then the onion is in (4,0) alone, while we have one onion in (2,0) and one in (4,0) -> not grouped.\n\nSo better for Bob to put it in (2,0). From (4,3) to (2,0) is far.\n\nGiven the time, I think for the sake of this response, I'll plan for Alice only for the next 10 turns, and assume Bob will be controlled separately or we focus on Alice.\n\nAlice's plan for 10 turns (t39 to t48):\n\n- Turn39: I (pick up onion from (3,0))\n- Turn40: L (move left to (2,1))\n- Turn41: D (face down)\n- Turn42: I (put onion in pot at (2,0))\n- Turn43: U (face up)\n- Turn44: I (pick up onion from (2,2)) -> if it's there\n- Turn45: D (face down)\n- Turn46: I (put onion in pot at (2,0)) -> now 2 onions in pot\n- Then she needs one more. The nearest is (3,0) but it's empty, or (4,2). So from (2,1) move right to (3,1) [R] turn47\n- Turn48: R (move to (4,1)) or face up to (4,2) but at (3,1) she can move right to (4,1) turn48.\n\nThen at (4,1) she can face up and interact with (4,2) in the next turn.\n\nBut this is incomplete.\n\nPerhaps it's better to have a simple plan that gets one onion in the pot and sets up for the next steps.\n\nGiven the constraints, I will provide a sequence for Alice for the next 5 turns (t39 to t43) that gets one onion in the pot and positions for the next.\n\nAlice:\nTurn39: I (pick up onion from (3,0))\nTurn40: L (move left to (2,1), now at (2,1) facing left)\nTurn41: D (change orientation to down, now facing (2,0))\nTurn42: I (put onion in pot (2,0))\nTurn43: U (change orientation to up, now facing (2,2))\n\nThen at turn44 she can interact to pick up the onion from (2,2) if it's still there.\n\nFor the answer, we only output Alice's actions because the task is to plan for Alice (and optionally Bob). The task says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". Since it's optional for Bob, and to keep it simple, I'll plan only for Alice for 5 turns.\n\nSo the sequence for Alice:\nTurn 39: I\nTurn 40: L\nTurn 41: D\nTurn 42: I\nTurn 43: U\n\nThis is for turns 39 to 43.\n\nIf we want to include Bob, we can, but the answer format might be for one player. The task says \"for Alice\", so I'll do Alice.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 39: I\nTurn 40: L\nTurn 41: D\nTurn 42: I\nTurn 43: U\n}\n\nThis is a starting point. Alice has put one onion in the pot at (2,0) and is now at (2,1) facing up, ready to pick up the onion from (2,2) on the next turn.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice and Bob should collaborate to collect onions and fill a pot, as the only available recipe requires 3 onions (reward: 20, cooking time: 5 turns). Given the current game state at turn 39, Alice is positioned to immediately pick up an onion from the kitchen counter at (3,0) and deliver it to the nearest pot at (2,0). Bob can simultaneously retrieve another onion from the kitchen counter at (2,2) and deliver it to the same pot. However, since the task focuses on planning for Alice, the sequence below optimizes her actions for the next 5 turns (turns 39–43), setting up for efficient collaboration with Bob.\n\n### Optimized Action Sequence for Alice\n- **Turn 39 (t₁)**: `I`  \n  Alice interacts with the kitchen counter at (3,0) (adjacent below her) to pick up an onion. She is now holding an onion.\n- **Turn 40**: `L`  \n  Alice moves left to (2,1), now adjacent to the pot at (2,0) below her. Her orientation changes to left.\n- **Turn 41**: `D`  \n  Alice changes orientation to down (without moving, as (2,0) is non-empty) to face the pot at (2,0).\n- **Turn 42**: `I`  \n  Alice interacts with the pot at (2,0) to add the onion. The pot now contains 1 onion.\n- **Turn 43**: `U`  \n  Alice changes orientation to up to face the kitchen counter at (2,2) (adjacent above her), preparing to pick up another onion on the next turn.\n\n### Coordination with Bob\n- **Bob's Role (Recommended)**:  \n  - **Turn 39**: Bob (at (3,3), facing left) should move left to (2,3).  \n  - **Turn 40**: Change orientation to down to face (2,2).  \n  - **Turn 41**: Interact to pick up the onion from (2,2).  \n  - **Turns 42+**: Deliver this onion to the pot at (2,0) via a path like (2,3) → (1,3) → (1,2) → (1,1) → (2,1), then interact with the pot.  \n  This allows the pot to reach 2 onions quickly, with Alice or Bob fetching the third onion (e.g., from (4,2) or (6,1)).\n\n### Why This Plan?\n- **Efficiency**: Alice uses minimal turns (5) to pick up, deliver, and prepare for the next onion. Her path avoids collisions and leverages her starting position/orientation.\n- **Reward Potential**: With Bob's help, the pot can receive 3 onions by ~turn 50, starting a soup that cooks by turn 55. A plate can then be fetched from (0,2) and used to serve the soup at (6,2) for 20 reward.\n- **Flexibility**: Alice's final orientation at (2,1) facing up enables an immediate interaction with (2,2) on turn 44, or coordination if Bob delivers the second onion.\n\n### Output for Alice (turns 39–43)\n\\boxed{\nTurn 39: I\nTurn 40: L\nTurn 41: D\nTurn 42: I\nTurn 43: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 42. The goal is to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes.\n\nFirst, let's understand the environment:\n\nTile Types:\n- Kitchen Counters: at (0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)\n- Onion Dispensers: at (2,4) and (4,4)\n- Plate Dispenser: at (0,2)\n- Pots: at (2,0) and (4,0)\n- Serving Counter: at (6,2)\n\nRecipe: Only one recipe is given: 3 onions, 0 tomatoes; reward 20; cooking time 5 turns.\n\nCurrent Game State:\n- Turn: 42\n- Alice (me): at (4,1), facing right (R), holding nothing.\n- Bob: at (2,3), facing up (U), holding one onion.\n\nNon-empty Kitchen Counters:\n- (6,1): onion\n- (2,2): onion\n- (4,2): onion\n- (3,0): onion\n\nPots: Both are empty.\n\nAction History (last 5 actions at most):\n- Alice: D, I, R, I, I (most recent last: so the last action was I, then before that I, then R, then I, then D)\n- Bob: I, L, L, U, I (most recent last: last action I, then U, then L, then L, then I)\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob, but the task says \"for Alice\", so we focus on Alice, but we can assume Bob will act reasonably? However, note the task says \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". Since we are only controlling Alice, we should plan for Alice and assume Bob will continue his own actions. But the problem doesn't specify if we control Bob. The task says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can plan for both? However, the answer format only shows actions for one player? The problem says: \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\", but the answer format doesn't specify for which player. Let me re-read:\n\n\"plan a sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=1}^{H-1}\\) for Alice (and optionally Bob)\"\n\nBut the answer format only shows actions without specifying the player. This is ambiguous. However, the example in the answer format only shows one set of actions. Since the task is to help Alice collaborate, and we are given Bob's state, we can plan for Alice and assume Bob will act in a way that we can predict? Or we can plan for both? But the answer format doesn't have two lines per turn.\n\nLooking at the answer format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\n...\n\nIt seems to be for one player. The task says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", but the format doesn't have a way to specify both. So I think we are only to plan for Alice. We can assume Bob will act reasonably and we can predict his actions based on the state? But we don't control Bob. Alternatively, we can plan Alice's actions in a way that coordinates with Bob's current state and likely actions.\n\nGiven the constraints, I think we should plan only for Alice. However, we can use Bob's state to decide how Alice can best collaborate.\n\nGoal: Deliver as many soups as possible. The recipe requires 3 onions. We have two pots and several onions already on counters.\n\nCurrent items:\n- Kitchen counters have 4 onions: at (6,1), (2,2), (4,2), (3,0)\n- Bob is holding one onion.\n\nSo there are 5 onions available.\n\nThe pots are empty. We need to put 3 onions in a pot to start cooking. Then after 5 turns, the soup is ready. Then we need a plate to serve the soup and then deliver it to the serving counter (6,2).\n\nPlates are available at the plate dispenser (0,2).\n\nSince there are two pots, we can potentially cook two soups.\n\nBut note: cooking time is 5 turns. We are at turn 42. We want to maximize the reward, so we should try to complete as many soups as possible in the next few turns. However, the horizon H is not specified. We should choose a reasonable H, say 10-20 turns? Since cooking takes 5 turns, and then we need to serve, we might complete one soup in about 10 turns? Let's plan for H=10 turns? But the problem says \"over next several turns\", so we can choose.\n\nBut note: the answer format is for a sequence of actions. We must output a sequence.\n\nLet's think of a plan:\n\nWe have two pots: (2,0) and (4,0). We are at (4,1). Bob is at (2,3) holding an onion.\n\nOne efficient plan:\n\n1. Bob can put his onion into one of the pots. He is at (2,3). The pot at (2,0) is below him. He would need to go down to (2,2) and then down to (2,1) and then (2,0)? But note the grid: from (2,3) to (2,0): \n   - (2,3): is a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters include (2,2) and (3,2), etc. But (2,3) is not a kitchen counter? The list: (0,3) and (6,3) are counters, but (2,3) is not listed? So (2,3) is empty? Then Bob can move down to (2,2). But (2,2) is a kitchen counter and has an onion. He cannot walk onto non-empty tiles? The rules: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" But note: kitchen counters are non-empty? Actually, the tile type is \"Kitchen Counter\", and it is non-empty if it has an item. So (2,2) has an onion, so it is non-empty? Then Bob cannot step on (2,2). So how does he get to the pot at (2,0)?\n\nWait, the rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are those that are not empty? The tile types: empty tile is walkable. Dispensers, pots, serving counters, and kitchen counters are non-empty? But the rules say: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if ...\". So non-empty tiles are the ones that are not empty. But for movement: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" and \"Players cannot walk onto/through each other. Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\"\n\nSo non-empty tiles (any tile that is not an empty tile) cannot be walked on. The grid has:\n- Empty tiles: walkable.\n- Other tiles (dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters) are non-empty and cannot be walked on.\n\nTherefore, the path must be through empty tiles.\n\nLet me map the grid. We know the positions of non-empty tiles. But we don't have a full grid. We can infer from the given non-empty tiles and the positions of players.\n\nBut note: the kitchen counters are at the positions listed. So any tile not in the list of non-empty tiles (and not a dispenser, pot, etc.) is empty? The problem doesn't give a full grid. We have to assume that the only obstacles are the non-empty tiles and the players.\n\nSo for Bob at (2,3): \n- To go to the pot at (2,0), he would need to go down. But (2,2) is a kitchen counter and non-empty (has an onion) -> so he cannot step on it. So he must go around? \n  - He can go left to (1,3)? But (1,3) is not listed as a non-empty tile? The kitchen counters at y=3 are (0,3) and (6,3). So (1,3) and (2,3) are empty? But (2,3) is where Bob is. (1,3): is it empty? We don't have information. The problem doesn't list all tiles. We must assume that any tile not in the non-empty list is empty.\n\nThe non-empty tiles are only the ones listed? So:\n- Kitchen Counters: the 17 positions listed.\n- Onion Dispensers: 2 positions.\n- Plate Dispenser: 1 position.\n- Pots: 2 positions.\n- Serving Counter: 1 position.\n\nSo the rest are empty.\n\nTherefore, (1,3) is empty? Then Bob can go left to (1,3), then down to (1,2)? But (1,2) is not listed as non-empty, so empty? Then (1,1)? Then (1,0) is a kitchen counter (non-empty). Then he cannot go to (1,0). So how to get to (2,0)? \n\nAlternatively, from (1,3) to (1,2) to (2,2)? But (2,2) is non-empty (kitchen counter with onion). So he cannot step on (2,2). So he cannot get to (2,1) or (2,0) from the left? \n\nHe can go right? (3,3) is empty? (3,3) is not listed as non-empty. Then (3,2) is a kitchen counter (non-empty). So he cannot go down to (3,2). \n\nSo Bob is stuck? That can't be. There must be a path. \n\nPerhaps the grid has empty tiles at (2,1) and (3,1) etc. Let me list the non-empty tiles by position:\n\nx from 0 to 6, y from 0 to 4? \n\nWe have non-empty at:\n- y=0: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) [pot], (3,0), (4,0) [pot], (5,0), (6,0)\n- y=1: (0,1), (6,1) [with onion]\n- y=2: (0,2) [plate dispenser], (2,2) [kitchen counter with onion], (3,2) [kitchen counter], (4,2) [kitchen counter with onion], (6,2) [serving counter]\n- y=3: (0,3), (6,3)\n- y=4: (0,4), (1,4), (2,4) [onion dispenser], (3,4), (4,4) [onion dispenser], (5,4), (6,4)\n\nSo the empty tiles are the rest.\n\nBob at (2,3): \n- (2,3) is empty? (not in the non-empty list) -> yes.\n- He can move: \n  - Up: (2,4) is an onion dispenser -> non-empty -> cannot walk.\n  - Down: (2,2) is kitchen counter (non-empty) -> cannot walk.\n  - Left: (1,3) -> empty? (not in non-empty list) -> yes.\n  - Right: (3,3) -> empty.\n\nSo he can go left to (1,3) or right to (3,3).\n\nTo get to the pot at (2,0): \nFrom (2,3), he must go left to (1,3), then down to (1,2) [empty?], then down to (1,1) [empty?], then right to (2,1) [empty?], then down to (2,0) [pot]? But (2,0) is a pot, so non-empty? He cannot step on it. But to interact, he must be adjacent and facing it. So he can stand at (2,1) and face down to interact with the pot at (2,0).\n\nSimilarly, for the pot at (4,0), he can go via (3,3) -> (3,2) is non-empty, so he can go to (3,3) -> (3,2) is blocked, so then to (4,3) [empty?] -> (4,3) is not listed, so empty? Then (4,2) is non-empty, so cannot go down. Then he can go to (5,3) [empty?] -> then (5,2) [empty?] -> then (5,1) [empty?] -> then (5,0) non-empty? (5,0) is a kitchen counter. Then he can go to (4,1) [empty?] but Alice is at (4,1) -> cannot step on player. \n\nSo the path to (4,0) for Bob is long and might be blocked by Alice.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's focus on Alice.\n\nAlice is at (4,1), holding nothing.\n\nShe is near the pot at (4,0). She can go down to (4,0) and interact? But she is at (4,1) and facing right. To interact with (4,0), she must be adjacent and facing it. So she must move to a tile adjacent to (4,0) and face it.\n\nAdjacent tiles to (4,0): \n- (4,1) is above -> she is already at (4,1). If she faces down, she can interact with (4,0). But she is currently facing right. So she can change orientation to down and then interact.\n\nBut note: the pot is empty. She has nothing. To add an ingredient, she must be holding an onion. She is holding nothing. So she cannot add an ingredient now.\n\nTherefore, she needs to get an onion.\n\nWhere can she get an onion?\n- From a kitchen counter that has an onion: (6,1), (2,2), (4,2), (3,0)\n- Or from an onion dispenser: (2,4) or (4,4)\n\nShe is at (4,1). The closest onion might be at (4,2) which is just below? But (4,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion. She is at (4,1). (4,2) is adjacent below. But she is facing right. So she needs to face down to interact with (4,2).\n\nBut (4,2) is below her. So if she moves down to (4,2)? But (4,2) is non-empty (kitchen counter with onion) -> she cannot step on it. So she must interact from her current position? She is at (4,1) and (4,2) is adjacent below. If she faces down, she can interact to pick up the onion from the counter.\n\nSimilarly, she could go to (3,0) which has an onion? But (3,0) is a kitchen counter. She is at (4,1). To get to (3,0): \n- She can go left to (3,1) [empty?] then down to (3,0) -> but (3,0) is non-empty, so she cannot step on it. So she must stand adjacent. Adjacent to (3,0): (3,1) above, (2,0) left, (4,0) right, (3,-1) out of bound. So she can stand at (3,1) and face down to interact.\n\nBut (4,2) is closer: she is at (4,1), so one step: change orientation to down and interact.\n\nPlan for Alice:\n\nTurn 42: Change orientation to down (D? But D is move down. We have two actions: move and change orientation. The actions are: U, D, L, R (which are moves and change orientation? But the description says: Move (L/R/U/D): changes position and orientation. And Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): no move if the adjacent tile is not empty. Wait, the actions are:\n\n- Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\n- Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one. [This is confusing]\n\nActually, the action set is: {U, D, L, R, I, S}. And the description says:\n\n\"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\"\n\nBut then it says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nBut the actions are the same set? How do we distinguish between move and change orientation? \n\nRe-reading: \n\n\"Each player (Alice/Bob) can:\n- **Move** (L/R/U/D): Changes position *and* orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\n- **Change Orientation** (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nBut the actions are both labeled U/D/L/R. How do we know if it's a move or a change orientation? \n\nI think there's a misunderstanding. In Overcooked, typically, moving in a direction changes your position and orientation. If you try to move into a non-empty tile, you don't move but your orientation changes? The description says for Change Orientation: \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" So if you try to move into a non-empty tile, you don't move but you change orientation? That is, the same action (U/D/L/R) can either move or change orientation depending on whether the adjacent tile in that direction is empty.\n\nSo the action U means: try to move up. If the tile above is empty, move there and face up. If the tile above is not empty, then stay and face up.\n\nSimilarly for D, L, R.\n\nTherefore, for Alice at (4,1) to face down without moving, she can try to move down. But the tile below (4,2) is non-empty (kitchen counter), so she cannot move there. Therefore, if she does D (down action), she will not move but will change orientation to down.\n\nThen she can interact with (4,2) because she is facing it and adjacent.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 42: D (try to move down, but cannot because (4,2) is non-empty, so she faces down)\nTurn 43: I (interact with (4,2)) -> pick up the onion from the kitchen counter.\n\nNow she is holding an onion.\n\nThen she can turn to the pot at (4,0). She is at (4,1), facing down. The pot is at (4,0) which is below. So she is already facing down and adjacent. So:\n\nTurn 44: I (interact with pot) -> add the onion. Now the pot at (4,0) has 1 onion.\n\nBut the pot needs 3 onions. So we need two more onions.\n\nNow, where to get more onions? There are onions at (6,1), (2,2), (3,0), and Bob has one.\n\nAlice can get another onion. She is at (4,1) and holding nothing after putting the onion? After interacting with the pot, she is no longer holding the onion. So she is empty.\n\nShe can get another onion. The closest is (3,0) or (6,1) or (2,2).\n\n(3,0) is at (3,0). She is at (4,1). She can go left to (3,1) [empty?] then face down to interact with (3,0). But (3,0) is a kitchen counter with onion.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 44: after putting the onion, she is at (4,1) facing down.\n\nTo go to (3,1): she needs to face left? Then move left.\n\nTurn 44: after the interact, she is free to act again? We are planning per turn. So:\n\nTurn 42: D (face down)\nTurn 43: I (pick up onion from (4,2))\nTurn 44: I (put onion in pot at (4,0)) -> now pot has 1 onion, Alice is at (4,1) facing down, holding nothing.\n\nThen for turn 45: she can try to move left? But to move left, she must change orientation to left? So she does L: which would try to move left. The left tile is (3,1). Is (3,1) empty? We don't have it in non-empty list, so yes. So she moves left to (3,1) and faces left.\n\nBut she is at (3,1) facing left. The pot at (4,0) is not adjacent? We are going for another onion.\n\nNow, at (3,1), she can interact with the kitchen counter at (3,0) below? She is facing left, so she needs to face down. So:\n\nTurn 46: D (try to move down to (3,0)? But (3,0) is non-empty -> cannot move, so she faces down.\n\nTurn 47: I (interact with (3,0)) -> pick up the onion.\n\nNow she is holding an onion. Then she can go back to the pot at (4,0). She is at (3,1) facing down. The pot at (4,0) is to her right and down. She can move right to (4,1) and then face down? Or from (3,1) she can face right and then interact with (4,0)? But (4,0) is not adjacent to (3,1) because (4,0) is at (4,0) and (3,1) is at (3,1) -> not adjacent (adjacent would be (3,0) and (4,1)). So she must go to (4,1).\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 48: R (move right to (4,1) and face right? But she is facing down? The action R: if she is at (3,1) and does R, she moves to (4,1) and faces right.\n\nThen at (4,1), she is facing right. The pot at (4,0) is below. So she needs to face down.\n\nTurn 49: D (face down without moving)\n\nTurn 50: I (put onion in pot) -> now pot has 2 onions.\n\nWe need one more onion for the pot. She can get another onion. There is one at (6,1) and at (2,2). Bob also has one.\n\nBut Bob might bring his onion to the pot. Bob is at (2,3) holding an onion. He can go to the pot at (2,0) via: \n- (2,3) -> left to (1,3), down to (1,2) [empty], down to (1,1) [empty], then right to (2,1) [empty]. Then at (2,1), he can face down to interact with the pot at (2,0). So he can put his onion in the pot at (2,0) in about 4-5 moves.\n\nBut we are planning for Alice. Alice can get the onion from (6,1) or (2,2).\n\n(6,1) is closer to Alice? She is at (4,1). (6,1) is two steps right: (5,1) and then (6,1). But (6,1) is a kitchen counter with onion. She can stand at (6,0) or (5,1) or (6,2)? But (6,0) is a kitchen counter (non-empty), (6,2) is serving counter (non-empty). So she can only stand at (5,1) or (6,1) but (6,1) is non-empty -> cannot step. So she must stand at (5,1) and face left to interact with (6,1)? Or at (6,0) or (6,2) but they are non-empty. So (5,1) is the only adjacent empty tile? \n\n(6,1) has neighbors: (6,0) non-empty, (6,2) non-empty, (5,1) empty? (5,1) is not in non-empty list -> empty. So she can stand at (5,1) and face right to interact with (6,1).\n\nFrom (4,1) to (5,1): one move right.\n\nSo:\n\nAfter turn 50, Alice is at (4,1) facing down.\n\nTurn 51: R (move right to (5,1) and face right)\n\nThen she is facing right, but (6,1) is to her right. So she can interact.\n\nTurn 52: I (pick up onion from (6,1))\n\nThen she needs to go back to the pot at (4,0). From (5,1) to (4,1) to (4,0) but (4,0) is non-empty. So she must go to (4,1) and then face down to interact.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 53: L (move left to (4,1) and face left? But she is at (5,1) facing right. L would move her to (4,1) and face left.\n\nThen at (4,1) facing left. The pot is below. So:\n\nTurn 54: D (face down without moving? Because moving down to (4,2) is blocked)\n\nTurn 55: I (put onion in pot) -> now the pot at (4,0) has 3 onions. Cooking starts.\n\nBut note: we are at turn 55. Cooking time is 5 turns. So the soup will be ready at turn 60.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob might have put his onion in the other pot? But let's see the time: we started at turn 42 and now at 55, 13 turns have passed. Bob could have moved to (2,1) by now and put his onion in the pot at (2,0). But we don't control Bob.\n\nAfter the pot starts cooking, we need to get a plate and then serve the soup.\n\nPlates are at (0,2). Alice is at (4,1). She can go to (0,2) to get a plate.\n\nBut (0,2) is a plate dispenser. She must be empty-handed to get a plate. She is now empty after putting the onion.\n\nSo after turn 55, she is empty.\n\nPath to (0,2): \n(4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (0,2) but (0,2) is non-empty, so she must stand adjacent. Adjacent to (0,2): (0,1) non-empty, (0,3) non-empty, (1,2) empty? So she can stand at (1,2) and face left to interact.\n\nBut (1,2) is empty? Yes. So:\n\nFrom (4,1) to (3,1): L (move left) -> (3,1) and face left\nThen to (2,1): L (move left) -> (2,1) and face left\nThen to (1,1): L (move left) -> (1,1) and face left\nThen to (1,2): U (move up) -> (1,2) and face up? Or she can face left from (1,1) and then move left? But (0,1) is non-empty, so she cannot move left from (1,1). So she must go up to (1,2). \n\n(1,2) is empty? Yes. Then at (1,2), she can face left to interact with (0,2) which is the plate dispenser.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 56: L (from (4,1) to (3,1), face left)\nTurn 57: L (to (2,1), face left)\nTurn 58: L (to (1,1), face left) [but (0,1) is non-empty, so she cannot move left from (1,1) -> but the action L at (1,1): the left tile (0,1) is non-empty, so she doesn't move, but changes orientation to left. That's not what we want. We want to go to (1,2). So she should change orientation to up first? \n\nAt (1,1), she is facing left. To move up to (1,2), she does U: move up to (1,2) and face up.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 58: U (from (1,1) to (1,2), face up)\n\nThen at (1,2), she needs to face left to interact with (0,2). But she is facing up. So:\n\nTurn 59: L (try to move left to (0,2)? But (0,2) is non-empty -> cannot move, so she faces left)\n\nTurn 60: I (interact with (0,2)) -> grab a plate.\n\nNow she has a plate. The soup at (4,0) is ready at turn 60? We put the last onion at turn 55, so cooking started at turn 55. After 5 turns, ready at turn 60. So at turn 60, it is ready.\n\nBut she is at (1,2) with a plate. She needs to go to the pot at (4,0) to serve the soup.\n\nPath: (1,2) to (2,2) but (2,2) is non-empty -> cannot. So she must go down to (1,1), then right to (2,1), then right to (3,1), then right to (4,1). Then at (4,1), face down to interact with the pot.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 61: D (from (1,2) to (1,1), face down)\nTurn 62: R (from (1,1) to (2,1), face right)\nTurn 63: R (from (2,1) to (3,1), face right)\nTurn 64: R (from (3,1) to (4,1), face right)\nTurn 65: D (face down without moving)\nTurn 66: I (interact with pot) -> serve the soup: she now has a soup in plate.\n\nThen she needs to deliver to the serving counter at (6,2). From (4,1), she can go right to (5,1), then up to (5,2) [empty?] then right to (6,2) but (6,2) is non-empty? She cannot step on it. So she must be adjacent. Adjacent to (6,2): (6,1) non-empty, (6,3) non-empty, (5,2) empty, (7,2) out of bound. So she must stand at (5,2) and face right to interact.\n\nSo:\n\nAfter getting the soup, she is at (4,1) facing down? After serving, she is still at (4,1).\n\nTurn 67: R (move right to (5,1), face right) [but she was facing down? Then R would move to (5,1) and face right? Or if she is facing down, R would turn right? The move action: if she does R, she moves right and faces right. So from (4,1) facing down, she does R: moves to (5,1) and faces right.\n\nThen at (5,1), she can move up to (5,2) if it is empty. (5,2) is not in non-empty list -> empty. So:\n\nTurn 68: U (move up to (5,2), face up)\n\nThen at (5,2), she is facing up. The serving counter is at (6,2) to the right. So she needs to face right.\n\nTurn 69: R (try to move right to (6,2)? But (6,2) is non-empty -> cannot move, so faces right)\n\nTurn 70: I (interact with (6,2)) -> deliver soup, get 20 points.\n\nThis is a long sequence and we are at turn 70, starting from 42. We planned 28 turns? But we only need to plan for several turns, say H=10? So we should plan a shorter sequence.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the onions on counters more efficiently and let Bob help.\n\nBut we control only Alice. So for the next 10 turns, what can Alice do to start a soup?\n\nSince Bob is holding an onion and is near the pot at (2,0), we can assume Bob will put his onion in the pot at (2,0). Then we need two more onions for that pot.\n\nAlice can bring two onions to the pot at (2,0) or (4,0).\n\nBut she is at (4,1). The pot at (4,0) is closer.\n\nPlan for Alice for H=10 turns (turns 42 to 51):\n\n1. Get the onion from (4,2): \n   - Turn 42: D (face down)\n   - Turn 43: I (pick up onion)\n2. Put it in the pot at (4,0):\n   - Turn 44: I (put onion) -> now pot has 1 onion.\n3. Get another onion from (3,0):\n   - From (4,1) to (3,1): \n        Turn 45: L (move left to (3,1), face left)\n   - Then face down to interact with (3,0):\n        Turn 46: D (face down)\n        Turn 47: I (pick up onion)\n4. Put it in the pot at (4,0):\n   - From (3,1) to (4,1):\n        Turn 48: R (move right to (4,1), face right)\n   - Then face down:\n        Turn 49: D (face down)\n        Turn 50: I (put onion) -> pot has 2 onions.\n\nThen at turn 51, she has put two onions in the pot. We need one more. She can get the onion from (6,1) or wait for Bob? But Bob might be on his way to the other pot.\n\nIn the next turns, she can get the third onion from (6,1):\n\nTurn 51: R (move right to (5,1), face right)\nTurn 52: I (pick up onion from (6,1)) -> but to interact, she must be facing (6,1). At (5,1) facing right, she is facing (6,1) -> yes.\n\nThen put in pot:\nTurn 53: L (move left to (4,1), face left)\nTurn 54: D (face down)\nTurn 55: I (put onion) -> now pot has 3 onions at turn 55.\n\nBut this is beyond 10 turns? From turn 42 to 51 is 10 turns (42 to 51 inclusive is 10 actions? 42,43,...,51 -> 10 turns). We only planned up to turn 51: at turn 51, she is at (5,1) and has not picked up the onion yet.\n\nSo for H=10, we can only do:\n\nTurns 42-50: as above, so at turn 51 she is about to move to (5,1) or something.\n\nBut let's list the turns:\n\nTurn 42: D\nTurn 43: I\nTurn 44: I\nTurn 45: L\nTurn 46: D\nTurn 47: I\nTurn 48: R\nTurn 49: D\nTurn 50: I  -> at turn 50, she has put the second onion in the pot.\n\nThen turn 51: she is at (4,1) facing down. She can go to (5,1) to get the onion from (6,1):\nTurn 51: R (move to (5,1), face right)\nTurn 52: I (interact with (6,1) to get onion)\n\nBut turn 52 is beyond H=10 if we start from 42? The turns are t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. So for H=10, we plan from turn 42 to 51 (10 actions).\n\nSo up to turn 51, she has done:\n\n42: D\n43: I\n44: I\n45: L\n46: D\n47: I\n48: R\n49: D\n50: I\n51: R\n\nAt turn 51, she is at (5,1) facing right, holding nothing (because at turn 50 she put the second onion, then at turn 51 she moved right).\n\nSo she has not gotten the third onion yet. But the pot has only 2 onions.\n\nAlternatively, after turn 50, she can get the onion from (6,1) in fewer steps? But from (4,1) to (5,1) is one move.\n\nAnother option: after the second onion, she can do nothing else in the next move.\n\nBut we want to maximize reward. Perhaps she can start another soup in the other pot? The pot at (2,0) is empty. Bob might be on his way. She can bring an onion to (2,0).\n\nBut she is at (4,1) after turn 50. The onions are at (6,1), (2,2), etc. (2,2) is close to (2,0).\n\nBut (2,2) has an onion. She can go to (2,2)? But (2,2) is non-empty, so she can't step on it. She can stand at (2,1) and face up to interact with (2,2).\n\nFrom (4,1) to (2,1): left to (3,1), then left to (2,1).\n\nSo:\n\nAfter turn 50: at (4,1) facing down.\n\nTurn 51: L ( to (3,1), face left)\nTurn 52: L ( to (2,1), face left) -> but for H=10, turn 52 is outside.\n\nSo for a short plan, we can only put two onions in the pot.\n\nThen Bob can put his onion in the same pot or the other.\n\nIf Bob puts his onion in the pot at (4,0), then the pot will have 3 onions (because we put two and Bob one) and start cooking.\n\nBut we don't control Bob.\n\nPerhaps Alice can signal to Bob by positioning.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's plan for Alice to complete the pot at (4,0) as much as possible.\n\nSo for 10 turns:\n\nTurn 42: D (face down)\nTurn 43: I (pick up onion from (4,2))\nTurn 44: I (put onion in pot at (4,0))\nTurn 45: L (move left to (3,1), face left)\nTurn 46: D (face down)\nTurn 47: I (pick up onion from (3,0))\nTurn 48: R (move right to (4,1), face right)\nTurn 49: D (face down)\nTurn 50: I (put onion in pot at (4,0))\nTurn 51: R (move right to (5,1), face right)   [for the next onion]\n\nBut turn 51 is the 10th action? Turn 42 to turn 51 is 10 actions: 42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51.\n\nAt turn 51, she is at (5,1) facing right, ready to interact with (6,1) on the next turn.\n\nThis sets up for getting the third onion.\n\nWe can output this sequence.\n\nBut the problem says: \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\". We can choose H=10.\n\nSo the plan for Alice:\n\nTurn 42: D\nTurn 43: I\nTurn 44: I\nTurn 45: L\nTurn 46: D\nTurn 47: I\nTurn 48: R\nTurn 49: D\nTurn 50: I\nTurn 51: R\n\nThis is 10 actions.\n\nAfter this, the pot at (4,0) has 2 onions, and Alice is at (5,1) facing right, holding nothing. She can then interact to get the onion from (6,1) on turn 52.\n\nAnd Bob may add his onion to complete the pot.\n\nSo it's a good setup.\n\nAlternatively, after turn 50, she could go towards the plate dispenser, but that might be premature.\n\nI think this plan is reasonable.\n\nSo the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 42: D\nTurn 43: I\nTurn 44: I\nTurn 45: L\nTurn 46: D\nTurn 47: I\nTurn 48: R\nTurn 49: D\nTurn 50: I\nTurn 51: R\n}\n\nNote: The actions are for Alice only.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice should focus on adding ingredients to the pot at (4, 0) to start cooking a soup, which requires 3 onions. Given the current game state, Alice is at (4, 1) holding nothing, and there are onions available on nearby kitchen counters. The plan leverages these onions efficiently and sets up for future actions to complete the soup. Bob is holding an onion and may independently contribute to the pot at (2, 0) or (4, 0), but Alice's actions are optimized for collaboration by progressing toward a completed soup at (4, 0).\n\n### Plan Explanation (for Alice, Turns 42 to 51):\n- **Turn 42: D**  \n  Alice faces down (since moving down to (4, 2) is blocked by the kitchen counter). This orients her to interact with the onion on (4, 2).\n- **Turn 43: I**  \n  Alice picks up the onion from the kitchen counter at (4, 2).\n- **Turn 44: I**  \n  Alice adds the onion to the pot at (4, 0) (she is adjacent and facing down). The pot now has 1 onion.\n- **Turn 45: L**  \n  Alice moves left to (3, 1) (empty tile) and faces left, positioning to access the onion on (3, 0).\n- **Turn 46: D**  \n  Alice faces down (moving down to (3, 0) is blocked by the kitchen counter), orienting to interact with (3, 0).\n- **Turn 47: I**  \n  Alice picks up the onion from the kitchen counter at (3, 0).\n- **Turn 48: R**  \n  Alice moves right to (4, 1) (empty tile) and faces right, returning to the pot's location.\n- **Turn 49: D**  \n  Alice faces down (moving down is blocked), orienting toward the pot at (4, 0).\n- **Turn 50: I**  \n  Alice adds the onion to the pot at (4, 0). The pot now has 2 onions.\n- **Turn 51: R**  \n  Alice moves right to (5, 1) (empty tile) and faces right, positioning to grab the onion from (6, 1) on the next turn.\n\n### Outcome After 10 Turns:\n- The pot at (4, 0) has 2 onions, requiring only one more onion to start cooking (which takes 5 turns once full).\n- Alice is at (5, 1) facing right, ready to interact with the onion on (6, 1) on turn 52.\n- Bob, holding an onion, can potentially add it to (4, 0) to complete the soup quickly, or use the other pot at (2, 0). Alice's actions set up efficient collaboration by:\n  - Using readily available onions on counters (minimizing trips to dispensers).\n  - Prioritizing the closest pot (4, 0) for faster cooking.\n  - Ending near (6, 1) to fetch the final onion or a plate later.\n\nThis sequence maximizes progress toward a high-reward soup (20 points) within the planning horizon. After turn 51, Alice should grab the onion from (6, 1), add it to (4, 0) to start cooking, then fetch a plate from (0, 2) and deliver the soup to (6, 2) when ready.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 42: D\nTurn 43: I\nTurn 44: I\nTurn 45: L\nTurn 46: D\nTurn 47: I\nTurn 48: R\nTurn 49: D\nTurn 50: I\nTurn 51: R\n}",

The goal is to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes.\n\nGiven the recipe: Recipe 1 requires 3 onions, cooks in 5 turns, and gives a reward of 20.\n\nCurrent state:\n\n- Alice (me): at (3,1), facing down (D), holding nothing.\n- Bob: at (5,3), facing right (R), holding one onion.\n\nKitchen counters with onions:\n- (6,1): onion\n- (2,2): onion\n- (4,2): onion\n- (3,0): onion  [Note: (3,0) is a kitchen counter? But according to the tile list, (3,0) is a kitchen counter. However, note that the pot is at (2,0) and (4,0).]\n\nPots are empty.\n\nWe have two pots: at (2,0) and (4,0). We can use either.\n\nThe plan: We need to make a soup with 3 onions. Since Bob is already holding an onion, we need two more onions. There are onions on kitchen counters at (6,1), (2,2), (4,2), and (3,0). We can use these.\n\nAlso, we need a plate to serve the soup. The plate dispenser is at (0,2).\n\nSteps:\n\n1. We need to get the pot filled with 3 onions. Since Bob already has one, he can put it in a pot. Then we need two more.\n\n2. We need to get a plate to serve the soup once it's cooked.\n\nConsidering positions:\n\nAlice is at (3,1). She can move to nearby counters to pick up an onion or go to the plate dispenser.\n\nBob is at (5,3) holding an onion. He can move to a pot to put his onion.\n\nLet's choose a pot: say the pot at (4,0) because it's closer to Bob and also to some onions.\n\nBob's path to pot (4,0):\n- Bob is at (5,3). He needs to go to (4,0). \n  - (5,3) -> (4,3) [L] -> (4,2) [D] (but (4,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion, so he can't step on it? Note: players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles. So he must go around? Actually, (4,2) is a kitchen counter and it's non-empty? The tile type is kitchen counter, which is non-empty? But the rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" And kitchen counters are non-empty? Actually, the kitchen counter is a tile type that can be occupied by an item. So if there's an item on it, it's non-empty and cannot be walked on. But if it's empty, it's walkable? The rules say: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So if there's an item on the counter, it's non-empty and cannot be walked on. If empty, then it's walkable? But note: the tile types list says \"Kitchen Counter\" as a tile type, and we are told which ones are non-empty. So (4,2) has an onion, so it's non-empty and Bob cannot step on it.\n\nSo Bob's path to (4,0):\n  From (5,3): \n    Option 1: \n      Move left to (4,3) -> then down to (4,2) is blocked because (4,2) has an onion -> so cannot go down.\n    Option 2:\n      Move down to (5,2) -> then left to (4,2) is blocked -> then down? (5,2) is what? We don't have the full map, but we know the non-empty tiles. We need to know what (5,2) is. Since it's not listed as a non-empty tile, it must be an empty tile? Similarly, (5,1) and (5,0) are not listed as non-empty? But note: the serving counter is at (6,2) and (6,1) is a kitchen counter with onion -> non-empty, so (5,1) and (5,0) are probably empty.\n\nSo Bob can go: \n  (5,3) -> D to (5,2) [empty?] -> then D to (5,1) [empty?] -> then D to (5,0) [empty?] -> then L to (4,0) [pot]. But note: (5,0) is a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters are at specific locations: (0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), ... So (5,0) is a kitchen counter. But is it non-empty? The non-empty kitchen counters are listed: (6,1) has onion, (2,2) has onion, (4,2) has onion, (3,0) has onion. So (5,0) is a kitchen counter and it is not listed as non-empty, so it is empty? Therefore, Bob can walk on (5,0) because it's empty? \n\nBut the rules: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and a kitchen counter without an item is empty? So yes, Bob can walk on (5,0) because it's empty.\n\nSo Bob's path:\n  Turn 45: Bob moves D (from (5,3) to (5,2))\n  Turn 46: Bob moves D (to (5,1))\n  Turn 47: Bob moves D (to (5,0)) -> now he is at (5,0), which is adjacent to the pot at (4,0) to the left? He is facing right (R) at start, but he moved down three times so now he is facing down? Actually, the movement changes both position and orientation. So after moving down three times, he is at (5,0) and facing down. But the pot is at (4,0) which is to his left. So he must change orientation to face left to interact with the pot.\n\nAlternatively, we can plan:\n\nBob at (5,3) facing R.\nAfter moving down to (5,2): now at (5,2) facing D.\nThen down to (5,1): at (5,1) facing D.\nThen down to (5,0): at (5,0) facing D.\n\nNow, to interact with the pot at (4,0), he must face left (L). So he needs to change orientation to L and then interact.\n\nBut note: the pot is at (4,0) which is adjacent to (5,0) on the left. So from (5,0), he can face left and interact.\n\nSo:\n  Turn 48: Bob changes orientation to L (so now facing left) -> then he can interact with the pot at (4,0) by putting the onion in.\n\nBut wait: we are only planning for Alice? The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But note: we can only control Alice. However, we are to plan for Alice, and we can assume Bob is our teammate and we can coordinate. But in the answer, we only output Alice's actions? The answer format only has actions for Alice? \n\nLooking at the answer format: it only shows actions for Alice? The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice\". So we only output Alice's actions. But we have to consider Bob's actions to coordinate? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\", meaning we assume Bob is also trying to help? However, we are only to output Alice's actions. So we must plan Alice's actions, and we assume Bob will act rationally? Or we don't control Bob? \n\nThe problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". The word \"optionally\" suggests we might output Bob's actions too? But the answer format doesn't have Bob. Let me check: \"Answer Format\" only shows Turn and then a_t, which is for Alice? \n\nBut the example: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and it doesn't specify player. Since the task is for Alice, I think we only output Alice's actions. And we assume that Bob is also controlled by the same agent? Or we have to plan with the given Bob's state and action history? \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think we must plan only for Alice, but we must anticipate Bob's actions to coordinate. Since Bob is holding an onion and is near a pot, we can assume Bob will put his onion in a pot. \n\nSo let's assume Bob will put his onion in the pot at (4,0) in the next few turns.\n\nNow for Alice:\n\nWe need to get two more onions to the same pot? Or we can use a different pot? But note: if we use the same pot, then we can have 3 onions in one pot. If we use two pots, then we have one onion in each and then we need to add more to each. But that would be inefficient. So let's use the same pot at (4,0).\n\nSo we need two more onions for the pot at (4,0). \n\nAlice is at (3,1). There is a kitchen counter with an onion at (3,0) and at (4,2). Also at (2,2) and (6,1). \n\nThe closest onion to Alice is at (3,0) which is directly below her. But (3,0) is a kitchen counter. She is at (3,1) and facing down (D). So she is adjacent to (3,0) and facing it? (3,0) is at (3,0) which is directly below (3,1). So she is facing down, which is towards (3,0). So she can interact to pick up the onion at (3,0) immediately.\n\nBut note: she must be on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and facing it. She is at (3,1) which is empty? We don't know the tile type of (3,1). It's not listed as a non-empty tile, so it's walkable (empty or a counter without item? but counters are non-empty only if they have an item). Actually, the tile types are: empty tile, dispenser, pot, serving counter, kitchen counter. The kitchen counters are listed as (0,0), etc., so (3,1) is not in that list? The list of kitchen counters: [(0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)]. So (3,1) is not a kitchen counter? Then it must be an empty tile? So yes, she is on an empty tile adjacent to (3,0) and facing it. So she can interact to pick up the onion at (3,0).\n\nSo at turn 45, Alice can interact (I) to pick up the onion from (3,0).\n\nThen she will be holding an onion.\n\nNow she needs to put it in the pot at (4,0). How to get there?\n\nFrom (3,1) to (4,0): \n  One way: right to (4,1) then down to (4,0). \n  But (4,1) is what? Not listed as non-empty, so empty? And (4,0) is a pot? So she can walk to (4,1) and then to (4,0)? But note: the pot is at (4,0) and it's a non-empty tile? Actually, the pot is a tile that we can step on? The rules: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" But the pot is a tile that we can interact with, but we can step on it? The tile types: \"Pot\" is one of the types. And the rules say we can only walk on empty tiles? So probably the pot is not walkable? \n\nBut the rules: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and the pot is a tile that is non-empty? Or is it that the pot can be empty or non-empty? The problem says: \"Pot: Cooks soup (3 ingredients → auto-starts cooking).\" So when it has ingredients, it is non-empty? But even when empty, it is still a pot tile? \n\nThe rules for movement: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" meaning that for moving, the destination must be an empty tile? And for interaction, we must be adjacent and facing.\n\nSo the pot tile: even when empty, it is not an empty tile? Because empty tile is a specific type. The tile types are:\n\n- Empty Tile: walkable\n- Dispensers: not walkable? (since they are non-empty? but they are always there) -> actually, dispensers are fixed and non-empty? The rules: \"Dispensers: Sources for items\" -> so they are always there and not walkable? \n\nSimilarly, pot, serving counter, kitchen counter (when non-empty) are not walkable? But when kitchen counter is empty, it is walkable? The rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" meaning that if a tile is non-empty (i.e., has an item or is a fixed object like dispenser, pot, serving counter, or kitchen counter with item) then it's not walkable. But what about kitchen counter without item? It is a tile that is walkable? \n\nThe problem states: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and then other types are not? \n\nBut the movement constraint: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are defined as tiles that are not empty? But the tile types are given: so we must consider that only empty tiles are walkable? \n\nActually, the rules: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are any tile that is not an empty tile? Or is it that a tile can be of type \"empty\" or \"dispenser\", etc., and then additionally have an item? \n\nThe problem says: \"Non-empty tiles\" meaning tiles that have an item? Or the tile type itself is non-empty? \n\nLooking at the constraints: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and then the tile types: \n  - Empty Tile: walkable -> so empty tile is always walkable? \n  - Other tiles (dispenser, pot, serving counter, kitchen counter) are not walkable? But the rules say: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" -> it doesn't say if it's walkable or not.\n\nBut note: the rule for interaction says: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\" \n\nThis implies that the player must be on an empty tile (so the tile they stand on must be empty) and the adjacent tile they are interacting with must be non-empty? But non-empty meaning having an item? Or the tile type is non-empty? \n\nThe context: the tile types that are not empty tiles are fixed and always non-empty? And then kitchen counters can be empty or non-empty? \n\nSo for movement: a tile is walkable only if it is an empty tile or a kitchen counter without an item? \n\nBut the rules don't explicitly say. However, the movement constraint: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and \"non-empty\" is defined as having an item? \n\nBut in the current state, we are told the non-empty kitchen counters (which have items). So for example, (3,0) is a kitchen counter and has an onion -> non-empty -> not walkable. (4,2) has an onion -> not walkable. \n\nBut what about (5,0)? It's a kitchen counter without an item? Then it is empty? And walkable? \n\nSimilarly, the pot: when empty, is it walkable? The rules don't say. But note: the pot is a tile that we interact with, so we don't step on it. So probably, the pot tile is not walkable? \n\nGiven the ambiguity, we must assume that only empty tiles and empty kitchen counters are walkable? But the problem says: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and then other types are not mentioned as walkable. \n\nTo be safe, I will assume that non-empty tiles (including dispensers, pots, serving counters, and kitchen counters that have an item) are not walkable. But kitchen counters without items are walkable? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" -> so it's a tile that can have an item. When it doesn't, it might be walkable? \n\nBut the movement rule only restricts non-empty tiles. So if a kitchen counter is empty, then it is an empty tile? No, because empty tile is a separate type. \n\nWe have to look at the tile types provided:\n\nTile Types:\n- Kitchen Counter: at specific coordinates -> so these coordinates are kitchen counter tiles, which are not empty tiles.\n\nSo for movement, we can only walk on empty tiles? \n\nBut then how do we get to the pot? We can't walk on the pot tile. So we must be adjacent to the pot and then interact.\n\nTherefore, for the pot at (4,0), we must be at an adjacent empty tile: (3,0), (5,0), (4,1) are adjacent? \n\nBut (3,0) is a kitchen counter and has an onion -> non-empty -> not walkable. \n(5,0) is a kitchen counter without an item? -> so it is empty? But it's a kitchen counter tile, not an empty tile. So can we walk on it? \n\nThe rules: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" meaning if the tile has an item (non-empty) then we can't walk. If it doesn't have an item, even if it's a kitchen counter, we can walk? \n\nBut the problem doesn't explicitly say. In many games, counters are walkable when empty. \n\nGiven the context, I think we must assume that a tile that is a kitchen counter without an item is walkable? Because otherwise, the kitchen counters would block the way. \n\nSimilarly, the pot is not walkable even when empty? Because it's a fixed object.\n\nSo let me assume:\n- Empty tiles: walkable.\n- Kitchen counters without items: walkable? But note: the tile type is kitchen counter, so when it has an item, it's non-empty and not walkable. When it doesn't, it's walkable? \n- Pots, dispensers, serving counters: never walkable.\n\nSo for (5,0): kitchen counter without item -> walkable.\n\nFor (4,0): pot -> not walkable.\n\nSo for Alice to put an onion in the pot at (4,0), she must stand at an adjacent empty tile (or walkable tile) and face the pot. Adjacent tiles: \n  (3,0): kitchen counter with onion -> non-empty -> not walkable.\n  (5,0): kitchen counter without item -> walkable? Yes.\n  (4,1): what is (4,1)? Not listed as any non-empty tile, so it must be an empty tile? Then walkable.\n  (4,-1): out of bound.\n\nSo she can stand at (4,1) or (5,0) to interact with (4,0). \n\nSimilarly, for the pot at (2,0), adjacent walkable tiles: (1,0), (3,0) [but (3,0) has onion -> not walkable], (2,1) [if empty], etc.\n\nNow, Alice is at (3,1) holding an onion (after picking up from (3,0) at turn 45). She wants to put it in the pot at (4,0). \n\nShe can move to (4,1) and then face down to interact with the pot? But the pot is at (4,0) which is below (4,1). So if she moves to (4,1) and faces down, she can interact.\n\nHow to get to (4,1) from (3,1)? \n  Turn 45: she picks up the onion at (3,0) by interacting (I). Then at turn 46, she moves right (R) to (4,1). Then at turn 47, she changes orientation to down (D) if not already? But note: when she moves right, her orientation becomes R? Because movement changes orientation. So after moving right to (4,1), she is facing right. Then she must change orientation to down (D) to face the pot at (4,0). Then interact.\n\nBut wait: when she moves, she changes orientation to the direction of movement. So moving right: orientation becomes R. Then to face down, she needs to change orientation to D.\n\nAlternatively, she can move down from (3,1) to (3,0)? But (3,0) has an onion and is non-empty -> cannot walk. So she must go right to (4,1).\n\nSo:\n  Turn 45: I (pick up onion from (3,0))\n  Turn 46: R (move to (4,1), now facing right)\n  Turn 47: D (change orientation to down) -> now facing the pot at (4,0)\n  Turn 48: I (put onion in the pot)\n\nBut note: after she picks up the onion at (3,0) at turn 45, the kitchen counter (3,0) becomes empty? So then (3,0) becomes walkable? But we don't need to walk on it.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob is moving to put his onion in the same pot. We assume:\n\nBob:\n  Turn 45: D (to (5,2))\n  Turn 46: D (to (5,1))\n  Turn 47: D (to (5,0))\n  Turn 48: change orientation to L (to face the pot at (4,0)) and then I? But we are at turn 48 for Alice, and Bob would also act at turn 48? \n\nBut note: the game is turn-based and both players act simultaneously? Or sequentially? The problem doesn't specify. Typically in Overcooked, players act simultaneously. So at the same turn, both players take an action.\n\nAt turn 45:\n  Alice: I -> picks up onion from (3,0). Now (3,0) becomes empty.\n  Bob: D -> moves to (5,2)\n\nAt turn 46:\n  Alice: R -> moves to (4,1), now facing right.\n  Bob: D -> moves to (5,1)\n\nAt turn 47:\n  Alice: D (change orientation to down) -> she doesn't move, just changes to face down.\n  Bob: D -> moves to (5,0)\n\nAt turn 48:\n  Alice: I -> tries to put onion in pot at (4,0). But the pot is currently at: Bob is going to put his onion at the same time? \n\nThe pot at (4,0) is empty. At turn 48:\n  Bob is at (5,0) and he changes orientation to L (so facing left) and then he can interact to put his onion. But note: Bob is at (5,0) and facing left, so he is adjacent to (4,0) and facing it? Yes. So both Alice and Bob try to interact with the same pot at the same turn?\n\nThe pot can accept multiple interactions? But the rules: at turn 48, the pot is empty. Alice puts an onion -> now it has one onion. Bob puts an onion -> now it has two onions? \n\nIs that allowed? The problem doesn't say. Typically, one interaction per turn per object? But since two players can interact simultaneously? \n\nThe rules don't specify. Let me assume that the pot can accept multiple interactions in one turn. So both can put an onion at the same turn.\n\nSo after turn 48, the pot at (4,0) has two onions (one from Alice and one from Bob). But Bob was holding one onion and Alice was holding one onion. But we need three onions. \n\nWe still need one more onion.\n\nAlso, note that Bob already put his onion, so he is free. Alice also put her onion.\n\nSo now we need one more onion for the pot. \n\nThere are onions at: (6,1), (2,2), (4,2). \n\nAlice is at (4,1) and facing down. After putting the onion, she is holding nothing.\n\nBob is at (5,0) and facing left. After putting, he is holding nothing.\n\nWho should get the next onion? \n\nThe closest onion to Alice: (4,2) is just below? But (4,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion -> non-empty. She is at (4,1). To get the onion at (4,2), she must face down and interact? But (4,2) is below her. So she is already facing down? Then at turn 49, she can interact to pick up the onion? But wait: (4,2) is adjacent and below. So she can pick it up? But note: she is at (4,1) and (4,2) is adjacent? Yes. And she is facing down? So she can interact to pick up the onion at (4,2). \n\nBut (4,2) is a kitchen counter, so she can pick up the item if she is empty-handed.\n\nSo at turn 49: Alice can I to pick up the onion from (4,2). Then she is holding an onion.\n\nThen she must put it in the pot at (4,0). But she is at (4,1) and the pot is below her. She is facing down. So at turn 50, she can I again to put the onion in the pot? Because she is still at (4,1) and facing down, adjacent to the pot.\n\nBut the pot now has two onions? Then after she puts the third, it will start cooking.\n\nSo:\n  Turn 49: Alice I (pick up onion from (4,2)) -> now holding onion.\n  Turn 50: Alice I (put onion in pot) -> now the pot has 3 onions and starts cooking.\n\nBut note: the cooking time is 5 turns. So after 5 turns, the soup is cooked.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob is free. We can have Bob get a plate? The plate dispenser is at (0,2).\n\nBob is at (5,0). He can go to (0,2) to get a plate.\n\nBut we are only planning for Alice? So we plan Alice's actions until turn 50? And then we stop? But the problem says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\". We can choose H. Since the cooking takes 5 turns, we might want to plan until the soup is delivered? But that would take more than 5 turns.\n\nAlternatively, we can plan for Alice to get the plate? \n\nBut note: we are at turn 45. We plan for the next few turns. We can set H=6, so until turn 50.\n\nBut then after turn 50, the soup is cooking and we need to serve it. So we should also plan for getting a plate and serving.\n\nBut we can do that in the same plan? \n\nAfter Alice puts the third onion at turn 50, she is at (4,1) holding nothing. Then she can go to the plate dispenser at (0,2). \n\nBut Bob is also free. We can have Bob get the plate? But we are only controlling Alice? Or we are to plan for both? The problem says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But the answer format only has one sequence. \n\nWe must output only Alice's actions. So we plan for Alice.\n\nSo after turn 50, Alice can go to (0,2) to get a plate.\n\nBut the plate dispenser is at (0,2). From (4,1) to (0,2):\n\n  (4,1) -> (3,1) [L] -> (2,1) [L] -> (1,1) [L] -> (0,1) [L] -> but (0,1) is a kitchen counter? And it has an onion? No: the non-empty kitchen counters: (6,1) has onion, but (0,1) is a kitchen counter and it is not listed as non-empty? So it is empty? Then walkable? Then from (0,1) she can move up to (0,2) but (0,2) is the plate dispenser? Not walkable. So she must be adjacent to (0,2) and facing it to interact.\n\nSo she can go to (0,1) and then face up to interact with the plate dispenser at (0,2). Or to (1,2) and then face left? \n\nBut (1,2): what is it? Not listed as non-empty, so empty? \n\nSo path:\n  (4,1) -> (3,1) [L] (turn 51: L to (3,1), facing left)\n  (3,1) -> (2,1) [L] (turn 52: L to (2,1), facing left)\n  (2,1) -> (1,1) [L] (turn 53: L to (1,1), facing left)\n  (1,1) -> (0,1) [L] (turn 54: L to (0,1), facing left) -> now at (0,1) which is a kitchen counter without item? So walkable? Then she can change orientation to up (U) to face the plate dispenser at (0,2). \n  Turn 55: change orientation to U -> facing up.\n  Turn 56: I -> grab a plate.\n\nThen she must go to the pot to serve the soup? But the soup is at (4,0) and cooking. It started cooking at turn 50 (after she put the third onion). So at turn 50, it starts cooking. After 5 turns, it will be ready at turn 55. So at turn 56, it is ready.\n\nThen she must go to the pot to serve. From (0,1) to (4,0):\n\n  This is long. Alternatively, Bob can do it? But we are only controlling Alice.\n\nBut note: we are to plan for the next several turns. We can set H=12? But the problem doesn't specify H. We can choose a reasonable H to achieve one delivery.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Alice get the plate earlier? But at the beginning, she was busy getting onions.\n\nAnother idea: after the pot starts cooking, Alice can get the plate and then wait? \n\nBut let's see the entire plan for Alice until serving:\n\nWe are at turn 45. We have:\n\n45: I (pick onion from (3,0))\n46: R (to (4,1))\n47: D (change orientation to down)\n48: I (put onion in pot) -> now pot has 2 onions? (with Bob's at the same turn)\n49: I (pick onion from (4,2)) -> now holding onion\n50: I (put onion in pot) -> now pot has 3 onions and starts cooking at turn 50.\n\nThen:\n51: L (to (3,1))\n52: L (to (2,1))\n53: L (to (1,1))\n54: L (to (0,1))\n55: U (change orientation to up to face the plate dispenser at (0,2))\n56: I (grab a plate)\n\nNow she is at (0,1) holding a plate. She must go to the pot at (4,0) to serve the soup. The soup is ready at turn 55? Started at turn 50, so at turn 55 it is done. But at turn 56, she grabs the plate. Then at turn 57, she can start moving.\n\nBut she is at (0,1). She must go to (4,0). How?\n\n  (0,1) -> (1,1) [R] (turn 57: R to (1,1), facing right)\n  (1,1) -> (2,1) [R] (turn 58)\n  (2,1) -> (3,1) [R] (turn 59)\n  (3,1) -> (4,1) [R] (turn 60) -> now at (4,1), facing right? But she needs to face down to interact with the pot? \n  Turn 61: D (change orientation to down) -> now facing the pot\n  Turn 62: I (serve the soup) -> she must be holding a plate and the soup is cooked. Then she serves it and gets the reward.\n\nBut note: the serving counter is at (6,2). But to serve the soup, she must take the soup from the pot and then bring it to the serving counter? \n\nI think I missed a step. \n\nWhen the soup is cooked in the pot, to serve it, a player must be holding a clean plate and interact with the pot to put the soup on the plate. Then take that plate to the serving counter.\n\nSo after the soup is cooked, Alice must:\n  - Get a plate.\n  - Go to the pot and interact to put the soup on the plate (so now she is holding a soup in plate).\n  - Then take it to the serving counter at (6,2) and interact to deliver.\n\nSo at turn 56, she has a plate at (0,1). Then she goes to the pot at (4,0). At turn 62, she is at (4,1) facing down and interacts with the pot: this action will put the soup on her plate? Because she has a plate and the pot has cooked soup.\n\nThen she is holding a soup in plate. Then she must go to the serving counter at (6,2).\n\nFrom (4,1) to (6,2):\n  (4,1) -> (5,1) [R] (turn 63: R to (5,1), facing right)\n  (5,1) -> (6,1) [R] -> but (6,1) is a kitchen counter with an onion? Non-empty -> not walkable. So she cannot go to (6,1). \n\nAlternative: from (4,1) go up? \n  (4,1) -> (4,2) -> but (4,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion -> non-empty -> not walkable. \n  Or go to (5,1) then to (5,2) [U]? (5,2) is not listed as non-empty, so empty? Then to (6,2) which is the serving counter? Not walkable? But she doesn't need to walk on it, just adjacent and facing.\n\nSo she can go:\n  From (4,1): \n    Turn 62: I (put soup on plate) -> now holding soup.\n    Turn 63: R (to (5,1))\n    Turn 64: U (to (5,2)) -> now at (5,2) which is adjacent to the serving counter at (6,2) to the right? \n    Turn 65: change orientation to R (if not already? After moving up from (5,1) to (5,2), she is facing up? So she must change to right.\n    Turn 66: I (deliver at serving counter)\n\nBut note: (5,2) is adjacent to (6,2) on the right. So she can face right and interact.\n\nBut the serving counter is at (6,2). \n\nSo total turns: from turn 45 to turn 66 -> 22 turns? That is too long? And we don't know if Bob is available to help.\n\nBut Bob is free after turn 48. We can have Bob get the plate? Then we don't need Alice to do it.\n\nBut we are only controlling Alice. \n\nAlternatively, we can have Alice get the plate while the soup is cooking? But the plate dispenser is at (0,2) and the soup is at (4,0). \n\nAfter the pot starts cooking at turn 50, Alice can go to get the plate. Then come back to the pot when the soup is ready.\n\nBut the soup is ready at turn 55. So she must be back by turn 55? \n\nAt turn 50, she is at (4,1) holding nothing. She needs to get to (0,2) to get a plate. How many turns? \n\nFrom (4,1) to (0,2): \n  (4,1) -> (3,1) [L] (1 turn)\n  (3,1) -> (2,1) [L] (2)\n  (2,1) -> (1,1) [L] (3)\n  (1,1) -> (0,1) [L] (4) -> then to interact with (0,2), she must be at (0,1) and face up? Or at (1,2) and face left? \n\nBut (1,2): not listed as non-empty, so empty? \n\nAlternatively: from (4,1) go up to (4,2)? But (4,2) is non-empty -> cannot. So she must go left to (0,1). \n\nAt turn 54: she is at (0,1). Then turn 55: change orientation to U to face up. Turn 56: I to grab plate. \n\nBut the soup is ready at turn 55. So at turn 55, she is at (0,1) facing up and hasn't grabbed the plate yet. Then at turn 56, she grabs the plate. Then she must go back to the pot.\n\nFrom (0,1) to (4,1): 4 moves right. Then at (4,1) she must face down and interact.\n\nSo:\n  Turn 57: R to (1,1)\n  Turn 58: R to (2,1)\n  Turn 59: R to (3,1)\n  Turn 60: R to (4,1) -> now at (4,1) facing right? \n  Turn 61: D (change to down)\n  Turn 62: I (to get the soup on the plate)\n\nThen she has the soup on the plate. Then she must deliver to serving counter at (6,2) as before.\n\nThis takes until turn 62 for the interaction to get the soup, and then more to deliver.\n\nBut we have Bob free. Since we are only controlling Alice, we cannot control Bob. But we can assume Bob will help? \n\nHowever, the problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice\". So we must output only Alice's actions.\n\nBut we can coordinate with Bob? But we don't output Bob's actions. \n\nGiven the time, perhaps we can plan for Alice to complete one soup delivery in the minimum turns.\n\nBut the initial plan until turn 50 is good. Then for the plate, we can have Alice get it earlier? \n\nAt turn 45 to 50, we have Alice busy. After turn 50, she is free. She can get the plate. \n\nBut Bob is free after turn 48. If we assume that Bob will get the plate, then Alice doesn't need to. But we don't control Bob.\n\nTo be safe, we plan for Alice to get the plate after the soup is cooking.\n\nSo for now, we can plan for Alice until turn 50, and then the next actions can be planned later? But the task is to plan for several turns. We can choose H=6, so from turn 45 to turn 50.\n\nSo Alice's actions:\n\nTurn 45: I (pick up onion from (3,0))\nTurn 46: R (move to (4,1))\nTurn 47: D (change orientation to down)\nTurn 48: I (put onion in pot at (4,0)) [pot now has 2 onions, with Bob's]\nTurn 49: I (pick up onion from (4,2)) [but wait: at turn 48, she put the onion, so she is holding nothing. Then at turn 49, she is at (4,1) facing down, and (4,2) is below her? (4,2) is at (4,2) which is south of (4,1)? Yes, so she can interact to pick up the onion at (4,2) because it is adjacent and she is facing it? But note: (4,2) is below (4,1) and she is facing down, so yes.\n\nBut is (4,2) adjacent to (4,1)? Yes, vertically adjacent.\n\nSo turn 49: I (pick up onion from (4,2))\nTurn 50: I (put onion in pot at (4,0)) -> now the pot has 3 onions and starts cooking.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 45: I\nTurn 46: R\nTurn 47: D\nTurn 48: I\nTurn 49: I\nTurn 50: I\n}\n\nThis is 6 turns.\n\nBut note: at turn 49, she picks up the onion from (4,2), and at turn 50, she puts it in the pot. She is at (4,1) and the pot is at (4,0) below her, so she can interact.\n\nThis plan assumes that at turn 48, Bob also puts his onion in the pot. If not, then at turn 48 the pot might have only one onion (from Alice) and then at turn 50, after Alice puts the second onion, it will have two, not three. \n\nBut Bob's action history shows he was moving towards the pot. We can assume he will put it at turn 48.\n\nIf we want to be safe, Alice could get two onions herself? But then we waste Bob's onion.\n\nAlternatively, after Alice picks up the onion at (3,0) at turn 45, she could put it in the pot immediately? But she is at (3,1) and the pot is at (2,0) or (4,0). To put in (2,0): she would need to go to (2,1) or (1,0) or (2,-1) [invalid] or (3,0) [which is now empty after she picked up the onion? But at turn 45, after she picks up, (3,0) becomes empty and walkable? \n\nSo at turn 45: I (pick up onion from (3,0)) -> (3,0) becomes empty and walkable.\nThen turn 46: D (move to (3,0)) -> now at (3,0), facing down.\nThen from (3,0), she can go to (2,0) which is the pot? But (2,0) is a pot -> not walkable. So she must be adjacent. From (3,0), she can face left to interact with the pot at (2,0)? But (2,0) is to the west.\n\nSo at turn 47: change orientation to L (face west) -> then interact to put onion in pot at (2,0) at turn 48.\n\nThen she is at (3,0) holding nothing. Then she can go to (4,2) to get another onion? But (4,2) is far. \n\nAnd Bob is putting his onion in (4,0) at turn 48. So now we have two pots with one onion each. Then we need to complete both? That would take more time.\n\nSo the first plan is better: both players put onions in the same pot.\n\nTherefore, we output the 6-turn plan for Alice.\n\nBut in the plan, at turn 49, she picks up the onion from (4,2). But (4,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion. After she picks it up, (4,2) becomes empty.\n\nThen at turn 50, she puts it in the pot at (4,0).\n\nSo the actions are as above.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 45: I\nTurn 46: R\nTurn 47: D\nTurn 48: I\nTurn 49: I\nTurn 50: I\n}\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice and Bob should collaborate to prepare and deliver a soup using Recipe 1 (3 onions, reward 20, cooking time 5 turns). The current game state shows Bob holding one onion and moving toward the pot at (4,0), while Alice is positioned to access onions on kitchen counters efficiently. The plan focuses on Alice collecting and adding onions to the pot at (4,0), leveraging Bob's onion to complete the recipe quickly.\n\n### Plan for Alice (Turns 45 to 50)\n1. **Turn 45: Interact (I)**  \n   - Alice is at (3,1), facing down (D), adjacent to and facing the kitchen counter at (3,0) which holds an onion. She picks up the onion, leaving the counter empty.\n\n2. **Turn 46: Move Right (R)**  \n   - Alice moves to (4,1) and now faces right (R). This positions her adjacent to both the pot at (4,0) and the kitchen counter at (4,2).\n\n3. **Turn 47: Change Orientation to Down (D)**  \n   - Alice changes orientation to face down (D) toward the pot at (4,0). This prepares her to interact with the pot.\n\n4. **Turn 48: Interact (I)**  \n   - Alice adds her onion to the pot at (4,0). Assuming Bob simultaneously adds his onion (based on his movement toward (4,0)), the pot now contains 2 onions.\n\n5. **Turn 49: Interact (I)**  \n   - Alice interacts with the kitchen counter at (4,2) (adjacent below her) to pick up the onion there. She now holds an onion, and the counter becomes empty.\n\n6. **Turn 50: Interact (I)**  \n   - Alice adds the onion to the pot at (4,0). With 3 onions, the soup starts cooking automatically (will be ready at turn 55).\n\n### Coordination with Bob\n- **Bob's Role**: Bob (at (5,3) holding an onion) moves toward the pot at (4,0). By turn 48, he should reach (5,0), face left, and add his onion to the pot. This ensures the pot has 2 onions when Alice adds hers at turn 48.\n- **Post-Cooking**: After turn 50, Alice or Bob should fetch a plate from (0,2) and serve the cooked soup at (6,2) once ready (turn 55+). However, this is beyond the 6-turn plan.\n\n### Rationale\n- **Efficiency**: Alice uses her position to access onions at (3,0) and (4,2) with minimal movement. Bob's onion is utilized to reduce the number of onions Alice needs to collect.\n- **Reward Maximization**: Completing Recipe 1 yields 20 points. Starting cooking early (turn 50) allows serving by turn 55, enabling further recipes.\n- **Constraints Adhered To**: \n  - Alice interacts only when adjacent and facing the target.\n  - Movement avoids non-empty tiles (e.g., (4,2) was non-empty until turn 49).\n  - Carrying one item at a time is respected.\n\nThis 6-turn plan ensures the soup starts cooking quickly, setting up for timely delivery.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 45: I \\\\\nTurn 46: R \\\\\nTurn 47: D \\\\\nTurn 48: I \\\\\nTurn 49: I \\\\\nTurn 50: I\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes. The only recipe given is Recipe 1, which requires 3 onions, cooks in 5 turns, and gives a reward of 20. There are no tomato dispensers, so we can only make onion soup.\n\nCurrent game state at turn 48:\n\n- Alice (me): Position (3,1), facing Down, holding one onion.\n\n- Bob: Position (3,3), facing Left, holding nothing.\n\nKitchen counters have onions on (6,1), (2,2), (4,2), and (6,3). All pots are empty.\n\nPots are at (2,0) and (4,0).\n\nServing counter is at (6,2).\n\nI need to plan a sequence of actions for Alice for the next H turns. H isn't specified, but since cooking takes 5 turns, I should plan for at least that long to complete a soup. Let's say H=10 for now to cover multiple actions.\n\nThe goal is to deliver soups for rewards. Since all pots are empty, we need to fill a pot with 3 onions to start cooking.\n\nAlice is holding an onion, so she can add it to a pot. But she needs to be adjacent and facing the pot to interact.\n\nAlice is at (3,1), facing Down. The pots are at (2,0) and (4,0). (2,0) is to her left and down, but let's see the grid.\n\nLet me sketch the grid based on the tile types:\n\n- Rows and columns: From the lists, x from 0 to 6, y from 0 to 4? Let's see:\n\nKitchen counters: (0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nOnion dispensers: (2,4), (4,4)\n\nPlate dispenser: (0,2)\n\nPots: (2,0), (4,0)\n\nServing counter: (6,2)\n\nAlice at (3,1), Bob at (3,3).\n\n(3,1) is a position; let's see what tile it is. From the kitchen counters list, (3,1) is not listed, so it might be an empty tile? Similarly, (3,3) is not in kitchen counters, so probably empty.\n\nKitchen counters are specific tiles, so other tiles might be empty or other types.\n\nBut from the context, (3,1) and (3,3) should be walkable, so empty tiles I assume.\n\nNow, Alice is at (3,1), holding an onion, facing Down. Down from (3,1) is (3,0). What is at (3,0)? From kitchen counters, (3,0) is a kitchen counter. But Alice is facing down towards (3,0), which is a kitchen counter.\n\nShe can interact with it if she is adjacent and facing it. She is at (3,1), which is adjacent to (3,0) since it's directly below? Coordinates: let's assume (x,y), with y increasing up? In the move actions, U is y+1, D is y-1, so y=0 is bottom, y=4 is top? Typically in grids, y=0 might be bottom or top; I need to clarify.\n\nIn the move actions: L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1). So if U is y+1, that means y increases upwards, so (3,1) to (3,0) is down, decreasing y.\n\n(3,0) is a kitchen counter tile. Since Alice is at (3,1) and facing down towards (3,0), she is adjacent to it and facing it, so she can interact with (3,0).\n\nBut (3,0) is a kitchen counter, not a pot. Pots are at (2,0) and (4,0).\n\n(3,0) is a kitchen counter, so if she interacts, she might place her onion there or pick something up, but it's empty? The non-empty kitchen counters are listed: (6,1) has onion, (2,2) has onion, (4,2) has onion, (6,3) has onion. (3,0) is a kitchen counter but not listed as non-empty, so it should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, other kitchen counters might be empty.\n\nSo Alice at (3,1) facing down to (3,0), which is an empty kitchen counter. If she interacts, since she is holding an onion, she can place it on the counter.\n\nBut we don't necessarily want to place it; we want to use it for soup.\n\nPots are at (2,0) and (4,0).\n\nFrom (3,1), to reach (2,0) or (4,0).\n\n(2,0) is left and down: from (3,1), moving left to (2,1) or down to (3,0), but (3,0) is a counter, not walkable? Tile types: kitchen counters are not walkable? The rules say: players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles. But kitchen counters can be empty or occupied.\n\nThe rules: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" And \"non-empty tiles\" refer to tiles that have something, like items on counters or dispensers, etc.\n\nBut for walking, it depends on whether the tile is occupied or not.\n\nFrom the constraints: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" And non-empty tiles are those with objects, I think.\n\nAlso, in the tile types, dispensers, pots, counters are all non-empty tiles in the sense that they have a function, but players can walk on empty tiles, and I think counters, dispensers, etc., are not walkable; only empty tiles are walkable.\n\nLet me check the rules.\n\n\"Game Grid (2D Tile Types)\":\n\n- Empty Tile: Walkable space.\n\n- Dispensers: Sources for items (not walkable, I assume)\n\n- Pot: Cooks soup (not walkable)\n\n- Serving Counter: Deliver cooked soup (not walkable)\n\n- Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage (not walkable)\n\nSo only empty tiles are walkable. Players can only be on empty tiles.\n\nIn the player actions, move: changes position to adjacent empty tile.\n\nAlso, interact: player must be on an empty tile adjacent to the target and facing it.\n\nSo in this case, positions like (3,1) must be an empty tile since Alice is there.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) must be empty.\n\n(3,0) is a kitchen counter, so not walkable; Alice cannot move to (3,0).\n\nShe can only interact with it from adjacent empty tile.\n\nBack to Alice: at (3,1), which is empty, facing down to (3,0), kitchen counter.\n\nShe is holding an onion.\n\nTo add to a pot, she needs to go to a pot location.\n\nNearest pot is (2,0) or (4,0).\n\n(2,0): to reach it, she needs to be at a tile adjacent to it. Adjacent tiles to (2,0) might be (2,1), (1,0), (3,0), but (3,0) is kitchen counter, not walkable. Similarly, (1,0) is kitchen counter, (2,1) — what is (2,1)? Not listed in any special tile, so probably empty tile.\n\nSimilarly for (4,0).\n\nList the grid around pots.\n\nFor pot at (2,0):\n\n- North: (2,1) — not in kitchen counters or other, so empty tile.\n\n- East: (3,0) — kitchen counter\n\n- West: (1,0) — kitchen counter\n\n- South: probably not, y-1, but y=0, so no tile south? Assuming grid from y=0 to 4.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,0):\n\n- North: (4,1) — empty? Not listed, so empty.\n\n- West: (3,0) — kitchen counter\n\n- East: (5,0) — kitchen counter\n\n- South: no\n\nAlice is at (3,1). (3,1) is empty tile.\n\nTo reach a position to interact with pot at (2,0), she needs to be at (2,1) and facing down (since pot is south of (2,1)? (2,1) to (2,0) is down, y-1.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,0), she needs to be at (4,1) and facing down.\n\nFrom (3,1), she can move left to (2,1) or right to (4,1).\n\n(2,1) is adjacent to (2,0), and (4,1) to (4,0).\n\nCurrently she is facing down, towards (3,0), which is kitchen counter.\n\nIf she interacts now, she would place the onion on (3,0), since it's empty kitchen counter and she is holding an item.\n\nBut that might not be useful; we want to put it in a pot.\n\nSo better to move to (2,1) or (4,1) to add to pot.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (3,3), holding nothing, facing left.\n\n(3,3) is empty tile, facing left, so towards (2,3)? What is at (2,3)? Not listed, so empty? But kitchen counters include (2,2), (3,2), etc.\n\n(2,3): not in kitchen counters, so empty tile.\n\nHe can move or interact.\n\nThere are onions on kitchen counters: (6,1), (2,2), (4,2), (6,3).\n\nBob could pick up an onion from one of these to help fill a pot.\n\nTo deliver soup, we need plates and cooked soup.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nServing counter at (6,2).\n\nCooking takes 5 turns after pot has 3 ingredients.\n\nCurrently, all pots empty, so we need to add 3 onions to a pot to start cooking.\n\nAlice has one onion, so she can add it, then we need two more.\n\nThere are onions on counters: (6,1), (2,2), (4,2), (6,3), so Bob or Alice can pick those up to add to the pot.\n\nBut Alice is already holding one, so she can add it first.\n\nLet's plan to use one pot, say (2,0) for simplicity.\n\nAlice at (3,1), can move left to (2,1), then face down and interact to add onion to pot at (2,0).\n\nAfter adding, she is empty-handed.\n\nThen, she or Bob can get another onion to add.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (3,3), which is above (3,2). (3,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion? Non-empty kitchen counters: (2,2) has onion, (4,2) has onion, but (3,2) is also a kitchen counter, but not listed as non-empty, so it might be empty or have nothing.\n\nNon-empty listed: (6,1): onion, (2,2): onion, (4,2): onion, (6,3): onion. So (3,2) is a kitchen counter but empty, I think.\n\nBob at (3,3), facing left, so towards (2,3). (2,3) is empty tile, I believe.\n\nHe can move to (2,3) or other places.\n\nTo get an onion, he can go to a counter with onion, e.g. (2,2) or (4,2) or (6,3) or (6,1).\n\n(2,2) is kitchen counter with onion. To interact, he needs to be adjacent and facing it.\n\nFor example, from (2,3), which is above (2,2), he can face down and interact to pick up the onion from (2,2).\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAlso, he could go to an onion dispenser at (2,4) or (4,4), but since there are onions on counters, it might be faster to use those.\n\nNow, let's think about the sequence.\n\nFirst, Alice should add her onion to a pot.\n\nChoose pot (2,0).\n\nFrom (3,1), move left to (2,1). That takes one action: L.\n\nAt (2,1), she is not facing the pot; the pot is at (2,0), south, so she needs to face down.\n\nCurrently, after move, her orientation might change? The action: move changes position and orientation. Specifically, when you move, you change to that direction.\n\nFrom rules: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\"\n\nAlso, \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if adjacent tile not empty.\"\n\nSo when she moves left to (2,1), she will be facing left (since L move changes orientation to left).\n\nThen, at (2,1), to interact with pot at (2,0), she needs to face down. So she can change orientation to down, which is one action: D (but D is move down or change orientation down? The actions are the same set: U,D,L,R for move or orientation change.\n\nThe actions are: Move or Change Orientation or Interact or Stay.\n\nFor orientation change, it's separate action: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nBut in this case, from (2,1), if she changes orientation to down, she can do that without moving, since it's just changing facing.\n\nThen, facing down, she can interact with (2,0).\n\nSo sequence for Alice: at turn 48, she is at (3,1), facing down.\n\nAction for turn 48: I need to give action for turn t1=48, and then subsequent turns.\n\nThe plan starts from t1=48.\n\nSo for turn 48, Alice can take action.\n\nCurrent state: position (3,1), orientation D, holding onion.\n\nIf she interacts now, she would interact with (3,0), which is kitchen counter, and since it's empty, she would place her onion on (3,0). But we might not want that; it's better to put in pot directly.\n\nShe could move to (2,1) first.\n\nAction: Move Left to (2,1). After move, she will be at (2,1), facing left.\n\nThen, on next turn, she can change orientation to down (action D for down orientation), then interact.\n\nBut that takes two turns to add the onion.\n\nShe could, from (3,1), change orientation to left? But she is facing down, to face left, she can change orientation to left without moving.\n\nThen, facing left, she can move left to (2,1), and after move, she would be facing left.\n\nThen still need to face down to interact with pot.\n\nSame thing.\n\nSince (2,1) is adjacent to (2,0), and she can be at (2,1) facing down, then interact.\n\nBut to get to (2,1) facing down, she needs to move or change orientation.\n\nEfficient way: from (3,1), move left to (2,1), which changes position to (2,1) and orientation to left.\n\nThen, at (2,1), change orientation to down (action D for orientation down).\n\nThen interact with pot (action I).\n\nThat's three actions to add the onion.\n\nBut since she is at (3,1) and (2,1) is adjacent, she can do it in fewer? Only if she is already facing the right direction when moving, but after move, orientation is set to direction of move.\n\nUnless she changes orientation first, then moves, but moving changes orientation again.\n\nLet's see: if at (3,1) facing down, she changes orientation to left (action L for orientation change), so now facing left, position same.\n\nThen, move left to (2,1), which changes position to (2,1) and orientation to left (since move left).\n\nThen, she is at (2,1) facing left, but to interact with (2,0) south, she needs to face down, so still need to change orientation to down.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf from (3,1), she moves down? But (3,0) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so she cannot move down. Only to empty tiles; (3,0) not empty, so move down not possible. Similarly, other directions: left to (2,1) is possible, right to (4,1) possible, up to (3,2)? (3,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so cannot move up.\n\n(3,2) is kitchen counter, so not walkable. So from (3,1), she can only move left to (2,1) or right to (4,1), both empty tiles.\n\nSimilarly, down to (3,0) not possible, up to (3,2) not possible.\n\nSo only left or right.\n\nSay she moves left to (2,1) on turn 48 action.\n\nAfter action, state: position (2,1), orientation left (since move left), holding onion.\n\nThen on turn 49, she needs to face down to interact with pot at (2,0). So action: change orientation down (D).\n\nThen on turn 50, interact (I) to add onion to pot.\n\nPot was empty, now has one onion.\n\nAlice now empty-handed.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can be doing something.\n\nBob at (3,3), facing left, holding nothing.\n\nHe can go to a counter to pick up an onion.\n\nFor example, (2,2) has onion, which is below and left.\n\nFrom (3,3), he can move left to (2,3) (assuming (2,3) empty), then face down to interact with (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is kitchen counter with onion.\n\nBob at (3,3), facing left.\n\nAction for Bob: I need to plan for Alice, but optionally Bob, but the task is to plan for Alice, so I should focus on Alice's actions, and assume Bob will cooperate or I can suggest, but for the answer, I think only Alice's actions are required.\n\nThe task says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", but in the answer format, only Alice's actions are listed, I think.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t: a_t for Alice.\n\nSo I need to specify only Alice's actions.\n\nBut to maximize reward, we need both players, so I should consider what Bob might do, but since I'm only controlling Alice, I'll plan Alice's actions assuming Bob is rational.\n\nIn the context, I can assume Bob will help to add ingredients or get plates.\n\nBut for now, let's plan Alice.\n\nAfter adding onion, Alice is at (2,1), empty-handed.\n\nShe can get another onion to add to the pot.\n\nPot has one onion, needs two more.\n\nShe can pick up an onion from a nearby counter, e.g. (2,2) has onion, which is south of (2,1)? (2,1) to (2,2) is up, y+1.\n\n(2,2) is at y=2, so from (2,1) y=1, to (2,2) is north, up.\n\nBut (2,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so Alice at (2,1) can face up and interact with (2,2).\n\nSince (2,2) has onion, she can pick it up.\n\nFirst, she needs to face up.\n\nCurrently at turn 50, after interact, she is at (2,1), orientation? After adding to pot, she is still facing down, I think. Orientation doesn't change on interact.\n\nAfter turn 50: she added onion, so position (2,1), orientation down (since she faced down to interact), holding nothing.\n\nNow, to interact with (2,2) which is north, she needs to face up.\n\nSo on turn 51, change orientation to up (U).\n\nThen on turn 52, interact with (2,2) to pick up onion.\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nThen she can add it to the pot at (2,0).\n\nShe is at (2,1), facing up after orientation change, but to add to pot, she needs to face down.\n\nPot at (2,0) south.\n\nSo on turn 53, change orientation to down (D).\n\nThen turn 54, interact with pot to add second onion.\n\nNow pot has two onions.\n\nAlice empty-handed.\n\nThen she needs to get the third onion.\n\nShe can get from another counter, e.g. (4,2) or (6,1), etc.\n\nBut (4,2) is at (4,2), which is east.\n\nFrom (2,1), she can move right to (3,1), then to (4,1), then face up to interact with (4,2)? (4,2) is kitchen counter.\n\n(4,1) is empty tile, I assume.\n\nSimilarly, there is onion at (4,2).\n\nBut Bob might be closer or something.\n\nFirst, let's see Bob.\n\nBob is at (3,3), he can help.\n\nFor example, Bob at (3,3), he can move to (2,3) or (4,3), etc.\n\n(2,2) has onion, but Alice is about to pick it up.\n\nIn the above, Alice is getting the onion from (2,2) on turn 52.\n\nBut Bob could get it faster or something.\n\nTo save time, let's coordinate.\n\nSince Alice is near (2,2), she can pick that onion.\n\nThen for the third onion, Bob can get one.\n\nBut I'm only planning Alice.\n\nAfter Alice adds second onion, she is at (2,1), empty.\n\nShe can move to another counter to get onion.\n\nFor example, (4,2) has onion.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (4,1): move right to (3,1), then to (4,1).\n\n(3,1) is empty, (4,1) empty.\n\nThen at (4,1), face up to interact with (4,2) which has onion.\n\nBut (4,2) is north of (4,1).\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's list Alice's actions.\n\nAlso, after pot has three onions, it starts cooking, takes 5 turns, then someone needs to get a plate and serve the soup.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nServing counter at (6,2).\n\nSo we need to get plates.\n\nBob is free, he can get plates.\n\nBut for Alice, she might need to get a plate later.\n\nFirst, let's get the pot filled.\n\nCurrent turn: t1=48.\n\nPlan Alice actions:\n\nTurn 48: Move Left to (2,1). After: pos (2,1), ori left, hold onion.\n\nTurn 49: Change orientation to Down (D). Now facing down.\n\nTurn 50: Interact (I) with pot at (2,0). Add onion, now pot has 1 onion. Alice: pos (2,1), ori down, hold nothing.\n\nNow, turn 51: Change orientation to Up (U) to face (2,2). Since (2,2) is north.\n\nTurn 52: Interact (I) with (2,2) to pick up onion. Now holding onion. Still at (2,1), ori up.\n\nNow, to add to pot, need to face down.\n\nTurn 53: Change orientation to Down (D).\n\nTurn 54: Interact (I) with pot to add second onion. Pot now has 2 onions. Alice empty, at (2,1), ori down.\n\nNow, need third onion. She can go to (4,2) which has onion.\n\nFirst, move to (4,1).\n\nFrom (2,1), move right to (3,1): turn 55: Move Right (R). After: pos (3,1), ori right.\n\nThen move right to (4,1): turn 56: Move Right (R). Now at (4,1), ori right.\n\n(4,1) is adjacent to (4,2) north, but she is facing right, not up.\n\n(4,2) is kitchen counter north of (4,1).\n\nSo need to face up.\n\nTurn 57: Change orientation to Up (U).\n\nTurn 58: Interact (I) with (4,2) to pick up onion. Now holding onion.\n\nThen, add to pot at (4,0)? But the pot we are using is at (2,0), not (4,0).\n\nPot at (2,0) is where we have two onions.\n\n(4,0) is another pot, empty.\n\nWe should add to the same pot.\n\nSo Alice needs to go back to (2,1) to add to (2,0).\n\nFrom (4,1), move left to (3,1): turn 59: Move Left (L). To (3,1), ori left.\n\nThen move left to (2,1): turn 60: Move Left (L). To (2,1), ori left.\n\nThen face down: turn 61: Change orientation Down (D).\n\nThen interact with pot: turn 62: Interact (I) to add third onion.\n\nNow pot has three onions, cooking starts.\n\nCooking time: 5 turns for the recipe.\n\nSo after turn 62, pot starts cooking at turn 62, so will be ready at turn 67.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice is at (2,1), empty.\n\nShe can get a plate or something.\n\nBut Bob might be better to get plates.\n\nFirst, let's see where Bob is.\n\nBob at (3,3), facing left.\n\nHe could have been getting the third onion or plates.\n\nSince I'm only planning Alice, I'll continue.\n\nAfter adding third onion, Alice can go to get a plate.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nFrom (2,1), she can move up to (2,2)? But (2,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so cannot move up.\n\nMove right to (3,1), then up? (3,1) to (3,2) is up, but (3,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nSo she needs to go around.\n\nTo reach (0,2), which is plate dispenser.\n\n(0,2) is at left top? y=2.\n\nPath: from (2,1), move left to (1,1)? (1,1) what tile? Not listed, so empty? Kitchen counters include (1,0), (0,1), etc., but (1,1) not listed, so probably empty.\n\nSimilarly, (0,1) is kitchen counter, (0,2) is plate dispenser.\n\nSo from (2,1), move left to (1,1): possible, if (1,1) empty.\n\nThen from (1,1), she can interact with (1,0) or (0,1) or (0,2), but (0,2) is plate dispenser.\n\n(1,1) to (0,2) is not adjacent; (0,2) is at x=0,y=2, (1,1) at x=1,y=1, so not adjacent; adjacent would be (0,1), (1,2), etc.\n\n(0,1) is kitchen counter, (1,2) — what is (1,2)? Not listed, so empty tile.\n\nTo reach (0,2), she needs to be at a tile adjacent to it.\n\nAdjacent to (0,2): probably (0,1), (0,3), (1,2).\n\n(0,1) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\n(0,3) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\n(1,2) might be empty.\n\n(1,2) not listed, so empty tile.\n\nThen from (1,2), she can face left to interact with (0,2) plate dispenser.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo from (2,1), to go to (1,2).\n\nFirst, from (2,1), move up? Cannot, (2,2) not walkable.\n\nMove left to (1,1): turn, say after previous.\n\nAfter turn 62, Alice at (2,1), ori down, empty.\n\nTurn 63: Move Left to (1,1). Now at (1,1), ori left.\n\nThen from (1,1), move up to (1,2)? (1,2) is empty? Assume yes. Move Up (U). Turn 64: Move Up (U) to (1,2), ori up.\n\nNow at (1,2), facing up. But (0,2) is west? x=0,y=2 vs x=1,y=2, so west, left.\n\nSo she needs to face left to interact.\n\nTurn 65: Change orientation Left (L).\n\nTurn 66: Interact (I) with plate dispenser at (0,2) to grab a plate. Now holding a clean plate.\n\nBut the soup is cooking at (2,0), will be ready at turn 67.\n\nAfter getting plate, she needs to go to the pot to serve the soup.\n\nPot at (2,0), which is south of (2,1).\n\nShe is at (1,2), need to go to (2,1) to interact with pot.\n\nFrom (1,2), move right to (2,2)? (2,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so cannot.\n\nMove down to (1,1): turn 67: Move Down (D) to (1,1), ori down.\n\nThen move right to (2,1): turn 68: Move Right (R) to (2,1), ori right.\n\nNow at (2,1), need to face down to interact with pot at (2,0).\n\nTurn 69: Change orientation Down (D).\n\nTurn 70: Interact (I) with pot. Since she is holding plate and soup is cooked, she serves the soup, so now she has the soup on plate.\n\nThen, need to deliver to serving counter at (6,2).\n\nServing counter at (6,2).\n\nFrom (2,1), she can move to (3,1), then to (4,1), etc., to (6,2).\n\n(6,2) is serving counter, not walkable, so need to be adjacent, e.g. (6,1), (5,2), (6,3).\n\n(6,1) has onion on counter, but it's a kitchen counter with item, so not walkable? Kitchen counter is a tile type, and it has an item, so it's non-empty, cannot walk on.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) has onion, non-empty.\n\n(5,2) — what is (5,2)? Not listed, so empty tile? Kitchen counters include (5,4), but not (5,2), so probably empty.\n\nAlso, (6,2) serving counter, adjacent tiles: (5,2) east? (5,2) to (6,2) is east if x increases right.\n\n(5,2) at x=5,y=2, (6,2) at x=6,y=2, so west of (6,2)? (6,2) has west: (5,2), east: no, north: (6,3), south: (6,1).\n\n(6,3) is kitchen counter with onion, not walkable.\n\n(6,1) is kitchen counter with onion, not walkable.\n\n(5,2) should be empty tile, so can stand there and face east to interact with (6,2).\n\nSimilarly, other points.\n\nSo Alice at (2,1), with soup on plate.\n\nMove to (3,1): turn 71: Move Right (R) to (3,1), ori right.\n\nThen to (4,1): turn 72: Move Right (R) to (4,1), ori right.\n\nThen to (5,1)? (5,1) what tile? Kitchen counters include (5,0), (5,4), not (5,1), so empty? Yes.\n\nMove to (5,1): turn 73: Move Right (R) to (5,1), ori right.\n\nBut (5,1) is at y=1, (6,2) is at y=2, so not directly adjacent; need to go to (5,2) or (6,1), but (6,1) not walkable.\n\nFrom (5,1), move up to (5,2)? (5,2) empty? Assume yes. Turn 74: Move Up (U) to (5,2), ori up.\n\nNow at (5,2), facing up. But serving counter is at (6,2), which is east? x=6,y=2 vs x=5,y=2, so east.\n\nShe needs to face east.\n\nTurn 75: Change orientation Right (R).\n\nTurn 76: Interact (I) with serving counter to deliver soup. Reward obtained.\n\nBut this is taking many turns, and the soup was ready at turn 67, but she is delivering at turn 76, which is late, but no problem, as long as delivered.\n\nBut we can optimize with Bob.\n\nBob can get the plate or serve.\n\nFor example, Bob at (3,3) can go to (0,2) to get a plate earlier.\n\nBut since I'm only planning Alice, let's see if Alice can do it faster.\n\nIn the beginning, instead of Alice getting all onions, Bob can get some.\n\nBut for Alice's actions, let's list what I have so far.\n\nAlso, cooking starts when third onion added, at turn 62, ready at turn 67.\n\nAlice is getting the plate around turn 66, but then moving to pot.\n\nIn turn 66, she gets plate at (1,2), then to (1,1), (2,1), then interact at turn 70, but soup ready at 67, so at turn 70 she serves, which is after ready, so ok.\n\nThen deliver by turn 76.\n\nBut H is not specified, but we can do for about 10-15 turns.\n\nSince there are onions on counters, Bob can add the second or third onion.\n\nFor example, after Alice adds first onion at turn 50, Bob can add another onion.\n\nBob at (3,3) at turn 48.\n\nHe can move to (2,3) on turn 48: say Move Left (L), to (2,3), ori left.\n\nThen change orientation down to face (2,2), interact to pick onion on turn 49 or 50.\n\nLet's not plan Bob, but assume he helps.\n\nTo save time, Alice can add her onion, then instead of getting second from (2,2), she can let Bob get it, and Alice can go get a plate or something.\n\nBut I need to specify only Alice's actions.\n\nAnother idea: use the onion on counters directly.\n\nFor example, Alice is holding an onion, she can add to pot quickly.\n\nThen for other onions, Bob or Alice can add, but Alice can be efficient.\n\nPot at (4,0) might be closer for some actions.\n\nLet's choose pot at (4,0) for Alice.\n\nAlice at (3,1), facing down.\n\nInstead of left to (2,1), move right to (4,1) on turn 48.\n\nTurn 48: Move Right (R) to (4,1), ori right.\n\nThen change orientation down: turn 49: D (orientation down).\n\nTurn 50: Interact with pot at (4,0) to add onion. Pot has 1 onion.\n\nAlice at (4,1), ori down, empty.\n\nThen, she can pick onion from (4,2), which is north.\n\n(4,2) has onion.\n\nTurn 51: Change orientation Up (U) to face north.\n\nTurn 52: Interact with (4,2) to pick onion. Now holding.\n\nThen add to pot: turn 53: Change orientation Down (D).\n\nTurn 54: Interact with pot to add second onion. Pot has 2.\n\nAlice empty.\n\nNow for third onion, she can go to (6,1) or (6,3) or (2,2), but (6,1) has onion.\n\nFrom (4,1), move right to (5,1): turn 55: Move Right (R) to (5,1), ori right.\n\nThen move right to (6,1)? But (6,1) is kitchen counter with onion, not walkable, so cannot move to (6,1).\n\nTo interact with (6,1), she needs to be at adjacent tile, e.g. (6,0), (5,1), or (6,2).\n\n(6,0) is kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\n(6,2) is serving counter, not walkable.\n\n(5,1) is empty, as before.\n\nSo at (5,1), she can face east to interact with (6,1)? (6,1) is at x=6,y=1, (5,1) is at x=5,y=1, so east.\n\nBut (6,1) is kitchen counter, and she is at (5,1), adjacent, facing east.\n\nThen interact to pick up onion from counter.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo from (4,1), after turn 54, at (4,1), ori down, empty.\n\nTurn 55: Move Right (R) to (5,1), ori right.\n\nTurn 56: Change orientation Right? To face east, but she is at (5,1), facing right (east), so already facing (6,1) if she is facing east.\n\n(5,1) to (6,1) is east, so if facing east, she can interact.\n\nAfter move to (5,1), ori right (east), so facing (6,1).\n\nTurn 57: Interact (I) with (6,1) to pick up onion. Now holding onion.\n\nThen, she needs to add to pot at (4,0), but she is at (5,1).\n\nGo back to (4,1): turn 58: Move Left (L) to (4,1), ori left.\n\nThen at (4,1), need to face down to interact with pot.\n\nTurn 59: Change orientation Down (D).\n\nTurn 60: Interact (I) with pot to add third onion. Pot has 3, cooking starts at turn 60.\n\nReady at turn 65.\n\nAlice at (4,1), empty.\n\nNow get plate.\n\nPlate at (0,2).\n\nFrom (4,1), move left to (3,1): turn 61: Move Left (L) to (3,1), ori left.\n\nThen to (2,1): turn 62: Move Left (L) to (2,1), ori left.\n\nThen to (1,1): turn 63: Move Left (L) to (1,1), ori left.\n\nThen to (1,2): move up, turn 64: Move Up (U) to (1,2), ori up.\n\nThen face left to (0,2): turn 65: Change orientation Left (L).\n\nTurn 66: Interact with plate dispenser at (0,2) to get plate.\n\nNow holding plate.\n\nSoup ready at turn 65, so she can go to serve.\n\nPot at (4,0), she is at (1,2).\n\nLong way back.\n\nGo to (4,1) to serve.\n\nFrom (1,2), move down to (1,1): turn 67: Move Down (D) to (1,1), ori down.\n\nThen move right to (2,1): turn 68: Move Right (R) to (2,1), ori right.\n\nTo (3,1): turn 69: Move Right (R) to (3,1), ori right.\n\nTo (4,1): turn 70: Move Right (R) to (4,1), ori right.\n\nThen face down: turn 71: Change orientation Down (D).\n\nTurn 72: Interact with pot to serve soup. Now has soup on plate.\n\nThen deliver to (6,2).\n\nFrom (4,1), move right to (5,1): turn 73: Move Right (R) to (5,1), ori right.\n\nThen to (5,2): move up, turn 74: Move Up (U) to (5,2), ori up.\n\nThen face east to (6,2): turn 75: Change orientation Right (R).\n\nTurn 76: Interact with serving counter to deliver.\n\nStill turn 76.\n\nBut in this case, cooking started later.\n\nFirst plan had cooking start at turn 62, ready 67, deliver by 76.\n\nThis one start cook at 60, ready 65, but serve at 72, deliver at 76.\n\nSimilar.\n\nBob can get the plate earlier.\n\nFor example, at turn 48, Bob is at (3,3), he can go to (0,2) to get a plate.\n\nBut I can't control Bob.\n\nPerhaps Alice can get the plate after adding her onion, and let Bob add the other onions.\n\nBut Bob might not.\n\nTo be safe, Alice can focus on one thing.\n\nAnother idea: since there are onions on counters, Alice can add her onion to the pot, then instead of getting another onion, she can get a plate immediately, and Bob can add the remaining onions.\n\nFor example, after Alice adds first onion at turn 50 (in first plan), she can go to get plate.\n\nThen Bob can add two onions from counters.\n\nBut for Alice's actions.\n\nLet's use the first plan with pot at (2,0).\n\nAnd assume Bob will help to add the other onions or get plate.\n\nBut for the sequence, I'll write Alice's actions.\n\nH should be defined; let's say for 10 turns or until soup delivered, but since cooking takes time, H=15 for example.\n\nBut the task says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\", so I need to choose H.\n\nPerhaps for the first few turns to start the process.\n\nBut to deliver soup, it might take more turns.\n\nSince the recipe is simple, and only one type, we can make one soup.\n\nAlso, there is another pot, but let's use one for now.\n\nAlice's action history: D, D, I, I, I for last 5 turns, but not sure what she did.\n\nBut not important for planning.\n\nLet's list Alice's actions from turn 48.\n\nI think the first plan is fine.\n\nTurn 48: Move L to (2,1)\n\nTurn 49: Change orientation D\n\nTurn 50: I (add onion to pot at (2,0))\n\nNow, instead of getting second onion, she can go for plate.\n\nTurn 51: Move R to (3,1)  // back to (3,1)\n\nTurn 52: Move L? To go to (1,1), but from (3,1), move left to (2,1): turn 51: from (2,1) move right to (3,1)? At turn 50, she is at (2,1), ori down, empty.\n\nTurn 51: Move Right (R) to (3,1), ori right.\n\nThen to go to (1,1), move left to (2,1): turn 52: Move Left (L) to (2,1), ori left. But (2,1) is where she was.\n\nBetter to go directly.\n\nFrom (3,1), move left to (2,1) on turn 51, but (2,1) is occupied? No, players can be on same tile? Rules: \"players cannot walk onto/through each other.\" So if Bob is elsewhere, ok.\n\nBut Bob at (3,3), far.\n\nSo from (2,1), turn 51: Move Left to (1,1), ori left. (1,1) empty.\n\nTurn 52: Move Up to (1,2), ori up. (1,2) empty.\n\nTurn 53: Change orientation Left (L) to face (0,2)\n\nTurn 54: I to get plate from dispenser. Now holding plate.\n\nBut the pot has only one onion, needs two more, not cooking yet.\n\nShe has a plate, but no soup.\n\nThen she needs to wait for soup to be cooked, but it's not started.\n\nSo she should not get plate too early.\n\nBetter to let the pot be filled first.\n\nSo in the first plan, Alice helps to fill the pot.\n\nThen after pot is cooking, she gets the plate.\n\nIn the first sequence, with H=10, she adds the third onion at turn 62.\n\nBut for shorter H, I can plan for fewer turns.\n\nPerhaps for turns 48 to 57 or something.\n\nLet's output a sequence for Alice.\n\nSince the soup needs to be served, and Bob can do part, but for Alice, let's plan to add her onion and then get a plate or something.\n\nBut to maximize reward, we need the soup delivered.\n\nPerhaps for the next 5 turns or so.\n\nBut let's assume H=10.\n\nI'll go with the first plan.\n\nAlice actions:\n\nTurn 48: L (move left to (2,1))\n\nTurn 49: D (change orientation down)\n\nTurn 50: I (interact with pot, add onion)\n\nTurn 51: U (change orientation up to face (2,2))\n\nTurn 52: I (interact with (2,2), pick up onion)\n\nTurn 53: D (change orientation down)\n\nTurn 54: I (interact with pot, add second onion)\n\nTurn 55: R (move right to (3,1))\n\nTurn 56: R (move right to (4,1))\n\nTurn 57: U (change orientation up to face (4,2))\n\nTurn 58: I (interact with (4,2), pick up onion)  // but (4,2) has onion, so pick up\n\nThen at turn 58, she has onion, needs to add to pot.\n\nBut in this, at turn 58, she is at (4,1), holding onion, but the pot with 2 onions is at (2,0), not (4,0).\n\nSo she needs to go back.\n\nTurn 59: L (move left to (3,1), ori left)\n\nTurn 60: L (move left to (2,1), ori left)\n\nTurn 61: D (change orientation down)\n\nTurn 62: I (add to pot at (2,0))\n\nThen cooking starts.\n\nFor H=15, she can continue to get plate.\n\nBut let's stop at turn 57 for H=10.\n\nH=10 from t1=48, so turns 48 to 57.\n\nBut at turn 58 she picks onion, not added yet.\n\nPerhaps for H=10, we have added two onions, and she is going for the third.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 58 she has the third onion.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll write for 10 turns.\n\nTurn 48: L\n\nTurn 49: D\n\nTurn 50: I\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: I\n\nTurn 53: D\n\nTurn 54: I\n\nTurn 55: R\n\nTurn 56: R\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nThen at turn 58, she can interact to pick onion from (4,2).\n\nBut in the plan, I need to specify actions up to H-1, but for sequence, I think list the actions.\n\nThe answer format is for turns t1 to t1+H-1 or something.\n\n\"plan a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=1 to H-1\" let's read.\n\n\"plan a sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=1}^{H-1}\\) for Alice over next several turns(say, H turns)\"\n\nIt says {a_{t1 + t} for t=1 to H-1, so that would be from t1+1 to t1+H-1, missing t1.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"plan a sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=1}^{H-1}\\) for Alice over next several turns(say, H turns)\"\n\nAnd in the answer format: Turn t1: a_{t1}, Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, etc.\n\nSo it includes turn t1.\n\nThe sequence is from t1 to t1 + (H-1), so H actions.\n\nFor example, H turns from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\n\"over next several turns(say, H turns)\" so H actions or H turns?\n\n\"plan ... over next several turns(say, H turns)\" and \"sequence ... for t=1 to H-1\" but that might be a mistake.\n\nIn the math, \\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=1}^{H-1} means a_{t1+1} to a_{t1+H-1}, which is H-1 actions, but for H turns, it should be H actions.\n\nLet's see the text: \"over next several turns(say, H turns)\" and \"sequence of actions ... for t=1 to H-1\" but that would be for turns t1+1 to t1+H-1, missing t1.\n\nBut in the answer format, it starts from Turn t1.\n\nProbably a inconsistency.\n\nI think it's better to start from t1 for H turns.\n\nSo I'll assume for turns t1 to t1+H-1, H actions.\n\nSet H=10 for example.\n\nSo for turns 48 to 57.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 48: L (move left to (2,1))\n\nTurn 49: D (change orientation down)\n\nTurn 50: I (add onion to pot at (2,0))\n\nTurn 51: U (change orientation up)\n\nTurn 52: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\n\nTurn 53: D (change orientation down)\n\nTurn 54: I (add second onion to pot at (2,0))\n\nTurn 55: R (move right to (3,1))\n\nTurn 56: R (move right to (4,1))\n\nTurn 57: U (change orientation up to face (4,2))\n\nThen on turn 58, she can interact to pick onion, but not in the sequence.\n\nFor H=10, up to turn 57.\n\nAt turn 57, she is at (4,1), facing up, ready to pick onion from (4,2).\n\nThen Bob can add it to the pot or something.\n\nBut I think it's ok.\n\nTo make it complete, let's include the interact.\n\nH=11.\n\nTurn 58: I (pick onion)\n\nThen she has onion, needs to add to pot.\n\nBut not in sequence.\n\nI think for the purpose, this is fine.\n\nPerhaps Alice can go for the plate after adding the first onion.\n\nBut let's finalize.\n\nAnother thing: the action history shows Alice did I,I,I recently, which might mean she interacted with something, but not specified, so ignore.\n\nSo I'll go with this.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice and Bob must collaborate to fill a pot with 3 onions, cook the soup for 5 turns, and deliver it to the serving counter. Given the current state at turn 48, Alice is holding an onion and near the pot at (2,0), while Bob is free to assist with gathering additional onions or plates. The plan focuses on Alice's actions for the next 10 turns (H=10), from turn 48 to turn 57, to efficiently add her onion to the pot, contribute to gathering a second onion, and position for further collaboration. Bob should be directed to gather the third onion (e.g., from (4,2) or other counters) and handle plate retrieval from (0,2) to optimize parallel tasks.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Pot Selection**: Use pot at (2,0) for cooking, as it is closer to Alice's starting position.\n- **Onion Sources**: Utilize onions on kitchen counters (e.g., (2,2) for Alice) to save time vs. dispensers.\n- **Cooking and Delivery**: After adding 3 onions, cooking starts automatically and takes 5 turns. Alice or Bob should fetch a plate from (0,2) during cooking and serve/deliver once ready.\n- **Bob's Role**: Alice cannot control Bob directly, but based on his position (3,3) and orientation, he can:\n  - Pick up an onion from (4,2) or (6,3) to add to the pot.\n  - Get a plate from (0,2) after the pot is full, so it is ready when soup finishes cooking.\n  - Serve or deliver the soup to (6,2) if efficient.\n- **Efficiency**: Alice's actions minimize movement and orientation changes. After this sequence, the pot should have 2 onions (from Alice), and Bob can add the third to start cooking by turn 55-58. Soup will be ready around turn 60-63, allowing delivery shortly after.\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence (Turns 48 to 57):\nAlice starts at (3,1), holding an onion, facing down. The sequence adds her onion to pot (2,0), picks up a second onion from (2,2), and moves toward (4,1) to facilitate Bob adding the third onion from (4,2).\n\n- **Turn 48 (t1): L**  \n  Move left to (2,1). Now at (2,1), facing left (orientation changes with move), holding onion.\n\n- **Turn 49: D**  \n  Change orientation down to face pot at (2,0).\n\n- **Turn 50: I**  \n  Interact with pot at (2,0) to add onion. Pot now has 1 onion. Alice empty-handed, at (2,1), facing down.\n\n- **Turn 51: U**  \n  Change orientation up to face kitchen counter at (2,2) (which has an onion).\n\n- **Turn 52: I**  \n  Interact with (2,2) to pick up onion. Now holding onion, at (2,1), facing up.\n\n- **Turn 53: D**  \n  Change orientation down to face pot at (2,0).\n\n- **Turn 54: I**  \n  Interact with pot to add second onion. Pot now has 2 onions. Alice empty-handed, at (2,1), facing down.\n\n- **Turn 55: R**  \n  Move right to (3,1). Now at (3,1), facing right (orientation changes with move).\n\n- **Turn 56: R**  \n  Move right to (4,1). Now at (4,1), facing right.\n\n- **Turn 57: U**  \n  Change orientation up to face kitchen counter at (4,2) (which has an onion). Alice can interact next turn to pick up this onion for Bob or to add to a pot.\n\n### Expected Outcome and Coordination:\n- By turn 54, the pot at (2,0) has 2 onions. Alice ends at (4,1) facing (4,2), suggesting Bob should:\n  - **Add the third onion**: Bob can pick up an onion from (4,2) or another counter (e.g., (6,1)) and add it to pot (2,0) by turn 58-60. This starts cooking, and soup will be ready 5 turns later (e.g., turn 63-65).\n  - **Get a plate**: Bob should fetch a plate from (0,2) during cooking (e.g., turns 55-60) to avoid delays.\n  - **Serve and deliver**: Once soup is cooked, Alice or Bob serves it (using the plate) and delivers to (6,2) for +20 reward.\n- **Total Reward Timeline**: With coordination, one soup can be delivered by turn 65-70, yielding 20 points. Further soups can be made using the second pot or counters for additional rewards.\n\nThis sequence ensures Alice efficiently uses her turns to progress toward soup completion while enabling Bob to handle parallel tasks. For H>10, Alice should focus on plate retrieval or serving if Bob is occupied.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 48: \\text{L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 49: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 50: \\text{I} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 51: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 52: \\text{I} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 53: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 54: \\text{I} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 55: \\text{R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 56: \\text{R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 57: \\text{U} \\end{array} }",

The goal is to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes.\n\nEnvironment Details:\n- Kitchen Counters: Many positions, but note that some have onions: (6,1), (2,2), (4,2), (6,3)\n- Onion Dispensers: (2,4) and (4,4)\n- Plate Dispenser: (0,2)\n- Pots: (2,0) and (4,0)\n- Serving Counter: (6,2)\n\nRecipe Information:\n- Recipe 1: 3 onions -> reward 20, cooking time 5 turns.\n\nCurrent Game State:\n- Alice (me) at (3,1) facing left, holding nothing.\n- Bob at (1,3) facing left, holding one onion.\n\nPot State:\n- Pot at (4,0): has 1 onion, 0 tomatoes. Not full, so cooking hasn't started.\n\nWe note that there are already several onions on kitchen counters and one in Bob's hand. Also, the pot at (4,0) has one onion.\n\nObjective: We want to deliver a soup that requires 3 onions. Since the recipe is only for onions and we have an onion dispenser, we can use that.\n\nPlan:\nWe need to get 3 onions in a pot. Currently, pot (4,0) has 1 onion. So we need 2 more.\n\nPossible sources for onions:\n- Bob is holding one onion. He can put it in the pot or on a counter.\n- There are onions on kitchen counters: (6,1), (2,2), (4,2), (6,3). But note: we can only pick up from a counter if we are adjacent and facing it, and we are empty-handed.\n\nHowever, we must consider the positions of Alice and Bob.\n\nAlice is at (3,1). The pot at (4,0) is to her right and down? Let's see the coordinates:\n- Alice: (3,1)\n- Pot (4,0): one step right and one step down? Actually, (3,1) to (4,0): \n  - Right: from (3,1) to (4,1) then down to (4,0) -> but that's two moves. Alternatively, from (3,1) we can go down to (3,0) then right to (4,0) because (3,0) is an empty tile? We need the layout.\n\nBut note the tile types: \n- The kitchen counters are listed, so other tiles are empty? We don't have a full map, but we know the non-empty tiles.\n\nThe grid: \n- The pot at (2,0) and (4,0) are non-empty. Also, kitchen counters at (0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0) ... so (3,0) is a kitchen counter? Then we cannot step on (3,0). Therefore, from (3,1) we can only go left, right, up, or down? Down to (3,0) is a kitchen counter -> not walkable. So we cannot go down.\n\nTherefore, Alice at (3,1) can move:\n- Left: (2,1) -> is that empty? We don't have a list of non-empty tiles that are obstacles? The non-empty tiles are the ones listed (counters, dispensers, pots, serving counter). So if (2,1) is not in the list, then it's an empty tile? We must assume that any tile not listed as non-empty is empty and walkable.\n\nNon-empty tiles (obstacles) are:\n- Kitchen Counters: [(0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)]\n- Onion Dispensers: [(2,4), (4,4)]\n- Plate Dispenser: [(0,2)]\n- Pots: [(2,0), (4,0)]\n- Serving Counter: [(6,2)]\n\nSo the walkable tiles are those not in the above.\n\nThus, for Alice at (3,1):\n- Up: (3,2) -> kitchen counter? Yes, (3,2) is in the kitchen counters -> not walkable.\n- Down: (3,0) -> kitchen counter? Yes, (3,0) is in the list -> not walkable.\n- Left: (2,1) -> not in any non-empty list? So empty -> walkable.\n- Right: (4,1) -> not in any non-empty list? So empty -> walkable.\n\nSimilarly, Bob at (1,3): \n- He can move: left to (0,3) -> kitchen counter? (0,3) is in the list -> not walkable? So he cannot go left? \n  But note: (0,3) is a kitchen counter -> obstacle. \n- Right: (2,3) -> not in the list? so empty -> walkable.\n- Up: (1,4) -> kitchen counter? (1,4) is in the list -> not walkable.\n- Down: (1,2) -> not in the list? so empty -> walkable.\n\nNow, the pot at (4,0) is the one we are interested in. It already has 1 onion. We need 2 more.\n\nIdea:\n1. Bob is holding an onion. He can put it in a pot or on a counter. But the pot at (4,0) is currently the one with an onion. How can Bob get to (4,0)? \n   - Bob is at (1,3). He would need to go down to (1,2), then right to (2,2) but (2,2) is a kitchen counter (with an onion on it) -> obstacle? So he cannot step on (2,2). \n   - Instead, he can go right to (2,3) -> empty, then down to (2,2) -> but (2,2) is a counter -> not walkable. So he must go around? \n   - From (1,3): down to (1,2) -> empty, then right to (2,2) -> blocked. Alternatively, from (1,3) right to (2,3) -> empty, then down to (2,2) -> blocked. \n   - So he must go down to (1,2), then right to (2,2) is blocked. Then he can go right from (1,2) to (2,2) is not possible. \n   - How about going to (1,2) then down to (1,1)? But (1,1) is not in the non-empty list? So empty. Then from (1,1) he can go right to (2,1) -> empty, then down to (2,0) -> pot? But (2,0) is a pot -> non-empty, so he can stand adjacent and interact? \n\nBut note: we are at (1,3). The path to (4,0) for Bob:\n  (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,0) is a kitchen counter -> blocked. \n  So from (3,1) he can go to (4,1) -> empty, then down to (4,0) -> pot? But (4,0) is non-empty, so he must stand adjacent and face it. \n\nSo Bob's path to the pot at (4,0):\n  (1,3) -> (1,2) [down] -> (1,1) [down] -> (2,1) [right] -> (3,1) [right] -> (4,1) [right] -> then face down to interact with (4,0).\n\nBut note: at (4,1) he is adjacent to (4,0) and can face down to interact.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Bob put his onion on a counter that is closer, and then Alice can pick it up and take it to the pot.\n\nBut note: Alice is at (3,1). She can go to (4,1) and then face down to interact with the pot at (4,0). She is holding nothing. She can pick up an onion from a counter? But the nearest counter with an onion is (4,2) but that is above her? But (3,1) cannot go up to (3,2) because it's a counter. So she must go left or right.\n\nLet's think of a plan:\n\nWe need two more onions for the pot at (4,0). We have:\n- Bob holding one onion -> he can bring it to the pot if he can get to (4,1) and face down.\n- Then we need one more onion. We can get it from a counter. The closest counter with an onion to (4,0) is (4,2) but that is above the pot? (4,2) is at (4,2) and the pot is at (4,0). So they are two steps apart. But note: (4,1) is walkable. So from (4,1) we can face up to interact with (4,2) if we are at (4,1) and facing up? But (4,2) is above (4,1) -> so yes.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the onion at (2,2) or (6,1) etc., but (4,2) is very close.\n\nSo plan for Alice and Bob:\n\nBob:\n  He is at (1,3) holding an onion. We want him to go to (4,1) and then put the onion in the pot at (4,0). \n  Steps for Bob:\n    From (1,3): \n      Move down to (1,2) -> turn 52: Bob moves D\n      Then down to (1,1) -> turn 53: D\n      Then right to (2,1) -> turn 54: R\n      Then right to (3,1) -> but at turn 55, Alice is at (3,1) at the start? We must avoid collision.\n\nAt turn 52, Alice is at (3,1) and Bob is at (1,3). We are planning for the next H turns, starting at turn 52.\n\nWe must coordinate so that they don't block each other.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Alice move away from (3,1) to let Bob pass? Or we can have Bob go a different route? \n\nBut note: Bob's path: \n  (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> but (3,1) is occupied by Alice at the start.\n\nSo at turn 52, if Bob moves down to (1,2), then at turn 52 Alice can move right to (4,1) to clear (3,1) for Bob? \n\nBut let's see:\n\nTurn 52:\n  Alice is at (3,1). She can move right to (4,1) -> that's walkable? (4,1) is not in the non-empty list -> empty. So she can move R to (4,1).\n  Bob moves down to (1,2).\n\nThen at turn 53:\n  Alice: now at (4,1). She can do nothing? Or she can pick up the onion from (4,2)? But (4,2) is above her. So she needs to face up? But she is at (4,1) and (4,2) is adjacent above. So she can change orientation to U and then interact? But note: she is at (4,1) and (4,2) is above. So if she faces up, then she can interact with (4,2). But she is holding nothing, so she can pick up the onion from the counter.\n\nBut note: (4,2) is a kitchen counter and has an onion. So she can pick it up.\n\nAlternatively, she can wait for Bob to come and then she can put that onion in the pot? But the pot is at (4,0) below her. So at (4,1) she can also face down to interact with the pot.\n\nBut we need two onions: one from Bob and one from the counter.\n\nSo turn 53:\n  Alice: at (4,1). She can face up (U) and then interact (I) to pick up the onion from (4,2). But note: she can only do one action per turn. So she must first change orientation to U? Or she can move? But she doesn't need to move. Alternatively, she can interact without moving? The action \"Change Orientation\" is separate. So if she is already facing up? Currently, at turn 52 she moved R to (4,1) and that move would have changed her orientation to R? Or does moving change the orientation? \n\nThe action: \n  Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position *and* orientation.\n\nSo when Alice moves R to (4,1) at turn 52, her orientation becomes right (R). Then at (4,1) she is facing right. To interact with (4,2) (which is above), she must face up. So at turn 53, she can change orientation to up (U). Then at turn 54, she can interact (I) to pick up the onion from (4,2).\n\nBut we can also have her interact at turn 53? No, because to interact she must be adjacent and facing the tile. At turn 53, she is at (4,1) and facing right. She is not facing (4,2). So she must first face up.\n\nAlternatively, at turn 52, after moving to (4,1), she could have changed orientation to up? But we are only allowed one action per turn.\n\nSo:\nTurn 52: Alice moves R to (4,1) -> now at (4,1) facing right.\nTurn 53: Alice changes orientation to U (up) -> now facing up.\nTurn 54: Alice interacts (I) to pick up the onion from (4,2).\n\nMeanwhile, Bob:\nTurn 52: moves D to (1,2)\nTurn 53: moves D to (1,1)\nTurn 54: moves R to (2,1)\n\nThen turn 55: Bob moves R to (3,1) -> now Alice is at (4,1) so (3,1) is free? But note: at turn 55, Alice is still at (4,1) (she hasn't moved). So Bob moves to (3,1) at turn 55.\n\nThen turn 56: Bob moves R to (4,1) -> but wait, Alice is at (4,1) at that time? So collision? \n\nWe need to avoid that.\n\nAt turn 54:\n  Alice is at (4,1) and she does I (interact) to pick up the onion from (4,2). Then she is holding an onion.\n  Bob is at (2,1) and moves to (3,1) at turn 54? Actually, at turn 54:\n    Alice: I (interact) -> so she picks up the onion at (4,2). Now she is holding an onion.\n    Bob: R to (2,1) -> turn 54: Bob moves R to (2,1) -> then he is at (2,1).\n\nThen turn 55:\n  Alice: she is holding an onion. She can put it in the pot at (4,0). To do that, she must be at (4,1) and face down. Currently she is facing up? She just interacted with (4,2) above. So she is still facing up. She must change orientation to down (D). Then she can interact to put the onion in the pot? But note: the pot already has 1 onion. If she puts one, then it becomes 2. We still need one more.\n\nBut Bob is coming with one onion.\n\nSo at turn 55:\n  Alice: change orientation to D (down) -> now facing down.\n  Bob: move R to (3,1)\n\nTurn 56:\n  Alice: interact (I) to put her onion into the pot at (4,0). Now the pot has 2 onions? (it had 1, plus one -> 2). Still not 3.\n  Bob: move R to (4,1) -> but Alice is at (4,1)? At turn 56, Alice is still at (4,1) because she didn't move. So Bob cannot move to (4,1). \n\nWe must have Alice move away? Or Bob goes to (4,1) earlier? But we have a conflict.\n\nAlternatively, after Alice picks up the onion at (4,2) at turn 54, she can move away? \n\nBut note: we want her to put her onion in the pot. So she must be at (4,1) and face down. But then she is blocking (4,1). \n\nAnother idea: have Bob go to (3,0)? But (3,0) is a kitchen counter -> obstacle. So he cannot. \n\nSo Bob must go to (4,1) to be adjacent to the pot at (4,0). But if Alice is at (4,1) and we need her to stay to put her onion, then Bob cannot be there at the same time.\n\nWe need to sequence:\n\nOption: \n  Alice puts her onion in the pot at turn 55? But at turn 55 she is at (4,1) and facing down. Then she interacts at turn 56? Then at turn 56 Bob can move to (4,1) only after she moves? But she doesn't have to move immediately.\n\nBut at turn 56:\n  Alice: I (interact) -> puts onion in pot -> now the pot has 2 onions. Alice is now holding nothing.\n  Bob: wants to move to (4,1) -> but (4,1) is occupied by Alice? So he cannot.\n\nSo after Alice puts the onion, she can move away at the next turn.\n\nTurn 56:\n  Alice: I -> puts onion -> pot now has 2 onions. She remains at (4,1).\n  Bob: cannot move to (4,1) because Alice is there. So Bob must wait? \n\nTurn 57:\n  Alice: move somewhere? For example, move left to (3,1) -> so she moves L to (3,1). Then (4,1) is free.\n  Bob: then can move to (4,1) at turn 57.\n\nThen turn 58:\n  Bob: at (4,1) and he is holding an onion. He can face down (if not already) and interact to put the onion in the pot. Then the pot has 3 onions and cooking starts.\n\nBut note: at turn 56, Bob is at (3,1). He can do something else? \n\nAlternatively, we can have Bob put his onion on a counter near the pot? For example, the counter at (4,2) is above (4,1). But at turn 56, Bob is at (3,1). He can go to (4,1) only when Alice moves.\n\nBut if we have Alice move away at turn 56? But she needs to put her onion at turn 56.\n\nRevised timeline:\n\nTurn 52:\n  Alice: R -> (4,1) facing right.\n  Bob: D -> (1,2)\n\nTurn 53:\n  Alice: U (change orientation to up) -> now facing up.\n  Bob: D -> (1,1)\n\nTurn 54:\n  Alice: I (pick up onion from (4,2)) -> now holding an onion. Still at (4,1) and facing up.\n  Bob: R -> (2,1)\n\nTurn 55:\n  Alice: D (change orientation to down) -> now facing down.\n  Bob: R -> (3,1)\n\nTurn 56:\n  Alice: I (put onion in pot at (4,0)) -> now the pot has 2 onions. Alice is holding nothing. Still at (4,1) and facing down.\n  Bob: S (stay) because he cannot move to (4,1) yet.\n\nTurn 57:\n  Alice: L (move left to (3,1)) -> now at (3,1) facing left? Because moving left changes orientation to left. This frees (4,1).\n  Bob: R (to (4,1)) -> now at (4,1) facing right? But he needs to face down to interact with the pot.\n\nTurn 58:\n  Alice: S or anything? \n  Bob: D (change orientation to down) -> now facing down.\n\nTurn 59:\n  Alice: S\n  Bob: I (put onion in pot) -> now pot has 3 onions. Cooking starts.\n\nThe pot will cook in 5 turns. Then we need to serve it.\n\nBut note: we are only planning for H turns? We don't know H, but we can plan for the immediate steps to get the pot started.\n\nBut we also need to get a plate and serve the soup.\n\nAfter the pot starts cooking, we have 5 turns. So we can plan for that too? But H might be limited. However, the problem says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\". We can choose H to be until the soup is delivered? But that might be too long. Alternatively, we can plan until the pot is filled and cooking starts, and then in the next plan we will serve.\n\nBut let's see the current turn is 52. The cooking will start at turn 59 (when the third onion is put). Then it will cook for 5 turns, so ready at turn 64.\n\nWe can also plan to get a plate and deliver.\n\nBut note: we have a plate dispenser at (0,2). \n\nAfter the pot is filled, Alice is at (3,1) and Bob is at (4,1). \n\nWho will get the plate? \n- Alice is at (3,1) and holding nothing. \n- Bob is at (4,1) and after putting the onion, he is holding nothing.\n\nSo either can get the plate.\n\nThe plate dispenser is at (0,2). \n\nPath for Alice to (0,2):\n  (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) -> but (0,1) is a kitchen counter -> obstacle. So she cannot go to (0,1). \n  How about (3,1) -> (3,2) is counter -> blocked. So she must go left to (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0) is kitchen counter -> blocked. \n  Then how to get to (0,2)? \n\nThe only access to (0,2) is from (0,1) or (0,3) but both are kitchen counters -> so adjacent? \n  Actually, (0,2) is a plate dispenser. To interact with it, we must be adjacent and facing it. The adjacent tiles are: (0,1), (0,3), (1,2). But (0,1) and (0,3) are counters -> not walkable. So the only accessible tile is (1,2). \n\nSo we must stand at (1,2) and face left to interact with (0,2).\n\nTherefore, Alice can go from (3,1) to (2,1) to (1,1) to (1,2). \n  (3,1) -> (2,1): left\n  (2,1) -> (1,1): left? but (1,1) is empty? Yes. Then (1,1) -> (1,2): up.\n\nBut at turn 57, Alice is at (3,1). \n\nAlternatively, Bob can go? Bob is at (4,1) at turn 57? Actually, at turn 57 Bob moves to (4,1). Then at turn 58 he changes orientation, and at turn 59 he puts the onion. Then he is free.\n\nBut Bob is at (4,1) and the plate dispenser is at (0,2). His path:\n  (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> then face left to interact.\n\nBut note: (1,1) to (1,2) is up.\n\nSo Bob can do it.\n\nBut let's see the timeline from turn 59:\n\nTurn 59: Bob puts the onion in the pot -> now pot has 3 onions and cooking starts. Bob is at (4,1) and holding nothing.\n\nThen turn 60: Bob moves L to (3,1)\nTurn 61: Bob moves L to (2,1)\nTurn 62: Bob moves L to (1,1)\nTurn 63: Bob moves U to (1,2)\nTurn 64: Bob changes orientation to L (left) to face the plate dispenser at (0,2)\nTurn 65: Bob interacts to take a plate.\n\nMeanwhile, the soup is cooking and will be ready at turn 64 (started at turn 59, so turn 59+5=64). So at turn 64 the soup is ready. But Bob is getting the plate at turn 65.\n\nThen at turn 65, Bob has a plate. He needs to go to the pot at (4,0) to serve the soup? But he is at (1,2). \n\nAlternatively, after getting the plate, he can go to the pot? But that is far. Or we can have Alice serve? \n\nBut note: after the pot is filled, Alice is at (3,1) and free. She can get the plate? \n\nAt turn 59:\n  Alice is at (3,1) (from turn 57 she moved to (3,1)). She is holding nothing.\n\nSo Alice can get the plate? \n  Turn 59: Alice moves L to (2,1)\n  Turn 60: Alice moves L to (1,1)\n  Turn 61: Alice moves U to (1,2) -> now at (1,2)\n  Turn 62: Alice changes orientation to L (left)\n  Turn 63: Alice interacts to take a plate.\n\nThen she has the plate. Then she must go to the pot to serve? But the pot is at (4,0). \n  Turn 64: Alice moves R to (1,1) -> but she is at (1,2), so down to (1,1)? \n  Then turn 65: R to (2,1)\n  Turn 66: R to (3,1)\n  Turn 67: R to (4,1)\n  Then turn 68: change orientation to down (D)\n  Turn 69: interact to serve the soup.\n\nBut the soup is ready at turn 64. It is sitting in the pot. We can serve it any time after it's ready.\n\nAlternatively, after getting the plate, she can go directly to the serving counter? But we need to put the soup in the plate first. So we must go to the pot.\n\nBut Bob is at (4,1) at turn 59. He could get the plate? \n\nBut Bob is at (4,1) at turn 59. He can start moving to (1,2) as above and get the plate at turn 65. Then he can go back to the pot? \n  From (1,2) to (4,0):\n    (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> then face down to interact with the pot? \n    That would take 4 moves and one orientation change and one interact.\n\nBut note: after getting the plate, he is at (1,2). \n  Turn 66: move down to (1,1)\n  Turn 67: move right to (2,1)\n  Turn 68: move right to (3,1)\n  Turn 69: move right to (4,1)\n  Turn 70: change orientation to down\n  Turn 71: interact to serve the soup.\n\nThen he has the soup on a plate. Then he must deliver to the serving counter at (6,2). \n  From (4,1) to (6,2):\n    (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (6,1) -> but (6,1) is a kitchen counter (with an onion) -> obstacle? So cannot step. \n    How about: (4,1) -> (4,2) is counter -> blocked. So must go: (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (6,1) is counter -> blocked. \n    Then how? \n\nActually, (6,1) is a kitchen counter -> obstacle, so we cannot step on it. The adjacent to the serving counter (6,2) must be from (5,2) or (6,1) or (6,3). But (6,1) and (6,3) are counters. So the only accessible tile is (5,2). \n\nSo we must go to (5,2). \n\nBut how to get from (4,1) to (5,2)? \n  (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (5,2) [up]? But (5,1) is a kitchen counter? (5,1) is not in the non-empty list? Wait, the kitchen counters include (5,0) and (5,4) but not (5,1). So (5,1) is empty? Then yes. \n  Then (5,1) -> (5,2): but (5,2) is not in the non-empty list? So empty? Then we can go. \n\nSo:\n  (4,1) -> (5,1) [right]\n  (5,1) -> (5,2) [up]\n\nThen at (5,2) we can face right to interact with the serving counter (6,2).\n\nBut note: (5,2) is adjacent to (6,2) on the left? So we must face right.\n\nSo Bob's path to serve:\n  After getting the plate and going back to (4,1) at turn 71, then:\n    Turn 72: move R to (5,1)\n    Turn 73: move U to (5,2)\n    Turn 74: change orientation to R (if not already) -> but moving to (5,1) and then (5,2) would change orientation? \n        When moving from (4,1) to (5,1): orientation becomes R.\n        Then moving up to (5,2): orientation becomes U. So he must change to R at (5,2) to face the serving counter.\n    Turn 75: interact to deliver.\n\nThis is too many turns. We might not plan that far.\n\nBut note: we are only required to plan for several turns. We can plan until the pot is filled and cooking starts, and then in the next planning phase we will handle the serving.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's focus on the immediate: getting the pot filled.\n\nWe already have a plan for the next few turns to get the pot filled.\n\nSo the plan for the next turns (starting at turn 52) for Alice and Bob:\n\nWe are controlling Alice. Bob is our teammate, but we can also plan for Bob? The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can plan for both? But note: we are only required to output actions for Alice. However, we assume Bob will follow our plan? Or we must assume Bob will act independently? \n\nThe problem says: \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\". We can assume that we can control both? But the output format only shows actions for Alice. \n\nRe-read: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can also output Bob's actions? But the answer format only shows Alice's. \n\nThe answer format: \n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nSo only Alice's actions.\n\nTherefore, we plan for Alice. We must assume Bob will act reasonably? But we don't know. However, the problem says \"collaborate\", so we can assume Bob is cooperative and we know his actions? But we don't control him. \n\nGiven the action history, we can infer Bob's recent actions? But we are not given a policy for Bob.\n\nTo be safe, we plan for Alice and hope Bob will continue to cooperate. But in the current state, Bob is holding an onion and we can assume he will bring it to the pot? \n\nBut we can plan Alice's actions to facilitate.\n\nSo let's plan only Alice's actions for the next H turns. We choose H=10? But we don't know. We can plan until the pot is filled by Alice and Bob.\n\nIn our earlier plan, Alice's actions:\n\nTurn 52: R (to (4,1))\nTurn 53: U (face up)\nTurn 54: I (pick up onion from (4,2))\nTurn 55: D (face down)\nTurn 56: I (put onion in pot) -> now pot has 2 onions\nTurn 57: L (move to (3,1)) to free (4,1) for Bob\n\nThen what? She can stay or do something else? We don't need her to do more until the soup is ready? \n\nBut we can have her get a plate? \n\nAfter turn 57, she is at (3,1). She can go to get a plate? \n\nTurn 58: L to (2,1)\nTurn 59: L to (1,1)\nTurn 60: U to (1,2)\nTurn 61: L (face left) to face the plate dispenser\nTurn 62: I (take plate)\n\nThen she has a plate. Then she can wait until the soup is ready? Or go to the pot? The soup will be ready at turn 64 (if the third onion is put at turn 59). \n\nBut Bob is putting the third onion at turn 59? How? \n\nIn our earlier plan for Bob, we assumed he moves to (4,1) at turn 57 and then at turn 58 he faces down and at turn 59 he puts the onion. \n\nBut we don't control Bob. So we cannot be sure. \n\nSo to be safe, we plan Alice to get the plate and then go to the pot to serve when the soup is ready.\n\nBut the soup might not be ready until turn 64. \n\nSo after getting the plate, she can go to (4,1) and wait? \n\nTurn 63: from (1,2) she moves D to (1,1)\nTurn 64: R to (2,1)\nTurn 65: R to (3,1)\nTurn 66: R to (4,1) -> now at (4,1) with a plate.\n\nThen at turn 66, the soup is ready? It was started at turn 59 (if Bob put the onion at turn 59) -> then turn 59+5=64, so at turn 64 the soup is ready. But at turn 66, it has been ready for 2 turns. \n\nSo at turn 67: Alice faces down (if not already) and interacts to pick up the soup? But note: to serve the soup from the pot, we must have a plate. She is holding a plate. So she can use the plate to serve the soup from the pot? \n\nThe interact with pot when holding a plate and the pot has cooked soup: we serve the soup (i.e., put the soup on the plate). Then she is holding a soup in a plate. Then she must deliver it to the serving counter.\n\nBut we are only planning for Alice. So we can plan until she picks up the soup? \n\nBut the problem says to maximize the total reward. We are delivering one soup for 20 points.\n\nSo we plan for Alice until she delivers? \n\nBut the plan might be too long. We are at turn 52. We plan for 15 turns? \n\nAlternatively, we can plan until the pot is filled and then stop? But then we haven't delivered. \n\nGiven the constraints, let's plan for Alice for the next 10 turns (until turn 62) and then in the next planning phase we can continue.\n\nBut to be complete, we plan for Alice until she delivers the soup? \n\nWe'll plan for 20 turns? But that might be too long for the answer.\n\nAlternatively, we can break it down. Since the problem says \"over next several turns\", we can choose H=10.\n\nSo we plan for turns 52 to 61 (10 turns).\n\nBut in 10 turns, we can get the pot filled and Alice to get the plate? \n\nFrom turn 52 to 61:\n\nTurn 52: R\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: I\nTurn 55: D\nTurn 56: I\nTurn 57: L\nTurn 58: L (to (2,1))\nTurn 59: L (to (1,1))\nTurn 60: U (to (1,2))\nTurn 61: L (face left) -> so she is facing the plate dispenser.\n\nThen at turn 62, she can interact to take the plate.\n\nBut we are not including turn 62 in the 10 turns? \n\nWe start at turn 52. So we plan for t=52 to t=61 (10 actions).\n\nBut we can adjust H.\n\nGiven the above, we output Alice's actions for the next 10 turns.\n\nBut note: at turn 56, after putting the onion, the pot has 2 onions. We hope Bob puts the third. But if Bob doesn't, then the soup won't be cooked. But we assume Bob is cooperative.\n\nSo the actions for Alice:\n\nTurn 52: R\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: I\nTurn 55: D\nTurn 56: I\nTurn 57: L\nTurn 58: L\nTurn 59: L\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: L\n\nBut the last action at turn 61 is L (which is a change of orientation to left) or a move? \n\nWe must specify the action. \n\nAt turn 60: Alice moves U to (1,2). Then at turn 61, she is at (1,2) and she wants to face left to interact with the plate dispenser at (0,2). So she changes orientation to left (L). \n\nSo action: L (which is change orientation to left).\n\nBut note: the action set: {U, D, L, R, I, S}. The L can be either move left or change orientation to left? \n\nBut the problem says:\n- Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position *and* orientation.\n- Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\n\nBut wait, there is no separate \"Change Orientation\" in the action set? The actions are: Move (which changes orientation) or Interact or Stay. \n\nBut the problem says: \"Each player can: Move (L/R/U/D): ... Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): ... Interact (I): ... Stay (S): ...\"\n\nSo the actions are:\n  - L, R, U, D for moving (which also change orientation) OR for changing orientation (without moving) if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty? \n\nBut the description for Change Orientation: \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> meaning that if you try to move in a direction and the adjacent tile is not empty, then you don't move but you change orientation? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position *and* orientation.\" and \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThis is ambiguous. \n\nRe-read: \n- **Move** (L/R/U/D): Changes position *and* orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\n- **Change Orientation** (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one. \n\nSo there are two types of actions? But the action set is listed as: {U, D, L, R, I, S}. \n\nHow do we distinguish between a move and a change orientation? \n\nThe problem says: \"Each player (Alice/Bob) can: ...\" and lists Move, Change Orientation, Interact, Stay. \n\nBut in the action set, they are represented by the same symbols? \n\nThis is confusing. \n\nLooking at the action set: \\(a_t \\in \\{U, D, L, R, I, S\\}\\). \n\nSo when we output L, it could be either:\n  - If the player is trying to move left, but if the adjacent tile is not empty, then it becomes a change orientation to left without moving.\n  - Or is it that we have to specify? \n\nBut the problem does not have separate symbols. \n\nTherefore, we must assume that when we output L (or any direction), it means the player attempts to move in that direction. If the adjacent tile in that direction is empty and walkable, then the player moves and changes orientation to that direction. If not, then the player doesn't move and only changes orientation to that direction.\n\nSo the same action L can result in either a move or just an orientation change.\n\nIn our plan, when we want the player to change orientation without moving, we can output the direction and hope that the adjacent tile is not empty? But sometimes we might want to change orientation without moving even if the adjacent tile is empty? \n\nBut the problem says: for Change Orientation: \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> meaning that the action for changing orientation is automatically handled by the game: if you try to move and cannot, you change orientation. \n\nTherefore, we only need to output the direction and the game will decide if it's a move or just orientation change.\n\nSo for Alice at (4,1) at turn 53: we want her to change orientation to up. We output U. But the adjacent tile above (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> not empty. So when she does U, she will not move (because the tile above is not empty) and will change her orientation to up.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 55: she is at (4,1) and we output D. The adjacent tile below (4,0) is a pot -> not empty. So she will not move and change orientation to down.\n\nSo we can use the direction actions for both moving and changing orientation.\n\nTherefore, the plan for Alice:\n\nTurn 52: R -> move right to (4,1) and face right.\nTurn 53: U -> since above is counter, she doesn't move and changes orientation to up.\nTurn 54: I -> pick up onion from (4,2)\nTurn 55: D -> since below is pot, she doesn't move and changes orientation to down.\nTurn 56: I -> put onion in pot (now pot has 2 onions)\nTurn 57: L -> move left to (3,1) and face left.\nTurn 58: L -> move left to (2,1) and face left.\nTurn 59: L -> move left to (1,1) and face left.\nTurn 60: U -> move up to (1,2) and face up? But we want her to face left for the plate dispenser. \n  However, at (1,1) if she moves up to (1,2), the move is allowed because (1,2) is empty? Then she moves and changes orientation to up. But we want her to face left at (1,2). \n\nSo at turn 60: she moves U to (1,2) and faces up. Then at turn 61, we want her to face left. So we output L. \n  At (1,2), the adjacent tile to the left is (0,2) -> plate dispenser, not empty. So when she does L, she doesn't move (because left is not empty) and changes orientation to left.\n\nSo turn 61: L -> changes orientation to left.\n\nThen at turn 62, she can interact to take the plate.\n\nBut we are only planning until turn 61? \n\nSince we started at turn 52, we are planning 10 actions: turns 52 to 61.\n\nSo we output:\n\nTurn 52: R\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: I\nTurn 55: D\nTurn 56: I\nTurn 57: L\nTurn 58: L\nTurn 59: L\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: L\n\nThis will set her up to take the plate at turn 62.\n\nWe assume Bob will put the third onion in the pot at some point (hopefully by turn 59) so that the soup starts cooking.\n\nThen in the next planning phase (at turn 62), we can have her take the plate and then go to the pot to serve.\n\nBut note: the soup will be ready 5 turns after the third onion is put. If Bob puts it at turn 59, then ready at turn 64. So at turn 62, she takes the plate, then at turn 63 she can start moving to the pot? \n\nBut we'll leave that for the next plan.\n\nSo we output the above.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice and Bob must collaborate to complete a 3-onion soup in the pot at (4,0), which already contains 1 onion. The plan involves Alice gathering a second onion from the kitchen counter at (4,2) and placing it in the pot, while Bob (holding an onion) is expected to add the third onion. Alice will then prepare to serve by fetching a plate from the dispenser at (0,2). The actions for Alice are optimized for efficiency and coordination with Bob's anticipated movements.\n\n### Planned Actions for Alice (10 turns):\n- **Turn 52: R**  \n  Move right to (4,1), facing right. This clears (3,1) for Bob's path to the pot.\n- **Turn 53: U**  \n  Change orientation to up (since (4,2) is a counter, Alice doesn't move). Prepares to interact with (4,2).\n- **Turn 54: I**  \n  Interact to pick up onion from kitchen counter (4,2). Alice now holds an onion.\n- **Turn 55: D**  \n  Change orientation to down (since (4,0) is a pot, Alice doesn't move). Prepares to interact with the pot.\n- **Turn 56: I**  \n  Interact to place onion into pot at (4,0). Pot now has 2 onions.\n- **Turn 57: L**  \n  Move left to (3,1), facing left. Frees (4,1) for Bob to access the pot.\n- **Turn 58: L**  \n  Move left to (2,1), facing left. Begins path to plate dispenser.\n- **Turn 59: L**  \n  Move left to (1,1), facing left. Continues path to plate dispenser.\n- **Turn 60: U**  \n  Move up to (1,2), facing up. Positions adjacent to plate dispenser (0,2).\n- **Turn 61: L**  \n  Change orientation to left (since (0,2) is a dispenser, Alice doesn't move). Faces plate dispenser for interaction.\n\n### Coordination and Expected Bob Actions:\n- **Bob's Role:** Bob (at (1,3) holding an onion) should move to (4,1) via (1,2) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (4,1). At (4,1), he should face down and interact to add his onion to the pot (by turn 59). This starts cooking (5-turn timer).\n- **After Turn 61:** Alice can interact (I) at turn 62 to grab a plate, then move to (4,1) and serve the soup (ready at turn 64 if Bob adds onion by turn 59). Deliver to serving counter (6,2) via (5,1) → (5,2).\n\nThis sequence ensures the pot is filled efficiently, and Alice is positioned to serve the soup for a 20-point reward.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 52: R \\\\\nTurn 53: U \\\\\nTurn 54: I \\\\\nTurn 55: D \\\\\nTurn 56: I \\\\\nTurn 57: L \\\\\nTurn 58: L \\\\\nTurn 59: L \\\\\nTurn 60: U \\\\\nTurn 61: L\n}",

We need to add 2 more onions to make the recipe (3 onions). The recipe takes 5 turns to cook once the pot is full.\n\nThere are onions scattered on kitchen counters and also available at dispensers. We can use these to complete the pot.\n\nGoal: Deliver as many soups as possible. Since the recipe takes 5 turns to cook, we can plan to complete the current pot and then start another one? But note that there are only two pots. However, the other pot at (2,0) is empty.\n\nBut let's see the current state of the other pot? The state only mentions the pot at (4,0). The other pot at (2,0) is not mentioned, so it must be empty.\n\nWe have many onions on counters. We can use these to fill the pots without going to the dispensers.\n\nPlan for the next few turns (say H=10 or so? We can adjust as needed to complete one soup delivery?).\n\nSteps:\n\n1. We need to get two more onions into the pot at (4,0). There is an onion at (4,2) which is very close to Alice.\n\n   Alice is at (4,1). She can move up to (4,2) to pick up the onion? But note: (4,2) is a kitchen counter and has an onion. However, to pick up, she must be adjacent and facing the counter. Currently, Alice is at (4,1) and facing right (R). The counter at (4,2) is above her.\n\n   To pick up from (4,2):\n      - She must be adjacent to (4,2). The adjacent tiles to (4,2) are (4,1) [south], (3,2) [west], (5,2) [east] and (4,3) [north]. \n      - Currently, she is at (4,1) which is adjacent (south of (4,2)). But she is facing right (east) and (4,2) is north of her. So she is not facing (4,2). \n\n   So she needs to change orientation to face north (U) and then interact.\n\n   Steps for Alice:\n      - Turn 55: Change orientation to Up (U) to face (4,2). But note: the action history shows she just did R (right) at the previous turn. Now she is at (4,1) facing right. To face up, she can use action 'U'. Then she will be facing up without moving.\n\n      - Then, at turn 56: Interact (I) to pick up the onion from (4,2). Now she is holding an onion.\n\n   But wait: the kitchen counter at (4,2) is non-empty, so she can pick it up if she is empty-handed (which she is) and adjacent and facing it.\n\n   Then, she can move down to (4,0) to put the onion in the pot? But note: the pot is at (4,0). She is at (4,1) and holding an onion. She can move down to (4,0) to be adjacent to the pot? Actually, the pot is at (4,0). When she moves down to (4,0), she is on the pot tile? But note: the pot is a non-empty tile? Actually, the pot is a tile that you can stand on? The rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" But the pot is a tile that is non-empty? However, in Overcooked, players can stand on the same tile as a pot? The rules don't explicitly say, but typically in Overcooked, pots are on counters and you stand adjacent to interact? Let me check the rules:\n\n   \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\n   So you must be on an adjacent empty tile. Therefore, (4,0) is a pot tile and not walkable? Then Alice cannot stand on (4,0). She must be adjacent to the pot. The pot at (4,0) is adjacent to which tiles? The adjacent tiles are (3,0), (5,0), (4,1) [north] and note that (4,-1) is out of bounds. So the only adjacent empty tile is (4,1) (north) and (3,0) and (5,0) if they are empty? But (3,0) and (5,0) are kitchen counters? They are listed as kitchen counters, so they are non-empty? Actually, kitchen counters are non-empty? The rule says: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and they are in the list of non-empty tiles? But note: a kitchen counter without an item might be walkable? The rules say \"non-empty tile\" meaning a tile that has an object (like dispenser, pot, counter with item, etc.). But the kitchen counter without an item is still a counter? The rules don't specify if a kitchen counter without an item is walkable? However, the problem says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and the tile types include \"Kitchen Counter\" as a type. So regardless of whether it has an item, it's a non-empty tile? \n\n   Looking at the tile types list: \"Kitchen Counter\" is listed as a tile type. And the rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So we assume that Kitchen Counters (even without items) are non-empty? Then we cannot walk on them. So the adjacent tiles to the pot at (4,0) are (3,0) [west] and (5,0) [east] and (4,1) [north]. But (3,0) and (5,0) are kitchen counters (so non-empty, cannot walk) and (4,1) is an empty tile? How do we know which tiles are empty? The environment details list the non-empty tiles (kitchen counters, dispensers, etc.) but we also have the grid? Actually, the grid is not provided. We must infer from the tile types.\n\n   The only walkable tiles are the ones that are not in the list of non-empty tile types? The tile types that are non-empty are: Dispensers, Pot, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter (even if no item). So the only adjacent tile to the pot at (4,0) that is walkable is (4,1). So to interact with the pot at (4,0), you must be at (4,1) and facing down (D) or at (3,0) or (5,0) but those are non-walkable? Actually, you can't stand on (3,0) because it's a kitchen counter. So the only access is from (4,1) facing down.\n\n   Therefore, Alice is currently at (4,1) and facing right. She can turn to face down (D) and then interact to put the onion in the pot.\n\n   But first, she must get an onion. We plan to get the onion from (4,2). So:\n\n   Step 1: Alice at (4,1) facing R -> turn to face up (U) at turn 55.\n   Step 2: Then at turn 56, interact to pick up onion from (4,2). Now she is holding an onion.\n   Step 3: Then she must turn to face down (D) at turn 57? Because she is now facing up and the pot is below her at (4,0). So she needs to face down to interact with the pot? But note: after picking up the onion, she is still at (4,1). Then at turn 57: change orientation to down (D). Then turn 58: interact (I) to put the onion in the pot.\n\n   Now the pot at (4,0) will have 2 onions? But it already had one, so now 2. We need one more.\n\n   Meanwhile, Bob is at (2,3) facing up. There is an onion at (2,2) which is below him? (2,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion. He is at (2,3) and facing up. The counter at (2,2) is south of him. So he can turn to face down (D) and then interact to pick up the onion? But note: he is at (2,3) and (2,2) is adjacent and to the south. So:\n\n   Bob can:\n      - Turn 55: change orientation to down (D) to face (2,2).\n      - Turn 56: interact to pick up the onion from (2,2). Now he is holding an onion.\n\n   Then, Bob can go to the pot at (4,0) to put his onion? But he is at (2,3) and the pot is at (4,0). He must navigate to (4,1) to interact with the pot? The path: from (2,3) to (4,1). The grid: we don't have a map, but we can assume that the tiles are connected. We know the non-empty tiles. The empty tiles are the ones not listed. For example, (3,3), (4,3), (3,2) is a kitchen counter? (3,2) is listed as a kitchen counter, so non-empty. Similarly, (3,1) is not listed? Let's list the non-empty tiles from the environment:\n\n   Kitchen Counters: (0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)\n   Onion Dispensers: (2,4), (4,4)\n   Plate Dispenser: (0,2)\n   Pots: (2,0), (4,0)\n   Serving Counter: (6,2)\n\n   So the empty tiles are: \n      - For row 0: (2,0) is a pot? non-empty. (4,0) is a pot. So row0: only (0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0) are non-empty. So (2,0) and (4,0) are non-empty? Actually, the pot is at (2,0) and (4,0) so they are non-empty. Then row0: every tile is non-empty? Then we cannot walk in row0? How do we access the pots? Only from row1? The adjacent to (2,0) is (2,1) and (1,0) and (3,0) but (1,0) and (3,0) are kitchen counters (non-empty) so only (2,1) is adjacent? Similarly for (4,0): only (4,1) is adjacent.\n\n   So the walkable tiles must be in rows 1,2,3,4 except the non-empty ones.\n\n   For Bob at (2,3) to (4,1):\n      - (2,3) to (3,3): is (3,3) empty? Not listed as non-empty, so yes.\n      - Then (3,3) to (4,3): is (4,3) empty? Not listed, so yes.\n      - Then (4,3) to (4,2): but (4,2) is a kitchen counter (non-empty) so cannot walk. Then he must go (4,3) to (4,4)? (4,4) is an onion dispenser, non-empty. So cannot. Then how?\n\n   Alternative path: \n      - (2,3) -> (2,2) is non-empty (kitchen counter) so cannot walk through. Then he must go east to (3,3) first? Then from (3,3) to (3,2) is non-empty? (3,2) is a kitchen counter. So he cannot go down to (3,2). Then he must go to (3,4)? But that is a kitchen counter? (3,4) is listed. So row3: (0,3) and (6,3) are non-empty, so (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) are empty? Then from (3,3) he can go down to (3,2)? No, because (3,2) is non-empty. Then he must go to (4,3) and then to (5,3)? Then from (5,3) to (5,2)? (5,2) is not listed, so empty? Then (5,2) to (5,1)? Then (5,1) to (4,1)? \n\n   But note: (5,0) is a kitchen counter (non-empty) and (5,1) is not listed? So (5,1) is empty. Then (4,1) is empty? But Alice is there? But we can share the same tile? The rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through each other.\" So if Alice is at (4,1), Bob cannot go to (4,1). But we are planning for multiple turns and Alice might move.\n\n   Alternatively, Bob can go to (3,3) then (4,3) and then (4,2) is non-empty so he cannot go. Then he must go to (5,3) -> (5,2) -> (5,1) -> (4,1). But (4,1) might be occupied by Alice? We can coordinate.\n\n   However, we are at turn 55 and we are planning for the next few turns. We can have Alice move after she puts the onion? But we need to get the third onion quickly.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the onion that is at (6,1) or (6,3) or (0,3) but they are far.\n\n   Another idea: use the onion that Bob picks up from (2,2) to put in the pot at (2,0) instead? Because the pot at (2,0) is empty and we can start a new soup there? Then we can have two soups cooking? But the pot at (4,0) already has one onion and we are about to add a second one. Then we need one more for (4,0) and three for (2,0). But we have many onions on counters: (6,1), (2,2) (which Bob is going to pick), (4,2) (which Alice is going to pick), (6,3), (0,3). So we have 5 onions. We can complete both pots.\n\n   Let me adjust the plan:\n\n   We can have:\n   - Alice: pick up onion at (4,2) and put in pot (4,0) -> then pot (4,0) will have 2 onions.\n   - Bob: pick up onion at (2,2) and put in pot (2,0) -> then pot (2,0) will have 1 onion.\n\n   Then we need one more onion for pot (4,0) and two more for pot (2,0). There are onions at (6,1), (6,3), (0,3). We can assign one player to get one for (4,0) and the other to get one for (2,0) and then another one for (2,0).\n\n   However, we are at turn 55 and we want to plan for the next several turns (say 10 turns). We can aim to complete the pot at (4,0) and then serve it? Because it will have 2 onions after Alice's action and then we add one more. Then it will cook for 5 turns. Then we can serve.\n\n   Steps for completing pot (4,0):\n\n   - Alice: \n        turn55: U (to face up to (4,2))\n        turn56: I (pick onion from (4,2))\n        turn57: D (face down to pot at (4,0))\n        turn58: I (put onion -> now pot has 2 onions)\n\n   Then we need one more onion for (4,0). Who gets it? Alice is at (4,1) and holding nothing after putting the onion. She can go to get another onion? The closest onions: (6,1) or (6,3) or (0,3) or (2,2) but (2,2) is about to be taken by Bob? Or Bob hasn't taken it yet? Bob is at (2,3) and we are at turn55. Bob can be doing:\n\n        turn55: D (face down to (2,2))\n        turn56: I (pick onion from (2,2)) -> now Bob has onion\n\n   Then Bob can go to the pot at (2,0) to put it? He is at (2,3) and the pot at (2,0) is adjacent to (2,1)? The adjacent tile to pot (2,0) is (2,1) (north). So Bob must go to (2,1) and face down? But (2,1) is not listed as non-empty? So it's empty. He can go:\n\n        turn57: move down to (2,2)? But (2,2) is non-empty (kitchen counter) -> cannot. Then he must go around? \n\n        Actually, from (2,3) to (2,1): but (2,2) is in between and non-empty. So he cannot go straight down. He must go east to (3,3) then down to (3,2) non-empty? Then east again? This is complicated.\n\n   Alternatively, Bob can put the onion in the pot at (4,0) instead? Because we need one more for (4,0). Then:\n\n        Bob after picking the onion at turn56 is at (2,3) holding an onion. He can go to (3,3) -> (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (5,2) -> (5,1) -> (4,1). But note: (4,1) is occupied by Alice until turn58? At turn58, Alice is at (4,1) and then she will put the onion and then she is done? Then at turn59, Alice might move? But Bob would take several turns to get to (4,1). Let's count:\n\n        Bob:\n          turn55: D (face down)\n          turn56: I (pick onion at (2,2)) -> now at (2,3) holding onion\n          turn57: move right to (3,3)\n          turn58: move down? to (3,2) is non-empty -> cannot. So move right to (4,3)\n          turn59: move down? (4,2) non-empty -> cannot. So move right to (5,3)\n          turn60: move down to (5,2) [if empty]\n          turn61: move down to (5,1) [if empty]\n          turn62: move left to (4,1) -> but at turn62, Alice might be elsewhere? \n\n        Then at (4,1), Bob would face down and interact to put the onion? That would be turn63: D (face down) and turn64: I. Then the pot has 3 onions and cooking starts at turn64. Then it cooks for 5 turns until turn69. Then we need to serve.\n\n   This is too long. We are only planning for 10 turns? We need a faster way.\n\n   Alternatively, there is an onion at (6,1). Alice, after putting the second onion at turn58, is at (4,1) and free. She can go to (6,1) to pick up the onion? But (6,1) is a kitchen counter with an onion. How to get there?\n\n        Alice at (4,1) after turn58:\n          turn58: just put the onion -> at (4,1) holding nothing.\n\n        Then:\n          turn59: move right to (5,1) -> if (5,1) is empty? We don't know. (5,0) is non-empty, but (5,1) is not listed? So it's empty.\n          turn60: move right to (6,1) -> but (6,1) is a kitchen counter (non-empty) so cannot walk on it. Then she must stand adjacent? The adjacent tile to (6,1) is (5,1) and (6,0) (non-empty) and (6,2) (serving counter, non-empty). So the only adjacent is (5,1). So she can be at (5,1) and face right to interact with (6,1)? But (6,1) is to the east.\n\n        Steps:\n          turn59: R (to face right? but she is at (4,1) and facing down? After turn58 she just did an interact and then she is facing down? Then turn59: change orientation to right (R) to face (5,1)? But she wants to go to (5,1). She can move right to (5,1) without changing orientation? Actually, moving changes the position and orientation? The move action: Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position *and* orientation. So if she moves right (R) to (5,1), she will be at (5,1) and facing right.\n\n        Then at (5,1) facing right, she is adjacent to (6,1) to the east. Then:\n          turn60: I (to pick up the onion from (6,1)) -> now she has an onion.\n\n        Then she must go back to (4,1) to put it in the pot? \n          turn61: move left to (4,1) -> and now she is at (4,1) facing left? Then she must turn to face down? \n          turn62: change orientation to down (D)\n          turn63: I (put the onion) -> now pot at (4,0) has 3 onions and cooking starts at turn63.\n\n        Then cooking takes 5 turns: turns 63,64,65,66,67 -> ready at turn68.\n\n        Then we need to serve: get a plate, put the soup on the plate, and deliver.\n\n   This is also long.\n\n   Another idea: use the onion that is at (4,2) for the pot? But we already took that one. The next closest onion for the pot (4,0) is the one at (4,2) but we already took it? Then the next is (2,2) but Bob is taking it? Or the one at (6,1) as above.\n\n   Alternatively, after Alice puts the second onion at turn58, she can go to (4,2) again? But (4,2) was emptied by her at turn56? But there is no other onion at (4,2). The state says (4,2) had an onion at the beginning. After she picks it up, it becomes empty. So no.\n\n   We need to get the third onion from elsewhere.\n\n   But note: there is an onion at (6,3). Bob is at (2,3) and can go to (6,3) to pick up that onion and then bring it to the pot? But that is even farther.\n\n   Given the time, we might focus on completing the pot at (4,0) as quickly as possible and then serve it.\n\n   Alternatively, we can have Bob help with the same pot. After Bob picks the onion at (2,2) at turn56, he can go to (3,3) -> (4,3) and then drop the onion on a kitchen counter near (4,0)? For example, at (3,2) or (5,2) but they are non-empty? The kitchen counters: (3,2) and (5,2) are not listed as having items? The non-empty kitchen counters are listed with items: (6,1), (2,2), (4,2), (6,3), (0,3). So (3,2) is a kitchen counter without an item? Then Bob can place the onion there? But then Alice can pick it up.\n\n   How? Bob at (2,3) after picking onion at (2,2) at turn56:\n        turn57: move right to (3,3)\n        turn58: move down? to (3,2) -> but (3,2) is a kitchen counter tile? And it is non-empty (because it's a counter) but does it have an item? The state says the non-empty kitchen counters are only those listed with items. So (3,2) is a kitchen counter tile but without an item? Then it is empty of item but still non-walkable? The rules say we cannot walk on non-empty tiles (which include kitchen counters regardless of item). So Bob cannot walk to (3,2). Then he must go around to (4,3) and then to (4,2) non-empty -> cannot. So he is stuck.\n\n   Given the complexity, let's focus on the immediate plan for the next 5-10 turns to get the third onion into the pot at (4,0).\n\n   We have Alice at (4,1) and Bob at (2,3). We also have an onion at (6,1). Alice is closer to (6,1) than Bob.\n\n   Revised plan for Alice to get the third onion from (6,1):\n\n        Alice:\n          turn55: U (face up to (4,2))\n          turn56: I (pick onion from (4,2)) -> holding onion\n          turn57: D (face down to pot (4,0))\n          turn58: I (put onion -> now pot has 2 onions)\n          turn59: R (move right to (5,1)) -> now at (5,1) facing right\n          turn60: I (interact with (6,1) to pick up the onion) -> now holding onion\n\n        But note: (6,1) is east of (5,1) and she is facing right, so she can interact.\n\n        Then she needs to put this onion in the pot:\n          turn61: L (move left to (4,1)) -> now at (4,1) facing left\n          turn62: D (face down) to face the pot\n          turn63: I (put onion) -> now pot has 3 onions and cooking starts.\n\n   This is 9 turns from turn55 to turn63 (we are at turn55, so turns 55 to 63).\n\n   Meanwhile, Bob can be doing something else? For example, start on the other pot? But we are not planning for Bob? The task says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". We can plan for Alice only, or also for Bob. Since it's collaboration, we can suggest for both.\n\n   Bob's actions:\n\n        At turn55, Bob is at (2,3) facing up. We can have him go to the other pot at (2,0) but he needs to go around. Or he can go to an onion dispenser to get an onion for the other pot? The onion dispensers are at (2,4) and (4,4). (2,4) is above him? He is at (2,3) facing up. So:\n\n          turn55: U (move up to (2,4)) -> (2,4) is an onion dispenser, non-empty, so cannot walk. Then he must stand at (2,3) and face up to interact? But he is empty-handed. He can grab an onion from the dispenser.\n\n          How? He is at (2,3) and the dispenser is at (2,4), which is north. He is already facing up? Then at turn55: he can interact (I) to grab an onion? But the dispenser is adjacent and he is facing it? Yes.\n\n          So Bob:\n             turn55: I (grab onion from dispenser at (2,4)) -> now holding onion.\n\n          Then he can start a new soup in the pot at (2,0). But how to get there? He is at (2,4) and the pot is at (2,0). The only access is from (2,1) facing down. He must go to (2,1). But the path is blocked by (2,2) and (2,3) is where he was? He is at (2,4) now? He was at (2,3) and then he interacted without moving, so he is still at (2,3)? The action \"I\" does not move the player. So after turn55, Bob is still at (2,3) holding an onion.\n\n          Then he needs to go to (2,1). But (2,2) is in between and non-empty. So he must go around:\n\n             turn56: move right to (3,3)\n             turn57: move down to (3,2) -> cannot, non-empty\n             turn58: move right to (4,3)\n             ... This is long.\n\n   Alternatively, Bob can put the onion on a kitchen counter near the pot at (2,0)? For example, at (1,0) or (3,0) but they are kitchen counters and might be empty of items? The state lists non-empty kitchen counters (with items) as: (6,1), (2,2), (4,2), (6,3), (0,3). So (1,0) and (3,0) are kitchen counters without items? Then Bob can place the onion on (3,0) or (1,0)? But then later someone can pick it up and put in the pot.\n\n   How to place? Bob must be adjacent to the kitchen counter and facing it.\n\n   For example, (3,0) is a kitchen counter. The adjacent tiles are (2,0) (pot, non-empty), (4,0) (pot, non-empty), (3,1) (north). (3,1) is not listed? So empty. Bob can go to (3,1) and face south to interact with (3,0)? \n\n   Path for Bob from (2,3) to (3,1):\n\n        turn55: I (grab onion at (2,4)) -> still at (2,3) holding onion.\n        turn56: move right to (3,3)\n        turn57: move down? to (3,2) cannot -> then move down to (3,1)? How? From (3,3) to (3,2) is blocked. So he must go to (4,3) then to (4,2) blocked, then to (4,1)? Then to (3,1)? \n\n        turn56: move right to (3,3)\n        turn57: move down to (3,2) -> cannot, so move right to (4,3)\n        turn58: move down to (4,2) -> cannot, so move down to (4,1) -> but (4,1) is occupied by Alice until turn58? At turn58, Alice is at (4,1) and then she moves to (5,1) at turn59. So at turn58, Alice is at (4,1), so Bob cannot go to (4,1) at turn58.\n\n        turn58: Bob move down to (4,2) cannot -> then move down to (4,1) cannot -> then move left to (3,3) is not possible because he was at (4,3) and move left would be to (3,3) which is empty? But he already moved away from (3,3) at turn57.\n\n   This is messy.\n\n   Given the time constraints and the fact that we are only planning for Alice, we can focus on Alice and let Bob do his own thing or we can suggest simple actions for Bob.\n\n   Since the task is to maximize reward, and the current pot is close to being completed, we focus on that.\n\n   We plan for Alice only for the next 9 turns (to complete the pot and start cooking).\n\n   Alice's actions (turns 55 to 63):\n\n        turn55: U (face up to interact with (4,2))\n        turn56: I (pick onion)\n        turn57: D (face down to pot)\n        turn58: I (put onion -> now 2 onions)\n        turn59: R (move right to (5,1))\n        turn60: I (pick onion from (6,1)) -> holding onion\n        turn61: L (move left to (4,1))\n        turn62: D (face down)\n        turn63: I (put onion) -> now 3 onions, cooking starts.\n\n   Then the soup will be ready at turn63+5 = turn68.\n\n   Then at turn68, we can serve the soup. But we need a plate. The plate dispenser is at (0,2). We should plan to get a plate and serve.\n\n   But we are only planning for the next H turns. We can set H=15 to cover until serving.\n\n   After turn63, Alice is at (4,1) holding nothing. She can go to get a plate:\n\n        From (4,1) to (0,2): \n          - Path: (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) -> but (0,1) is kitchen counter, non-empty? So cannot walk. Then how? \n          - The plate dispenser at (0,2): adjacent tiles are (0,1), (0,3), (1,2). (0,1) and (0,3) are non-empty, so only (1,2) is available? \n          - (1,2) is not listed as non-empty? So empty. She can go to (1,2) and face west to interact.\n\n        Steps from (4,1) to (1,2):\n          turn64: move left to (3,1) -> if empty? (3,1) not listed, so empty.\n          turn65: move left to (2,1) -> empty\n          turn66: move left to (1,1) -> empty? (1,1) not listed.\n          turn67: move up to (1,2) -> now at (1,2) facing up? Actually, each move changes orientation. So:\n                 turn64: L (move left to (3,1)) -> facing left\n                 turn65: L (move left to (2,1)) -> facing left\n                 turn66: L (move left to (1,1)) -> facing left\n                 turn67: U (move up to (1,2)) -> facing up\n\n          Then at (1,2), she is adjacent to (0,2) (west) but she is facing up? Then she needs to face west.\n\n          turn68: change orientation to left (L) to face (0,2)\n          turn69: I (grab a plate) -> now holding a plate.\n\n        Then she must go to the pot at (4,0) to serve the soup? The soup is ready at turn68, but she is at (1,2) at turn68. Then she grabs the plate at turn69. Then she needs to go back to (4,1) to serve the pot.\n\n          turn70: move down to (1,1) -> facing down\n          turn71: move right to (2,1) -> facing right\n          turn72: move right to (3,1) -> facing right\n          turn73: move right to (4,1) -> facing right\n          turn74: D (face down to pot)\n          turn75: I (interact to serve the soup) -> she puts the plate in the pot and gets the soup on the plate? Then she is holding the soup.\n\n        Then she must deliver to the serving counter at (6,2). From (4,1) to (6,2):\n\n          turn76: move right to (5,1) -> facing right\n          turn77: move right to (6,1) -> but (6,1) is non-empty? Cannot walk. Then she must go to (5,2) first? \n          turn76: U (face up) then move up to (4,2) -> but (4,2) is non-empty, cannot. \n          Alternatively, from (4,1) to (5,1) then to (5,2) then to (6,2)? But (5,2) is empty? Yes, not listed. (6,2) is serving counter, non-empty, so cannot walk on it.\n\n          So she must be at (5,2) or (6,1) or (6,3) or (5,2) is adjacent to (6,2)? Yes, (5,2) is west of (6,2). She can be at (5,2) and face east to interact.\n\n          How to get to (5,2) from (4,1):\n             turn75: at (4,1) holding soup, facing down after serving the pot? Actually, at turn75 she did I at (4,1) facing down, then she is still at (4,1) holding the soup.\n             turn76: R (face right)\n             turn77: U (face up)  [to prepare for moving up?]\n             turn78: U (move up to (4,2)) -> cannot, non-empty. Then she must go to (5,1) then to (5,2).\n\n          So:\n             turn76: R (move right to (5,1)) -> now at (5,1) facing right\n             turn77: U (move up to (5,2)) -> now at (5,2) facing up\n             turn78: R (face right to face (6,2))\n             turn79: I (deliver soup) -> reward!\n\n   This is very long and beyond 15 turns.\n\n   Given the complexity, and since we are only required to plan for the next several turns (say 10 turns), we can focus on getting the soup cooking and then in a subsequent plan, we can do the serving.\n\n   Therefore, we output Alice's actions for the next 9 turns (turns 55 to 63) as described above.\n\n   But note: at turn55, Bob is also acting. We must ensure they don't collide. We don't control Bob, but we can assume he will not block Alice in this plan.\n\n   Alice's actions:\n\n        turn55: U\n        turn56: I\n        turn57: D\n        turn58: I\n        turn59: R\n        turn60: I\n        turn61: L\n        turn62: D\n        turn63: I\n\n   This completes the pot at (4,0) and starts cooking at turn63.\n\n   We don't plan for Bob, but if we were to suggest, he could start on the other pot? But it's optional.\n\n   So the answer:\n\n   \\boxed{\n   Turn 55: U\n   Turn 56: I\n   Turn 57: D\n   Turn 58: I\n   Turn 59: R\n   Turn 60: I\n   Turn 61: L\n   Turn 62: D\n   Turn 63: I\n   }\n\n   Note: This plan assumes that the onion at (6,1) is still there. The state is at turn55, and the onion at (6,1) is on a kitchen counter. It will remain until someone picks it up. We assume Bob doesn't pick it up.\n\n   Also, at turn59, Alice moves to (5,1). We assume (5,1) is empty and not blocked by Bob.\n\n   This is a feasible plan for the next 9 turns.\n\n   Let's double-check the number of turns: from turn55 to turn63 is 9 actions, covering turns 55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63.\n\n   We output only Alice's actions.\n\n   If we want to be safe, we can plan for fewer turns? But the problem says \"over next several turns\", and 9 is several.\n\n   Alternatively, we can plan until the pot is filled, which is turn63.\n\n   We'll go with this.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice will focus on completing the onion soup in the pot at (4, 0) by adding two more onions. The closest available onions are on the kitchen counters at (4, 2) and (6, 1). Alice will first pick up the onion at (4, 2), add it to the pot, then fetch the onion at (6, 1), and add it to the pot to complete the recipe. This sequence ensures the soup starts cooking as quickly as possible.\n\n**Alice's Action Plan (Turns 55 to 63):**\n- **Turn 55 (U)**: Alice at (4, 1) faces up to interact with the onion on (4, 2).\n- **Turn 56 (I)**: Picks up the onion from (4, 2).\n- **Turn 57 (D)**: Faces down to interact with the pot at (4, 0).\n- **Turn 58 (I)**: Adds the onion to the pot (now 2 onions).\n- **Turn 59 (R)**: Moves right to (5, 1) to access the onion at (6, 1).\n- **Turn 60 (I)**: Picks up the onion from (6, 1) (facing right, adjacent to it).\n- **Turn 61 (L)**: Moves left back to (4, 1).\n- **Turn 62 (D)**: Faces down to interact with the pot.\n- **Turn 63 (I)**: Adds the final onion to the pot (3 onions). Cooking starts immediately and will finish in 5 turns (turn 68).\n\nThis plan efficiently uses the available onions and positions Alice to later serve the soup (requiring a plate from (0, 2) and delivery to (6, 2)), which can be planned after the cooking completes.\n\n**Bob's Role (Optional Suggestion):**  \nBob can start a second soup in the pot at (2, 0) by fetching an onion from the dispenser at (2, 4) or a nearby kitchen counter. For example:\n- Turn 55: Interact (I) to grab an onion from (2, 4) (already facing up).\n- Subsequent turns: Navigate to (2, 1) via a path like (3, 3) → (4, 3) → (5, 3) → (5, 2) → (5, 1) → (4, 1) (after Alice moves), then add the onion to (2, 0). However, this is complex due to terrain, so focus remains on Alice.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: I\nTurn 57: D\nTurn 58: I\nTurn 59: R\nTurn 60: I\nTurn 61: L\nTurn 62: D\nTurn 63: I\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 58. The goal is to maximize the total reward by delivering soups. The only recipe available is 3 onions for a reward of 20, which cooks in 5 turns.\n\nCurrent state:\n- Alice: at (4,1), facing Up, holding one onion.\n- Bob: at (1,3), facing Up, holding one onion.\n\nKitchen counters have onions at (6,1), (2,2), (6,3), (0,3). \nPot at (4,0) has 1 onion (so it needs 2 more to start cooking).\n\nThere are two pots: (2,0) and (4,0). The pot at (4,0) is partially filled (1 onion). The pot at (2,0) is empty.\n\nWe have two onion dispensers at (2,4) and (4,4). Plate dispenser at (0,2). Serving counter at (6,2).\n\nSince the recipe requires 3 onions, we need to get two more onions into the pot at (4,0) to start cooking. Alternatively, we could use the other pot at (2,0) but it's empty and we have onions available.\n\nHowever, note that there are onions already on kitchen counters. We can use those to avoid going to the dispenser every time.\n\nPlan:\nWe need to complete a soup in a pot and then serve it. The pot at (4,0) is at (4,0). Alice is at (4,1) and holding an onion. She is adjacent to the pot (since (4,1) is above (4,0)) and facing Up (which is away from the pot). So she needs to turn to face Down to interact with the pot.\n\nBut note: to interact with the pot, she must be adjacent and facing it. Currently, she is at (4,1) and the pot is at (4,0). So she is adjacent (above the pot) but facing Up (away). Therefore, she cannot interact until she faces Down.\n\nAlternatively, she could move to (5,1) and then face Left? But that would not be adjacent to the pot. The adjacent tiles to (4,0) are (3,0), (5,0) [but those are kitchen counters? Let me check the tile types: kitchen counters are at (3,0) and (5,0) so they are not walkable? Actually, the problem says players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles. But note: the pot is at (4,0) and the adjacent tiles are (4,1) [which is empty?] and (3,0), (5,0) [kitchen counters, non-walkable] and (4,-1) [which is out of bounds?]. So the only adjacent empty tile is (4,1). Therefore, Alice must be at (4,1) and face Down to interact with the pot.\n\nSo for Alice at turn 58:\n- She is at (4,1), facing Up, holding an onion.\n- To put the onion in the pot at (4,0), she must face Down and then Interact.\n\nBut note: the pot currently has 1 onion and can take 2 more. So she can put her onion in.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (1,3) holding an onion. He can also contribute to the pot at (4,0) or the one at (2,0). But the pot at (4,0) is closer to being done. How can Bob get to (4,0)? He is at (1,3). He would have to go through (1,2) -> (2,2) [but (2,2) is a kitchen counter and has an onion? It's non-walkable? Actually, kitchen counters are non-walkable? The rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles include kitchen counters that have an item? But the problem says: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and the tile type is a kitchen counter. Also, the list of non-empty kitchen counters includes (2,2) with an onion. So that tile is occupied and cannot be walked on.\n\nTherefore, Bob cannot walk through (2,2). The path from (1,3) to (4,0) might be: (1,3) -> (1,2) [if (1,2) is empty?] but we don't have the full grid. We know the positions of non-empty tiles. We need to assume that any tile not listed as non-empty (like kitchen counter with item) is empty? Actually, the grid has:\n- Kitchen counters (without items) are still kitchen counters and are they walkable? The rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty means they have an item? Or does the tile type matter? \n\nRe-reading: \n- \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" \n- Other tiles (like dispensers, pot, serving counter, kitchen counter) are non-empty? But note: the problem says \"non-empty tile\" in the context of interaction. And for movement: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" \n\nI think \"non-empty tile\" in movement context refers to any tile that is not an empty tile? Because the tile types are defined. So:\n- Only empty tiles are walkable. All others (dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters) are non-walkable? \n\nBut wait: the problem says \"Players cannot walk onto/through each other.\" and \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" \n\nSo non-empty tiles are non-walkable. And what are non-empty tiles? They are any tile that has an item? Or the tile type? \n\nLooking at the tile types list: we have kitchen counters at specific positions. Even if they don't have an item, they are still kitchen counters? And the problem says kitchen counter is a tile type. So I think the tile types that are not \"Empty Tile\" are non-walkable? \n\nBut wait: the interaction rule says: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\nSo the tile being interacted with is non-empty (meaning it has content? or it's a special tile?) but the player must stand on an empty tile adjacent. So the player is on an empty tile, and the adjacent tile is a non-empty one (like a dispenser, pot, etc). \n\nTherefore, the special tiles (dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters) are not walkable. Only empty tiles are walkable.\n\nSo the grid has:\n- Walkable: empty tiles (which are not listed in the non-empty types? We have to infer from the given positions of non-empty tiles? Actually, the problem gives the positions of non-empty tiles (like kitchen counters, dispensers, etc). So any coordinate not mentioned in those lists is an empty tile? \n\nBut note: the kitchen counter list includes many positions, even if they don't have an item? Or does the list \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter\" mean that at the current state, only those kitchen counters have items? \n\nThe problem says: \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter: [list]\" meaning that these kitchen counters currently have items. But the tile type \"kitchen counter\" exists at the positions listed under \"Kitchen Counter\" regardless of whether they have an item? \n\nSo, for example, the kitchen counter at (0,0) is a tile of type kitchen counter. If it has no item, then it's an empty kitchen counter? But it is still non-walkable? \n\nThe movement constraint: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" Here \"non-empty\" might refer to having an item? Or the tile type? \n\nLooking at the rule: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and then in the tile types, we have \"Empty Tile\" as walkable. So I think the other tiles (dispensers, kitchen counters, etc) are non-walkable regardless of whether they have an item? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and then lists other types. So I think only empty tiles are walkable. All others are not.\n\nTherefore, the positions of the kitchen counters (with or without items) are non-walkable. Similarly, dispensers, pots, serving counters are non-walkable.\n\nSo the grid:\n\nWe have the following non-walkable tiles (from the lists):\n- Kitchen Counter: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (3, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (0, 1), (6, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (0, 3), (6, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (3, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4)]\n- Onion Dispenser: [(2, 4), (4, 4)]\n- Plate Dispenser: [(0,2)]\n- Pot: [(2,0), (4,0)]\n- Serving Counter: [(6,2)]\n\nSo the only walkable tiles are the ones not in these lists? \n\nNow, let's see the positions of the players and the objects.\n\nAlice at (4,1): is (4,1) in the non-walkable list? It's not in the kitchen counter list? So it's walkable. Similarly, Bob at (1,3): not in the non-walkable list? But (1,3) is not in the kitchen counter list? Actually, the kitchen counter list has (1,0), (0,3), (1,4), but not (1,3). So (1,3) should be empty? But wait, the non-empty kitchen counter list includes (0,3) and (6,3) and (2,2) and (6,1) and (0,3) again? But (1,3) is not mentioned, so it's an empty tile? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter\" meaning that the kitchen counter at (0,3) has an item? But the tile type is kitchen counter, so it's non-walkable regardless? \n\nSo the tile at (1,3) is not in the kitchen counter list? Then it must be an empty tile? \n\nLooking at the kitchen counter list: \n    Kitchen Counter: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (3, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (0, 1), (6, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (0, 3), (6, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (3, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4)]\n\nSo (1,3) is not in that list? Then it is an empty tile? \n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is not in that list? So it's empty.\n\nBut what about (1,2)? It's not in the list? Then it's empty? \n\nSo the grid has walkable tiles at: (1,3), (1,2) [if not listed], (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) is non-walkable? (6,1) is a kitchen counter and non-empty? So non-walkable.\n\nLet me sketch a grid (from (0,0) to (6,4)):\n\nRow y=4: [KC (0,4), Onion Dispenser (2,4), KC (3,4), Onion Dispenser (4,4), KC (5,4), KC (6,4)]\nRow y=3: [KC (0,3) (with onion), (1,3) Bob, (2,3)?, (3,3)?, (4,3)?, (5,3)?, KC (6,3) (with onion)]\nRow y=2: [Plate Dispenser (0,2), (1,2)?, KC (2,2) (with onion), KC (3,2), KC (4,2), (5,2)?, Serving Counter (6,2)]\nRow y=1: [KC (0,1), (1,1)?, (2,1)?, (3,1)?, (4,1) Alice, (5,1)?, KC (6,1) (with onion)]\nRow y=0: [KC (0,0), KC (1,0), Pot (2,0), KC (3,0), Pot (4,0), KC (5,0), KC (6,0)]\n\nWe don't have information about the tiles not listed. We must assume that any tile not in the non-walkable tile types (i.e., not in the kitchen counter, dispenser, pot, serving counter) is an empty tile? \n\nBut note: the problem only lists the positions for the non-empty tiles of the special types. So the tile at (1,1) for example: is it a kitchen counter? The kitchen counter list includes (0,1) and (6,1) and others, but not (1,1). So (1,1) is an empty tile? \n\nSimilarly, (1,2) is not in the kitchen counter list? Then it's empty? \n\nSo the walkable tiles are the ones not in the provided lists of non-walkable tiles.\n\nNow, back to Bob: he is at (1,3). He wants to go to the pot at (4,0). \nPath: \n(1,3) -> (1,2): empty? (we think so) -> (1,1): empty? -> (2,1): empty? -> (3,1): empty? -> (4,1): Alice is there? At turn 58, Alice is at (4,1). So Bob cannot go to (4,1) if Alice is there? \n\nBut note: we are planning for the next turns. We can move both players. \n\nAlternatively, Bob might go to the pot at (2,0). He is at (1,3). \nPath to (2,0): \n(1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> then to (2,0)? But (2,0) is a pot, non-walkable. So he must stand adjacent to (2,0). The adjacent empty tiles to (2,0) are: \n- (1,0): kitchen counter (non-walkable)\n- (3,0): kitchen counter\n- (2,1): empty? \nSo (2,1) is the only adjacent empty tile. So Bob can go to (2,1) and face Down to interact with the pot at (2,0).\n\nSimilarly, for the pot at (4,0): adjacent empty tile is (4,1) (currently occupied by Alice) and (3,0), (5,0) are kitchen counters. So only (4,1) is adjacent.\n\nSo if Alice moves away from (4,1), then Bob can use that spot? \n\nBut Alice is holding an onion and can put it in the pot at (4,0) from (4,1) by facing Down. So she should do that immediately.\n\nThen the pot at (4,0) will have 2 onions. We need one more onion to start cooking.\n\nBob is holding an onion. He can either:\n- Go to the pot at (4,0) and put his onion? But the only adjacent spot (4,1) is currently occupied by Alice. After Alice puts her onion, she might move away? Then Bob can come to (4,1) and put his onion? But note: the pot will then have 3 onions and start cooking. \n\nAlternatively, Bob could put his onion in the pot at (2,0). Then we would have two pots with 1 onion each? Then we would need two more onions for each? That might be inefficient.\n\nSo the plan should be to complete the pot at (4,0) first.\n\nSteps for Alice:\nTurn 58: She is at (4,1) facing Up. To interact with the pot at (4,0), she must face Down. So:\nTurn 58: D (to change orientation to Down) -> then she can interact? But note: the action is per turn. She can only do one action. So she must spend one turn to face Down, then next turn to Interact.\n\nBut note: the action \"Change Orientation\" (L/R/U/D) changes the orientation without moving. So at turn 58, she can do D (to face Down). Then at turn 59, she can do I to put the onion in the pot.\n\nAfter that, the pot will have 2 onions. Then she is free to move.\n\nBob: at (1,3) holding an onion. He needs to get to (4,1) to put his onion in the pot at (4,0). But (4,1) is currently occupied by Alice. After Alice does two actions (turn58: D, turn59: I), she will be at (4,1) facing Down. Then she can move away at turn60.\n\nBut Bob is at (1,3). How many moves to get to (4,1)? \n(1,3) -> (1,2) [1 move] -> (1,1) [2] -> (2,1) [3] -> (3,1) [4] -> (4,1) [5]. So 5 moves? \n\nBut note: we have to avoid non-walkable tiles. The path: \n(1,3) to (1,2): empty? yes.\n(1,2) to (1,1): empty? yes.\n(1,1) to (2,1): empty? yes.\n(2,1) to (3,1): empty? yes.\n(3,1) to (4,1): but (4,1) is occupied by Alice until at least turn59. At turn60, Alice moves away? \n\nSo Bob can start moving at turn58. \n\nAt turn58:\nAlice: D (face Down)\nBob: ? He can start moving: for example, move Down to (1,2) at turn58.\n\nThen at turn59:\nAlice: I (put onion in pot at (4,0) -> now pot has 2 onions.\nBob: move Down to (1,1)\n\nTurn60:\nAlice: move away from (4,1) to, say, (3,1) (Left) so that Bob can use (4,1). \nBut (3,1) is empty? We think so. Then Alice moves Left to (3,1).\nBob: move Down to (1,0)? But (1,0) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So he must go Right? From (1,1) to (2,1). \n\nSo at turn60:\nAlice: L (to move to (3,1))\nBob: R (to move to (2,1))\n\nTurn61:\nAlice: can stay or do something else? She is at (3,1) and not holding anything. She might go to get a plate? Or get another onion? But we need to get one more onion for the pot at (4,0). \nBob: from (2,1) to (3,1)? But (3,1) is now occupied by Alice? So he cannot go to (3,1). He can go to (3,1) only if Alice moves. Or he can go to (4,1) but (4,1) is now free? \n\nAt turn60, Alice moved to (3,1). So (4,1) is free. Bob at (2,1) can move Right to (3,1)? But that's where Alice is. So he must go to (3,1) only if Alice moves. Alternatively, he can go from (2,1) to (2,0)? But (2,0) is non-walkable. So he must go to (3,1) but it's occupied. \n\nAlternatively, Bob can go from (2,1) to (3,1) only if Alice moves? \n\nWe need to coordinate: at turn61, Alice should move away from (3,1) to let Bob pass? Or Bob can take a different path? \n\nAnother path for Bob: from (1,1) he could go to (2,1) and then (3,1) and then (4,1). But at turn61, Alice is at (3,1). So Bob at (2,1) can move to (3,1) only if Alice leaves. \n\nSo at turn61, Alice should move again? For example, from (3,1) to (3,2)? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So she cannot. Then to (2,1)? But Bob is going to be at (2,1) at turn60? Then at turn61, Bob is at (2,1) and Alice at (3,1). Then Bob can go to (3,1)? But Alice is there -> collision? Players cannot walk through each other. \n\nSo Bob must wait? \n\nAlternatively, at turn60, after Alice moves to (3,1), Bob could go to (2,2)? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter and non-walkable? And it has an onion? So no. \n\nSo the only way is for Alice to move to a different direction? \n\nAt turn60, instead of moving Left to (3,1), Alice could move Right to (5,1)? But (5,1) is not in the non-walkable list? So it should be empty? Then:\nTurn60: Alice moves R to (5,1). Then Bob at (2,1) can move R to (3,1) at turn61? Then turn62 Bob moves R to (4,1). \n\nBut that is too slow.\n\nAlternatively, at turn60, Alice moves Up? But (4,2) is a kitchen counter? Non-walkable. So she cannot. Or Down? But (4,0) is the pot, non-walkable. So she can only move Left to (3,1) or Right to (5,1). \n\nSo let's choose Right to (5,1) at turn60.\n\nThen:\nTurn61:\nAlice: at (5,1). She can go to (5,0)? But (5,0) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. Or Up? (5,2) is not listed? So empty? Then she can move Up to (5,2). But (5,2) is not in the kitchen counter list? So empty. \nBob: at turn60 he is at (2,1). Then at turn61, he moves to (3,1) (since Alice is at (5,1) now, so (3,1) is free?).\n\nTurn62: \nBob moves to (4,1). Then he can face Down and interact to put his onion in the pot? But he is holding an onion and the pot now has 2 onions. He puts it -> now 3 onions, so cooking starts.\n\nBut that is turn62. And we are at turn58. So we are planning 5 turns? H might be 5? But the problem says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\" but doesn't specify H. We can plan as long as needed? But we should plan until we have a soup ready? But cooking takes 5 turns.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the onions on the kitchen counters? There is an onion at (2,2) which is adjacent to (2,1). Bob could pick it up? But Bob is holding an onion already. He cannot pick up until he puts his current onion.\n\nBut note: there are onions on kitchen counters. So if we can use them, we don't have to go to the dispenser.\n\nBut for the pot at (4,0), we need one more onion. Bob is holding one and is on his way to put it. \n\nBut we have to consider: after the pot starts cooking, we need to get a plate and then serve the soup.\n\nAlso, we can start another soup in the other pot? \n\nBut let's focus on the immediate plan for the next few turns.\n\nWe have to maximize the total reward. We are at turn58. The pot at (4,0) will have 2 onions after Alice's interaction at turn59. Then Bob will put his onion at turn62 (if we follow the above). Then the pot starts cooking at turn62. It will be ready at turn62+5 = turn67. Then we need to get a plate and serve the soup.\n\nBut we can do that with either Alice or Bob.\n\nNow, for the next actions:\n\nTurn58:\nAlice: D (to face Down) [so she can interact next turn]\nBob: D (move Down to (1,2)) [to start heading to (4,1)]\n\nTurn59:\nAlice: I (put onion in pot at (4,0)) -> now pot has 2 onions. Alice is now empty-handed.\nBob: D (move Down to (1,1))\n\nTurn60:\nAlice: R (move Right to (5,1)) [to free up (4,1) for Bob]\nBob: R (move Right to (2,1))\n\nTurn61:\nAlice: U (move Up to (5,2)) [so she is out of the way and can head to get a plate? The plate dispenser is at (0,2). She is at (5,2). She can go left? But the path: (5,2) to (4,2) is kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So she cannot go left? Then she can only go up? (5,3) is empty? Or down? (5,1) is where she came from? Or right? (6,2) is serving counter -> non-walkable? And (5,2) to (6,2) is adjacent? But (6,2) is serving counter, non-walkable. So she can only go Up to (5,3) or Down to (5,1). \n\nAt turn61, she just moved to (5,2). Then at turn61, she can move Up to (5,3). \n\nBob: R (move Right to (3,1))\n\nTurn62:\nAlice: U (move Up to (5,4)) -> but (5,4) is a kitchen counter? Non-walkable. So she cannot. Then she must move Left? But (4,2) is non-walkable. Or Right? (6,2) non-walkable. Or Down? to (5,1). So she moves D to (5,1) at turn62? That seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, at turn60, after putting the onion, Alice could go to get a plate? The plate dispenser is at (0,2). She is at (4,1) at turn59. Then at turn60, instead of moving Right, she could move Left to (3,1) and then continue? But then Bob cannot use (4,1) until she moves. But we moved her to (5,1) to free (4,1). \n\nBut now she is stuck at (5,2). \n\nAlternatively, at turn60, after putting the onion, Alice could move Left to (3,1) and then at turn61 move Left to (2,1)? But Bob is going to be at (2,1) at turn60? So at turn61, if Alice moves to (2,1), Bob is there? Collision.\n\nSo the safe way is to move Alice to (5,1) at turn60, then at turn61 move her to (5,0)? But (5,0) is kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So she must stay at (5,1) or move up to (5,2). But then at turn62, she can move to (5,3) [if empty]? \n\n(5,3): is it a kitchen counter? The kitchen counter list has (5,4) and (6,3) and (6,4) but not (5,3). So it should be empty. So:\n\nTurn61: Alice moves U to (5,2) -> then at turn62, she can move U to (5,3). Then she can continue to (4,3) [if empty]? But (4,3) is not in the non-walkable list? Then yes. Then to (3,3), etc. to get to (0,2) for a plate.\n\nBut that is a long path.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can put his onion in the pot at (4,0) at turn62, and then Alice is free to get a plate. But we need to plan for the soup that will be ready at turn67.\n\nBut we are only planning for the next few turns? The problem doesn't specify H. We should plan until the soup is served? But that might be too long. \n\nSince the problem says \"plan a sequence of actions ... over next several turns\", we can set H=5? Then we plan until turn63 (t58 to t62, 5 actions?).\n\nBut the problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=1}^{H-1}\\)\" -> that might be from t1 to t1+H-1? \n\nActually, the sequence is for t1 to t1+H-1? But the answer format is:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1}\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n...\n\nSo we need to specify the actions starting at turn t1 for H turns? But H is not given. We can choose H=5? \n\nBut note: the action history given is for the last 5 turns? But we are at turn58, and we have to plan the next actions.\n\nI think we should plan for the immediate actions to set up the soup. \n\nBut let's think: we have two players. After the pot at (4,0) is started (at turn62), we need to get a plate and then serve. \n\nBut also, we have the other pot at (2,0). We could start another soup? We have onions on the kitchen counters. For example, the onion at (2,2) is next to the pot at (2,0). \n\nSo after Bob puts his onion in the pot at (4,0) at turn62, he is at (4,1) and empty-handed. He can then go to (2,2) to pick up the onion? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter. He can pick up the onion from (2,2) if he is adjacent and facing it. The adjacent tile to (2,2) is (2,1) and (2,3) [but (2,3) is not listed? so empty] and (1,2) and (3,2). \n\nSo Bob at (4,1) at turn62 (after putting the onion) can move to (3,1) then (2,1) at turn63. Then at turn64, he can face Up (because (2,2) is above (2,1)) and then interact to pick up the onion at (2,2). Then he can put it in the pot at (2,0) from (2,1) by facing Down.\n\nBut we are getting ahead.\n\nFor now, let's plan for turns 58 to 62 (5 turns).\n\nSo:\n\nTurn58:\nAlice: D (change orientation to Down) [so she can interact with the pot below]\nBob: D (move Down to (1,2))\n\nTurn59:\nAlice: I (interact to put onion in pot at (4,0); pot now has 2 onions)\nBob: D (move Down to (1,1))\n\nTurn60:\nAlice: R (move Right to (5,1)) [to free (4,1) for Bob]\nBob: R (move Right to (2,1))\n\nTurn61:\nAlice: U (move Up to (5,2)) [she is going to get a plate? but we are only planning until turn62, so we can leave her there]\nBob: R (move Right to (3,1))\n\nTurn62:\nAlice: ? We have to specify. She is at (5,2). She can move U to (5,3) to continue to the plate dispenser? But we don't have to plan beyond H=5? Or we can plan 5 actions? From turn58 to turn62 (inclusive) is 5 turns? So we stop at turn62.\n\nBut turn62 is the fifth action? Actually, from turn58 to turn62 is 5 actions? \n\nt58: first action\nt59: second\nt60: third\nt61: fourth\nt62: fifth\n\nSo we can plan 5 actions for each? But the problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\" -> it says \"for Alice\" but then \"optionally Bob\". So we have to plan for Alice? And Bob is controlled by the teammate? \n\nRe-read: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\" \n\nBut in the context, it says \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\", so we might need to plan for both? \n\nThe problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can plan for both? \n\nBut the answer format only shows actions? It doesn't specify which player. But the problem says \"for Alice\", so probably only Alice? \n\nBut then how can we collaborate? We can only control Alice? \n\nLooking at the task: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\" \n\nSo we can plan for both? And the answer format doesn't specify the player? It only says \"Turn t: a_t\". \n\nBut then how do we know which action is for which player? \n\nI think we have to output two sequences? But the format is one sequence of actions. \n\nPerhaps the actions are for Alice? And Bob is controlled by the environment? \n\nThe problem says: \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\" and then \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice\". \n\nSo I think we only plan for Alice? And Bob is controlled by his own policy? \n\nBut the problem says: \"optimize coordination, planning, and decision-making based on ... action history of both players\", but we only control Alice? \n\nThis is confusing. \n\nLooking at the answer format: it only lists actions without player. So probably we are to assume that we are only planning for Alice? \n\nBut then how do we collaborate? We must assume Bob is rational and will cooperate? \n\nBut we don't know Bob's next actions. \n\nAlternatively, the problem allows us to plan for both? But the format doesn't have player labels. \n\nRe-read the task: \"plan a sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=1}^{H-1}\\) for Alice (and optionally Bob)\" \n\nIt says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", meaning we can plan for both? But then the actions should be specified for each player? \n\nThe answer format is:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1}\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n...\n\nThis doesn't distinguish players. \n\nPerhaps the actions are for Alice only? \n\nBut then Bob's actions are not planned by us? \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think we are only to plan for Alice. And we have to assume that Bob will act rationally. \n\nBut in the current state, Bob is holding an onion and he is at (1,3). He will likely try to put it in a pot? \n\nBut we don't know. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might allow us to output a joint plan? But the format doesn't support it. \n\nGiven the format, I think we are to output Alice's actions only. \n\nSo we plan for Alice only, and assume Bob will do reasonable things. \n\nSo for Alice:\n\nAt turn58: she needs to put her onion in the pot. So she should face Down (D) and then interact. \n\nBut at turn58, she can only do one action: D.\n\nThen at turn59: I.\n\nThen she is free. \n\nWhat should she do next? She can go to get a plate for the soup that will be ready soon? The plate dispenser is at (0,2). \n\nSo at turn60: she can move Left to (3,1). \n\nBut then at turn61: move Left to (2,1)? But Bob might be there? We don't know. \n\nTo avoid collision, she could go up? But (4,2) is kitchen counter. \n\nSo she can only go left or right. \n\nAfter turn59, she is at (4,1) facing Down, empty-handed. \n\nThen at turn60: move Left to (3,1). \n\nThen turn61: move Left to (2,1). But (2,1) might be occupied by Bob? We don't control Bob. \n\nAlternatively, she can move Right to (5,1) at turn60, then Up to (5,2) at turn61, then Left? But cannot because (4,2) is blocked. \n\nSo she can go to (5,1) and then (5,2) and then (5,3) and then left to (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3) but (0,3) is a kitchen counter and has an onion? She can pick up the onion? But she wants a plate. \n\nThe plate dispenser is at (0,2). So from (0,3) she can move down to (0,2)? But (0,2) is the plate dispenser, non-walkable. So she must stand adjacent to (0,2). The adjacent tiles to (0,2) are (0,1), (0,3), (1,2). \n\n(0,1) is kitchen counter -> non-walkable. \n(0,3) is kitchen counter and has an onion -> non-walkable? Or can she stand on (0,3)? No, non-walkable. \n(1,2) is empty? Yes. \n\nSo she can go to (1,2) and face Left to interact with the plate dispenser at (0,2). \n\nSo path from (4,1) to (1,2): \n(4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2)\n\n5 moves? \n\nBut she has 3 actions after turn59 (t60, t61, t62) to move to (1,2)? Not enough. \n\nSo she can only get part of the way.\n\nBut we are only planning for H turns? We can choose H=5 for Alice: turns 58,59,60,61,62.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn58: D\nTurn59: I\nTurn60: L (to (3,1))\nTurn61: L (to (2,1))  [but if Bob is there, she might not be able to? But we have to assume she can]\nTurn62: U (to (2,2)? But (2,2) is non-walkable. So she cannot. Or she can move to (1,1)? From (2,1) to (1,1) is Left? \n\nFrom (2,1), she can move Left to (1,1) at turn62.\n\nThen she is at (1,1). Then she can move Up to (1,2) at turn63.\n\nSo for now, we output for turns58 to 62.\n\nBut turn62: she is at (1,1) and we output U? But U from (1,1) would go to (1,2). \n\nSo actions for Alice:\n\nTurn58: D\nTurn59: I\nTurn60: L\nTurn61: L\nTurn62: U\n\nThis gets her to (1,2) at turn62? Let's see:\n- Turn60: from (4,1) move L to (3,1)\n- Turn61: move L to (2,1)\n- Turn62: move U to (2,2) -> but (2,2) is non-walkable! I forgot. (2,2) is a kitchen counter and has an onion. So she cannot move there. \n\nSo she must move from (2,1) to (1,1) at turn62: which is L? \n\nFrom (2,1), moving Left (L) goes to (1,1). \n\nSo turn62: L\n\nThen she is at (1,1).\n\nSo the sequence for Alice:\n\nTurn58: D\nTurn59: I\nTurn60: L (to (3,1))\nTurn61: L (to (2,1))\nTurn62: L (to (1,1))\n\nThen at turn63, she can move U to (1,2) and then face Left to get a plate from (0,2).\n\nBut for now, we output until turn62.\n\nBut is this the best? She could go the other way to (5,1) and then (5,2), etc., but that might be longer.\n\nGiven the time, we output the above.\n\nBut note: at turn61, if Bob is at (2,1), then Alice cannot move there. But we don't control Bob. We have to assume that Bob will move away? Or perhaps we can plan based on the assumption that Bob is also collaborating. \n\nBob is holding an onion and likely wants to put it in a pot. He might be heading to the pot at (4,0) or (2,0). \n\nIf he goes to (4,0), he will need to use (4,1). We freed it at turn60. So he might be moving to (4,1) at turn60? \n\nAt turn58, Bob is at (1,3). At turn58, he might move Down to (1,2). \nTurn59: move Down to (1,1). \nTurn60: move Right to (2,1). \nTurn61: move Right to (3,1). \nTurn62: move Right to (4,1). \n\nSo at turn61, Alice is at (2,1) and Bob is at (3,1) -> no conflict. \nAt turn62, Alice moves to (1,1) and Bob moves to (4,1). \n\nSo it works.\n\nTherefore, the plan for Alice:\n\nTurn58: D\nTurn59: I\nTurn60: L\nTurn61: L\nTurn62: L\n\nBut at turn62, she moves to (1,1). \n\nThis is safe.\n\nAlternatively, after putting the onion, she could go to get a plate immediately. The above plan is for her to head to the plate dispenser.\n\nSo I think this is good.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 58: D\nTurn 59: I\nTurn 60: L\nTurn 61: L\nTurn 62: L\n}\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice should prioritize completing the partially filled pot at (4,0) with her onion and then prepare to fetch a plate for the soon-to-be-cooked soup. The pot currently has 1 onion and requires 2 more to start cooking (which takes 5 turns). Alice is holding an onion and is adjacent to the pot at (4,0), but facing away (Up). She must face Down to interact. After depositing her onion, she should move toward the plate dispenser at (0,2) to be ready to serve the soup once cooked.\n\nBob (not controlled here) is holding an onion and is expected to collaborate by moving to (4,1) to deposit his onion into the same pot, completing the recipe. Based on Bob's position and orientation, a likely path for him is: Down to (1,2), Down to (1,1), Right to (2,1), Right to (3,1), and Right to (4,1) by turn 62. This avoids conflicts with Alice's path.\n\nAlice's action plan for turns 58-62:\n- **Turn 58**: Change orientation to Down (`D`) to face the pot.\n- **Turn 59**: Interact (`I`) to deposit the onion into the pot (pot now has 2 onions).\n- **Turn 60**: Move Left (`L`) to (3,1), freeing (4,1) for Bob.\n- **Turn 61**: Move Left (`L`) to (2,1), continuing toward the plate dispenser.\n- **Turn 62**: Move Left (`L`) to (1,1), positioning to move to (1,2) next and interact with the plate dispenser.\n\nThis sequence ensures the pot is completed (when Bob adds his onion) and Alice is en route to fetch a plate, optimizing coordination for soup delivery.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 58: D\nTurn 59: I\nTurn 60: L\nTurn 61: L\nTurn 62: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 61 (t1 = 61). The goal is to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes.\n\nFirst, let's understand the environment and current state:\n\n### Tile Layout (from the list of tile types):\n- Kitchen Counters: at (0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)\n- Onion Dispensers: at (2,4) and (4,4)\n- Plate Dispenser: at (0,2)\n- Pots: at (2,0) and (4,0)\n- Serving Counter: at (6,2)\n\n### Recipe Information:\n- Only one recipe: 3 onions, 0 tomatoes; reward 20; cooking time 5 turns.\n\n### Current Game State:\n- Turn: 61\n- Alice (me): \n  - Position: (4,1)\n  - Orientation: D (down)\n  - Holding: nothing\n  - Recent actions: I, U, I, D, D (most recent last: so last action was D, then D, then I, etc.)\n\n- Bob:\n  - Position: (2,3)\n  - Orientation: U (up)\n  - Holding: nothing\n  - Recent actions: L, U, I, R, U (most recent last: last action was U, then R, then I, etc.)\n\n### Non-empty Kitchen Counters (with onions):\n- (6,1): onion\n- (2,2): onion\n- (6,3): onion\n- (0,3): onion\n- (4,2): onion\n- (1,4): onion\n\n### Non-empty Pot:\n- Pot at (4,0): 1 onion, 0 tomatoes. Not full -> cooking not started.\n\n### Objective:\nWe need to deliver as many soups as possible. The only recipe is 3 onions. We have a pot at (4,0) that already has 1 onion, so it needs 2 more. There are also other pots (like (2,0)) that are empty? But note: the pot at (2,0) is not mentioned in the non-empty pot state, so it must be empty.\n\nHowever, note that the pot at (4,0) is at (4,0) and Alice is at (4,1) which is adjacent (directly above). Bob is at (2,3) which is near the other pot (2,0) and also near an onion dispenser at (2,4) and kitchen counters with onions.\n\n### Planning:\nWe have two pots: (2,0) and (4,0). The pot at (4,0) is partially filled (1 onion). We can use both pots to cook multiple soups.\n\nBut note: we have a limited number of plates? The plate dispenser is at (0,2). Also, we have onions scattered on kitchen counters. We can use those onions to fill the pots.\n\n### Steps to make and serve a soup:\n1. Fill a pot with 3 onions (either by taking from dispensers or from kitchen counters).\n2. Wait for the pot to cook (5 turns for the onion soup).\n3. Get a plate from the plate dispenser (at 0,2).\n4. Use the plate on the pot to get the soup (if the soup is cooked).\n5. Deliver the soup to the serving counter (at 6,2).\n\n### Current resources:\n- Onions: available on several kitchen counters and at the dispensers. Also, we have 1 onion already in the pot at (4,0).\n\n### Roles for Alice and Bob:\nWe can assign roles to each player. For example:\n- Alice is near the pot at (4,0) and also near a kitchen counter at (4,2) which has an onion. She can quickly grab that onion and put it into the pot at (4,0) to help fill it.\n- Bob is at (2,3). He is near an onion dispenser at (2,4) and a kitchen counter at (2,2) that has an onion. He can also access the other pot at (2,0).\n\nGiven that the pot at (4,0) already has 1 onion, it would be efficient to complete that pot first. We need two more onions.\n\n### Possible immediate actions for Alice (at 61):\n- Alice is at (4,1) facing down (D). The tile below her is (4,0) which is a pot. Since she is adjacent and facing the pot, she can interact (I) to add an onion if she had one? But she is holding nothing. So she cannot add anything.\n\nAlternatively, she could move to pick up an onion from a nearby kitchen counter. The closest one is at (4,2) which is one step above? (4,1) to (4,2) is up. But note: she is facing down. So first she must change orientation to up? Or move.\n\nLet me map the grid:\n\nWe have a grid of 7x5? (from the coordinates: x from 0 to 6, y from 0 to 4)\n\nAlice at (4,1). Adjacent tiles:\n- Up: (4,2) -> kitchen counter with onion? Yes, (4,2) is a kitchen counter and it has an onion.\n- Down: (4,0) -> pot\n- Left: (3,1) -> ? Not listed as non-empty, so probably empty? (since kitchen counters are at (3,0), (3,2), (3,4) but not (3,1))\n- Right: (5,1) -> ? Not listed as non-empty, so empty.\n\nSo Alice can:\n- Move up to (4,2): then she would be on the kitchen counter? But note: players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles? Actually, kitchen counters are non-empty? Wait, the tile types: kitchen counter is a tile type that can be occupied by an item, but the tile itself is walkable? The rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" And a kitchen counter is a tile that is always present, but it can be empty or occupied by an item.\n\nThe rule: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" meaning if the tile has an item? Or the tile itself is an obstacle?\n\nActually, the tile types are fixed. The dispensers, pots, serving counters, and kitchen counters are all non-empty tiles? Or are they walkable?\n\nFrom the rules: \n- \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\"\n- For other tiles: the rules don't explicitly say they are walkable or not, but note: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and \"non-empty\" meaning having an item? Or the tile itself is an object?\n\nBut the rule for movement: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\" and then \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nSo the movement is only allowed to empty tiles? Or to any walkable tile?\n\nThe rule says: \"Change Orientation: No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" That doesn't seem to relate to movement. Let me read again:\n\n\"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\"\n\nAnd then: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This is confusing.\n\nActually, the description for Change Orientation: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This seems incorrect. I think it means: when you change orientation, you don't move, but you face the direction. The condition about adjacent tile is for interact? \n\nLet me re-read the Interact rule:\n\n\"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\nSo, to interact with a tile (say, a pot at (4,0)), Alice must be standing on an adjacent empty tile and facing the pot.\n\nTherefore, the tile the player stands on must be empty. So the player can stand on an empty tile, and then interact with an adjacent non-empty tile (like a pot, dispenser, etc.) if facing it.\n\nWhat about the kitchen counter? It is a non-empty tile? Actually, the kitchen counter is a tile that is always present (like a fixture), and it can hold an item. So the tile itself is not empty? Or is it a type of tile that is walkable?\n\nThe rules say: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and then in the tile types, it is listed separately. Also, the movement constraint: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" -> meaning tiles that are not of type \"Empty Tile\"? Or tiles that have an item on them?\n\nThis is ambiguous. But note: the rule says \"non-empty tile\" in the context of interact. And in the grid, we have \"Empty Tile\" as a type. So probably, only \"Empty Tile\" is walkable? But then how do you access the dispensers, pots, etc.?\n\nLooking at the interact rule: the player must stand on an empty tile adjacent to the non-empty tile (the dispenser, pot, etc.). Therefore, the non-empty tiles (like dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters) are not walkable. The player must stand on an adjacent empty tile to interact.\n\nSo the grid has:\n- Empty tiles: walkable.\n- Non-empty tiles (dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters): not walkable.\n\nTherefore, Alice at (4,1) is standing on an empty tile? Because (4,1) is not in the list of kitchen counters, dispensers, etc. So it must be an empty tile.\n\nAdjacent to her:\n- Up: (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty -> not walkable.\n- Down: (4,0) is a pot -> non-empty -> not walkable.\n- Left: (3,1) -> not listed, so empty? (assuming it's an empty tile)\n- Right: (5,1) -> empty.\n\nSo Alice can move left to (3,1) or right to (5,1), or stay. She cannot move up or down because those are non-empty.\n\nBut note: to interact with the pot at (4,0), she is already adjacent (standing at (4,1) which is adjacent to (4,0)) and facing down (so facing the pot). But she is holding nothing, so if she interacts, what happens? \n\nThe rules for pot interaction:\n- If the player is holding an ingredient, they can add it (if pot not full).\n- If the player is holding a clean plate and the pot has cooked soup, they can serve the soup (get the soup in the plate).\n\nBut she is holding nothing, so interact would do nothing? Or maybe she can take an ingredient from the pot? The rules don't specify that. Only adding and serving.\n\nSo in this case, if she interacts with the pot while holding nothing, it might do nothing.\n\nTherefore, she should not interact now.\n\nInstead, she can pick up an onion from the kitchen counter at (4,2). But to do that, she must be adjacent to (4,2) and facing it. Currently, she is at (4,1) and facing down. The kitchen counter (4,2) is above her. So she must face up and then interact.\n\nBut she is not adjacent to (4,2) in the sense that (4,2) is one step above? Adjacent means horizontally or vertically adjacent. So (4,1) is adjacent to (4,2) (above) and (4,0) (below). So she is adjacent to (4,2).\n\nBut she is facing down, so not facing (4,2). So she must change orientation to up (U) and then interact (I).\n\nAlternatively, she could move to (3,1) or (5,1) and then come back, but that would take extra moves.\n\nSo the efficient plan for Alice at turn 61:\n- Change orientation to Up (U) to face (4,2). Then interact (I) to pick up the onion from the kitchen counter at (4,2). But note: the kitchen counter at (4,2) has an onion, so she can pick it up if she is empty-handed.\n\nAfter that, she will be holding an onion. Then she can turn around to face down (D) and then interact (I) to put the onion into the pot at (4,0). But note: after picking up the onion, the kitchen counter at (4,2) becomes empty? And then she is at (4,1) holding an onion, facing up? Then she must turn to face down.\n\nSo steps for Alice:\nTurn 61: U (change orientation to up) -> now facing (4,2)\nTurn 62: I (interact) -> pick up onion from (4,2). Now holding an onion.\nTurn 63: D (change orientation to down) to face (4,0)\nTurn 64: I (interact) -> add onion to pot at (4,0). Now the pot at (4,0) has 2 onions.\n\nThen she needs one more onion. Where to get? There are other kitchen counters with onions, but the closest one? (4,2) is now empty? Or she can go to another one. Alternatively, she can move to (5,1) then (5,0) which is a kitchen counter? (5,0) is a kitchen counter, but is it occupied? The non-empty ones are listed, and (5,0) is a kitchen counter but not listed as non-empty, so it's empty. So not useful.\n\nAlternatively, she can go to (3,1) and then to (3,2) which is a kitchen counter and has an onion? (3,2) is listed as a kitchen counter and in non-empty? Yes: Kitchen Counter on (3,2) is not listed in the non-empty list? Wait, the non-empty kitchen counters are: (6,1), (2,2), (6,3), (0,3), (4,2), (1,4). So (3,2) is a kitchen counter but it is empty? Similarly, (2,2) has an onion.\n\nSo the onion at (4,2) is taken by Alice, so it becomes empty. The next closest onion might be at (2,2) or (3,2) is empty? Then she would have to go to (2,2) which is two steps away? Or use another one.\n\nBut note: Bob is at (2,3) and can help.\n\nAlternatively, Alice can get the onion from (2,2) by moving left: from (4,1) to (3,1) to (2,1) but (2,1) might be empty? Then from (2,1) she can face up to (2,2) and interact. But that takes two moves to get to (2,1), then change orientation to up, then interact. Then she must bring it back to the pot at (4,0). That would be many moves.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can help by bringing an onion to the pot at (4,0). Bob is at (2,3). He can pick up the onion at (2,2) which is adjacent and above him? He is at (2,3) facing up. The kitchen counter (2,2) is above him. So he can interact? He is adjacent (standing at (2,3) which is adjacent to (2,2)) and facing up? So he can pick up the onion at (2,2) by interacting.\n\nThen he can bring it to the pot at (4,0). How? He would need to go from (2,3) to (3,3) to (4,3) to (4,2) but (4,2) is a kitchen counter and not walkable? So he must go around? The grid:\n\nFrom (2,3) to (4,0): \nOne way: \n- Move right to (3,3) -> is (3,3) empty? Not listed, so empty.\n- Then down to (3,2) -> (3,2) is a kitchen counter? Yes, but it's a tile that is non-empty? So not walkable. So cannot go to (3,2).\nAlternative: \n- From (2,3) move down to (2,2)? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter -> not walkable. So he cannot step on it.\n- So he must go: (2,3) -> right to (3,3) -> then right to (4,3) -> then down to (4,2) -> but (4,2) is non-empty? So cannot. Then how?\n\nHe must go: (2,3) -> right to (3,3) -> down to (3,2)? But (3,2) is non-empty (kitchen counter) -> not walkable. So he must go around the non-walkable tiles.\n\nLooking at the grid, we have kitchen counters at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) in the middle row? So that blocks the way.\n\nHe can go: (2,3) -> down? But down is (2,2) -> non-walkable. So he must go right to (3,3). Then from (3,3), he can go down to (3,2)? Not possible. Then he can go right to (4,3). Then from (4,3) he can go down to (4,2) -> not walkable. Then he must go to (5,3) -> (5,3) is a kitchen counter? (5,3) is not in the list? The kitchen counters are at (5,0), (5,4) but not (5,3). So (5,3) is empty? Then he can go (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (5,2)? (5,2) is not listed as non-empty, so empty? Then (5,1) -> then (5,0) which is a kitchen counter? But he can stand at (5,1) and interact with the pot at (4,0) if he faces left? But (4,0) is at (4,0) and (5,1) is not adjacent? (5,1) is adjacent to (5,0) and (5,2) and (4,1) and (6,1). Not adjacent to (4,0).\n\nTo interact with (4,0), he must be at (4,1) (above), (3,0) (left) or (5,0) (right) or (4,-1) which is out of bounds. But (3,0) and (5,0) are kitchen counters? (3,0) is a kitchen counter and non-empty? We don't know if it's occupied, but the tile itself is non-walkable. So the only adjacent empty tile to the pot at (4,0) is (4,1) above? Because (3,0) and (5,0) are non-walkable, and (4,-1) doesn't exist.\n\nTherefore, only (4,1) is the tile from which the pot can be accessed.\n\nSo Bob must go to (4,1) to interact with the pot. But Alice is currently at (4,1). So they cannot both be at (4,1) at the same time.\n\nSo Bob cannot access the pot at (4,0) while Alice is there? Or they can coordinate.\n\nBut note: the pot at (4,0) already has 2 onions (after Alice adds one) and needs one more. Bob can bring the third onion and Alice can step aside.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can work on the other pot at (2,0). The pot at (2,0) is empty. Bob is at (2,3). He can get onions and fill that pot.\n\nGiven the constraints, it might be more efficient to have Alice complete the pot at (4,0) and Bob start on the pot at (2,0).\n\nSo let's plan:\n\n### For Alice (to complete pot at (4,0)):\n- Currently at (4,1), holding nothing.\n- Steps:\n  - Turn 61: Change orientation to Up (U) to face (4,2)\n  - Turn 62: Interact (I) to pick up onion from (4,2) -> now holding onion.\n  - Turn 63: Change orientation to Down (D) to face (4,0)\n  - Turn 64: Interact (I) to add onion to pot -> now pot has 2 onions. She is still at (4,1) holding nothing? After adding, she is empty.\n\nNow the pot has 2 onions, needs one more. She can get another onion. The closest one? (4,2) is now empty. The next closest might be (3,2) but it's empty? Or (2,2) has an onion. But (2,2) is two steps away? And Bob might be using it.\n\nAlternatively, she can go to (5,1) and then to (6,1) which is a kitchen counter with an onion? (6,1) is a kitchen counter and has an onion. But (6,1) is non-walkable, so she must stand adjacent. The adjacent empty tiles to (6,1) are (6,0), (6,2), (5,1). (6,0) is a kitchen counter? So not walkable. (6,2) is the serving counter -> non-walkable. (5,1) is empty. So she can stand at (5,1) and face right to interact with (6,1). But (6,1) is to the right of (5,1). So:\n\nFrom (4,1) to (5,1): one move right. Then from (5,1) she can face right (R) and interact with (6,1) to get the onion.\n\nThen she must come back to (4,1) to put it in the pot.\n\nSo:\n- After turn 64 (after adding the second onion), she is at (4,1) holding nothing.\n- Turn 65: Move right to (5,1) -> now at (5,1)\n- Turn 66: Change orientation to Right (R) to face (6,1)\n- Turn 67: Interact (I) to pick up onion from (6,1) -> holding onion.\n- Turn 68: Change orientation to Left (L) to face (4,1) [but (4,1) is left of (5,1)? Actually, from (5,1), left is (4,1) and right is (6,1). But she needs to go to (4,1) to access the pot? To put the onion in the pot, she must be at (4,1) and facing down (to (4,0)).\n- So she must move left to (4,1) and then face down.\n\nSo:\n- Turn 68: Move left to (4,1) -> now at (4,1)\n- Turn 69: Change orientation to Down (D)\n- Turn 70: Interact (I) to add onion -> now pot has 3 onions -> cooking starts.\n\nBut this takes until turn 70 to start cooking the pot at (4,0). Then it will cook for 5 turns, so ready at turn 75.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can work on the other pot at (2,0).\n\n### For Bob (at turn 61):\nBob is at (2,3) facing up. He can pick up the onion at (2,2) because he is adjacent and facing it? (2,2) is above (2,3). So:\n- Turn 61: Interact (I) to pick up onion from (2,2) -> now holding an onion.\n- Then he needs to take it to the pot at (2,0). How? The adjacent tile to the pot at (2,0) must be an empty tile. The tiles adjacent to (2,0): \n  - Above: (2,1) -> is it empty? (2,1) is not listed as non-empty, so empty.\n  - Left: (1,0) -> kitchen counter -> non-walkable.\n  - Right: (3,0) -> kitchen counter -> non-walkable.\n  - Below: (2,-1) -> invalid.\n\nSo Bob must stand at (2,1) and face down to interact with the pot at (2,0). \n\nHow to get to (2,1) from (2,3)? \n- He cannot go down to (2,2) because it's non-walkable. So he must go around: \n  - Move right to (3,3) -> then down to (3,2)? But (3,2) is non-walkable. So he must go further: \n  - From (2,3) move right to (3,3) -> then right to (4,3) -> then down to (4,2) -> non-walkable. This is blocked.\n\nAlternatively, move left? (1,3) -> is (1,3) empty? Not listed, so empty. Then down to (1,2)? (1,2) is not listed as non-empty? The kitchen counters are at (0,0) to (6,0) etc. but (1,2) is not in the kitchen counter list? So it might be empty. Then down to (1,1) -> then right to (2,1). \n\nSo path:\n- Turn 61: I (interact) -> pick up onion from (2,2) -> holding onion.\n- Turn 62: Move left to (1,3) [assuming (1,3) is empty]\n- Turn 63: Move down to (1,2) [assuming empty]\n- Turn 64: Move down to (1,1) [assuming empty? (1,1) is not listed, so empty]\n- Turn 65: Move right to (2,1) -> now at (2,1) which is adjacent to the pot at (2,0) below.\n- Turn 66: Change orientation to Down (D) to face the pot.\n- Turn 67: Interact (I) to add onion -> now pot has 1 onion.\n\nBut the pot at (2,0) is empty, so he just added the first onion. He needs to add two more. He can go get more onions.\n\nBut he is now at (2,1) holding nothing (after adding). He can go back to get more onions.\n\nAlternatively, he can get another onion from the dispenser at (2,4) or from kitchen counters. But the kitchen counter at (2,2) is now empty? He took it. The next closest might be the dispenser at (2,4).\n\nHe is at (2,1). To get to (2,4): \n- Move up to (2,2)? Not walkable. So go around: \n  - Move left to (1,1) -> down? No, better to go to (1,2) then (1,3) then (1,4) but (1,4) is a kitchen counter? And it has an onion? The non-empty kitchen counters include (1,4) with an onion. But (1,4) is non-walkable. So he can pick it up from adjacent? \n\nHe can go:\n- From (2,1) to (1,1) -> (1,1) to (1,2) -> (1,2) to (1,3) -> then to (1,4)? But (1,4) is non-walkable. So he must stand adjacent. The adjacent empty tiles to (1,4): \n  - Above: (1,5) invalid.\n  - Below: (1,3) -> empty? \n  - Left: (0,4) -> kitchen counter -> non-walkable.\n  - Right: (2,4) -> onion dispenser -> non-walkable.\n\nSo he can stand at (1,3) and face up to (1,4) and interact? But (1,4) is above (1,3). So he can pick up the onion at (1,4) if he is at (1,3) and facing up.\n\nSo:\n- Turn 67: after adding the onion, he is at (2,1) holding nothing.\n- Turn 68: Move left to (1,1)\n- Turn 69: Move up to (1,2)\n- Turn 70: Move up to (1,3)\n- Turn 71: Change orientation to Up (U) to face (1,4)\n- Turn 72: Interact (I) to pick up onion from (1,4) -> holding onion.\n- Then he must bring it back to the pot at (2,0). So he must go back to (2,1) and face down.\n\nPath back:\n- Turn 73: Move down to (1,2)\n- Turn 74: Move down to (1,1)\n- Turn 75: Move right to (2,1)\n- Turn 76: Change orientation to Down (D)\n- Turn 77: Interact (I) to add onion -> now pot at (2,0) has 2 onions.\n\nThen he needs one more. He can go to the dispenser at (2,4) to get a new onion.\n\nBut the dispenser is at (2,4). He is at (2,1). How to get to (2,4)? Must go around: (2,1) to (1,1) to (1,2) to (1,3) to (1,4) -> but (1,4) is non-walkable, so then to (1,5) invalid. Alternatively, from (1,3) to (2,3) to (2,4)? But (2,3) is empty? And (2,4) is non-walkable. So he can stand at (2,3) and face up to (2,4) to interact with the dispenser.\n\nSo:\n- After turn 77: at (2,1) holding nothing.\n- Turn 78: Move left to (1,1)\n- Turn 79: Move up to (1,2)\n- Turn 80: Move up to (1,3)\n- Turn 81: Move right to (2,3) -> now at (2,3)\n- Turn 82: Change orientation to Up (U) to face (2,4)\n- Turn 83: Interact (I) to get an onion from dispenser -> holding onion.\n- Then bring it to (2,1) and add to pot.\n\nPath back:\n- Turn 84: Move down to (2,2)? Not walkable. So go left: (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1). \n  - Turn 84: Move left to (1,3)\n  - Turn 85: Move down to (1,2)\n  - Turn 86: Move down to (1,1)\n  - Turn 87: Move right to (2,1)\n  - Turn 88: Change orientation to Down (D)\n  - Turn 89: Interact (I) to add onion -> now pot at (2,0) has 3 onions -> cooking starts at turn 89.\n\nThis is very slow. And the first pot (at (4,0)) started cooking at turn 70, so it will be ready at turn 75. Then we need to serve it.\n\nBut note: we need plates. The plate dispenser is at (0,2). And we have two pots, so we need two plates.\n\nAlso, the serving counter is at (6,2).\n\n### Serving the first soup (from (4,0)):\nThe soup is ready at turn 75. We need someone to get a plate and then serve the soup and then deliver.\n\nAlice is free at turn 70 (after starting the pot at (4,0)). She can get a plate.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2). Alice is at (4,1). How to get to (0,2)? \n\nPath: \n- From (4,1) to (3,1) -> (2,1) -> but (2,1) is empty? Then (1,1) -> (0,1) -> but (0,1) is a kitchen counter? Non-walkable. So must go around? \n\nAlternatively, go up? But above (4,1) is (4,2) non-walkable. So left to (3,1), then up to (3,2)? non-walkable. So she must go left to (3,1) and then left to (2,1) and then up? But (2,2) is non-walkable. So she has to go to (1,1) and then to (0,1) is non-walkable? Then how to get to (0,2)? \n\nThe adjacent empty tile to (0,2) (plate dispenser) might be (0,1), (0,3), (1,2). But (0,1) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. (0,3) is a kitchen counter and non-empty -> non-walkable. (1,2) is empty? So she can stand at (1,2) and face left to (0,2) to interact.\n\nSo path for Alice to plate dispenser:\n- From (4,1): \n  - Move left to (3,1) [turn 71? But we are at turn 70 after she added the last onion and started cooking. So turn 70: she just finished adding and is at (4,1).]\n\nLet's reset the turn count for Alice.\n\nAfter turn 70: Alice is at (4,1) holding nothing. The pot at (4,0) is cooking (started at turn 70, so ready at turn 75).\n\nAlice can go get a plate:\n- Turn 71: Move left to (3,1)\n- Turn 72: Move left to (2,1) [but note: Bob might be there? We have to coordinate. At turn 71, Bob is at ... let's see Bob's timeline.]\n\nBut we are planning independently. To avoid conflict, we can assign Alice to get the plate and Bob to continue with the other pot.\n\nBob is working on the pot at (2,0). At turn 70, where is Bob? \n\nBob's timeline (from turn 61):\n- Turn 61: I -> pick up onion at (2,2) -> at (2,3) holding onion.\n- Turn 62: Move left to (1,3)\n- Turn 63: Move down to (1,2) [we assume (1,2) is empty]\n- Turn 64: Move down to (1,1)\n- Turn 65: Move right to (2,1)\n- Turn 66: D -> face down\n- Turn 67: I -> add onion to pot at (2,0) -> now pot has 1 onion. At (2,1) holding nothing.\n- Turn 68: Move left to (1,1)\n- Turn 69: Move up to (1,2)\n- Turn 70: Move up to (1,3) -> at (1,3) holding nothing.\n\nAt turn 70, Bob is at (1,3). He is about to pick up the onion at (1,4).\n\nAlice at turn 70 is at (4,1). She wants to go to (1,2) to access the plate dispenser at (0,2). But (1,2) might be occupied by Bob later? At turn 70, Bob is moving to (1,3). Alice can go:\n\n- Turn 71: Move left to (3,1)\n- Turn 72: Move left to (2,1) -> at turn 72, Bob is at turn 71: Bob's turn 71: he is at (1,3) and does: change orientation to up (for interacting with (1,4) at his next turn). So at turn 72, Bob is still at (1,3) and does interact? Or at turn 71 he changes orientation, turn 72 interacts.\n\nSo at turn 72, Alice moves to (2,1). But Bob is at (1,3) and not at (2,1), so no conflict.\n\n- Turn 73: Alice moves up? But (2,2) is non-walkable. So she must move left to (1,1)? Or up is blocked. So:\n  - From (2,1), she can move left to (1,1) [turn 73]\n  - Then from (1,1) to (1,2) [turn 74] -> now at (1,2), which is adjacent to the plate dispenser at (0,2) (left of (1,2)).\n\n- Turn 75: Change orientation to Left (L) to face (0,2)\n- Turn 76: Interact (I) to get a plate -> now holding a plate.\n\nThen she must go to the pot at (4,0) to get the soup. The soup is ready at turn 75. At turn 76, it is ready. So she can then go to the pot.\n\nBut she is at (1,2) holding a plate. To go to (4,0): \n- Move right to (2,2) -> not walkable. So move down to (1,1) [turn 77], then right to (2,1) [turn 78], then right to (3,1) [turn 79], then right to (4,1) [turn 80]. \n- Then at (4,1), she must face down (D) [turn 81] and interact (I) [turn 82] to get the soup from the pot (which is cooked).\n\nThen she must deliver it to the serving counter at (6,2). From (4,1), she can go:\n- Move right to (5,1) [turn 83]\n- Then up? But (5,2) is empty? And (6,2) is serving counter. She can stand at (5,2) or (6,1) or (6,3) or (5,2) to interact with (6,2)? The serving counter at (6,2) is adjacent to (5,2) (left), (6,1) (below), (6,3) (above), (7,2) invalid.\n\n(6,1) is a kitchen counter and non-walkable. (6,3) is a kitchen counter and non-walkable. (5,2) is empty? So she can stand at (5,2) and face right to (6,2).\n\nSo from (4,1):\n- After getting the soup at turn 82, she is at (4,1) holding soup.\n- Turn 83: Move right to (5,1)\n- Turn 84: Move up to (5,2) -> now at (5,2)\n- Turn 85: Change orientation to Right (R) to face (6,2)\n- Turn 86: Interact (I) to deliver the soup -> reward 20.\n\nThis is at turn 86.\n\nBut during this time, Bob is filling the other pot. But it's slow. Alternatively, after Alice delivers the first soup, she can help Bob.\n\nBut the problem is to maximize the total reward. We can try to get two soups.\n\nHowever, the second pot (at (2,0)) will be ready at turn 89 + 5 = 94, and then serving would take more turns.\n\nBut we are only planning for H turns? The problem says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\". We are not given H, but we should aim for at least one delivery.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's focus on delivering one soup quickly and then see.\n\nBut we have to output a sequence of actions for Alice. The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\" but the answer format only has actions for Alice? The instruction: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", but the answer format only shows actions for Alice. So probably we only output Alice's actions.\n\nBut then how to coordinate? We must assume Bob will act optimally? Or we only control Alice.\n\nThe task says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\" but then the answer format only has turns for one player? It says \"a_{t}\" for Alice? Let me read:\n\n\"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t_1} ... }\" and each action in {U, D, L, R, I, S}. And it's for Alice.\n\nSo we only output Alice's actions. We don't control Bob. But we can assume that Bob will continue his current task? Or we must plan with the current state and history.\n\nBut in the plan, we should consider what Bob is likely to do based on his history and position.\n\nBob's recent actions: L, U, I, R, U. At turn 61, he is at (2,3) facing up. He just did \"U\" (up) in the last action, which is a move? Or orientation change? The actions are: Move or Change Orientation or Interact or Stay.\n\nThe action history: \"L, U, I, R, U\". We don't know if they are moves or orientation changes. But typically, in the history, they are the actions taken.\n\nBut we can assume that Bob is facing up because his orientation is U. And he is at (2,3). The kitchen counter at (2,2) has an onion. It's likely that he will interact with it.\n\nSo at turn 61, Bob will probably interact (I) to pick up the onion at (2,2).\n\nThen he will move to put it in the pot at (2,0) as we planned earlier.\n\nSo for Alice, we can focus on completing the pot at (4,0) and then serving it.\n\n### Revised plan for Alice only (turns 61 to 86):\n\nAt turn 61: Alice at (4,1) facing down, holding nothing.\n- Turn 61: U (change orientation to up) to face (4,2)\n- Turn 62: I (interact) to pick up onion from (4,2)\n- Turn 63: D (change orientation to down) to face (4,0)\n- Turn 64: I (interact) to add onion to pot (now 2 onions)\n\nThen she needs one more onion. Instead of going to (6,1), she could use the onion at (6,1) but it's far. There is an onion at (6,3) and (0,3) but also far. Or she can get one from the dispenser? The onion dispensers are at (2,4) and (4,4). (4,4) is closer.\n\n(4,4) is an onion dispenser. Alice is at (4,1). She can go to (4,3) but (4,3) is empty? Then to (4,4)? But (4,4) is non-walkable. So she must stand at (4,3) and face up to (4,4) to interact.\n\nBut (4,3) is a kitchen counter? No, the kitchen counters are at (0,3), (6,3), etc. (4,3) is not in the kitchen counter list, so empty? Then she can go:\n\n- Turn 65: Move up to (4,2)? Not possible, non-walkable. So she must go around: move right to (5,1) [turn 65], then up to (5,2) [turn 66], but (5,2) is empty? Then up to (5,3) [turn 67], then left to (4,3) [turn 68]. \n- Then at (4,3) she can face up (U) [turn 69] and interact (I) [turn 70] to get an onion from dispenser at (4,4).\n\nBut this is longer than going to (6,1). Previously we had 4 moves to get the onion from (6,1) and back. This is 5 moves to get to (4,3) and interact, then she must come back.\n\nAlternatively, after adding the second onion at turn 64, she is at (4,1). She can move right to (5,1) [turn 65], then face right (R) [turn 66], then interact (I) [turn 67] to get the onion from (6,1) (which is right of (5,1)). Then she has the onion, and she is at (5,1). Then she can move left to (4,1) [turn 68], face down (D) [turn 69], and interact (I) [turn 70] to add to the pot.\n\nThis is shorter: turns 65-70.\n\nSo we'll do that.\n\nThen at turn 70, the pot has 3 onions and cooking starts. It will be ready at turn 75.\n\nThen Alice can go get a plate from (0,2) as before.\n\nBut turn 70: she is at (4,1) holding nothing.\n\nThen turns for plate and delivery:\n- Turn 71: Move left to (3,1)\n- Turn 72: Move left to (2,1) -> but at this time, Bob might be at (2,1)? At turn 72, Bob's timeline: \n  - Bob's turn 61: I\n  - Turn 62: move left to (1,3)\n  - Turn 63: move down to (1,2)\n  - Turn 64: move down to (1,1)\n  - Turn 65: move right to (2,1) -> so at turn 65, Bob is at (2,1). Then turn 66: D, turn 67: I (add onion). So at turn 67, Bob is at (2,1) and then he moves away.\n\nAlice's turn 72 is global turn 72. Bob's turn 72: \n  - Bob's turn 67: I (add onion) -> then he is at (2,1) holding nothing.\n  - Turn 68: move left to (1,1) [global turn 68+61-1? Wait, turn 61 is the first turn, so Bob's turn 1 (relative) is turn 61, turn 2 is 62, etc.\n\nGlobal turn for Bob:\n- Turn 61: action 1 (I)\n- Turn 62: action 2 (move left)\n- ...\n- Turn 67: action 7 (I) -> global turn 67.\n\nThen turn 68: Bob moves left to (1,1) (global turn 68).\n\nSo at global turn 72, Bob is at: \n  - Turn 68: move to (1,1)\n  - Turn 69: move up to (1,2)\n  - Turn 70: move up to (1,3)\n  - Turn 71: change orientation to up (at (1,3))\n  - Turn 72: interact to pick up onion at (1,4) -> at (1,3)\n\nSo Alice at turn 72 (global) moves to (2,1). Bob is at (1,3), so no conflict.\n\nThen Alice:\n- Turn 73: move left to (1,1) -> global turn 73\n- Turn 74: move up to (1,2) -> global turn 74\n- Turn 75: change orientation to left (L) to face (0,2) -> global turn 75\n- Turn 76: interact (I) to get plate -> holding plate, at (1,2)\n\nThe soup is ready at turn 75, but she is not at the pot yet.\n\nThen she must go to the pot at (4,0):\n- Turn 77: move down to (1,1) -> global turn 77\n- Turn 78: move right to (2,1) -> global turn 78\n- Turn 79: move right to (3,1) -> global turn 79\n- Turn 80: move right to (4,1) -> global turn 80\n- Turn 81: change orientation to down (D) -> global turn 81\n- Turn 82: interact (I) to get soup from pot -> holding soup, at (4,1)\n\nThen deliver to (6,2):\n- Turn 83: move right to (5,1) -> global turn 83\n- Turn 84: move up to (5,2) -> global turn 84\n- Turn 85: change orientation to right (R) to face (6,2) -> global turn 85\n- Turn 86: interact (I) to deliver -> reward, and now holding nothing.\n\nThis gets one soup delivered by turn 86.\n\nWe could try to start the second pot, but with Alice and Bob both working on it, but since we only output Alice's actions, and she is far away after turn 86, and the second pot won't be ready until turn 94, it might be beyond H.\n\nSo for the sequence, we'll output Alice's actions from turn 61 to turn 86.\n\nBut the problem says \"over next several turns\", so we don't have to go until delivery. But to maximize reward, we should at least complete one delivery.\n\nAlternatively, we could have Alice help with the second pot after the first, but that would be beyond turn 86.\n\nGiven the instructions, we'll output a sequence until the first delivery.\n\nSo Alice's actions from turn 61 to 86:\n\nTurn 61: U\nTurn 62: I\nTurn 63: D\nTurn 64: I\nTurn 65: R  (move right to (5,1))\nTurn 66: R  (change orientation to right? Or move? The action is R, which can be move or orientation change? In the action set: \"Move (L/R/U/D)\" and \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D)\" are separate, but the action is specified by the letter. \n\nThe actions are: U, D, L, R, I, S. And the move and change orientation share the same letters. How to distinguish?\n\nThe rule: \n- \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\"\n- \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This is confusing.\n\nActually, I think the action \"R\" can mean either move right or face right? But the rule for change orientation says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This suggests that when you do a change orientation, you only change orientation and don't move, but there is a condition about adjacent tile? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. In many implementations, there are separate actions for move and rotate. But here the actions are listed as U, D, L, R, I, S. And the description says:\n\n\"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" -> meaning when you move, you also change your orientation to the direction of movement.\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This seems to be a mistake. I think it should be: when you change orientation, you don't move, and there is no condition. The condition is only for interact.\n\nBut the rule as written is confusing. Perhaps \"Change Orientation\" action only changes orientation and never moves. The phrase \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one\" might be a remnant from a different description.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will assume that:\n- U, D, L, R can mean either move in that direction (which also changes orientation to that direction) or change orientation to that direction without moving? But the action set is {U, D, L, R, I, S}, so we have to choose one.\n\nLooking at the action history: Alice's action history: I, U, I, D, D. This suggests that U and D can be used for both move and orientation change.\n\nIn the context, when a player is adjacent to a non-walkable tile in the direction, they cannot move, so they change orientation? But the rule says for change orientation action: \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one\" — which is always true? Because change orientation doesn't move.\n\nI think the intended meaning is:\n- When you choose a direction action (L/R/U/D):\n  - If you are trying to move and the target tile is empty, you move and change orientation.\n  - If the target tile is not empty, then you do not move, but you change your orientation to that direction.\n\nSo it's a combined action: attempt to move in the direction; if cannot, then change orientation to that direction.\n\nSimilarly, the change orientation action might be redundant.\n\nBut the rule lists \"Move\" and \"Change Orientation\" separately, but they share the same action letters.\n\nTo clarify, I think that the action L/R/U/D means:\n- If the adjacent tile in that direction is empty, then move to it and change orientation to that direction.\n- Else, change orientation to that direction without moving.\n\nAnd there is no separate \"change orientation\" action; it's implied by the move action when movement is blocked.\n\nThe rule says: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" — implying that it always moves and changes orientation? But then how to change orientation without moving?\n\nThen it says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" — which suggests that this action never moves, but the condition is confusing.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will assume that the actions U/D/L/R are used for both move and orientation change: if the player can move in that direction (target tile empty), they move and change orientation; if not, they change orientation without moving.\n\nThis is common in such games.\n\nIn that case, for Alice at turn 65: she is at (4,1), and she wants to move right to (5,1). (5,1) is empty, so she can move. So action R at turn 65: move to (5,1) and face right.\n\nThen turn 66: she is at (5,1) holding onion? No, at turn 65 she is moving from (4,1) to (5,1), and she is holding the onion? No, at turn 64 she added the onion, so she is holding nothing at turn 65.\n\nAt turn 65: she is at (4,1) holding nothing. She does R: move to (5,1) and face right.\n\nThen turn 66: she is at (5,1) facing right. The tile to the right is (6,1), which is a kitchen counter and non-empty, so she cannot move there. If she does R, she will change orientation to right without moving? But she is already facing right? Or it will do nothing? \n\nBut she wants to interact with (6,1). She is adjacent to (6,1) and facing it? (5,1) is adjacent to (6,1) (right) and she is facing right, so she can interact.\n\nSo turn 66: she can do I to interact and pick up the onion from (6,1)? But she is at (5,1) facing right, and (6,1) is adjacent and she is facing it, so yes.\n\nIn our earlier plan, we had:\n- Turn 65: R (move right to (5,1)) -> now at (5,1) facing right.\n- Turn 66: I (interact) to pick up onion from (6,1) -> holding onion.\n\nThen turn 67: she wants to move left to (4,1). So she does L: move left to (4,1) and face left. (4,1) is empty, so she moves.\n\nBut then at (4,1), she is facing left. To interact with the pot at (4,0) which is below, she must face down.\n\nSo:\n- Turn 67: L (move left to (4,1)) -> now at (4,1) facing left.\n- Turn 68: D (change orientation to down) -> since she cannot move down (because (4,0) is non-empty), so she changes orientation to down without moving.\n- Turn 69: I (interact) to add onion to pot.\n\nThis is one more turn than previously planned (because of the extra orientation change).\n\nTo save a turn, after picking up the onion at turn 66, she can at turn 67 do D to change orientation to down? But then she is at (5,1) facing down. Then she can move down? But (5,0) is a kitchen counter, non-empty, so cannot move down. Then she must move left to (4,1) at turn 67: L (move left) to (4,1) and face left. Then at turn 68: D to face down (since cannot move down), then turn 69: I. Same as above.\n\nSo the sequence for Alice:\n\nTurn 61: U  (at (4,1), facing down: try to move up? (4,2) is non-empty, so cannot move, so change orientation to up)\nTurn 62: I  (interact with (4,2) to pick up onion)\nTurn 63: D  (try to move down? (4,0) non-empty, so change orientation to down)\nTurn 64: I  (add onion to pot, now 2 onions)\nTurn 65: R  (move right to (5,1) because (5,1) empty, and face right)\nTurn 66: I  (interact with (6,1) to pick up onion)\nTurn 67: L  (move left to (4,1) because (4,1) empty, and face left)\nTurn 68: D  (try to move down? cannot, so change orientation to down)\nTurn 69: I  (add onion to pot, now 3 onions, cooking starts at turn 69)\n\nThen turn 70: she is at (4,1) holding nothing.\nTurn 70: L  (move left to (3,1)? (3,1) is empty, so move to (3,1) and face left)\nTurn 71: L  (move left to (2,1)? (2,1) is empty, so move to (2,1) and face left)\nTurn 72: U  (try to move up? (2,2) non-empty, so change orientation to up)\nBut she wants to go to (1,2). So better to move left to (1,1) first.\nTurn 72: L  (move left to (1,1) if empty, and face left)\nTurn 73: U  (move up to (1,2) if empty, and face up) -> now at (1,2)\nTurn 74: L  (change orientation to left? Or move? (0,2) is non-empty, so if she does L, she changes orientation to left without moving. So she faces left towards (0,2))\nTurn 75: I  (interact to get plate)\nTurn 76: D  (try to move down? (1,1) empty, so move to (1,1) and face down)\nTurn 77: R  (move right to (2,1) and face right)\nTurn 78: R  (move right to (3,1) and face right)\nTurn 79: R  (move right to (4,1) and face right)\nTurn 80: D  (change orientation to down? Or move down? cannot, so change to down)\nTurn 81: I  (interact with pot to get soup)\nTurn 82: R  (move right to (5,1) and face right)\nTurn 83: U  (move up to (5,2) and face up) -> (5,2) should be empty\nTurn 84: R  (change orientation to right? Or move? (6,2) non-empty, so change orientation to right)\nTurn 85: I  (interact to deliver soup)\n\nThis is turn 85 for delivery, one turn earlier than before.\n\nLet's check the moves:\n\n- Turn 69: added onion, at (4,1)\n- Turn 70: L to (3,1)\n- Turn 71: L to (2,1)\n- Turn 72: L to (1,1) [I changed from U to L because moving left to (1,1) is better]\n- Turn 73: U to (1,2)\n- Turn 74: L (to change orientation to left, since cannot move left to (0,2))\n- Turn 75: I (get plate)\n- Turn 76: D (move down to (1,1) and face down)\n- Turn 77: R (move right to (2,1) and face right)\n- Turn 78: R (to (3,1))\n- Turn 79: R (to (4,1))\n- Turn 80: D (change to down)\n- Turn 81: I (get soup)\n- Turn 82: R (to (5,1))\n- Turn 83: U (to (5,2))\n- Turn 84: R (change to right to face (6,2))\n- Turn 85: I (deliver)\n\nYes, and the soup was ready at turn 69+5=74? But she picks it up at turn 81, which is after 74, so it's ready.\n\nBut at turn 75 when she gets the plate, the soup is ready (turn 69+5=74), so it's fine.\n\nSo we have a sequence for Alice from turn 61 to 85.\n\nWe can stop at turn 85 after delivery.\n\nSo the actions:\n\nTurn 61: U\nTurn 62: I\nTurn 63: D\nTurn 64: I\nTurn 65: R\nTurn 66: I\nTurn 67: L\nTurn 68: D\nTurn 69: I\nTurn 70: L\nTurn 71: L\nTurn 72: L\nTurn 73: U\nTurn 74: L\nTurn 75: I\nTurn 76: D\nTurn 77: R\nTurn 78: R\nTurn 79: R\nTurn 80: D\nTurn 81: I\nTurn 82: R\nTurn 83: U\nTurn 84: R\nTurn 85: I\n\nBut the problem says to start at turn t1=61, and we have up to turn 85 (which is 25 actions?).\n\nt1=61, then we go to turn 85, which is 25 turns? From 61 to 85 inclusive is 25 actions.\n\nAlternatively, we can output until the delivery is done.\n\nThis should be acceptable.\n\nSo the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice should focus on completing the partially filled pot at (4,0) with 1 onion by adding two more onions, starting the cooking process, and then delivering the soup. The pot requires 3 onions for the recipe (3 onions, 0 tomatoes), which yields a reward of 20 after a 5-turn cook time. Alice's actions are planned to efficiently gather ingredients from nearby kitchen counters and the onion at (6,1), start cooking, fetch a plate from the dispenser at (0,2), and deliver the soup to the serving counter at (6,2). Bob is assumed to independently work on filling the other pot at (2,0), but Alice's actions are optimized for her path and interactions.\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence:\n- **Turns 61-62:** Pick up the onion from the kitchen counter at (4,2). Alice is at (4,1) facing down; she changes orientation to up (U) to face (4,2) and interacts (I) to grab the onion.\n- **Turns 63-64:** Add the onion to the pot at (4,0). Alice changes orientation to down (D) to face the pot and interacts (I) to add the onion (pot now has 2 onions).\n- **Turns 65-66:** Move to (5,1) and pick up the onion from (6,1). Alice moves right (R) to (5,1), then interacts (I) with (6,1) to grab the onion (facing right).\n- **Turns 67-69:** Return to (4,1) and add the onion to the pot. Alice moves left (L) to (4,1), changes orientation to down (D) (since moving down is blocked), and interacts (I) to add the onion. The pot now has 3 onions, and cooking starts at turn 69 (ready at turn 74).\n- **Turns 70-72:** Move to (1,1) to approach the plate dispenser. Alice moves left (L) three times to (3,1), (2,1), and (1,1).\n- **Turns 73-75:** Pick up a plate from (0,2). Alice moves up (U) to (1,2), changes orientation to left (L) (facing (0,2)), and interacts (I) to get the plate.\n- **Turns 76-79:** Return to (4,1) to access the pot. Alice moves down (D) to (1,1), then right (R) three times to (2,1), (3,1), and (4,1).\n- **Turns 80-81:** Collect the cooked soup. Alice changes orientation to down (D) and interacts (I) with the pot to get the soup.\n- **Turns 82-85:** Deliver the soup to (6,2). Alice moves right (R) to (5,1), up (U) to (5,2), changes orientation to right (R) (facing (6,2)), and interacts (I) to deliver, earning the reward at turn 85.\n\nThis sequence delivers one soup by turn 85, achieving a reward of 20. The pot at (2,0) can be handled by Bob for additional rewards, but Alice's actions are complete after delivery.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 61: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 62: \\text{I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 63: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 64: \\text{I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 65: \\text{R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 66: \\text{I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 67: \\text{L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 68: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 69: \\text{I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 70: \\text{L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 71: \\text{L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 72: \\text{L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 73: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 74: \\text{L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 75: \\text{I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 76: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 77: \\text{R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 78: \\text{R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 79: \\text{R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 80: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 81: \\text{I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 82: \\text{R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 83: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 84: \\text{R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 85: \\text{I}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 65. Alice is at (2,1) facing Up, holding nothing. Bob is at (3,3) facing Up, holding nothing.\n\nThe recipe available is for 3 onions, which gives a reward of 20 and takes 5 turns to cook.\n\nWe have two pots: at (2,0) and (4,0). The pot at (4,0) already has 1 onion. So it needs 2 more onions to start cooking.\n\nThere are onion dispensers at (2,4) and (4,4). Plate dispenser at (0,2). Serving counter at (6,2).\n\nThere are several kitchen counters with onions already placed: \n- (6,1): onion\n- (2,2): onion\n- (6,3): onion\n- (0,3): onion\n- (4,2): onion\n- (1,4): onion\n- (3,4): onion\n\nSince there are already onions on many counters, we can use these to avoid going to the dispenser every time.\n\nGoal: We want to deliver as many 3-onion soups as possible. The pot at (4,0) already has one onion, so we can complete it with two more. The pot at (2,0) is empty and can be used for another soup.\n\nHowever, we are at turn 65 and we are planning for the next several turns (let's say H=10 turns for a start). We need to maximize the reward.\n\nPlan:\n\n1. Complete the pot at (4,0) by adding two more onions. Then wait for it to cook (5 turns) and then serve it.\n2. Start a new soup in the pot at (2,0) by adding three onions. But note that we have many onions on counters, so we can use those.\n\nBut note: we have two players. We can have both players working on different tasks.\n\nAlice is at (2,1) and Bob at (3,3). \n\nLet's assign:\n\nAlice: She is near the pot at (2,0) and the kitchen counter at (2,2) which has an onion. She can pick up that onion and put it in the pot at (2,0). But note that the pot at (4,0) is also close? Actually, (2,0) is one step down from (2,1). But she is facing Up. So she needs to turn or move.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Alice work on the pot at (2,0) and Bob work on the pot at (4,0).\n\nBob is at (3,3). He can go to the kitchen counter at (4,2) which has an onion, then go to the pot at (4,0) to add it. Then he can get another onion from a nearby counter (like (3,4) or (4,2) again if we put one there? But (4,2) only has one onion and he just took it). Alternatively, he can go to an onion dispenser.\n\nBut note: we have many onions on counters. We can use them without going to the dispensers.\n\nLet me map the positions:\n\n- Alice: (2,1) -> she can go down to (2,0) which is a pot. But she is facing Up. So she needs to turn down or move down.\n\n- Bob: (3,3) -> he can go up to (3,4) which is a kitchen counter with an onion? But (3,4) is one above (3,3). He is facing Up, so he can interact with (3,4) without moving? But note: to interact, he must be adjacent and facing the tile. He is at (3,3) and (3,4) is adjacent and above. So if he faces Up, he can interact with (3,4) without moving? Actually, the action \"Change Orientation\" doesn't move, but to interact he must be adjacent and facing. So if he is at (3,3) and facing Up, then (3,4) is adjacent and in front. So he can do:\n\nTurn Up (if not already) and then Interact to pick up the onion at (3,4). But he is already facing Up? So he can just Interact.\n\nBut note: the action history for Bob: his last actions were U, I, R, U, I. We don't know the exact state before, but we know his current position and orientation.\n\nSimilarly for Alice.\n\nSo for Bob at (3,3) facing Up:\n\n- He can pick up the onion at (3,4) by interacting (without moving). Then he can go down to (3,2) and then left to (2,2) to get the onion there? But (2,2) has an onion, but that's a kitchen counter. Or he can go to the pot at (4,0) to add the onion? But he has to go down to (3,2), then (4,2) (which also has an onion, but he might pick that up if he steps on it? No, he must interact to pick up from a counter. And he is holding an onion, so he can't pick up another. He must first deliver the onion to the pot.\n\nSo Bob's plan:\n\nTurn 65: Bob can Interact to pick up the onion at (3,4). Then he is holding an onion.\n\nThen he needs to go to the pot at (4,0). How?\n\nFrom (3,3) with an onion: \n- Move down to (3,2) [D]\n- Then move right to (4,2) [R] (but note (4,2) is a kitchen counter and has an onion, but he can just walk through? No, he can walk on empty tiles. Kitchen counters are non-empty? Actually, the tile is a kitchen counter and it has an onion, but the tile type is kitchen counter and it is non-empty? The rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" But the kitchen counter is a tile that is non-empty? Actually, the kitchen counter is a tile type that is walkable? The tile types: kitchen counter is a tile that you can walk on? The rule says: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and then other tiles? The rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are those that have an item? Actually, the tile types are fixed. The kitchen counter is a tile that is always there. The rule says:\n\n\"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and then the constraint: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" \n\nBut what is a non-empty tile? It means a tile that has an item (like an onion or plate) on it? Or the tile type itself? \n\nRe-read: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are defined as tiles that have an item? The game grid section says: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and then the others are not empty? But then it says \"non-empty tiles\" in the constraints. \n\nActually, the constraint is: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are those that are not of type \"Empty Tile\". Because the grid has tile types, and only empty tiles are walkable. So dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters are not walkable? That would be a problem because then players couldn't stand on them? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\nSo the player must be standing on an empty tile and adjacent to the tile they are interacting with. Therefore, the player cannot stand on a non-empty tile (like a dispenser, pot, etc.). So all the non-empty tiles (meaning non-empty tile types) are not walkable? \n\nBut then the kitchen counters are non-empty tile types? Actually, the tile types are:\n\n- Empty Tile: walkable.\n- Dispensers, Pot, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter: not walkable? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and it's a tile type. So it must be that these are non-walkable? Then how do you interact? By standing on an adjacent empty tile.\n\nSo in the grid, the player must be on an empty tile adjacent to the target.\n\nTherefore, Bob at (3,3) is on an empty tile? We don't have the full grid, but we know the positions of non-empty tiles. The kitchen counters are at specific positions. So (3,3) is not in the list of kitchen counters? The list: \nKitchen Counter: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (3, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (0, 1), (6, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (0, 3), (6, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (3, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4)]\n\nSo (3,3) is not a kitchen counter? Then it must be an empty tile? So Bob is at (3,3) which is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) is a kitchen counter and has an onion. So Bob is at (3,3) (empty) and adjacent to (3,4) (kitchen counter) and facing it (Up). So he can interact to pick up the onion.\n\nNow, to go to the pot at (4,0): \n- From (3,3) he can move down to (3,2). Is (3,2) empty? The kitchen counters are at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2). Oh, (3,2) is a kitchen counter? Then he cannot walk on it? So he must go around? \n\nWait, the list: kitchen counters at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2). So (3,2) is a kitchen counter. Then Bob cannot move down to (3,2) because it's non-walkable? \n\nBut note: the kitchen counter might be non-walkable? The rule says players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles. So if (3,2) is a kitchen counter (a non-empty tile type? Or does \"non-empty\" refer to having an item? \n\nThe constraint says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and then in the context, non-empty tiles are the ones that are not empty? The tile types: only empty tiles are walkable? \n\nBut the problem states: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and then the others are not. So dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters are not walkable. Therefore, Bob cannot move to (3,2) because it's a kitchen counter? Then how can he get to (4,0)? \n\nHe must go around the kitchen counters. The grid is 7x5? We don't have the full grid, but we know the positions of non-empty tiles.\n\nAlternatively, the kitchen counters might be walkable? But the rule says only empty tiles are walkable. And the problem says: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and it's a tile type. So it is not an empty tile. Therefore, it is not walkable.\n\nSo Bob at (3,3) cannot move down to (3,2) because (3,2) is a kitchen counter. He can move right to (4,3)? But we don't know if (4,3) is empty. The kitchen counters are listed, and (4,3) is not in the list? Then it might be empty? Similarly, (3,4) is a kitchen counter, so he cannot move up? He is at (3,3). He can move left to (2,3)? (2,3) is not in the kitchen counter list? Then it's empty? Or is it a wall? We don't have walls listed. We only know the non-empty tiles (with items) and the tile types? \n\nThe problem gives the tile types: we know the positions of kitchen counters, dispensers, pots, serving counters. So any tile not in these lists is either an empty tile or a wall? But the problem doesn't mention walls. So we assume that any tile not in the provided lists is an empty tile? \n\nLooking at the provided lists:\n\n- Kitchen Counter: [list]\n- Tomato Dispenser: none\n- Onion Dispenser: [(2,4), (4,4)]\n- Plate Dispenser: [(0,2)]\n- Pot: [(2,0), (4,0)]\n- Serving Counter: [(6,2)]\n\nSo the grid has other tiles that are not mentioned? For example, (3,3) is not in any of these, so it must be an empty tile? Similarly, (4,3) is not in any list, so empty? (2,3) is not in any list? Then it's empty.\n\nSo Bob at (3,3) can:\n\n- Move left to (2,3) [L]\n- Then move down to (2,2) but (2,2) is a kitchen counter -> cannot walk on it.\n- Or move down to (2,2) is not allowed? So from (2,3) he can move down to (2,2)? No, because (2,2) is non-walkable.\n\nAlternatively, move right to (4,3) [R] (if (4,3) is empty), then down to (4,2) -> but (4,2) is a kitchen counter, so cannot. Then how to get to (4,0)? \n\nHe can go:\n\n(3,3) -> (4,3) [R] -> (5,3) [R]? But we don't know if (5,3) is empty. The kitchen counters are at (5,4) and (6,4) and (5,0) and (6,0). So (5,3) is not in the list, so empty? Then (5,3) is empty. Then (5,2)? Is (5,2) empty? It's not in the kitchen counter list? Then yes. Then (5,1)? Then (5,0) is kitchen counter -> cannot. Or (4,1)? \n\nActually, we need a path to (4,0). The pot is at (4,0). Adjacent tiles to the pot: (4,1) above, (3,0) left, (5,0) right? But (3,0) and (5,0) are kitchen counters? The list: (3,0) is kitchen counter, (5,0) is kitchen counter. So the only adjacent empty tile to (4,0) is (4,1)? \n\nIs (4,1) empty? It's not in any list? Then it's empty.\n\nSo Bob must get to (4,1) to interact with the pot at (4,0) (facing down).\n\nHow to get from (3,3) to (4,1)?\n\nOption:\n\n(3,3) -> (4,3) [R] -> (4,2) is non-walkable? (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> so he cannot move down to (4,2). Then he must go:\n\n(3,3) -> (4,3) [R] -> (5,3) [R] -> (5,2) [D] -> (5,1) [D] -> (4,1) [L]? Then he is at (4,1) and can face down to interact with the pot at (4,0).\n\nThat's 4 moves. Then interact. So total 5 turns for Bob to add one onion to the pot at (4,0).\n\nBut we have two onions to add? And we want to complete the pot at (4,0) and then also start the pot at (2,0).\n\nAlternatively, we can have Alice help with the pot at (4,0). Alice is at (2,1). She can go:\n\n(2,1) -> (3,1) [R]? (3,1) is not in any list -> empty. Then (4,1) [R] -> then she is at (4,1) and can interact with the pot at (4,0) (facing down). But she is holding nothing? So she can't add an onion. She must first pick up an onion.\n\nSo Alice could pick up the onion at (2,2) which is adjacent to her current position? She is at (2,1) and (2,2) is above? She is facing Up, so she can interact with (2,2) without moving? Then she would pick up the onion. Then she can go to (4,1) to add it to the pot? \n\nPath for Alice:\n\nTurn 65: Alice can Interact (to pick up onion from (2,2)) -> then she is holding an onion.\nThen she needs to go to (4,1). From (2,1) holding an onion: \n- Move right to (3,1) [R]\n- Move right to (4,1) [R] -> now at (4,1) and facing? She was facing Up when she picked up. Then she moved right twice? So after moving right twice, she is facing right? But to interact with the pot at (4,0) she needs to face down. So she must change orientation to down? Then interact.\n\nSo actions for Alice:\n\nt65: I (pick up onion from (2,2)) -> now holding onion.\nt66: R (to (3,1))\nt67: R (to (4,1)) -> now at (4,1), facing right? But we don't track orientation per step? We have to specify each action.\n\nAfter t67, she is at (4,1) and her orientation is right (because she moved right). So she must turn down to face (4,0). Then interact.\n\nt68: D (change orientation to down? But the action for changing orientation: we use the direction? The actions are U/D/L/R for move or change orientation? The problem says: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" and \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" \n\nSo to change orientation to down, we use the action 'D'? But 'D' is also for moving down. How to distinguish? The action set is {U, D, L, R, I, S}. And the description:\n\n- Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\n- Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\n\nBut note: the change orientation action only doesn't move if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty? Actually, the description is a bit ambiguous.\n\nIt says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nBut that doesn't make sense. Actually, it should be: the player changes orientation to the specified direction without moving, unless the adjacent tile in that direction is empty? \n\nBut the rule is: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> meaning if the adjacent tile in the direction of the change is not empty, then the player doesn't move? But that would be confusing.\n\nRe-read: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nI think it means: when you use a direction for changing orientation, you are trying to move? But that contradicts the separation. \n\nLooking back: \"Each player can: \n- Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. \n- Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThis is confusing. Actually, the way it's written, it seems that the \"Change Orientation\" action might be intended to be a separate action? But the action set is {U, D, L, R, I, S}. So how do we represent change orientation? \n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding. The action set is only six: U, D, L, R, I, S. And the description says:\n\n- Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\n\n- Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\n\nBut note: the same letters are used for two different things? That can't be. \n\nAlternatively, the action L/R/U/D can be either a move or a change orientation? The rule says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> meaning if you try to move but the adjacent tile is not empty, then you just change orientation? \n\nBut that would mean that when you use U, if the tile above is empty, you move and change orientation to U. If the tile above is not empty, you just change orientation to U without moving.\n\nSimilarly for D, L, R.\n\nSo the action U, D, L, R can result in either moving (if the adjacent tile in that direction is empty) or just changing orientation (if not).\n\nBut in the case of Alice at (2,1) facing Up. She wants to change orientation to down? How? She must use the action 'D'. But if she does 'D', then if the tile below (2,0) is empty? But (2,0) is a pot -> non-empty. So she cannot move there. So if she does 'D', she will change orientation to down without moving.\n\nSimilarly, if she is at (4,1) and facing right, and wants to face down, she does 'D'. Since the tile below (4,0) is non-empty (pot), she will not move and only change orientation to down.\n\nSo in summary, the actions U, D, L, R are:\n\n- If the adjacent tile in that direction is empty, then move and change orientation to that direction.\n- If not, then only change orientation to that direction.\n\nSo for Alice at (2,1) facing Up:\n\n- To pick up from (2,2): she is adjacent and facing Up? Yes, so she can do I to pick up the onion at (2,2).\n\nThen she is holding an onion. Now she wants to go to (4,1). She is at (2,1), facing Up.\n\n- To move right, she does R. But the tile to the right (3,1) is empty? Yes. So she moves to (3,1) and now faces right.\n- Then she does R again: from (3,1) to the right is (4,1) -> empty? Yes. So she moves to (4,1) and faces right.\n\nNow at (4,1) facing right. She wants to interact with the pot at (4,0) which is below. So she must face down. So she does D. Since the tile below (4,0) is non-empty (pot), she doesn't move and only changes orientation to down. Then she can do I to add the onion to the pot.\n\nSo Alice's actions:\n\nt65: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\nt66: R (move to (3,1), face right)\nt67: R (move to (4,1), face right)\nt68: D (change orientation to down, because (4,0) is non-empty -> no move, now facing down)\nt69: I (add onion to pot at (4,0))\n\nNow the pot at (4,0) had 1 onion, now has 2. Still needs one more.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can do something. Bob is at (3,3) facing Up. He can pick up the onion at (3,4) by doing I.\n\nThen he needs to go to the pot at (4,0) to add his onion. But we saw that the path is long? Alternatively, we can have him go to the pot at (2,0) which might be closer? \n\nBob at (3,3) facing Up:\n\nt65: I (pick up onion from (3,4))\n\nNow holding an onion. He can go to the pot at (2,0). How?\n\nThe pot at (2,0) is adjacent to (2,1) and (1,0) and (3,0). But (1,0) and (3,0) are kitchen counters? So only (2,1) is empty? But (2,1) is where Alice was, but Alice is moving away. So Bob can go to (2,1) and then face down to interact with the pot at (2,0).\n\nPath for Bob:\n\nFrom (3,3) holding an onion:\n- Move left to (2,3) [L] -> (2,3) is empty? Yes. So move to (2,3) and face left.\n- Then move down to (2,2) -> but (2,2) is a kitchen counter? Non-walkable? So cannot. Then how?\n\nHe must go: (3,3) -> (2,3) [L] -> (2,3) is empty. Then from (2,3) he can move down? (2,2) is non-walkable. So he must go to (1,3)? (1,3) is not in any list? Then empty. Then (1,2)? (1,2) is not in the kitchen counter list? The kitchen counters are at (0,3), (1,4), (0,0), etc. (1,2) is not listed -> empty. Then (1,1)? Then (1,0) is kitchen counter -> cannot. Or (2,1)? \n\n(2,1) is empty? Yes. So path:\n\n(3,3) -> (2,3) [L] -> (1,3) [L]? But (1,3) is adjacent? From (2,3) to (1,3) is left? Then (1,3) to (1,2) [D] (if (1,2) empty), then (1,2) to (1,1) [D]? (1,1) is not in any list -> empty. Then (1,1) to (2,1) [R]? But (2,1) is adjacent? Then at (2,1) he can face down to interact with the pot at (2,0).\n\nBut that is 4 moves. Then change orientation to down and interact.\n\nBut we have a closer pot? The pot at (4,0) is also available, but we are already having Alice go there. We can have Bob go to (4,0) as well? But the pot at (4,0) only needs one more onion after Alice adds hers.\n\nAfter Alice adds at t69, the pot at (4,0) will have 2 onions. Then Bob can add his to make it 3? But Bob is at (3,3) and it will take him at least 4 moves to get to (4,1) (as per earlier long path) and then interact. So:\n\nBob's path to (4,1):\n\nt65: I (pick up at (3,4))\nt66: R (to (4,3))\nt67: R (to (5,3))? But we don't know if (5,3) is empty? Assume it is.\nt68: D (to (5,2))? But (5,2) is not in the kitchen counter list? Then empty.\nt69: D (to (5,1))? Then t70: L (to (4,1)) -> at (4,1) facing left? Then he needs to face down: t71: D (change orientation to down) and then t72: I.\n\nThat's too long.\n\nAlternatively, after Alice adds her onion at t69, the pot at (4,0) has 2 onions. We need one more. But Bob is holding an onion and we can have him go to (4,1) to add it.\n\nBut the above path for Bob would take until t72 to add, which is too late.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can pick up an onion and then go to a kitchen counter to place it, and then someone else can use it? But that might not be efficient.\n\nAnother idea: since the pot at (4,0) will have 2 onions at t69, we can have Alice or Bob quickly get another onion and add it.\n\nBut Alice is at (4,1) at t69. She can go to a kitchen counter to get an onion? The closest kitchen counter with an onion is (4,2) which is adjacent? But (4,2) is a kitchen counter and has an onion. But Alice is at (4,1) and (4,2) is above? So she must face up and interact to pick up. But she is holding nothing? After she added the onion, she is holding nothing.\n\nSo at t69, Alice is at (4,1) facing down (after adding), holding nothing. She can do:\n\nt70: U (to change orientation to up? But if she does U, she would move to (4,2) if it were empty? But (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable? So she cannot move up. Therefore, doing U at (4,1) would only change her orientation to up. Then she can interact with (4,2) to pick up the onion? But (4,2) is adjacent and above? Yes, so she can pick up the onion from (4,2) by doing I.\n\nSo:\n\nt70: U (change orientation to up, because (4,2) is non-empty -> no move, now facing up)\nt71: I (pick up onion from (4,2))\n\nThen she can turn down (t72: D -> no move, facing down) and interact (t73: I) to add the onion to the pot at (4,0). Then the pot starts cooking at t73.\n\nBut then we have to wait 5 turns for cooking.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Bob bring the third onion. But Bob is at (3,3) and we are at t65. He can go to (4,2) to pick up the onion? But he is at (3,3) and (4,2) is not adjacent? He must move. But he is holding an onion already? So he cannot pick up another.\n\nSo Bob must first deliver his onion somewhere. He can go to the pot at (2,0) and add it there? Then we start a new soup.\n\nLet's reassess:\n\nWe have two pots. The pot at (4,0) has 1 onion. We can complete it with two more. The pot at (2,0) is empty.\n\nWe also have many onions on counters. We can use them.\n\nPlan A: Alice and Bob both work on the pot at (4,0) to complete it quickly.\n\nAlice: as above, picks up onion from (2,2) at t65, then moves to (4,1) by t67, then turns down at t68, adds at t69. Now the pot has 2 onions.\n\nThen Alice can immediately pick up the onion from (4,2) (which is very close) and add it. She does:\n\nt70: U (to face up) -> no move, facing up.\nt71: I (pick up onion from (4,2))\nt72: D (face down)\nt73: I (add to pot) -> now the pot at (4,0) has 3 onions and starts cooking at t73.\n\nThen the soup will be ready at t73+5 = t78.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can work on the pot at (2,0). He is at (3,3) facing Up at t65.\n\nt65: I (pick up onion from (3,4)) -> holding onion.\nThen he needs to go to the pot at (2,0). The closest empty tile adjacent to (2,0) is (2,1). So he must go to (2,1) and face down.\n\nPath to (2,1): \n- Move left to (2,3) [L] -> (2,3) is empty? Yes. Now at (2,3) facing left.\n- Move down to (2,2) -> cannot, because (2,2) is non-walkable.\n- So he must go: (2,3) -> (1,3) [L] -> (1,3) is empty.\n- (1,3) -> (1,2) [D] -> (1,2) empty.\n- (1,2) -> (1,1) [D] -> (1,1) empty.\n- (1,1) -> (2,1) [R] -> (2,1) empty.\n\nThat's 4 moves: L, D, D, R.\n\nActions for Bob:\n\nt65: I (pick up)\nt66: L (to (2,3), face left)\nt67: L (to (1,3), face left)\nt68: D (to (1,2), face down)\nt69: D (to (1,1), face down)\nt70: R (to (2,1), face right) -> now at (2,1) facing right? But he needs to face down to interact with (2,0). So:\nt71: D (change orientation to down) -> no move, facing down.\nt72: I (add onion to pot at (2,0)) -> now the pot at (2,0) has 1 onion.\n\nThen he needs to add two more.\n\nBut this is taking a long time. And we are only planning for 10 turns? From t65 to t74.\n\nWe might not have time to complete both pots.\n\nAlternative: after the pot at (4,0) is cooking (at t73), Alice can start working on the pot at (2,0). But we have to wait for the soup to cook.\n\nOr, while waiting, they can prepare the next soup.\n\nBut let's see the time: we are at t65. We want to plan for 10 turns: up to t74.\n\nBy t73, Alice has added the third onion to (4,0). The soup will be ready at t78, which is beyond our planning horizon.\n\nBut we can start serving it? Not until it's cooked.\n\nAlternatively, we can have only one soup delivered within the next 10 turns? But the soup at (4,0) won't be ready until t78.\n\nBut the pot at (4,0) had 1 onion at t65. When we add the second at t69, and the third at t73, it starts cooking at t73 and will be ready at t78.\n\nSo within 10 turns from t65 (up to t74), we won't deliver any soup? That is not good.\n\nBut we have another option: use the existing onions to complete the pot faster.\n\nFor example, the pot at (4,0) already has 1 onion. We need two more. There is an onion at (4,2) and also at (3,4) and others.\n\nBut to add them, we need players to carry them.\n\nAlice is close to (2,2) and (4,2). Bob is close to (3,4).\n\nSo Alice can add two onions to (4,0) quickly, as planned.\n\nBut can she add two onions by herself quickly?\n\nAlice at (2,1) at t65:\n\nt65: I (pick up (2,2))\nt66: R (to (3,1))\nt67: R (to (4,1))\nt68: D (face down)\nt69: I (add onion) -> now the pot has 2 onions.\n\nThen she is at (4,1) holding nothing. She can immediately pick up the onion at (4,2):\n\nt70: U (face up) -> no move\nt71: I (pick up onion from (4,2)) -> now holding onion.\nt72: D (face down)\nt73: I (add to pot) -> done.\n\nBut t73 is turn 73, and we are only planning up to turn 74? Then the soup starts cooking at t73, and we can't serve it within the next turn.\n\nBut we can have Bob, after picking up the onion at (3,4) at t65, go directly to (4,1) to add his onion? But the path is long. Or we can have him meet Alice halfway? Not efficient.\n\nAnother idea: after Alice adds the first onion at t69, she is at (4,1) holding nothing. Bob is at (3,3) holding an onion. He can go to (4,3) and then drop the onion on a kitchen counter? But the only kitchen counters nearby are occupied or not?\n\nFor example, at (4,2) is a kitchen counter but it has an onion, so it's occupied? You can only place on an empty kitchen counter. But the kitchen counter at (4,2) is occupied, so he cannot place there.\n\nHe could go to (3,2) which is a kitchen counter? But it has an onion? The list says kitchen counter on (3,2) contains an onion? The non-empty kitchen counters are listed, and (3,2) is not in the non-empty list? Wait, the non-empty kitchen counters are:\n\n\"Kitchen Counter on (6, 1): contains a onion; \nKitchen Counter on (2, 2): contains a onion; \nKitchen Counter on (6, 3): contains a onion; \nKitchen Counter on (0, 3): contains a onion; \nKitchen Counter on (4, 2): contains a onion; \nKitchen Counter on (1, 4): contains a onion; \nKitchen Counter on (3, 4): contains a onion;\"\n\nSo (3,2) is not listed as non-empty? Then it is empty? So Bob can place his onion on (3,2).\n\nBut (3,2) is a kitchen counter tile, and it is empty, so he can place an item there.\n\nHow? He must be on an adjacent empty tile and facing it. He is at (3,3) holding an onion. (3,2) is below him. So he can face down and interact to place the onion on (3,2).\n\nSo Bob's actions:\n\nt65: I (pick up from (3,4)) -> holding onion.\nt66: D (face down) -> because (3,2) is below, and it's non-empty? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter tile, and it's empty? The tile type is non-empty? But the item on it is empty? The rule: \"non-empty tile\" in the context of walking? For interaction, you can interact with a kitchen counter regardless of whether it has an item or not? But to place an item, the counter must be empty.\n\nSo at t66: Bob does D to change orientation to down (since (3,2) is non-walkable, so he doesn't move, only faces down).\nt67: I (places the onion on (3,2)) -> now he is holding nothing.\n\nThen the onion is on (3,2) kitchen counter.\n\nThen Alice, after adding her first onion at t69, can go to (3,2) to pick up that onion? She is at (4,1) holding nothing.\n\nShe can:\nt70: L (move left to (3,1)) -> empty, face left.\nt71: U (move up to (3,2)? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable? So she cannot move there. She must be on an adjacent empty tile and facing it. The empty tile adjacent to (3,2) are (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), (4,2). (2,2) and (4,2) are kitchen counters and non-walkable? (3,1) and (3,3) are empty.\n\nSo Alice at (4,1) can:\nt70: L ( to (3,1), face left)\nt71: U ( to change orientation to up? Because (3,2) is above (3,1). But if she does U, she would move to (3,2) if it were empty? But it's not walkable. So she only changes orientation to up.\nt72: I (pick up the onion from (3,2))\nt73: then she can go back to (4,1) to add it? \nt73: R ( to (4,1), face right)\nt74: D (face down)\nt75: I (add) -> too late.\n\nSo within 10 turns, we can't complete the soup.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best is to start the soup at (4,0) and have it cook while we work on the next.\n\nBut within 10 turns, we won't deliver any soup. So the reward is 0 for the next 10 turns.\n\nBut that is not productive. Maybe we can work on the pot at (2,0) and have it cook sooner? The pot at (2,0) is empty. If we add three onions quickly, it will cook in 5 turns.\n\nFor example, if we add three onions by t70, then it cooks until t75, and then we can serve at t75 or later.\n\nBut can we add three onions to (2,0) by t70?\n\nAlice is at (2,1) at t65. She can add one onion quickly from (2,2).\n\nt65: I (pick up onion from (2,2)) -> holding onion.\nt66: D (face down) -> because (2,0) is below, and non-empty, so only change orientation to down.\nt67: I (add onion to (2,0)) -> now the pot has 1 onion.\n\nThen she is holding nothing. She can pick up another onion. The closest is (2,2) but she just took it, and it's empty? The kitchen counter at (2,2) had an onion, and she took it, so now it's empty. So no onion there.\n\nNext closest: (1,4) or (3,4) or (0,3) etc. Far.\n\nBob can add one. Bob at (3,3) can pick up the onion at (3,4) at t65: I.\nThen he can go to (2,1) to add it to the pot at (2,0) as before, but it takes until t72.\n\nNot by t70.\n\nAlternatively, use the onion at (4,2) for the pot at (2,0)? But it's far.\n\nSo it seems difficult to complete a soup within 10 turns.\n\nPerhaps the only thing we can do is to prepare for future soups.\n\nBut the task is to maximize the reward from delivered recipes within the planned turns. Since no soup can be delivered in the next 10 turns, any action that contributes to future soups is good.\n\nSo the best is to complete the pot at (4,0) so that it starts cooking, and then it will be ready soon after.\n\nAlice can add two onions to (4,0) as in the first plan, and Bob can add one onion to the pot at (2,0) or start on it.\n\nBut let's have Bob work on the pot at (2,0) to add one onion, so that we have two pots with some onions.\n\nAlice's actions (for the next 10 turns, t65 to t74):\n\nt65: I (pick up from (2,2))\nt66: R ( to (3,1))\nt67: R ( to (4,1))\nt68: D ( face down)\nt69: I ( add to (4,0)) -> now 2 onions in (4,0)\nt70: U ( face up)\nt71: I ( pick up from (4,2)) -> holding onion\nt72: D ( face down)\nt73: I ( add to (4,0)) -> now 3 onions, starts cooking at t73.\nt74: S (stay) or anything, since the soup is cooking.\n\nBob's actions (we are not required to plan for Bob, but we can suggest or assume he will be controlled similarly. But the question is to plan for Alice. So we only output Alice's actions.\n\nThe answer format is only for Alice: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice\".\n\nSo for Alice, the above actions from t65 to t73, and then t74.\n\nBut t74 is the 10th turn? From t65 to t74 is 10 turns: t65, t66, t67, t68, t69, t70, t71, t72, t73, t74.\n\nSo 10 actions.\n\nAt t74, she is at (4,1) holding nothing, facing down. She can stay or do something else, but there's nothing urgent. She can for example go to a plate dispenser to get a plate for when the soup is ready, but the plate dispenser is at (0,2), far away. Or she can help with the other pot.\n\nSo for t74, she can stay or start moving towards the other pot.\n\nBut to keep it simple, we can have her stay.\n\nSo Alice's actions:\n\nt65: I\nt66: R\nt67: R\nt68: D\nt69: I\nt70: U\nt71: I\nt72: D\nt73: I\nt74: S\n\nThis completes the soup in the pot at (4,0) at t73, and it will be ready at t78.\n\nThen after our planning horizon, they can serve it.\n\nSo this seems the best we can do.\n\nBut let's confirm the orientations and positions.\n\n- t65: Alice at (2,1) facing Up. Interact: picks up onion from (2,2) (above her). Now holding onion.\n- t66: R: move right to (3,1), now facing right.\n- t67: R: move right to (4,1), now facing right.\n- t68: D: since (4,0) is below and non-empty, she doesn't move, only changes orientation to down.\n- t69: I: add onion to (4,0). Now holding nothing.\n- t70: U: to change orientation to up (since (4,2) is above and non-empty, so only changes to up, no move.\n- t71: I: pick up onion from (4,2) (above her). Now holding onion.\n- t72: D: change orientation to down (no move).\n- t73: I: add onion to (4,0). Now holding nothing.\n- t74: S: stay.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this is the plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice should prioritize completing the pot at (4, 0) with three onions to start cooking a soup, which will yield a reward of 20 after 5 turns of cooking. The pot at (4, 0) already contains 1 onion, so Alice needs to add two more onions. She can efficiently use the onion on the kitchen counter at (2, 2) and then the onion at (4, 2) to minimize movement and actions. \n\nAlice starts at (2, 1) facing Up, holding nothing. The plan leverages her proximity to these onions and the pot at (4, 0). Bob is not directly controlled in this plan, but he can independently contribute (e.g., by adding an onion to the pot at (2, 0) or fetching plates for future serving).\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence (turns 65 to 74):\n- **Turn 65 (t65):** Interact (I) to pick up the onion from the kitchen counter at (2, 2) (adjacent and facing Up). Now holding an onion.\n- **Turn 66 (t66):** Move right (R) to (3, 1), now facing right.\n- **Turn 67 (t67):** Move right (R) to (4, 1), now facing right.\n- **Turn 68 (t68):** Change orientation down (D) (since the pot at (4, 0) is below and non-empty, no move occurs; now facing down).\n- **Turn 69 (t69):** Interact (I) to add the onion to the pot at (4, 0). Pot now has 2 onions. Now holding nothing.\n- **Turn 70 (t70):** Change orientation up (U) (since the kitchen counter at (4, 2) is above and non-empty, no move occurs; now facing up).\n- **Turn 71 (t71):** Interact (I) to pick up the onion from the kitchen counter at (4, 2). Now holding an onion.\n- **Turn 72 (t72):** Change orientation down (D) (to face the pot at (4, 0); no move occurs.\n- **Turn 73 (t73):** Interact (I) to add the onion to the pot at (4, 0). Pot now has 3 onions and starts cooking (will be ready at turn 78).\n- **Turn 74 (t74):** Stay (S) as no urgent action is needed; Alice can prepare for serving (e.g., move toward the plate dispenser at (0, 2) in subsequent turns).\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Completes Soup Cooking:** By turn 73, the pot at (4, 0) is filled and cooking starts, enabling a reward of 20 at turn 78.\n- **Efficiency:** Uses nearby onions on counters (2, 2) and (4, 2) to avoid trips to dispensers. Minimal movement (only 2 tiles) and no idle turns.\n- **Coordination with Bob:** Bob can focus on the pot at (2, 0) (e.g., picking up an onion from (3, 4) or other counters to add ingredients) or fetch plates from (0, 2) for future serving. This division of labor optimizes overall progress.\n- **Reward Timeline:** No soup is delivered within turns 65–74 due to cooking time, but this sets up a delivery at turn 78, maximizing future reward within the planning horizon.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 65: \\text{I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 66: \\text{R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 67: \\text{R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 68: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 69: \\text{I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 70: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 71: \\text{I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 72: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 73: \\text{I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 74: \\text{S}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 68. The goal is to maximize the total reward by delivering soups. The only recipe available is 3 onions, which gives 20 reward and takes 5 turns to cook.\n\nCurrent state:\n- Alice: at (2,1), facing down (D), holding nothing.\n- Bob: at (2,3), facing up (U), holding one onion.\n\nKitchen counters have onions at: (6,1), (6,3), (0,3), (4,2), (1,4), (3,4). That's 6 onions on counters.\n\nPots:\n- (4,0): 1 onion (so needs 2 more)\n- (2,0): 1 onion (so needs 2 more)\n\nThere are no tomato dispensers, and the only recipe is 3 onions.\n\nPlan:\nWe need to get both pots to have 3 onions each so they can cook and then serve the soups.\n\nSteps:\n1. Bob is holding an onion. He is at (2,3) facing up. The pot at (2,0) is at the same x=2 but above. However, Bob is at y=3 and the pot is at y=0. He is facing up, so he can move towards the pot.\n\n   But note: Bob is at (2,3). He can move up to (2,4)? But (2,4) is not a kitchen counter? Actually, the kitchen counters are at (0,0), (1,0), ... etc. We have a list: \n   Kitchen Counter: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (3, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (0, 1), (6, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (0, 3), (6, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (3, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4)]\n\n   (2,2) is a kitchen counter. Also, note that (2,3) is not a kitchen counter? Actually, the grid is defined by the tile types. We have to be careful about the layout.\n\n   Let me map the grid:\n\n   The x from 0 to 6, y from 0 to 4.\n\n   Important: The pot at (2,0) and (4,0). The serving counter is at (6,2). The onion dispensers are at (2,4) and (4,4) but note: (2,4) is an onion dispenser? The list says Onion Dispenser: [(2,4), (4,4)]. But (2,4) is a dispenser, not a kitchen counter? And the kitchen counter at (2,2) is at the same x as the pot (2,0) but at y=2.\n\n   Bob at (2,3) facing up. He is facing (2,4) which is an onion dispenser? But he is holding an onion already. He cannot pick up another because he is already holding one. So he should not interact with the dispenser.\n\n   Instead, Bob should go to a pot to put his onion. The nearest pot? He can go to the pot at (2,0) or (4,0). However, the pot at (2,0) already has one onion and needs two more. Bob can put his onion in that pot? But to do that he must be adjacent and facing the pot.\n\n   How to get to (2,0)? From (2,3) to (2,0): he must move down three times: D, D, D. But note: there is a kitchen counter at (2,2). That is not walkable? Because non-empty tiles (like kitchen counters) are not walkable? The rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" And kitchen counters are non-empty? Actually, the rule says the tile types: kitchen counter is one of them. And the rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So a kitchen counter is a non-empty tile? But note: the tile type is kitchen counter, and it may or may not have an item. The rule says: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and it is listed as a tile type. But the movement rule: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" Here \"non-empty\" might refer to the state? Actually, the rule says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through each other\" and \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles\". So non-empty tiles are those that are not empty? And the empty tile is defined as walkable. So only empty tiles are walkable? \n\n   Let me check: \n   - Empty Tile: Walkable space.\n   - Other tiles (Dispensers, Pot, Serving Counter, Kitchen Counter) are non-empty? Because they are not empty. So they are not walkable.\n\n   Therefore, Bob cannot walk through (2,2) because it's a kitchen counter (non-empty tile). So he cannot go directly from (2,3) to (2,2) to (2,1) to (2,0). \n\n   Alternative: Bob must go around? The layout:\n\n   Let me sketch the grid:\n\n   y=4: [ (0,4): kitchen counter, (1,4): kitchen counter (with onion), (2,4): onion dispenser, (3,4): kitchen counter (with onion), (4,4): onion dispenser, (5,4): kitchen counter, (6,4): kitchen counter ]\n   y=3: [ (0,3): kitchen counter (with onion), ... (6,3): kitchen counter (with onion) ]\n   y=2: [ (0,2): plate dispenser, (1,2): ? (not listed as non-empty, so empty?), (2,2): kitchen counter, (3,2): kitchen counter, (4,2): kitchen counter (with onion), (5,2): ? (empty?), (6,2): serving counter ]\n   y=1: [ (0,1): kitchen counter, (1,1): ? (empty?), (2,1): Alice, (3,1): ? (empty?), (4,1): ? (empty?), (5,1): ? (empty?), (6,1): kitchen counter (with onion) ]\n   y=0: [ (0,0): kitchen counter, (1,0): kitchen counter, (2,0): pot (with 1 onion), (3,0): kitchen counter, (4,0): pot (with 1 onion), (5,0): kitchen counter, (6,0): kitchen counter ]\n\n   So the walkable tiles are the ones not listed in any non-empty type? We have to assume that any tile not listed as one of the non-empty types is empty and walkable.\n\n   Bob at (2,3). He cannot go down because (2,2) is a kitchen counter. He can go left? (1,3): is it empty? The kitchen counters at y=3 are only (0,3) and (6,3). So (1,3) is empty? Similarly, (3,3) is empty? Then he can go left to (1,3) and then down? \n\n   But note: he is facing up. To move left, he must change orientation to left? Or we can change orientation and move in the same turn? Actually, the actions: \n   - Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. So if he moves left, he goes to (1,3) and faces left.\n   - Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): Only changes orientation without moving, but only if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty? Actually, the rule says: \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" So to change orientation without moving, the adjacent tile in the new direction must be non-empty? Actually, no: the rule says \"Change Orientation: No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" That seems ambiguous.\n\n   Let me re-read: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" \n\n   I think it means: if you try to change orientation to a direction, and the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty, then you don't move? But that doesn't make sense because changing orientation shouldn't move. \n\n   Actually, I think it's a typo? The move action says: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" and then the change orientation says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" \n\n   I think the intention is: \n   - When you choose a direction for changing orientation, you are only changing your orientation to that direction, and you don't move. But the condition about the adjacent tile is confusing.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the rule is that if you try to change orientation to a direction and the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty, then you cannot change to that orientation? That doesn't make sense.\n\n   I think it's better to assume that changing orientation does not require any condition on the adjacent tile. The rule might be misstated. So I'll assume that changing orientation is always possible regardless of the adjacent tile.\n\n   So Bob can change his orientation to down (D) without moving. Then he can move down? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter, so he cannot move down. So he must go around.\n\n   How about:\n   Bob at (2,3) facing up. He can move left to (1,3) (and face left). Then from (1,3) he can move down to (1,2). Is (1,2) walkable? We don't have any non-empty tile at (1,2) (the kitchen counters at y=2 are (0,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), and (6,2) is serving counter). So (1,2) should be empty. Then he can move down to (1,1) (which is empty) and then to (1,0) (but (1,0) is a kitchen counter? It's listed, so non-empty -> not walkable). So he cannot go to (1,0). \n\n   Alternatively, from (1,2) he can move right to (2,2)? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter -> not walkable.\n\n   Another route: from (2,3) move right to (3,3) (empty) and then down to (3,2) -> but (3,2) is a kitchen counter? Yes, so not walkable.\n\n   So Bob cannot get to the pots at (2,0) and (4,0) directly? But that doesn't make sense because the level must be traversable.\n\n   Let me check the grid again: \n   The pots are at (2,0) and (4,0). The only way to access them is from the sides? \n\n   For the pot at (2,0): adjacent tiles are (1,0) [kitchen counter, non-empty], (3,0) [kitchen counter], (2,1) [empty?]. (2,1) is not listed as a non-empty tile? So (2,1) is empty? Then Bob can go to (2,1) and then interact with the pot at (2,0) by facing down? \n\n   Similarly, for (4,0): adjacent are (3,0) [kitchen counter], (5,0) [kitchen counter], and (4,1) [empty?].\n\n   So Bob can get to (2,1) and then interact with (2,0) by facing down? But note: to interact, he must be on an empty tile adjacent to the target and facing it. So if he is at (2,1) and facing down, then (2,0) is adjacent and he is facing it.\n\n   How to get to (2,1)? Bob is at (2,3). He must go around the kitchen counter at (2,2). \n\n   Path for Bob:\n   - Move left to (1,3) -> now at (1,3), facing left.\n   - Move down to (1,2) -> now at (1,2), facing down? Actually, when he moves down, he changes orientation to down? Yes, because move changes orientation too.\n   - Then move down to (1,1) -> now at (1,1), facing down.\n   - Then move right to (2,1) -> now at (2,1), facing right? But we want him to face down to interact with the pot at (2,0). So he might need to change orientation to down.\n\n   Alternatively, from (1,2) move right to (2,2)? But (2,2) is non-empty -> cannot move.\n\n   So from (1,1) to (2,1) is possible.\n\n   Then at (2,1) he can change orientation to down (if he isn't already facing down) and then interact to put the onion in the pot at (2,0).\n\n   But note: Alice is currently at (2,1). So Bob cannot move to (2,1) because Alice is there? The rule: \"Players cannot walk onto/through each other.\" So Bob cannot move to (2,1) if Alice is there.\n\n   Therefore, we must coordinate: Alice should move away from (2,1) to let Bob use it.\n\n   Alternatively, Bob can go to (3,1) and then to (4,1) and then interact with the pot at (4,0) by facing down? But the pot at (4,0) already has one onion and needs two more. And Bob is holding one onion.\n\n   But note: Alice is at (2,1). She can also help.\n\n   Let's consider both players.\n\n   We have two pots that need 2 onions each. We also have Bob holding one onion and several onions on counters. We need to get 4 more onions (2 for each pot) to complete the two soups.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Option 1: \n   - Alice moves to a location to get an onion and put it in a pot.\n   - Bob goes to the other pot to put his onion.\n\n   But Bob is blocked by Alice at (2,1). So Alice should move.\n\n   Alice is at (2,1) facing down. She can move:\n   - Left: (1,1) -> empty? Yes.\n   - Right: (3,1) -> empty? Yes.\n   - Down: (2,0) -> pot, non-empty -> cannot move down.\n   - Up: (2,2) -> kitchen counter, non-empty -> cannot move up.\n\n   So Alice can move left to (1,1) or right to (3,1).\n\n   If Alice moves left to (1,1), then Bob can then come to (2,1) and put his onion in the pot at (2,0).\n\n   Then the pot at (2,0) will have 2 onions (needs one more). The pot at (4,0) has 1 onion (needs two more).\n\n   Then we need to get two more onions for (2,0) and two for (4,0).\n\n   Alternatively, we can have Bob go to the pot at (4,0) and Alice go to the pot at (2,0) after getting an onion.\n\n   But currently, Alice is holding nothing. She can pick up an onion from a kitchen counter? The counters have onions at: (6,1), (6,3), (0,3), (4,2), (1,4), (3,4). \n\n   The closest onion to Alice? She is at (2,1). The onion at (4,2) is at (4,2) (which is a kitchen counter). To get it, she must be adjacent and facing it. (4,2) is two steps right and one up from (2,1). But there is a kitchen counter at (3,2) and (4,2) is at (4,2). So she can go to (3,1) then to (4,1) and then face up to interact with (4,2)? But (4,2) is above (4,1). So if she is at (4,1) and facing up, she can interact to pick up the onion from (4,2). \n\n   Similarly, Bob, after putting his onion, can go get another onion.\n\n   But note: we have onions on counters, so we don't necessarily need to go to the dispensers.\n\n   Plan:\n\n   Step 1: Alice moves to free up (2,1) for Bob? Or Alice goes to get an onion? \n\n   Since Bob is holding an onion and is blocked, it's better to let Bob put his onion first. So:\n\n   Turn 68: \n   - Alice moves left to (1,1) (action: L). Then she is at (1,1) facing left? (Because move left changes orientation to left).\n   - Bob: currently at (2,3) facing up. He needs to go to (2,1). But now Alice has moved, so (2,1) is free. But Bob is at (2,3) and cannot go down because of (2,2). So he must go via (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> but (1,1) is now occupied by Alice? \n\n   Alternatively, Bob can go via the right: \n   - Bob moves right to (3,3) (action: R). Then he is at (3,3) facing right.\n   - Then he moves down to (3,2)? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> not walkable. So he cannot.\n\n   So Bob must go left: \n   - Bob moves left to (1,3) (action: L). Then at (1,3) facing left.\n   - Then Bob moves down to (1,2) (action: D). Then at (1,2) facing down.\n   - Then Bob moves down to (1,1)? But at turn 68, Alice is moving to (1,1). So at the same turn? But they move simultaneously? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob). But note: the problem says \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\" meaning we are controlling both? Or only Alice? \n\n   The task: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we are to plan for both? But the answer format only shows actions for one? \n\n   Let me read: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". And the answer format only has one set of turns. So I think we are only planning for Alice? But then how to coordinate? \n\n   The problem says: \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\". But in the answer format, we are only outputting Alice's actions? \n\n   The task: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\" and then the answer format has \"Turn t: a_t\", which is for Alice? But it says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\" meaning we might also output Bob's actions? The answer format doesn't specify. \n\n   But the example output only has one action per turn. \n\n   Re-read: \"plan a sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=1}^{H-1}\\) for Alice (and optionally Bob)\".\n\n   The notation is for one sequence? But it says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\" meaning we are to plan for both? Then the answer should have two actions per turn? But the format doesn't show that.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might assume that we are only controlling Alice and Bob is controlled by another agent? But then we have to predict Bob's behavior? The problem says: \"based on the current game state and action history of both players\". And we are to maximize the reward. \n\n   However, the task says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". The \"optionally\" suggests we might not control Bob. But without controlling Bob, we cannot guarantee coordination.\n\n   Given the ambiguity, I think we are only to plan for Alice, and we have to assume that Bob will act reasonably? Or we can use the action history to predict Bob's next move? \n\n   Bob's action history: U, I, L, U, I. The most recent is I (interact). He is at (2,3) holding an onion. What did he interact with? The last action was I. Since he is at (2,3) and facing up, he must have tried to interact with (2,4) (onion dispenser) but he is holding an onion so that would fail? Or maybe he put an onion on a counter? But the counters at (2,3) are not adjacent? He is at (2,3) and facing up, so he is adjacent to (2,4) (onion dispenser) and (1,3) and (3,3) but those are empty? And (2,2) is below. \n\n   Actually, he could have interacted with the kitchen counter at (2,2) if he were facing down? But he is facing up. So his interact at (2,3) facing up: he would be interacting with (2,4) (onion dispenser). Since he is holding an onion, he cannot pick up another, so the interact fails? Or he could have placed the onion on a counter? But the rule: interact with a dispenser: only grab if empty-handed. So he cannot grab. Interact with a kitchen counter? But he is not facing a kitchen counter. He is facing (2,4) which is a dispenser. So the interact fails.\n\n   The action before that: U (move up). He was at (2,2) and moved up to (2,3)? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter, so he couldn't have been on it. So the history might be from previous positions.\n\n   Given the complexity, I think we have to assume that we are only planning for Alice, and we have to hope that Bob will cooperate. But the problem says \"collaborate\", so we can assume Bob is also trying to maximize the reward? \n\n   Alternatively, the problem might allow us to plan for both. But the answer format doesn't accommodate two actions. \n\n   I think the intended task is to plan only for Alice, but in the context of the environment and Bob's actions. We have to make a plan for Alice that is robust to Bob's actions or assumes Bob will act optimally.\n\n   Given the time, let me propose a plan for Alice that tries to complete the soups.\n\n   We need to fill the pots. Alice can go get an onion from a counter and put it in a pot.\n\n   The closest onion on a counter to Alice (at (2,1)):\n   - (4,2): at (4,2) -> distance: |4-2|+|2-1| = 2+1=3 steps (if she goes right twice and up once, but then she must be at (4,1) and facing up to interact). But note: she cannot go up from (2,1) to (2,2) because it's a kitchen counter. So she must go right to (3,1), then to (4,1) (2 moves), then change orientation to up (if not already) and interact to pick up the onion at (4,2). Then she can go to a pot.\n\n   The pots are at (2,0) and (4,0). She is at (4,1) holding an onion. She can then face down to interact with the pot at (4,0) to put the onion. That would make the pot at (4,0) have 2 onions (needs one more).\n\n   Meanwhile, Bob is holding an onion. We hope he will put it in a pot. The nearest pot to him is (2,0) but he is blocked by the counter at (2,2) and Alice was at (2,1) but she moved. Now Alice is at (4,1) after a few turns. So (2,1) is free. Bob can go to (2,1) and put the onion in (2,0) by facing down.\n\n   But how many turns for Alice to get the onion and put it in the pot at (4,0):\n   - Turn 68: Alice moves right to (3,1) [action: R]\n   - Turn 69: Alice moves right to (4,1) [action: R] -> now at (4,1), facing right? But she needs to face up to interact with (4,2). So she must change orientation to up. But the action set doesn't have a separate change orientation without move? Actually, the actions are: Move (which changes orientation) or Change Orientation (which is a separate action) or Interact or Stay.\n\n   So:\n   - Turn 68: Alice moves right to (3,1) [R] -> now at (3,1), facing right.\n   - Turn 69: Alice moves right to (4,1) [R] -> now at (4,1), facing right. But she needs to face up to interact with (4,2). So she must do a Change Orientation to up? That is action 'U' but not move? The actions are: U (move up), D (move down), etc. How to represent change orientation without move? \n\n   The action list: {U, D, L, R, I, S}. There is no separate change orientation. \n\n   Re-read the actions:\n\n   - **Move** (L/R/U/D): Changes position *and* orientation.\n   - **Change Orientation** (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.  -> but how is this represented? It's the same letter? \n\n   So the action 'U' can mean either move up or change orientation to up? But it depends on whether the adjacent tile in that direction is empty? \n\n   The rule for change orientation: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" \n\n   This means: if you do an action 'U' (for example), then if the adjacent tile in the up direction is not empty, you don't move (and only change orientation). If it is empty, then you move up? \n\n   But that's not what the rule says for move. The move action says: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" \n\n   So it seems there is only one type of action for direction: \n   - If you are on an empty tile and the adjacent tile in that direction is empty, then you move to that tile and change orientation to that direction.\n   - If the adjacent tile is not empty, then you only change orientation to that direction.\n\n   So in effect, the same action (U/D/L/R) can result in either a move or just a orientation change.\n\n   Therefore, for Alice at (4,1) facing right, if she does 'U' (which is move up), then since (4,2) is a kitchen counter (non-empty), she cannot move up. So she only changes orientation to up. \n\n   Then she can interact with (4,2) to pick up the onion.\n\n   So plan for Alice:\n\n   Turn 68: R (move right to (3,1), facing right)\n   Turn 69: R (move right to (4,1), facing right)\n   Turn 70: U (since (4,2) is non-empty, she doesn't move, but changes orientation to up)\n   Turn 71: I (interact with (4,2) to pick up the onion) -> now holding an onion.\n   Turn 72: D (to change orientation to down, because she is facing up and (4,0) is below. But note: at (4,1) facing down, she can interact with the pot at (4,0) below her? Yes. But first she must change orientation to down. How? She can do a 'D' action. Since (4,0) is non-empty (pot), she won't move, but will change orientation to down.\n   Turn 73: I (interact with (4,0) to put the onion) -> now the pot at (4,0) has 2 onions.\n\n   Then she can go get another onion.\n\n   But meanwhile, we hope Bob will put his onion in the pot at (2,0). If Bob does that, then both pots will have 2 onions. Then we need one more onion for each.\n\n   Alice can then go get another onion from a counter and put it in one pot, and Bob get one for the other.\n\n   But let's see the state after turn 73 (which is turn 68+5=73).\n\n   The pot at (4,0) will have 2 onions. The pot at (2,0) might have 2 onions if Bob put his onion. But we don't control Bob.\n\n   Alternatively, Alice can try to get another onion for the same pot to complete it.\n\n   But the pot at (4,0) now has 2 onions. It needs one more. Alice is at (4,1) facing down, holding nothing (after putting the onion). She can go get another onion and put it in (4,0). \n\n   The closest onion? (4,2) has an onion? She just picked it up, so it's gone? The state says the kitchen counter on (4,2) contains an onion, but after she picks it up, it's gone. So she has to go to another counter.\n\n   The next closest onion might be at (3,4) or (1,4), etc. That's far.\n\n   Or at (6,1) or (6,3). \n\n   Alternatively, she can go to the onion dispenser? But there are no tomato dispensers, but there are onion dispensers at (2,4) and (4,4). She can go to (4,4) to get an onion? But she is at (4,1). She can move up to (4,2)? But (4,2) is a kitchen counter, not walkable. So she must go around.\n\n   From (4,1) she can move right to (5,1) (empty?) and then up to (5,2) (empty? because kitchen counters are at (5,0) and (5,4), so (5,2) is empty) and then to (5,3) (empty) and then to (5,4) (kitchen counter? it is listed -> non-empty, cannot walk). Or from (5,2) she can move left to (4,2)? -> not walkable.\n\n   Alternatively, from (4,1) move left to (3,1), then to (3,0)? not walkable. Then up? (3,1) to (3,2) -> not walkable.\n\n   This is getting complicated.\n\n   Given the complexity, and that we only plan for Alice, let's focus on one pot.\n\n   After Alice puts the onion in (4,0) at turn 73, the pot has 2 onions. She can then immediately go to get another onion to complete it.\n\n   The nearest source: \n   - The kitchen counter at (6,1) is at (6,1). She is at (4,1). She can move right to (5,1) (if empty) and then to (6,1). But (6,1) is a kitchen counter, non-empty -> not walkable. So she must be at (5,1) or (6,0) or (6,2) to interact? But (6,2) is serving counter.\n\n   To interact with (6,1): she must be adjacent and facing it. Adjacent tiles to (6,1): (5,1), (6,0), (6,2), and (7,1) [out of bounds]. So only (5,1), (6,0), (6,2) are candidates.\n\n   (6,0) is a kitchen counter -> not walkable.\n   (6,2) is serving counter -> not walkable.\n   So only (5,1) is available.\n\n   She can go to (5,1) and face right to interact with (6,1)? But (6,1) is to the right of (5,1). So if she is at (5,1) and facing right, she can interact with (6,1) to pick up the onion.\n\n   Steps from (4,1) to (5,1): one move right.\n\n   Then she can interact to get the onion.\n\n   Then she can go back to (4,1) and put the onion in the pot at (4,0).\n\n   So:\n   Turn 74: R (move to (5,1), facing right)\n   Turn 75: I (interact with (6,1) to pick up the onion) -> holding onion\n   Turn 76: L (change orientation to left? Or move left? If she does 'L', then since (4,1) is to the left and empty? (5,1) to (4,1) is left. The tile (4,1) is empty? Yes. So if she does 'L', she will move left to (4,1) and face left. But we want her to be at (4,1) facing down to interact with the pot. So at (4,1) she can then do 'D' to face down (without moving, because below is non-empty) and then interact.\n\n   Alternatively, after picking up the onion at turn 75, at (5,1) facing right, she can do 'L' to change orientation to left (without moving, because the left is (4,1) which is empty? But the rule: if she does 'L', since the adjacent tile to the left (4,1) is empty, she would move left to (4,1) and face left? \n\n   So then turn 76: L -> move to (4,1) and face left.\n   Turn 77: D -> change orientation to down (without moving, because down is (4,0) non-empty) -> now facing down.\n   Turn 78: I -> interact to put onion in pot (4,0). Now the pot has 3 onions and cooking starts.\n\n   But we are at turn 78 (68+10). The cooking takes 5 turns, so at turn 83 the soup is ready. Then we need to serve it.\n\n   But the plan is only for H turns? We don't know H. But we can plan until she delivers the soup? But the problem says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\". We can choose H.\n\n   Given the complexity, and that we are only planning for Alice, let's output a plan for the next 10 turns (H=10) for Alice.\n\n   But note: we are at turn 68, and we have to start from turn 68.\n\n   Alternative plan: after Alice frees (2,1) by moving away, Bob might be able to put his onion in (2,0). Then Alice can go to (2,0) to add an onion? But she is not holding one.\n\n   Given the time, I'll go with the first plan for Alice to fill the pot at (4,0) to 3 onions.\n\n   But the initial move: she needs to move away from (2,1) to let Bob use it. In the first step, if she moves left to (1,1), then Bob might be able to come to (2,1) and put the onion. Then Alice can go get an onion for the same pot.\n\n   Let's try that:\n\n   Turn 68: Alice moves left to (1,1) [action: L] -> now at (1,1), facing left.\n   Then she can go to get an onion from a counter. The closest is (0,3)? That's far. Or (1,4) is at (1,4) (kitchen counter with onion). To get to (1,4) from (1,1): move up to (1,2) [action: U] (if (1,2) is empty) -> then to (1,3) [U] -> then at (1,3) she can face up to interact with (1,4) which is above? But (1,4) is at (1,4) and she is at (1,3). So she can interact.\n\n   Steps:\n   - Turn 68: L (move to (1,1), face left)\n   - Turn 69: U (move to (1,2), face up) [assuming (1,2) is empty]\n   - Turn 70: U (move to (1,3), face up)\n   - Turn 71: U (since (1,4) is non-empty, she doesn't move, but changes orientation to up? But she is already facing up. So she stays facing up? Or does she try to move and fail? Anyway, she can then interact.\n   - Turn 72: I (pick up onion from (1,4)) -> holding onion.\n\n   Then she can go to the pot at (2,0) to put the onion. But to put it, she must be at (2,1) facing down. \n\n   From (1,3) she can move right to (2,3) [action: R] -> but (2,3) might be occupied by Bob? Bob is at (2,3) initially. If Bob has moved, then it might be free. But we don't know.\n\n   This is risky.\n\n   Given the time, I think the first plan is better: Alice goes to the onion at (4,2) and then fills the pot at (4,0) to 3.\n\n   So I'll output the first plan for 10 turns.\n\n   Plan for Alice:\n\n   Turn 68: R (move to (3,1), face right)\n   Turn 69: R (move to (4,1), face right)\n   Turn 70: U (change orientation to up, because (4,2) is non-empty)\n   Turn 71: I (pick up onion from (4,2))\n   Turn 72: D (change orientation to down, because (4,0) is non-empty)\n   Turn 73: I (put onion in pot (4,0) -> now the pot has 2 onions)\n   Then she goes to (6,1) to get another onion:\n   Turn 74: R (move to (5,1), face right)\n   Turn 75: I (pick up onion from (6,1) by facing right? She is at (5,1) and after moving right she is facing right. And (6,1) is to her right, so she can interact immediately? But the interact requires that she is facing the tile. She is facing right, and (6,1) is to the right, so yes.\n   Turn 76: L (move left to (4,1), face left) [because (4,1) is empty and to the left]\n   Turn 77: D (change orientation to down, because (4,0) is non-empty)\n   Turn 78: I (put onion in pot (4,0) -> now 3 onions, cooking starts)\n\n   Then she can get a plate to serve the soup after 5 turns, but we are at turn 78, and the soup will be ready at turn 78+5 = 83.\n\n   But our plan is only up to turn 78 (68+10).\n\n   Alternatively, after turn 73, the pot has 2 onions. She can get an onion from elsewhere to complete it faster. But the plan above does that.\n\n   However, in turn 75 she interacts with (6,1) to get the onion. But note: the state says the kitchen counter on (6,1) contains an onion. So it's there.\n\n   But after she takes it, it's gone.\n\n   This plan is for Alice only.\n\n   We hope that Bob is also filling the other pot.\n\n   Given the above, the actions for Alice from turn 68 to 77 (10 turns):\n\n   Turn 68: R\n   Turn 69: R\n   Turn 70: U\n   Turn 71: I\n   Turn 72: D\n   Turn 73: I\n   Turn 74: R\n   Turn 75: I\n   Turn 76: L\n   Turn 77: D\n   Turn 78: I   [but we are planning up to turn 68+10 = 78, which is 11 turns?]\n\n   We are at turn 68. We plan for the next H turns. If H=10, then we plan from turn 68 to 77 (10 actions) or to 78 (11 actions)? \n\n   The plan should be for turns t1, t1+1, ..., up to t1+H-1? Or for H turns including t1? \n\n   The task: \"over next several turns(say, H turns)\" and the sequence is for t=1 to H-1? Let me see the notation: {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=1}^{H-1}. That means t from 1 to H-1, so the actions are for turns t1+1 to t1+H-1, which is H-1 actions? That doesn't make sense.\n\n   Re-read: \"plan a sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=1}^{H-1}\\) for Alice (and optionally Bob) over next several turns(say, H turns)\"\n\n   This is confusing. It says H turns, but the sequence is indexed from t=1 to H-1, so it's H-1 actions? \n\n   But the example output format has \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\", \"Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\", etc.\n\n   So probably we are to plan from turn t1 (current turn) for the next H turns, meaning turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1 (H actions).\n\n   In the notation, if we let the sequence be for t=0 to H-1, then a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}.\n\n   But the given notation is for t=1 to H-1. \n\n   Given the format, I think we should output from turn t1 (68) for a number of turns.\n\n   Let's output 10 actions: for turns 68 to 77.\n\n   But in the plan above, we have 10 actions for turns 68 to 77:\n\n   Turn 68: R\n   Turn 69: R\n   Turn 70: U\n   Turn 71: I\n   Turn 72: D\n   Turn 73: I\n   Turn 74: R\n   Turn 75: I\n   Turn 76: L\n   Turn 77: D\n\n   Then at turn 78, she would do 'I' to put the onion, but that is beyond.\n\n   Alternatively, we can plan for 10 actions and stop at turn 77 with her at (4,1) facing down, holding an onion. Then she can interact on turn 78.\n\n   But the plan is only for 10 turns.\n\n   So we output 10 actions.\n\n   However, after turn 73, she is at (4,1) holding nothing. Then she moves to (5,1) and interacts to get the onion, then moves back to (4,1) and faces down. That's turns 74 to 77.\n\n   This is a valid plan.\n\n   But note: at turn 73, after she puts the onion, the pot at (4,0) has 2 onions. It needs one more. So the next onion she gets and puts will complete it.\n\n   We output the 10 actions.\n\n   Final plan for Alice (10 turns):\n\n   Turn 68: R\n   Turn 69: R\n   Turn 70: U\n   Turn 71: I\n   Turn 72: D\n   Turn 73: I\n   Turn 74: R\n   Turn 75: I\n   Turn 76: L\n   Turn 77: D\n\n   At turn 77, she is at (4,1) facing down, holding an onion. Then on her next turn (turn 78) she can interact to put it in the pot.\n\n   This should be acceptable.\n\n   Let's hope that during this time, Bob has put his onion in one of the pots and is working on getting more.\n\n   The two pots will then be: \n   - (4,0) will have 3 onions at turn 78 (after Alice's next interact) and start cooking, ready at turn 83.\n   - (2,0) might have 2 or 3 onions if Bob is helping.\n\n   But we are only planning for Alice.\n\n   So the answer:\n\n   \\boxed{\n   Turn 68: R\n   Turn 69: R\n   Turn 70: U\n   Turn 71: I\n   Turn 72: D\n   Turn 73: I\n   Turn 74: R\n   Turn 75: I\n   Turn 76: L\n   Turn 77: D\n   }\n\n   Note: This is for Alice only.\n\n   We assume that the environment will allow the actions (e.g., the tiles are walkable and the interactions are valid).\n\n   If at any point the interaction is not valid (e.g., someone else took the onion), then the plan might fail, but we do our best.\n\n   We also assume that Bob will not block Alice's path.\n\n   This is a preliminary plan. Given the complexity, it's the best we can do.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice and Bob should focus on completing the 3-onion soup recipe in the pots. The pot at (4,0) already has 1 onion and needs 2 more, while the pot at (2,0) also has 1 onion and needs 2 more. Alice's plan involves fetching onions from kitchen counters and adding them to the pot at (4,0), while Bob (acting independently but assumed to cooperate) is expected to use his held onion to fill the pot at (2,0) and gather additional onions.\n\n### Alice's Plan (Turns 68–77):\n- **Turn 68 (R)**: Move right to (3,1), facing right. This clears (2,1) for Bob to access the pot at (2,0).\n- **Turn 69 (R)**: Move right to (4,1), facing right. Positions Alice to interact with the onion on (4,2).\n- **Turn 70 (U)**: Change orientation to up (since (4,2) is non-empty, no move occurs). Faces the kitchen counter at (4,2) to interact.\n- **Turn 71 (I)**: Interact to pick up the onion from (4,2). Alice now holds an onion.\n- **Turn 72 (D)**: Change orientation to down (since (4,0) is non-empty, no move occurs). Faces the pot at (4,0).\n- **Turn 73 (I)**: Interact to place the onion in the pot at (4,0). The pot now has 2 onions.\n- **Turn 74 (R)**: Move right to (5,1), facing right. Positions Alice to interact with the onion on (6,1).\n- **Turn 75 (I)**: Interact to pick up the onion from (6,1). Alice now holds an onion.\n- **Turn 76 (L)**: Move left to (4,1), facing left. Returns to a tile adjacent to the pot at (4,0).\n- **Turn 77 (D)**: Change orientation to down (since (4,0) is non-empty, no move occurs). Faces the pot at (4,0) for the final onion.\n\n### Expected Outcome:\n- By Turn 78, Alice can interact (I) to place the onion in the pot at (4,0), completing 3 onions. Cooking starts and will finish in 5 turns (Turn 83), yielding a 20-reward soup.\n- Bob (not controlled here but expected to cooperate) should have placed his onion in the pot at (2,0) by moving around the kitchen counter at (2,2) (e.g., via (1,3) → (1,2) → (1,1) → (2,1)) and interacted to add it. He can then fetch another onion (from a dispenser or counter) to complete that pot.\n\nThis plan efficiently uses nearby onions on counters (avoiding dispensers) and coordinates space for Bob, maximizing the likelihood of two soups (40 total reward) with minimal turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 68: R\nTurn 69: R\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: I\nTurn 72: D\nTurn 73: I\nTurn 74: R\nTurn 75: I\nTurn 76: L\nTurn 77: D\n}",

The goal is to maximize the reward from delivered soup recipes.\n\nKey observations:\n- Recipe 1: 3 onions, 0 tomatoes; reward 20; cooking time 5 turns.\n- There are two pots: (2,0) and (4,0), each already has 1 onion. They need 2 more onions each to start cooking (which takes 5 turns).\n- There are many onions scattered on kitchen counters (at (6,1), (6,3), (0,3), (4,2), (1,4), (3,4), (3,2)) and also onion dispensers at (2,4) and (4,4). However, note that the kitchen counters already have onions available for pickup.\n\nPlayers:\n- Alice: at (5,1), holding nothing, facing right (R). \n- Bob: at (3,3), holding nothing, facing down (D).\n\nObjective: We want to fill the pots with the required onions to start cooking and then serve the cooked soups. Since each pot already has 1 onion, we need 2 more per pot.\n\nPlan:\n1. We need to get onions into the pots. Since there are onions on kitchen counters, we can use them to avoid going to the dispensers (which are at (2,4) and (4,4)) and save time.\n\nLet's consider the positions:\n\nAlice (5,1):\n  - Adjacent tiles: (4,1), (6,1), (5,0), (5,2)\n  - (6,1) has an onion on the kitchen counter. Since Alice is at (5,1) and facing right (R), she is facing (6,1) which is to her right. So she can interact to pick up the onion from (6,1) on the next turn.\n\nBob (3,3):\n  - Adjacent tiles: (2,3), (4,3), (3,2), (3,4)\n  - (3,2) has an onion on the kitchen counter. Bob is facing down (D), so he is facing (3,2) because (3,2) is one step down from (3,3)? Actually, (3,3) to (3,2) is down? In the grid, note that U is (x,y+1) and D is (x,y-1). So from (3,3), moving down (D) goes to (3,2). Bob is facing down, so he is facing (3,2). Therefore, he can interact to pick up the onion at (3,2) immediately.\n\nImmediate actions:\n- Alice: at (5,1) facing right (R) can interact (I) to pick up the onion at (6,1). But note: (6,1) is adjacent? Yes, because (5,1) and (6,1) are adjacent horizontally. And she is facing right, which is towards (6,1). So she can do I to pick up the onion.\n\n- Bob: at (3,3) facing down (D) can interact (I) to pick up the onion at (3,2). But note: (3,2) is one step down from (3,3). He is facing down, so he is facing (3,2). So he can do I to pick up the onion.\n\nAfter that, both will be holding an onion.\n\nThen, we need to bring these onions to the pots. The pots are at (2,0) and (4,0). We have two pots and two players.\n\nLet's assign:\n- Alice can go to pot (4,0) because it's closer to her.\n- Bob can go to pot (2,0) because it's closer to him.\n\nBut note: Alice is at (5,1) after picking up the onion. To get to (4,0):\n  - From (5,1): she needs to move left to (4,1) and then down to (4,0). But (4,1) might be empty? We don't have information about the grid beyond the non-empty tiles. We assume that all tiles not listed as non-empty (like counters, dispensers, pots) are empty and walkable? The rules say: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space\". So (4,1) is empty? We have kitchen counters at (3,0), (5,0), etc. but (4,1) is not listed as a kitchen counter? Looking at the kitchen counter list: [(0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)]. So (4,1) is not a kitchen counter -> it's empty. Similarly, (4,0) is a pot, so we can walk on empty tiles but we cannot walk on non-empty? The rule: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" But note: pots and counters are non-empty? Actually, the rule says: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\" So we must stand on an adjacent empty tile to interact. Therefore, we cannot walk onto a non-empty tile. So (4,0) is a pot, which is non-empty, so we cannot walk on it. We must stand next to it.\n\nFor Alice to get to (4,0):\n  - From (5,1): move left to (4,1) [empty]. Then from (4,1) she can face down to (4,0) and interact.\n\nSimilarly, Bob at (3,3) after picking up the onion at (3,2). He is now at (3,3) holding an onion. To get to (2,0):\n  - He needs to go to (3,2) -> but (3,2) is a kitchen counter? Actually, no: (3,2) is a kitchen counter? The list of kitchen counters includes (3,2). But note: we just picked up the onion from (3,2). Now the kitchen counter at (3,2) is empty? The state says: \"Kitchen Counter on (3,2): contains a onion\" but Bob just picked it up. So now it's empty. But the tile is still a kitchen counter (non-empty tile). So Bob cannot walk onto (3,2) because it's a non-empty tile? Actually, the tile type is kitchen counter, which is non-empty? But the rule says: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and we can walk on empty tiles only? \n\nClarification: the grid has fixed tile types. The non-empty tiles (like dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters) are fixed and cannot be walked on. The empty tiles are walkable. So players can only stand on empty tiles.\n\nTherefore, Bob at (3,3) cannot walk down to (3,2) because (3,2) is a kitchen counter (non-empty). So he must go around? \n\nLooking at the grid, how can Bob get to (2,0)? \n\nThe grid layout is not fully given, but we know the positions of non-empty tiles. We need to plan a path that only goes through empty tiles.\n\nBob is at (3,3). Adjacent empty tiles: \n  - Left: (2,3) -> is it empty? We don't see it in the non-empty list -> so it's empty.\n  - Right: (4,3) -> empty? It's not in the non-empty list -> empty.\n  - Up: (3,4) -> kitchen counter (non-empty) -> cannot walk.\n  - Down: (3,2) -> kitchen counter -> cannot walk.\n\nSo Bob can move left to (2,3) or right to (4,3). \n\nTo get to (2,0), which is a pot at (2,0). We need to be adjacent to it. The adjacent empty tiles to (2,0) might be (1,0), (3,0), (2,1). But note:\n  - (1,0): kitchen counter (non-empty) -> cannot stand on.\n  - (3,0): kitchen counter (non-empty) -> cannot stand on.\n  - (2,1): is it empty? We don't see it in the non-empty list -> so it's empty.\n\nTherefore, Bob can stand at (2,1) to interact with the pot at (2,0) (facing down?).\n\nHow to get from (3,3) to (2,1):\n  - Option: (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,2) -> but (2,2) is a kitchen counter? The list has (2,2) as a kitchen counter -> non-empty. So cannot walk on (2,2). \n  - Alternatively: (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (1,3) -> but we don't know about (1,3). The non-empty tiles: we have kitchen counters at (0,3), (1,4), etc. (1,3) is not listed -> empty. Then from (1,3) we can go down to (1,2) -> is (1,2) empty? Not listed -> empty. Then from (1,2) to (1,1) -> empty? Then (1,1) to (2,1)? But (2,1) is adjacent to (1,1) and (3,1) and (2,0) and (2,2). But (2,2) is non-empty. So (2,1) is empty? Yes, because not listed.\n\nBut that path is long: (3,3) -> (2,3) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1). Then at (2,1) he can face down to interact with the pot at (2,0). \n\nAlternatively, is there a shorter path? What about going down? Bob cannot go down from (3,3) because (3,2) is non-empty. So he must go left or right. \n\nAlternatively, can he go to (4,3) and then down? (4,3) is empty. Then (4,3) to (4,2) -> but (4,2) is a kitchen counter (non-empty) -> cannot walk. So that doesn't work.\n\nSo the only way is to go left to (2,3) and then via (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) to (2,1). That's 4 moves.\n\nBut note: we have a kitchen counter at (1,4) and (0,3), but (1,3) is not listed so it's empty.\n\nAlternatively, if (3,1) is empty, then Bob could go (3,3) -> (3,4) is non-empty (kitchen counter) so cannot go up. So he must go left to (2,3). Then from (2,3) he can go down to (2,2)? No, (2,2) is non-empty. So he must go left to (1,3). Then (1,3) to (1,2) to (1,1) to (2,1). \n\nSo Bob's path to the pot at (2,0) is long.\n\nAlternatively, we might assign Bob to the other pot at (4,0) and Alice to (2,0)? But Alice is at (5,1) and (4,0) is closer to her.\n\nLet me reassess:\n\nWe have two pots: (2,0) and (4,0). We need to put two onions in each.\n\nAfter both players pick up an onion (Alice from (6,1) and Bob from (3,2)):\n\nAlice at (5,1) holding onion. She can go to (4,1) (one move left) and then face down to interact with the pot at (4,0). So in two moves (after the interact to pick up) she can deliver to pot (4,0). Then the pot at (4,0) will have 2 onions (it already has 1, so now 2). Then we need one more onion for that pot? Actually, it started with 1, so after adding one, it becomes 2. We need 3 for the recipe. So we need one more onion for each pot.\n\nBut note: we have many onions on counters. We can have the players pick up another onion and add to the same pot? Or we can have one player focus on one pot and the other on the other.\n\nAlternatively, we can have both players work together to fill one pot first? Because filling one pot and serving it might be faster.\n\nBut we have two pots that are already partially filled. If we can get both pots cooking, then we can get two soups.\n\nBut Bob is far from the pot at (2,0). So maybe we have Bob help with the pot at (4,0) and then we can use the other pot later? Or we can have Bob pick up an onion and bring it to the pot at (2,0) even if it takes time.\n\nBut note: the cooking time is 5 turns. So if we start one pot now, it will be ready in 5 turns. If we start the other pot later, it will be ready later. We are planning for the next several turns (say H turns). We don't know H, but we should aim to complete as many as possible.\n\nBut the problem is to maximize the total reward. Each soup gives 20. So we want to make two soups.\n\nHowever, we must also consider that after the soup is cooked, we need to serve it: which requires a plate and then deliver to the serving counter at (6,2).\n\nSo let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Fill the pots to 3 onions each.\n   - Pot at (4,0): currently 1 onion. Needs 2 more.\n   - Pot at (2,0): currently 1 onion. Needs 2 more.\n\n2. Wait for cooking (5 turns per pot).\n\n3. For each cooked soup, we need to:\n   a. Get a plate (from dispenser at (0,2)).\n   b. Use the plate to serve the soup from the pot.\n   c. Deliver the soup to the serving counter at (6,2).\n\nWe have two players. We can do things in parallel.\n\nBut Bob is currently at (3,3) and it will take him many moves to get to (2,0). Alternatively, we can have Bob pick up an onion and bring it to the pot at (4,0) as well? Then we can have both players working on the same pot? That might be faster.\n\nBut the pot at (4,0) only needs 2 more. So if both players bring one onion each to (4,0), then we can fill it in two steps? But we have to do it one by one because the pot can only be interacted by one player at a time? Actually, two players can interact in the same turn? The rules don't say, but typically in Overcooked, only one player can interact with a pot at a time? So we have to coordinate turns.\n\nAlternatively, we can have one player bring two onions? But a player can only carry one at a time. So after delivering the first onion, the player must go get another onion.\n\nGiven the positions, let's have Alice and Bob both work on the pot at (4,0) first.\n\nPlan for the next few turns:\n\nTurn 71 (current turn we are planning for turn 71? Actually, we are at the start of turn 71. The state is given at turn 71, and we are to plan from turn 71 onward.\n\nSo we plan for turn 71, 72, ... for Alice (and we can also suggest for Bob? The task says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But the answer format only has one sequence? The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice\". So we only output Alice's actions? But to maximize the reward, we need Bob to cooperate. However, we cannot control Bob? But the task says \"collaborate with Bob\", so we assume we can control both? But the answer format is for Alice. \n\nLooking at the task: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice\". So we only output Alice's actions. But we can assume Bob is following a coordinated plan? The problem says: \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\", so we can design a plan for both, but the answer only requires Alice's actions? \n\nBut the answer format is:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1}\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n...\n\nSo we only output Alice's actions. Therefore, we must assume that Bob is controlled by someone else? But the problem says \"optimize coordination\", so we can assume that Bob will follow a reasonable plan? However, we are not outputting Bob's actions. \n\nThis is ambiguous. But note: the problem says \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\", meaning we can plan for both. But the answer format only asks for Alice. So we must plan Alice's actions with the expectation that Bob is also acting optimally? Or we can assume Bob will follow the same plan? \n\nGiven the constraints, I think we should plan Alice's actions and assume Bob will do the most logical thing. Alternatively, we can design a plan that is robust to Bob's actions? But that is complex.\n\nAlternatively, we can output only Alice's actions and hope that Bob will be controlled by a similar algorithm? But for the purpose of this problem, we are only required to output Alice's actions.\n\nSo let's focus on Alice and assume Bob is also trying to help.\n\nBut to be safe, we can have Alice focus on one pot and assume Bob will take care of the other? Or we can have Alice work with Bob on the same pot if that is more efficient.\n\nGiven the positions, Alice is close to the pot at (4,0) and also to the onion at (6,1). Bob is close to the onion at (3,2) and then he can go to the pot at (2,0) but it's a long way. Alternatively, Bob can also go to the pot at (4,0) and they can both fill that pot quickly.\n\nBut note: Bob is at (3,3) and the pot at (4,0) is at (4,0). How can Bob get to (4,0)? \n\nFrom (3,3) -> he can move right to (4,3) (empty) -> then down to (4,2) is blocked (kitchen counter) -> so he cannot go down from (4,3). He must go left to (3,3) and then? We already saw he cannot go down. So he must go via (4,3) to (5,3)? Is (5,3) empty? Not listed -> empty. Then (5,3) to (5,2) -> empty? Then (5,2) to (5,1) -> but (5,1) is where Alice is at the start? But Alice will move. Then (5,1) to (5,0) -> kitchen counter (non-empty) -> cannot go. Alternatively, from (5,2) to (4,2) is blocked. So he cannot get to (4,1) from the east? \n\nHow about from (4,3) to (4,4)? (4,4) is an onion dispenser (non-empty) -> cannot walk. \n\nSo Bob cannot get to (4,0) either? \n\nWait, let me map the area around (4,0):\n\nThe adjacent empty tiles for (4,0) are:\n  - (3,0): kitchen counter -> non-empty\n  - (5,0): kitchen counter -> non-empty\n  - (4,1): empty (as per above) -> so players can stand at (4,1) to interact with (4,0) by facing down.\n\nHow can Bob get to (4,1)? \n  - From (3,3): he can go to (4,3) (one move right). Then from (4,3) to (4,2) is blocked (kitchen counter). So he cannot go down. \n  - From (4,3) he can go right to (5,3) (empty). Then from (5,3) to (5,2) (empty). Then from (5,2) to (5,1) (empty). Then from (5,1) to (4,1) (left). \n\nSo path: (3,3) -> (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (5,2) -> (5,1) -> (4,1). That's 4 moves.\n\nThen from (4,1) he can face down to interact with the pot.\n\nBut note: Alice is at (5,1) at the beginning. She will move to interact with (6,1) on turn 71. Then on turn 72 she can move left to (4,1). So by turn 72, Alice will be at (4,1) and holding an onion. Then she can interact with the pot at (4,0) on turn 72 (if she faces down?).\n\nBut at turn 71:\n  - Alice: at (5,1) facing right -> interact (I) to pick up onion at (6,1). Then she will be at (5,1) holding an onion.\n  - Bob: at (3,3) facing down -> interact (I) to pick up onion at (3,2). Then he will be at (3,3) holding an onion.\n\nTurn 72:\n  - Alice: move left to (4,1). Then she must change orientation to down to face the pot at (4,0). But the action for turn 72: move left (L) to (4,1). Then she is at (4,1) and her orientation after moving left? When she moves left, her orientation becomes left? Or does orientation change only when we use the change orientation action? The move action changes position and orientation: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" So if she moves left, she will be at (4,1) and facing left. But to interact with (4,0) which is down, she needs to be facing down. So she cannot interact immediately. She would need to change orientation to down first.\n\nAlternatively, we can have her move down from (5,1) to (5,0)? But (5,0) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, so she cannot walk there. So she must go left to (4,1). Then on turn 73, she changes orientation to down (D) and then interacts (I) on turn 74? That would be two more turns.\n\nBut if she moves left to (4,1) on turn 72, then on turn 73 she can change orientation to down and interact? Or can she interact on turn 72 after moving? No, because after moving left, she is at (4,1) facing left. The pot is down, so she is not facing down. So she must turn down on turn 73 and interact on turn 73? Actually, the change orientation action is separate? The actions are: Move, Change Orientation, Interact, Stay.\n\nSo on turn 72: she moves left to (4,1) and becomes facing left.\nTurn 73: she changes orientation to down (D) (which doesn't move her, but changes her facing).\nTurn 74: she interacts (I) to add the onion to the pot.\n\nThat's three turns from turn 71.\n\nAlternatively, we can have her change orientation first? On turn 72: change orientation to down (while still at (5,1))? Then she is facing down. But the pot at (4,0) is not adjacent to (5,1)? The adjacent tiles to (5,1) are (4,1), (6,1), (5,0), (5,2). (5,0) is a kitchen counter (non-empty), so she cannot interact with it? And (4,0) is not adjacent to (5,1). So she cannot interact with the pot from (5,1). So she must move to (4,1) first.\n\nSo the fastest for Alice to add to pot (4,0) is: \n  turn 71: I (pick up onion from (6,1))\n  turn 72: L (move left to (4,1), facing left)\n  turn 73: D (change orientation to down)\n  turn 74: I (add onion to pot)\n\nThen the pot at (4,0) will have 2 onions (1+1=2). It still needs one more.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob:\n  turn 71: I (pick up onion from (3,2))\n  then he can start moving to (4,1) to add to the same pot? Or to the other pot? \n\nBut to add to (4,0), he needs to go to (4,1). The path: (3,3) -> (4,3) [right] -> (5,3) [right] -> (5,2) [down] -> (5,1) [down] -> (4,1) [left]. That's 4 moves. Then at (4,1) he must face down to interact.\n\nBut note: Alice will be at (4,1) on turn 72, but then she moves away? We don't want both at (4,1) at the same time? The rule: players cannot walk through each other. But they can be on adjacent tiles? But (4,1) can only hold one player.\n\nSo if Alice is at (4,1) on turn 72, then Bob cannot move to (4,1) until Alice leaves. But Alice will stay at (4,1) until at least turn 74 (because on turn 73 she changes orientation and on turn 74 she interacts). Then after turn 74, she can move away.\n\nSo Bob can start moving but he will be blocked at (4,1) until Alice leaves.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Bob go to the other pot at (2,0) even if it's far.\n\nBut let's calculate for Bob to go to (2,0):\n  - Path: (3,3) -> (2,3) [left] -> (1,3) [left] -> (1,2) [down] -> (1,1) [down] -> (2,1) [right]. Then at (2,1) he can face down to interact with pot at (2,0). That's 4 moves and then interact on the 5th step.\n\nThen he can add one onion to (2,0), making it 2 onions. Then we still need one more for each pot.\n\nThen we need to get one more onion for each pot.\n\nAlternatively, after Alice adds her onion to (4,0) on turn 74, she can go pick up another onion and bring it to (4,0). But where to get an onion? There are onions at (6,3), (0,3), (1,4), etc.\n\nThe closest onion to (4,1) might be at (4,2)? But (4,2) is a kitchen counter and it has an onion. But (4,2) is adjacent to (4,1)? Alice is at (4,1). She is facing down after turn 73. (4,2) is up from (4,1)? But she is facing down. So she would need to change orientation to up? And then interact to pick up the onion at (4,2)? But (4,2) is adjacent and she can interact if facing it.\n\nSo after adding the onion to the pot at turn 74, on turn 75 she can change orientation to up (U) and then on turn 76 interact to pick up the onion at (4,2). Then she has an onion. Then she can immediately (since she is at (4,1) and the pot is at (4,0) and she is facing up? no, she would be facing up after picking up) then she needs to face down again. \n\nSo:\n  turn 75: U (change orientation to up)\n  turn 76: I (pick up onion from (4,2))\n  turn 77: D (change orientation to down)\n  turn 78: I (add onion to pot at (4,0))\n\nThen the pot at (4,0) will have 3 onions and start cooking.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob is on his way to (2,0). By turn 71+4=75, he should be at (2,1) and then on turn 75 he can face down and interact to add his onion to (2,0), making it 2 onions. Then he needs to get another onion for (2,0). The closest onion might be at (3,4) or (1,4) or (0,3). \n\nFor example, from (2,1) he can go to (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) [kitchen counter with onion]. \n  - (1,4) is non-empty, so he can stand at (1,3) facing up to interact with (1,4) to pick up the onion? But (1,4) is at (1,4) and (1,3) is below it. So he needs to face up.\n  - Then he can go back to (2,1) and add to the pot.\n\nSo:\n  turn 75: at (2,1) facing down -> interact to add onion (pot becomes 2 onions)\n  turn 76: move up to (2,2)? -> blocked, so move left to (1,1) [from (2,1) to (1,1): left]\n  turn 77: move up to (1,2) [U]\n  turn 78: move up to (1,3) [U]\n  turn 79: change orientation to up (U) [if not already] and interact to pick up onion from (1,4)\n  turn 80: move down to (1,2) [D]\n  turn 81: move down to (1,1) [D]\n  turn 82: move right to (2,1) [R]\n  turn 83: change orientation to down [D] and interact to add onion.\n\nThis is very long.\n\nGiven the complexity, it might be better to focus on one pot first.\n\nRevised plan: fill the pot at (4,0) as fast as possible and then serve it, while Bob starts working on the other pot.\n\nSteps for pot at (4,0):\n  - It needs 2 more onions.\n  - Alice will bring one (turns 71-74 as above).\n  - Then Alice will bring another one (turns 75-78 as above).\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can bring one onion to (2,0) (which will take until turn 75 to add) and then he can start cooking at (2,0) by bringing the second onion later.\n\nBut after Alice starts the cooking at (4,0) on turn 78, the soup will be ready at turn 78 + 5 = turn 83.\n\nThen we need to serve it: \n  - Get a plate from (0,2). \n  - Use the plate to serve the soup from (4,0).\n  - Deliver to (6,2).\n\nAlice can do this after she adds the last onion. But she will be at (4,1) after adding the last onion on turn 78. She is holding nothing. She needs to get a plate.\n\nThe plate dispenser is at (0,2). Path from (4,1) to (0,2): \n  - (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) -> then from (0,1) she can go up to (0,2)? But (0,1) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, so she cannot walk on it. She must stand next to (0,2) to interact. \n\nAdjacent empty tiles to (0,2): \n  - (0,1): kitchen counter -> non-empty\n  - (0,3): kitchen counter -> non-empty\n  - (1,2): empty? not listed -> empty.\n\nSo she must stand at (1,2) to interact with (0,2). But (1,2) is empty? Yes.\n\nSo path: (4,1) -> (4,2) is blocked, so she must go west: (4,1) -> (3,1) [left] -> (2,1) [left] -> (1,1) [left] -> (1,2) [up]. That's 4 moves. Then she can face left to interact with (0,2) to get a plate.\n\nBut (1,2) is empty, but (0,2) is the plate dispenser. She is at (1,2) and facing left (if she moved left to (1,1) and then up to (1,2), she would be facing up? Or when she moves up, she faces up. So she must change orientation to left to face (0,2).\n\nSo:\n  turn 79: move left to (3,1) [L]\n  turn 80: move left to (2,1) [L]\n  turn 81: move left to (1,1) [L]\n  turn 82: move up to (1,2) [U] -> now facing up.\n  turn 83: change orientation to left [L] \n  turn 84: interact to get plate [I]\n\nThen she has a plate. Now she needs to go back to the pot at (4,0) to serve the soup. The soup is ready at turn 83, but she is at (1,2) at turn 82, and at turn 84 she gets the plate. So the soup has been ready since turn 83, so at turn 84 it is still there.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (4,0):\n  - (1,2) -> (1,1) [D] -> (2,1) [R] -> (3,1) [R] -> (4,1) [R]. Then at (4,1) she can face down to interact with the pot.\n\nSo:\n  turn 85: move down to (1,1) [D] -> facing down.\n  turn 86: move right to (2,1) [R] -> facing right.\n  turn 87: move right to (3,1) [R] -> facing right.\n  turn 88: move right to (4,1) [R] -> facing right.\n  turn 89: change orientation to down [D]\n  turn 90: interact to serve the soup [I] -> now she is holding a soup in a plate.\n\nThen she needs to deliver to the serving counter at (6,2). From (4,1) to (6,2):\n  - (4,1) -> (5,1) [R] -> (5,2) [U] -> (6,2) is serving counter, so she must stand adjacent. The serving counter at (6,2) is adjacent to (5,2) (east) and (6,1) (north) and (6,3) (south). (5,2) is empty? not listed -> empty.\n\nSo she can stand at (5,2) and face right to interact with (6,2).\n\nSo from (4,1) to (5,1) to (5,2) to then interact.\n\n  turn 91: move right to (5,1) [R]\n  turn 92: move up to (5,2) [U] -> now facing up.\n  turn 93: change orientation to right [R]\n  turn 94: interact to deliver [I]\n\nThis is very long and we haven't even started the other pot.\n\nGiven the time, it might be better to have both players work on filling the same pot quickly.\n\nBut as we saw, Bob cannot easily reach (4,0) and the path is blocked by counters.\n\nAlternative plan: have Alice and Bob both work on the pot at (2,0) even though it's far for Alice? \n\nAlice at (5,1) to (2,0): \n  - Path: (5,1) -> (4,1) [L] -> (3,1) [L] -> (2,1) [L] -> then at (2,1) face down to interact. That's 3 moves. But she must first pick up an onion.\n\nSo:\n  turn 71: I to pick up onion from (6,1) -> at (5,1) holding onion.\n  turn 72: L to (4,1)\n  turn 73: L to (3,1)\n  turn 74: L to (2,1) -> now at (2,1) facing left.\n  turn 75: D to face down.\n  turn 76: I to add onion to pot at (2,0) -> now the pot has 2 onions.\n\nThen she can get another onion. The closest might be at (3,2) but Bob might have taken it. Or at (4,2) or (3,4).\n\nBut Bob can also be heading to (2,0) with his onion.\n\nBob's path to (2,0) is long, as before. But if both are heading to (2,0), then they might block each other.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that we are only planning for Alice, let's focus on Alice and assume Bob will do his part.\n\nBut to maximize reward, we should try to complete one soup quickly.\n\nLet's have Alice work on the pot at (4,0) because it's closer.\n\nPlan for Alice:\n\nTurn 71: I (pick up onion from (6,1))\nTurn 72: L (move left to (4,1))\nTurn 73: D (change orientation to down)\nTurn 74: I (add onion to pot at (4,0)) -> now the pot has 2 onions.\nThen she needs to get one more onion for the same pot.\n\nThe closest onion might be at (6,3) or (4,2) or (3,2) or (3,4). But (4,2) is right above her at (4,1)? \n  - (4,2) is adjacent to (4,1) (north). So she can pick it up if it's still there.\n\nAfter turn 74, she is at (4,1) facing down. She needs to face up to interact with (4,2).\n\nTurn 75: U (change orientation to up)\nTurn 76: I (pick up onion from (4,2)) -> now she has an onion.\nThen she can immediately add it to the pot? She is at (4,1) and the pot is south. So she needs to face down.\nTurn 77: D (change orientation to down)\nTurn 78: I (add onion to pot) -> now the pot has 3 onions and cooking starts. The cooking will complete at turn 78 + 5 = 83.\n\nThen she is free to do other things. But we need to serve the soup when it's ready.\n\nShe can go get a plate from (0,2) as before, but that takes many turns. Alternatively, Bob might get the plate.\n\nBut since we are only planning for Alice, we can have her get the plate.\n\nFrom (4,1) to (0,2) as before: \n  (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) (4 moves) \n  then get the plate (after changing orientation to left).\n\nThen return to (4,1) to serve the soup (4 moves back), then deliver to (6,2) (2-3 moves).\n\nBut this will take until after turn 83.\n\nAlternatively, after adding the last onion, she can go to (0,2) immediately.\n\nSo turn 79: L to (3,1)\n turn 80: L to (2,1)\n turn 81: L to (1,1)\n turn 82: U to (1,2) -> now at (1,2) facing up.\n turn 83: L (change orientation to left) to face the plate dispenser at (0,2)\n turn 84: I (grab plate)\n turn 85: R (change orientation to right) // not needed, she can move directly\n turn 86: D (move down to (1,1)) // to start heading back\n turn 87: R (move right to (2,1))\n turn 88: R (move right to (3,1))\n turn 89: R ( move right to (4,1)) // now at (4,1) facing right.\n turn 90: D (change orientation to down)\n turn 91: I (serve the soup) // now holding soup in plate\n turn 92: U (change orientation to up) // to move to (4,2)? or to head east\n        actually, to deliver, she needs to go to (6,2). \n        from (4,1): \n turn 92: move right to (5,1) [R]\n turn 93: move up to (5,2) [U]\n turn 94: change orientation to right [R] \n turn 95: I (deliver at (6,2))\n\n This is very long, and the other pot is not touched.\n\nGiven the time constraints, we might only be able to complete one soup in the near future.\n\nBut the problem says \"maximize the total reward\", and one soup gives 20. If we can complete two, we get 40, but it takes longer.\n\nHowever, the planning horizon H is not specified. We are to plan for \"next several turns\". So we should plan as long as necessary to complete at least one soup.\n\n But note: the other pot already has 1 onion. If we leave it, it doesn't cook. So eventually we should fill it.\n\n Since we are only planning for Alice, and we can't control Bob, we focus on Alice's actions.\n\n Let's go with the plan to complete the soup in the pot at (4,0) with Alice.\n\n Summary for Alice:\n\n Turn 71: I (pick up onion from (6,1))\n Turn 72: L (move left to (4,1))\n Turn 73: D (face down)\n Turn 74: I (add onion to (4,0) -> now 2 onions)\n Turn 75: U (face up)\n Turn 76: I (pick up onion from (4,2))\n Turn 77: D (face down)\n Turn 78: I (add onion to (4,0) -> cooking starts at turn 78)\n\n Then she goes for a plate:\n\n Turn 79: L (move left to (3,1))\n Turn 80: L (move left to (2,1))\n Turn 81: L (move left to (1,1))\n Turn 82: U (move up to (1,2))\n Turn 83: L (change orientation to left) // to face the plate dispenser at (0,2)\n Turn 84: I (grab plate)\n\n Then return to the pot:\n\n Turn 85: D (move down to (1,1)) // and she is facing down after moving down? \n           When she moves down, she becomes facing down. So no need to change orientation for movement.\n Turn 86: R (move right to (2,1)) -> facing right\n Turn 87: R (move right to (3,1)) -> facing right\n Turn 88: R (move right to (4,1)) -> facing right\n Turn 89: D (change orientation to down) // to face the pot\n Turn 90: I (serve the soup) // now holding a soup in a plate\n\n Then deliver to (6,2):\n\n Turn 91: R (move right to (5,1)) -> facing right\n Turn 92: U (move up to (5,2)) -> facing up\n Turn 93: R (change orientation to right) // to face the serving counter at (6,2)\n Turn 94: I (deliver the soup) // reward obtained\n\n This is 24 turns (from turn 71 to 94).\n\n In the meantime, Bob might be filling the other pot.\n\n But we have to output only for Alice.\n\n However, this is a long sequence and the problem says \"next several turns\", which might be shorter. But the horizon H is not specified.\n\n Alternatively, after the pot is cooking (turn 78), we might have Alice help with the other pot? But then we risk the soup burning? No, the cooking time is fixed. It will be ready at turn 83, and we can serve it anytime after that. But we need to serve it before the game ends, but we don't know when the game ends.\n\n Since the task is to maximize the total reward, and we can only control Alice, we should complete the soup we started.\n\n Given the above, I will output the sequence for Alice for the next 24 turns.\n\n But note: the action history only has 5 turns, and we are planning for the future, so it's fine.\n\n Let's write the actions:\n\n turn 71: I\n turn 72: L\n turn 73: D\n turn 74: I\n turn 75: U\n turn 76: I\n turn 77: D\n turn 78: I\n turn 79: L\n turn 80: L\n turn 81: L\n turn 82: U\n turn 83: L   [change orientation to left]\n turn 84: I\n turn 85: D\n turn 86: R\n turn 87: R\n turn 88: R\n turn 89: D\n turn 90: I\n turn 91: R\n turn 92: U\n turn 93: R\n turn 94: I\n\n But turn 76: I to pick up from (4,2) - is the onion still there? The state at turn 71 says (4,2) has an onion. But Bob might have taken it? We don't know. It's risky.\n\n Alternatively, use the onion at (6,3) which is also on a kitchen counter.\n\n After turn 78, Alice is at (4,1) holding nothing. She can go to (6,3) to get an onion for the other pot? But we are not sure.\n\n Given the uncertainty, let's stick to using the onion at (4,2) for the second onion for the pot at (4,0). If it's not there, then the plan fails.\n\n Alternatively, right after turn 74, she could go to (6,3) for the second onion? But (6,3) is farther.\n\n Let's compare:\n  from (4,1) to (4,2): one move up and interact (2 turns) and then back down to add (2 turns) -> 4 turns.\n  from (4,1) to (6,3): \n      (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (6,1) -> (6,2) is serving counter? (6,2) is serving counter, non-empty, so cannot walk. \n      How to get to (6,3)? \n          (4,1) -> (5,1) [R]\n          (5,1) -> (5,2) [U]\n          (5,2) -> (5,3) [U]\n          (5,3) -> (6,3) is kitchen counter, non-empty, so cannot walk. \n          So she must stand at (5,3) or (6,2) or (6,4) to interact with (6,3)? \n          (6,3) is at (6,3). Adjacent empty tiles: \n             (5,3) -> empty\n             (6,2) -> serving counter (non-empty) -> cannot stand\n             (6,4) -> kitchen counter (non-empty) -> cannot stand\n          So only (5,3) is available. She can stand at (5,3) and face right to interact with (6,3).\n\n          Path: (4,1) -> (5,1) [R]\n                 -> (5,2) [U]\n                 -> (5,3) [U]   // 3 moves\n          Then interact.\n\n          So turn 75: R to (5,1)\n          turn 76: U to (5,2)\n          turn 77: U to (5,3)\n          turn 78: R (change orientation to right) \n          turn 79: I (pick up onion from (6,3))\n          Then she has to go back to (4,1) to add to the pot: \n          turn 80: L (change orientation to left) // to move west\n          turn 81: D ( to (5,2) )\n          turn 82: D ( to (5,1) )\n          turn 83: L ( to (4,1) )\n          turn 84: D (face down)\n          turn 85: I (add onion)\n\n          This is 15 turns from turn 71 to turn 85 just to add the second onion, which is worse.\n\n Therefore, using the onion at (4,2) is better.\n\n So we assume the onion at (4,2) is still there.\n\n If it's not, then the plan fails, but we have to make an assumption.\n\n Therefore, I will output the 24-turn sequence for Alice.\n\n But note: the problem might expect a shorter horizon. However, to complete a soup, we need this many steps.\n\n Alternatively, after we have the pot cooking, we could have Alice help with the other pot, but then we have to come back to serve, which might be even longer.\n\n Given the above, let's output the sequence.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice will focus on completing the soup in the pot at (4,0), which already contains 1 onion. She will gather the two additional onions needed from nearby kitchen counters, start the cooking process, and then serve the cooked soup. The plan leverages the proximity of onions at (6,1) and (4,2) to minimize movement. After adding the ingredients, Alice will fetch a plate from (0,2), serve the soup from the pot, and deliver it to the serving counter at (6,2). This sequence ensures one soup is delivered efficiently, yielding a reward of 20.\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence\n- **Turn 71: I**  \n  Interact to pick up onion from kitchen counter at (6,1) (adjacent and facing right).\n- **Turn 72: L**  \n  Move left to (4,1), now facing left.\n- **Turn 73: D**  \n  Change orientation to down to face the pot at (4,0).\n- **Turn 74: I**  \n  Interact to add onion to the pot at (4,0) (pot now has 2 onions).\n- **Turn 75: U**  \n  Change orientation to up to face the kitchen counter at (4,2).\n- **Turn 76: I**  \n  Interact to pick up onion from (4,2) (adjacent and facing up).\n- **Turn 77: D**  \n  Change orientation to down to face the pot at (4,0).\n- **Turn 78: I**  \n  Interact to add onion to the pot (pot now has 3 onions; cooking starts and will finish at turn 83).\n- **Turn 79: L**  \n  Move left to (3,1), now facing left.\n- **Turn 80: L**  \n  Move left to (2,1), now facing left.\n- **Turn 81: L**  \n  Move left to (1,1), now facing left.\n- **Turn 82: U**  \n  Move up to (1,2), now facing up.\n- **Turn 83: L**  \n  Change orientation to left to face the plate dispenser at (0,2).\n- **Turn 84: I**  \n  Interact to grab a clean plate from (0,2).\n- **Turn 85: D**  \n  Move down to (1,1), now facing down.\n- **Turn 86: R**  \n  Move right to (2,1), now facing right.\n- **Turn 87: R**  \n  Move right to (3,1), now facing right.\n- **Turn 88: R**  \n  Move right to (4,1), now facing right.\n- **Turn 89: D**  \n  Change orientation to down to face the pot at (4,0).\n- **Turn 90: I**  \n  Interact to serve the cooked soup (now holding soup in plate).\n- **Turn 91: R**  \n  Move right to (5,1), now facing right.\n- **Turn 92: U**  \n  Move up to (5,2), now facing up.\n- **Turn 93: R**  \n  Change orientation to right to face the serving counter at (6,2).\n- **Turn 94: I**  \n  Interact to deliver the soup to the serving counter at (6,2) (reward of 20 obtained).\n\nThis sequence completes one soup delivery by turn 94. Bob can work independently on the other pot at (2,0) to prepare a second soup for additional reward, but Alice's actions are optimized to secure at least one reward efficiently. The soup at (4,0) starts cooking at turn 78 and is ready at turn 83, with serving and delivery completed by turn 94. The use of nearby onions minimizes movement, and the path to the plate dispenser and serving counter is direct.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 71: \\text{I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 72: \\text{L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 73: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 74: \\text{I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 75: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 76: \\text{I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 77: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 78: \\text{I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 79: \\text{L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 80: \\text{L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 81: \\text{L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 82: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 83: \\text{L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 84: \\text{I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 85: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 86: \\text{R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 87: \\text{R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 88: \\text{R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 89: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 90: \\text{I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 91: \\text{R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 92: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 93: \\text{R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 94: \\text{I}\n}",

The goal is to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes.\n\nKey observations from the current state:\n\n1. **Recipes**: Only one recipe is provided: Recipe 1 requires 3 onions (0 tomatoes), reward 20, cooking time 5 turns.\n\n2. **Dispensers**: \n   - Onion dispensers at (2,4) and (4,4)\n   - Plate dispenser at (0,2)\n   - No tomato dispensers (so we only use onions)\n\n3. **Pots**:\n   - Pot at (2,0): has 1 onion (needs 2 more onions)\n   - Pot at (4,0): has 1 onion (needs 2 more onions)\n\n4. **Kitchen Counters** (with onions): \n   - (6,1): onion\n   - (6,3): onion\n   - (0,3): onion\n   - (4,2): onion\n   - (1,4): onion\n   - (3,4): onion\n   - (3,2): onion\n\n   There are 7 onions already placed on kitchen counters. We can use these to fill the pots without going to the dispensers.\n\n5. **Players**:\n   - Alice (me): at (5,2), holding nothing, facing Up. Action history: R, R, R, U, I (most recent last: I at turn 74).\n   - Bob: at (2,3), holding one onion, facing Up. Action history: D, I, L, U, I (most recent: I at turn 74).\n\nSince Bob just did an 'I' at turn 74 and he is at (2,3) facing Up, let's see what he might have interacted with. \n- (2,3) is adjacent to (2,2) (which is a kitchen counter) and (2,4) (onion dispenser). But note that (2,3) is adjacent to (1,3) (east of (2,3) is (3,3) but that's not a tile we have, so let's look at the grid.\n\nThe grid has:\n- Kitchen Counters at (0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nBob is at (2,3). The adjacent tiles are:\n- Up: (2,4) -> Onion Dispenser? But the list of onion dispensers is [(2,4), (4,4)]. So (2,4) is an onion dispenser.\n- Down: (2,2) -> Kitchen Counter (since (2,2) is in the kitchen counter list)\n- Left: (1,3) -> is (1,3) in any non-empty tile? The kitchen counters are at (0,3), (1,4), etc. (1,3) is not listed as a kitchen counter, so it's probably an empty tile? But note the list of kitchen counters is given, so (1,3) is empty. However, we cannot interact with an empty tile. \n- Right: (3,3) -> not in the kitchen counter list, so empty.\n\nBob is facing Up. So he must have interacted with the tile above him, which is (2,4) (onion dispenser). But Bob is holding an onion already? Then he cannot grab another because he can only hold one. Alternatively, he might have placed the onion on a counter? But the kitchen counter at (2,2) is below him? He is facing Up, so he cannot interact with (2,2) because he is facing away.\n\nWait, the interaction rule: must be adjacent and facing the tile. So at (2,3) facing Up, he can only interact with (2,4). Since he is holding an onion, he cannot grab from the dispenser (because he is not empty-handed). So what did he do with 'I'? \n\nAlternatively, note that the kitchen counters: (2,2) is a kitchen counter and is adjacent (down) but he is facing up, so he cannot interact with it. So the only interactable tile is (2,4). But since he is holding an onion, he can't grab. So what did the 'I' do? \n\nIt's possible that the action 'I' did nothing because he couldn't interact? Or maybe he tried to put the onion on the dispenser? But dispensers are not for placing items. They are for taking.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Bob was at (2,3) and facing Up and tried to interact with (2,4). Since he is holding an onion and the dispenser is only for taking, the interaction fails. So he still holds the onion.\n\nSimilarly, Alice did an 'I' at turn 74. Alice is at (5,2) facing Up. What is adjacent above? (5,3). Is (5,3) a non-empty tile? The kitchen counters are at (5,4) and (5,0) and (6, something). (5,3) is not in the kitchen counter list. The serving counter is at (6,2). So adjacent to (5,2): \n- Up: (5,3) -> empty? \n- Down: (5,1) -> empty?\n- Left: (4,2) -> kitchen counter (and it has an onion)\n- Right: (6,2) -> serving counter.\n\nBut Alice is facing Up. So she can only interact with (5,3). But (5,3) is empty? So the interaction does nothing? Or maybe she was trying to interact with the serving counter? But she is at (5,2) and the serving counter is to her right (east) at (6,2). She is facing Up, so she is not facing the serving counter. Therefore, the interaction at turn 74 by Alice did nothing.\n\nNow, what is the plan?\n\nWe have two pots that each have one onion and need two more. There are plenty of onions on the kitchen counters. We also need to get plates and serve the soups.\n\nSteps to complete a recipe:\n\n1. Fill a pot with 3 onions -> then it starts cooking (5 turns).\n2. After 5 turns, the soup is cooked.\n3. Get a plate (from plate dispenser at (0,2)), then use it on the pot to get the soup.\n4. Deliver the soup at the serving counter (6,2).\n\nWe have two pots. Both are partially filled (1 onion each). We need to add two more onions to each.\n\nBut note: we are at turn 74. The cooking time is 5 turns. So if we fill a pot at turn t, it will be ready at turn t+5.\n\nWe can have multiple soups cooking at the same time.\n\nWe have two players. We can assign one to work on one pot and the other on the other, but we must coordinate.\n\nAlso, there are onions already on counters. We can pick them up and use them.\n\nCurrent positions:\n\n- Alice: (5,2) holding nothing.\n- Bob: (2,3) holding one onion.\n\nWe need to get onions into the pots.\n\nLet's consider the pots:\n\n- Pot at (2,0): currently has 1 onion. It is at (2,0). The kitchen counters with onions: (2,2) is a kitchen counter and has an onion? Yes, (3,2) and (4,2) also have onions. But note (2,2) is adjacent to (2,1) and (2,0) is at (2,0). So (2,0) is two steps down from (2,2). But the grid: (2,2) is a counter, so we can stand on (2,1) and (2,3) is Bob. \n\nThe grid layout: we don't have a full grid, but we know the non-empty tiles. We know that (2,2) is a kitchen counter and (2,0) is a pot. The tiles at (2,1) and (2,3) are walkable? We don't have any non-empty tile at (2,1) and (2,3) is where Bob is. So (2,1) must be empty (walkable).\n\nSimilarly, for the other pot at (4,0): adjacent to (4,1) which is empty? We don't have a non-empty tile at (4,1) so it should be walkable.\n\nPlan for the next few turns:\n\nWe want to get onions into the pots as quickly as possible.\n\nBob is at (2,3) holding an onion. He can move down to (2,2) but (2,2) is a kitchen counter and not walkable. He can go down to (2,2)? No, because non-empty tiles are not walkable. So he must go around? Or use the adjacent empty tile to interact with the counter or the pot.\n\nBob is at (2,3) and wants to put his onion into the pot at (2,0). He has two options:\n\nOption 1: Go down to (2,2) -> but (2,2) is a kitchen counter and not walkable. So he cannot step on it.\n\nOption 2: He must go to a tile adjacent to the pot and facing the pot to interact. The pot at (2,0) is at (2,0). The adjacent tiles are:\n- (1,0): kitchen counter (non-empty, not walkable)\n- (3,0): kitchen counter (non-empty, not walkable)\n- (2,1): empty? (since not in the non-empty list) -> walkable.\n\nSo Bob can go to (2,1) and face down (south) to interact with the pot at (2,0). How?\n\nFrom (2,3) to (2,1): \n- First, move down to (2,2)? But (2,2) is a counter and not walkable. So he cannot go straight down. \n- Therefore, he must go around. The path: (2,3) -> (1,3) or (3,3) then down? \n\nThe tile (1,3) is not in the non-empty list -> walkable. Similarly, (3,3) is walkable. Then (1,2) and (3,2) are kitchen counters (non-empty). So:\n\nBob at (2,3):\n- Move left to (1,3) [L] -> now at (1,3)\n- Then move down to (1,2)? But (1,2) is a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters include (0,0) ... (1,4) -> (1,2) is not in the kitchen counter list? Wait, the list: \nKitchen Counter: [(0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)]\n\nSo (1,2) is not in the list -> so it's walkable? But we don't have information about (1,1) and (1,2). Since they are not in the non-empty list, they are empty and walkable.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> not walkable. So Bob can go:\n\n(2,3) -> L to (1,3) -> then D to (1,2) -> then D to (1,1) -> then R to (2,1). Then at (2,1), face down (D) to interact with the pot at (2,0). \n\nBut that is 4 moves and then an interact. Alternatively, from (1,2) he could go R to (2,2)? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter and not walkable. So he must go to (1,1) then to (2,1).\n\nAlternatively, from (2,3) he can go right to (3,3) [R] -> then D to (3,2)? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> not walkable. So he must go to (3,3) -> D to (3,2) is blocked, so then D to (3,1)? But we don't know about (3,1). It's not in the non-empty list, so walkable. Then from (3,1) to (2,1) [L]. Then at (2,1) face down to interact.\n\nThis is also 3 moves and then an interact: R, D, L, then I (with facing down). But note: when moving, we change orientation? The move action also changes orientation. So when Bob moves R to (3,3), he is now facing right? Then he moves D to (3,2) is blocked? Actually, we can only move to empty tiles. (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> not walkable. So he cannot move down to (3,2). Therefore, from (3,3) he can only move down to (3,2) if it were walkable? It's not. So he must go around the other way? \n\nWait, the tile (3,3) can move down? The tile below (3,3) is (3,2) which is a kitchen counter -> not walkable. So he cannot go down from (3,3). Therefore, the only way is to go left to (2,3) (which is occupied by Bob originally, but now he is at (3,3))? Or go down? Blocked. So he must go left to (2,3) -> but (2,3) is now empty? But we are at the next turn. \n\nActually, Bob is currently at (2,3). He can move left to (1,3) or right to (3,3) because both are empty? But (3,3) is empty? Yes. So:\n\nOption 1: Bob goes left to (1,3) [L] -> now at (1,3). Then from (1,3) he can move down to (1,2) [D] (since (1,2) is walkable). Then from (1,2) he can move down to (1,1) [D] (if (1,1) is walkable). Then from (1,1) move right to (2,1) [R]. Then at (2,1) he must face down (D) to interact with the pot at (2,0). But note: the move actions change his orientation. So when he moves down from (1,3) to (1,2), he is facing down. Then moving down to (1,1) he is still facing down. Then moving right to (2,1) he is facing right. Then he must change orientation to down (D) to face the pot, then interact (I). That's 4 moves and one change orientation? But the change orientation can be done in the same turn as the move? No, each turn one action.\n\nAlternatively, we can plan:\n\nTurn 75: Bob moves L to (1,3) [now facing left? Because move left changes orientation to left? The action: Move L changes position to (x-1,y) and orientation to L. So at (1,3) facing L.\n\nTurn 76: Bob moves D to (1,2) [and changes orientation to D? Because moving down changes orientation to down? So at (1,2) facing down.\n\nTurn 77: Bob moves D to (1,1) [facing down] -> at (1,1) facing down.\n\nTurn 78: Bob moves R to (2,1) [facing right] -> now at (2,1) facing right.\n\nBut the pot is at (2,0) which is below him. He is facing right, so he must change orientation to down to interact. So:\n\nTurn 79: Bob changes orientation to D (action D? But D is move down. We have to use the orientation change? The actions: we can move or change orientation. So to change orientation without moving, we use the orientation change action. So action D (which in the context of orientation change is down) would change his orientation to down without moving. Then:\n\nTurn 80: Bob interacts (I) to put the onion in the pot.\n\nThat's 5 turns for Bob to put one onion. And the pot at (2,0) would then have 2 onions (it had 1, now 2). Then we need one more onion.\n\nBut we have onions on counters. There is an onion at (2,2) which is adjacent to (2,1). But (2,2) is a kitchen counter and Bob is at (2,1). He is now facing down. The counter (2,2) is above him. So he can change orientation to up (U) and then interact to pick up the onion? But then he would have the onion and then he can put it in the pot? But the pot is below him. So:\n\nAfter turn 80, Bob is at (2,1) facing down, and the pot at (2,0) now has 2 onions. Bob is holding nothing (he put the onion). Now he can:\n\nTurn 81: Bob changes orientation to U (action U) to face up towards (2,2).\n\nTurn 82: Bob interacts (I) to pick up the onion from (2,2) [if it's still there]. Then he is holding an onion.\n\nTurn 83: Bob changes orientation to D (action D) to face the pot again.\n\nTurn 84: Bob interacts (I) to put the onion in the pot -> now the pot has 3 onions and starts cooking.\n\nThat would be 10 turns for Bob to complete the pot at (2,0). \n\nBut note: there are onions on counters. We don't need to get onions from the dispenser. We can use the ones on counters.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Alice help with the other pot and also with the plates.\n\nLet's look at Alice.\n\nAlice is at (5,2) holding nothing. She is facing Up.\n\nThe pot at (4,0) has 1 onion and needs 2 more. There is an onion on the kitchen counter at (4,2) which is adjacent to her? She is at (5,2) and (4,2) is to her left. She is facing Up. So she can:\n\nTurn 75: change orientation to L (left) to face (4,2). Then:\n\nTurn 76: interact (I) to pick up the onion from (4,2). Now she is holding an onion.\n\nThen she needs to put it in the pot at (4,0). How?\n\nThe pot at (4,0) is at (4,0). The adjacent walkable tile is (4,1). So she must go to (4,1) and face down to interact.\n\nFrom (5,2) to (4,1): \n\nOption: \n- Move left to (4,2) but (4,2) is a kitchen counter and not walkable. So she cannot step on it.\n- Therefore, she must go around: \n  (5,2) -> move down to (5,1) [D]? But (5,1): is it walkable? Not in non-empty list -> walkable. Then from (5,1) move left to (4,1) [L]. Then at (4,1) face down to interact.\n\nSteps:\n\nTurn 75: Alice changes orientation to L (to face the counter at (4,2))? Or she can just move? But to pick up the onion, she must be facing the counter. So:\n\nTurn 75: Alice changes orientation to L (so now facing left) at (5,2). \nTurn 76: Alice interacts (I) to pick up the onion from (4,2). Now holding onion.\nTurn 77: Alice moves down to (5,1) [D] -> facing down? (because move down changes orientation to down)\nTurn 78: Alice moves left to (4,1) [L] -> facing left? \nBut the pot is below (4,1). So she must face down to interact.\n\nTurn 79: Alice changes orientation to D (down) at (4,1).\nTurn 80: Alice interacts (I) to put the onion in the pot at (4,0). Now the pot at (4,0) has 2 onions.\n\nThen she can get another onion to complete it. There is an onion at (3,2) (kitchen counter). How to get it? She is at (4,1) holding nothing. The counter (3,2) is at (3,2). She is at (4,1). She can move to (3,1) then to (3,2)? But (3,2) is a counter and not walkable. So she must stand adjacent and face it.\n\nFrom (4,1) move left to (3,1) [L] (if (3,1) is walkable). Then at (3,1) face up (U) to interact with (3,2).\n\nBut note: (3,1) is not in the non-empty list -> walkable.\n\nSo:\nTurn 81: Alice moves left to (3,1) [L] -> facing left? \nTurn 82: Alice changes orientation to U (up) to face (3,2).\nTurn 83: Alice interacts (I) to pick up the onion from (3,2).\nTurn 84: Alice changes orientation to D (down) to face the pot? But the pot is at (4,0) which is below and to the right? She is at (3,1). The pot is at (4,0). To interact with the pot at (4,0) from (3,1) is not adjacent? The adjacent tiles to (4,0) are (4,1), (3,0), (5,0). (3,0) is a kitchen counter (non-empty) and (5,0) is also non-empty. So the only adjacent walkable tile is (4,1). Therefore, she must go to (4,1) and face down.\n\nFrom (3,1):\nTurn 85: Alice moves right to (4,1) [R] -> facing right.\nTurn 86: Alice changes orientation to D (down) to face the pot.\nTurn 87: Alice interacts (I) to put the onion -> now the pot at (4,0) has 3 onions and starts cooking.\n\nThat's 13 turns for Alice to complete the pot at (4,0). But we can do better.\n\nAlternatively, after Alice puts the first onion in the pot at (4,0) at turn 80 (so the pot has 2 onions), Bob could bring the last onion? But Bob is working on the other pot.\n\nWe can also use the onions on the counters near the pots.\n\nFor the pot at (4,0): there is an onion at (4,2) (which we already used) and at (3,2). Also, (2,2) has an onion but that's for the other pot.\n\nBut note: there is an onion at (3,4) and (1,4) and others. But they are farther.\n\nBut we are trying to minimize the time.\n\nAnother idea: since there are many onions on counters, we can have one player focus on one pot and the other on the other pot.\n\nBut Bob is closer to the pot at (2,0) and Alice to (4,0). \n\nWe also need to get plates and serve. The plate dispenser is at (0,2). The serving counter is at (6,2).\n\nAfter the pots are filled, they will cook for 5 turns. Then we need to get a plate and serve.\n\nSo let's plan:\n\nWe have two pots to fill. We can fill both as quickly as possible.\n\nBob's plan for the pot at (2,0):\n\nBob is at (2,3) holding an onion. He can put that onion in the pot by going to (2,1) and facing down. But as we saw, he must go around. However, note that there is a kitchen counter at (2,2) which has an onion. He cannot step on it, but he can interact with it from (2,1) or (2,3) or (1,2) or (3,2)? \n\nSpecifically, to interact with (2,2) from (2,3): he is above it. So if he is at (2,3) and faces down, he can interact with (2,2). But (2,2) is a kitchen counter. He is holding an onion. He cannot pick up because he is holding an item. He can place the onion on the counter? But the counter at (2,2) already has an onion? The non-empty kitchen counters include (2,2) having an onion. So it is occupied. He cannot place his onion there. Therefore, he must take the long route to (2,1).\n\nBut wait, he could first place his onion on an empty counter? There are no empty counters? All kitchen counters listed are occupied by onions. So we have to use an empty counter? But there are none. Or we can use a counter that is not occupied? But the non-empty kitchen counters are listed, so the others are empty? \n\nThe kitchen counters are fixed, but some are occupied and some are not? The environment says \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter\" and lists several with onions. So the other kitchen counters are empty? \n\nBut the list of kitchen counter tiles is given, and then it says \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter\" and lists the ones that have an item. So the other kitchen counters are empty? \n\nThe initial list of kitchen counter tiles: \n    [(0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)]\n\nAnd the non-empty ones are: (6,1), (6,3), (0,3), (4,2), (1,4), (3,4), (3,2). So the kitchen counters at (0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (2,2), (0,4), (5,4), (6,4) are empty? But (2,2) is listed as non-empty? No, wait: the non-empty list includes (2,2): \"Kitchen Counter on (2,2): contains a onion\". So (2,2) is occupied. Similarly, (3,2) and (4,2) are occupied. \n\nBut (0,0) is a kitchen counter and not listed as non-empty -> so it's empty. Similarly, (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (0,4), (5,4), (6,4) are empty.\n\nSo there are empty kitchen counters.\n\nBob could place his onion on an empty kitchen counter to free himself? But that might not be efficient.\n\nGiven the time, let's try to have both players fill the pots as fast as possible.\n\nBob's immediate action: he is at (2,3) holding an onion. He can go to (2,1) via (1,3) and (1,2) and (1,1) and (2,1) as before. But that's long. Is there a shorter path? \n\nFrom (2,3) to (2,1): but (2,2) is blocked. So he must go around. The shortest path is either via (1,3)->(1,2)->(1,1)->(2,1) or via (3,3)->(3,2) is blocked, so (3,3)->(3,1) is possible? But (3,2) is blocked. So:\n\n(2,3) -> (3,3) [R] -> then (3,3)->(3,1) is not adjacent. He must go (3,3)->(3,2) is blocked, so he can go (3,3)->(4,3) if (4,3) is walkable? But (4,3) is not in the non-empty list -> walkable. Then from (4,3) to (4,2) is blocked (kitchen counter), so then to (4,1) [D]? Then to (3,1) [L]? Then to (2,1) [L]. This is even longer.\n\nSo the shortest is via (1,3)->(1,2)->(1,1)->(2,1): 3 moves to (2,1) and then change orientation and interact.\n\nBut note: after the first move, he is at (1,3) and then he can move down to (1,2) and then he is at (1,2) facing down. At (1,2), he is adjacent to the kitchen counter at (2,2) to the east. He is facing down. He can change orientation to east (R) and then interact to place his onion on (2,2)? But (2,2) already has an onion -> so he cannot place. Or if he wants to pick up, he is holding an onion so he can't pick up.\n\nSo he must continue to (1,1) and (2,1).\n\nAlice has a shorter path to help with the pot at (4,0): she can pick up the onion at (4,2) in two turns (orient left and interact). Then she can go to (4,1) to put it in the pot. But to get to (4,1), she can go (5,2)->(5,1)->(4,1). Then at (4,1) face down to interact.\n\nSo for Alice:\n\nTurn 75: change orientation to L (to face (4,2))\nTurn 76: interact (I) to pick up onion from (4,2)\nTurn 77: move down to (5,1) [D] -> facing down\nTurn 78: move left to (4,1) [L] -> facing left\nTurn 79: change orientation to D (down) to face the pot\nTurn 80: interact (I) to put onion -> now pot at (4,0) has 2 onions.\n\nThen for the last onion, she can use the onion at (3,2) which is close. She is at (4,1) holding nothing.\n\nTurn 81: move left to (3,1) [L] -> facing left\nTurn 82: change orientation to U (up) to face (3,2)\nTurn 83: interact (I) to pick up onion from (3,2)\nTurn 84: move right to (4,1) [R] -> facing right\nTurn 85: change orientation to D (down) to face the pot\nTurn 86: interact (I) to put onion -> pot at (4,0) now has 3 onions and starts cooking at turn 86.\n\nThe cooking will finish at turn 86+5 = 91.\n\nMeanwhile, for Bob and the pot at (2,0):\n\nBob is at (2,3) holding an onion.\n\nTurn 75: move L to (1,3) [facing left]\nTurn 76: move D to (1,2) [facing down]\nTurn 77: move D to (1,1) [facing down]\nTurn 78: move R to (2,1) [facing right]\nTurn 79: change orientation to D (down) [action D]\nTurn 80: interact (I) to put onion in pot at (2,0) -> now pot has 2 onions.\n\nNow, he needs one more onion. There is an onion at (2,2) above him. He is at (2,1) facing down.\n\nTurn 81: change orientation to U (up) [action U]\nTurn 82: interact (I) to pick up onion from (2,2)\nTurn 83: change orientation to D (down) [action D]\nTurn 84: interact (I) to put onion in pot -> pot at (2,0) has 3 onions and starts cooking at turn 84.\n\nThis cooking will finish at turn 84+5 = 89.\n\nSo both pots will be cooking by turn 86 and 84.\n\nThen we need to serve. We need plates.\n\nThe plate dispenser is at (0,2). The serving counter is at (6,2).\n\nWe can have Alice and Bob get plates and serve the soups.\n\nAfter Alice finishes at turn 86, she is at (4,1) facing down. She can go to the plate dispenser at (0,2) and then to the pots to serve.\n\nSimilarly, Bob at turn 84 is at (2,1) facing down. He can go to the plate dispenser.\n\nBut we have two soups: one ready at turn 89 (pot at (2,0)) and one at turn 91 (pot at (4,0)).\n\nWe can have Bob serve the first soup and Alice the second.\n\nBob's plan after filling the pot at (2,0) at turn 84:\n\nHe is at (2,1) facing down. He needs a plate. Plate dispenser at (0,2). How to get there?\n\nPath: (2,1) -> (2,0) is a pot and not walkable. He can go to (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (0,3) [kitchen counter, empty?] -> then to (0,2) [plate dispenser]. But (0,2) is a dispenser and not walkable. So he must stand adjacent and face it. The adjacent walkable tiles to (0,2) are (0,1), (0,3), (1,2). \n\n(0,1) is a kitchen counter -> not walkable. (0,3) is a kitchen counter and has an onion -> not walkable. (1,2) is walkable? Yes.\n\nSo he must go to (1,2) and face west (left) to interact with the plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nFrom (2,1) to (1,2): \n- (2,1) to (1,1) [L] -> facing left\n- (1,1) to (1,2) [U] -> facing up\n\nThen at (1,2) facing up. But the dispenser is to the west. So he must change orientation to left (L).\n\nThen interact.\n\nSteps for Bob to get a plate:\n\nTurn 85: move L to (1,1) [facing left]\nTurn 86: move U to (1,2) [facing up]\nTurn 87: change orientation to L (left) to face the dispenser at (0,2)\nTurn 88: interact (I) to get a plate -> now holding a plate.\n\nThen he can go to the pot at (2,0) to get the soup. The soup will be ready at turn 89. So he must wait until turn 89? Or he can go to the pot and wait.\n\nAt turn 88, the soup is not ready (ready at 89). So he can:\n\nAfter turn 88, he is at (1,2) facing left, holding a plate.\n\nTurn 89: he can move to (2,2) but (2,2) is a counter and not walkable. So he must go to (2,1) and face down to interact with the pot.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (2,1): \n- Move right to (2,2) -> blocked. \n- Move down to (1,1) [D] -> then right to (2,1) [R]. \n\nSo:\nTurn 89: move D to (1,1) [facing down]\nTurn 90: move R to (2,1) [facing right]\nTurn 91: change orientation to D (down) to face the pot\nTurn 92: interact (I) to get the soup (if it's cooked and he is holding a plate) -> now holding a soup in plate.\n\nThen he must deliver to the serving counter at (6,2).\n\nPath from (2,1) to (6,2): \n- Go to (3,1) [R] -> (4,1) [R] -> (5,1) [R] -> (6,1) [R] -> then up to (6,2) [U]. But (6,1) is a kitchen counter and has an onion -> not walkable. So cannot go to (6,1).\n\nAlternative: \n- (2,1) -> (2,2) is blocked, so (2,1)->(3,1) [R] -> (4,1) [R] -> (5,1) [R] -> (5,2) [U] -> (6,2) is serving counter, but (6,2) is not walkable. So he must stand at (5,2) or (6,1) or (6,3) or (5,2) is adjacent? \n\nThe serving counter at (6,2) is adjacent to (5,2), (6,1), (6,3). (6,1) and (6,3) are kitchen counters and not walkable. (5,2) is walkable? It's not a non-empty tile? It's not in the kitchen counter list? The kitchen counters are at (5,0) and (5,4) -> so (5,2) is walkable.\n\nSo Bob can go to (5,2) and face east to interact with the serving counter at (6,2).\n\nFrom (2,1) to (5,2):\n- (2,1) -> (3,1) [R] -> (4,1) [R] -> (5,1) [R] -> (5,2) [U]. \n\nThen at (5,2) face east (R) and interact.\n\nSteps:\n\nTurn 93: move R to (3,1) [facing right]\nTurn 94: move R to (4,1) [facing right]\nTurn 95: move R to (5,1) [facing right]\nTurn 96: move U to (5,2) [facing up]\nTurn 97: change orientation to R (right) to face the serving counter\nTurn 98: interact (I) to deliver the soup.\n\nThat's a lot of turns. We are only planning for H turns. What is H? We are not given H. But we can plan for the near future.\n\nAlternatively, we might not need to plan that far. We can focus on the next few turns to fill the pots.\n\nSince we are at turn 74, and we are to plan a sequence for the next several turns, let's say H=10 or 20. But the problem says \"over next several turns\", so we can choose a horizon.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's plan for the next 10 turns (turns 75 to 84) for both players.\n\nWe'll have Alice and Bob work on filling the pots.\n\nAlice's actions:\n\nTurn 75: change orientation to L (to face the counter at (4,2))\nTurn 76: interact (I) to pick up onion from (4,2)\nTurn 77: move D to (5,1)\nTurn 78: move L to (4,1)\nTurn 79: change orientation to D (to face the pot at (4,0))\nTurn 80: interact (I) to put onion in pot (now pot has 2 onions)\nTurn 81: move L to (3,1) [to get closer to (3,2) for the next onion]\nTurn 82: change orientation to U (to face the counter at (3,2))\nTurn 83: interact (I) to pick up onion from (3,2)\nTurn 84: move R to (4,1) [to go back to the pot]\n\nThen on turn 85 she can change to down and interact to put the onion.\n\nBut we are only planning up to turn 84? So we can plan until she gets the onion.\n\nBob's actions:\n\nTurn 75: move L to (1,3)\nTurn 76: move D to (1,2)\nTurn 77: move D to (1,1)\nTurn 78: move R to (2,1)\nTurn 79: change orientation to D (to face the pot)\nTurn 80: interact (I) to put onion in pot (now pot at (2,0) has 2 onions)\nTurn 81: change orientation to U (to face up towards (2,2))\nTurn 82: interact (I) to pick up onion from (2,2)\nTurn 83: change orientation to D (to face the pot again)\nTurn 84: interact (I) to put onion in pot (now pot at (2,0) has 3 onions and starts cooking)\n\nSo by turn 84, Bob has filled the pot at (2,0) and it starts cooking.\n\nAlice by turn 84 has picked up the onion from (3,2) and is at (4,1) (from turn 84: move R to (4,1)). Then on turn 85 she can change to down and interact to put the onion, filling the pot at (4,0).\n\nBut we are only writing actions for turns 75 to 84.\n\nSo the actions for Alice from turn 75 to 84:\n\nTurn 75: L (orientation change to left)\nTurn 76: I (interact to pick up onion from (4,2))\nTurn 77: D (move down to (5,1))\nTurn 78: L (move left to (4,1))\nTurn 79: D (orientation change to down)\nTurn 80: I (put onion in pot at (4,0))\nTurn 81: L (move left to (3,1))\nTurn 82: U (orientation change to up)\nTurn 83: I (pick up onion from (3,2))\nTurn 84: R (move right to (4,1))\n\nFor Bob from turn 75 to 84:\n\nTurn 75: L (move left to (1,3))\nTurn 76: D (move down to (1,2))\nTurn 77: D (move down to (1,1))\nTurn 78: R (move right to (2,1))\nTurn 79: D (orientation change to down)\nTurn 80: I (put onion in pot at (2,0))\nTurn 81: U (orientation change to up)\nTurn 82: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\nTurn 83: D (orientation change to down)\nTurn 84: I (put onion in pot at (2,0))\n\nThis will complete the filling of the pot at (2,0) and partially fill the pot at (4,0).\n\nBut note: at turn 80, Bob puts an onion in the pot at (2,0) making it 2 onions. Then at turn 84, he puts another making it 3.\n\nFor Alice, at turn 80 she puts an onion in (4,0) making it 2 onions. Then she picks up another onion and moves to (4,1) by turn 84. On turn 85, she can put it in.\n\nWe are to output only Alice's actions? The problem says \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can output Alice's actions and if needed Bob's. But the example output only shows one set of actions. Probably we are to output Alice's actions.\n\nThe problem: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice\"\n\nSo we output Alice's actions for turns 75 to 84.\n\nBut let's double-check the positions and orientations.\n\nAlice at turn 74: (5,2) facing U, holding nothing.\n\nTurn 75: change orientation to L -> now at (5,2) facing L.\nTurn 76: interact (I) -> since facing L, adjacent left is (4,2) which is a kitchen counter with an onion -> she picks up the onion. Now holding onion.\nTurn 77: move D to (5,1) -> now at (5,1) facing D.\nTurn 78: move L to (4,1) -> now at (4,1) facing L (because move left changes orientation to left).\nTurn 79: change orientation to D -> now facing down (towards the pot at (4,0)).\nTurn 80: interact (I) -> put onion in pot. Now holding nothing. Pot at (4,0) now has 2 onions.\nTurn 81: move L to (3,1) -> now at (3,1) facing L.\nTurn 82: change orientation to U -> facing up towards (3,2) which is a kitchen counter with an onion.\nTurn 83: interact (I) -> pick up the onion. Now holding onion.\nTurn 84: move R to (4,1) -> now at (4,1) facing R.\n\nThis is valid.\n\nWe don't need to output Bob's actions, but if we are only doing Alice, then we are done.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\", so we might need to consider Bob's actions to avoid conflict? But the output is only for Alice.\n\nSo we output Alice's actions for the next 10 turns (75 to 84).\n\nBut note: at turn 78, Alice moves to (4,1). Is there any conflict with Bob? Bob is at turn 78: move R to (2,1). So they are not at the same position.\n\nSimilarly, at other turns.\n\nTherefore, the sequence for Alice:\n\nTurn 75: L  \nTurn 76: I  \nTurn 77: D  \nTurn 78: L  \nTurn 79: D  \nTurn 80: I  \nTurn 81: L  \nTurn 82: U  \nTurn 83: I  \nTurn 84: R  \n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut the turn numbers: we start at t_1=74, so the next turns are 75,76,...,84.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 75: L\nTurn 76: I\nTurn 77: D\nTurn 78: L\nTurn 79: D\nTurn 80: I\nTurn 81: L\nTurn 82: U\nTurn 83: I\nTurn 84: R\n}\n\nThis is for Alice.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice and Bob should focus on completing the two partially filled pots (each with 1 onion) by adding the remaining onions from nearby kitchen counters. The goal is to fill both pots to 3 onions to start cooking, as each completed recipe yields a reward of 20. Alice will handle the pot at (4,0), while Bob focuses on the pot at (2,0). Alice's actions for turns 75–84 are optimized to efficiently pick up onions from counters and deliver them to the pot at (4,0), leveraging her current position and available resources.\n\n### Alice's Action Plan (Turns 75–84):\n- **Turn 75 (L)**: Change orientation to left (to face the kitchen counter at (4,2), which has an onion).\n- **Turn 76 (I)**: Interact to pick up the onion from (4,2). Alice now holds an onion.\n- **Turn 77 (D)**: Move down to (5,1) (empty tile) to approach the pot at (4,0).\n- **Turn 78 (L)**: Move left to (4,1) (empty tile), now adjacent to the pot.\n- **Turn 79 (D)**: Change orientation to down (to face the pot at (4,0)).\n- **Turn 80 (I)**: Interact to place the onion in the pot. Pot now has 2 onions. Alice holds nothing.\n- **Turn 81 (L)**: Move left to (3,1) (empty tile) to approach the next onion at (3,2).\n- **Turn 82 (U)**: Change orientation to up (to face the kitchen counter at (3,2), which has an onion).\n- **Turn 83 (I)**: Interact to pick up the onion from (3,2). Alice now holds an onion.\n- **Turn 84 (R)**: Move right to (4,1) (empty tile) to return to the pot for the next action.\n\n### Coordination with Bob:\n- **Bob's Role**: Bob (at (2,3) holding an onion) will fill the pot at (2,0). His path:  \n  - Turns 75–78: Move to (2,1) via (1,3), (1,2), (1,1).  \n  - Turns 79–84: Place onion, pick up another from (2,2), and place it to complete the pot (3 onions) by turn 84.  \n- **Conflict Avoidance**: Alice and Bob operate in separate areas (Alice near (4,0), Bob near (2,0)), minimizing interference. By turn 84, Bob's pot starts cooking (ready at turn 89), and Alice is positioned to place her onion in the pot at (4,0) on turn 85 (starting cook at turn 90).  \n- **Next Steps (Post-Turn 84)**:  \n  - Alice: On turn 85, change orientation down and interact to place onion (pot at (4,0) starts cooking).  \n  - Both players: Fetch plates from (0,2) and serve cooked soups at (6,2) after 5-turn cook time (turns 89 and 90).\n\nThis sequence ensures both pots are filled efficiently, starting the cooking process to maximize rewards. Alice's actions are optimized for minimal movement and leveraging existing onions on counters.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 75: L\nTurn 76: I\nTurn 77: D\nTurn 78: L\nTurn 79: D\nTurn 80: I\nTurn 81: L\nTurn 82: U\nTurn 83: I\nTurn 84: R\n}",

The goal is to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes.\n\nGiven the recipe information:\n- Only one recipe: 3 onions, 0 tomatoes; reward 20; cooking time 5 turns.\n\nCurrent game state:\n- Alice (me): at (4,1), facing left, holding nothing.\n- Bob: at (1,3), facing left, holding nothing.\n\nKitchen counters have many onions (8 in total, but we don't need to count because we have dispensers and pots that are partially filled).\n\nPots:\n- (4,0): 1 onion (not full, cooking not started)\n- (2,0): 1 onion (not full, cooking not started)\n\nWe have onion dispensers at (2,4) and (4,4).\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nServing counter at (6,2).\n\nPlan:\nWe have two pots that already have 1 onion each. We need to add 2 more onions to each pot to make a complete soup (3 onions). Then each soup will take 5 turns to cook. After cooking, we need to serve them with a plate.\n\nWe are at turn 77. Let's plan for the next several turns (say H=20 turns) to complete as many soups as possible.\n\nWe note that the two pots are at (2,0) and (4,0). They are both on the bottom row.\n\nAlice is at (4,1) which is just above the pot at (4,0). She is facing left, so she is facing west. The pot at (4,0) is directly below her. To interact with the pot below, she must face down. So she needs to change orientation to down and then interact.\n\nBut note: she is holding nothing. So she cannot add an ingredient to the pot. She must first pick up an onion.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (1,3) which is above the pot at (2,0) but not directly adjacent. He is also holding nothing.\n\nWe have many onions on kitchen counters, but we also have onion dispensers.\n\nGiven the positions, it might be efficient to use the onions on the counters to avoid going to the dispensers.\n\nLook at the kitchen counters with onions:\n- (6,1): onion\n- (6,3): onion\n- (0,3): onion\n- (4,2): onion  (this is very close to Alice at (4,1))\n- (1,4): onion\n- (3,4): onion\n- (3,2): onion\n- (2,2): onion\n\nAlice is at (4,1). The counter at (4,2) is directly above her. She is facing left. To pick up the onion at (4,2), she must move to a tile adjacent to (4,2) and face it. Currently, she is at (4,1) which is adjacent to (4,2) (south of it). But she is facing left (west). So she needs to face up (U) to interact with (4,2). Then she can pick up the onion.\n\nAlternatively, she could move up to (4,2) but note: (4,2) is a kitchen counter and non-empty (has an onion). Players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles. So she cannot step on (4,2). Therefore, she must be adjacent and facing it.\n\nSo from (4,1), she can face up (change orientation to U) and then interact to pick up the onion at (4,2).\n\nThen, she can turn down (change orientation to D) and then interact with the pot at (4,0) to add the onion.\n\nBut note: the pot at (4,0) currently has 1 onion. Adding one more would make it 2. Then we need a third onion.\n\nAlternatively, we can plan to have Alice and Bob work together to complete both pots.\n\nHowever, Bob is at (1,3). He can go to a nearby onion: for example, at (2,2) or (3,2) or (1,4). Let's see:\n\n- (1,4) is adjacent to (1,3)? (1,3) is at y=3, (1,4) is at y=4. So (1,4) is above (1,3). Bob is facing left. So he can move up to (1,4) but note: (1,4) is a kitchen counter and has an onion. He cannot walk onto it. So he must stand adjacent and face it. Currently at (1,3), he is adjacent to (1,4) (south of it). He needs to face up to interact. Then he can pick up the onion.\n\nThen he can go to the pot at (2,0). How? He would need to go from (1,3) to (2,3) to (2,2) to (2,1) to (2,0). But note: (2,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion, so he cannot step on (2,2). So the path might be: (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) is blocked? Actually, he can go (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) is not allowed because (2,2) is non-empty. Alternatively: (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) is blocked? (3,2) is non-empty. So he must avoid stepping on counters.\n\nLook at the grid:\n\nThe kitchen counters are at:\n[(0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)]\n\nSo the walkable tiles are the ones not in the above and not the dispensers, pots, or serving counter.\n\nWe have:\n- Onion dispensers: (2,4), (4,4) -> these are non-empty? Actually, dispensers are always there and cannot be walked on? The problem says: non-empty tiles cannot be walked on. Dispensers are non-empty? Actually, the tile types are fixed. The problem says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles include dispensers, pots, serving counters, and kitchen counters that have items? But note: the kitchen counter without an item is walkable? The problem says: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and when it is occupied, it is non-empty. So when it has an item, it is non-empty and not walkable. When it is empty, it is walkable? Actually, the problem says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are defined as having an item? But the tile types are fixed: dispensers, pots, serving counters are always non-empty? And kitchen counters are non-empty when they have an item.\n\nSo the grid has:\n- Empty tiles: walkable.\n- Dispensers: non-empty and not walkable.\n- Pot: non-empty and not walkable? But when the pot is empty, is it walkable? The problem doesn't specify. But typically in Overcooked, pots are not walkable. Similarly, dispensers and serving counters are not walkable.\n\nSo we assume that the only walkable tiles are the empty tiles and the kitchen counters that are empty? But note: the kitchen counter when empty is still a tile of type \"kitchen counter\", but without an item. The problem says: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and it can be empty. So when empty, is it walkable? The problem says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So if a tile is non-empty (has an item or is a dispenser/pot/serving counter) then it's not walkable. But if a kitchen counter is empty, then it is walkable? The problem does not explicitly say. However, in the action \"Interact\", we can interact with a kitchen counter only when we are adjacent and facing. So if we are standing on a kitchen counter, we cannot interact with it? Because we are on it. Therefore, players cannot stand on kitchen counters? So they are not walkable.\n\nTherefore, all the tiles that are not empty (i.e., the ones that are dispensers, pots, serving counters, and kitchen counters) are not walkable. So the only walkable tiles are the empty ones.\n\nNow, let's map the grid (7x5? because x from 0 to 6 and y from 0 to 4?).\n\nWe need to plan movement accordingly.\n\nAlice at (4,1). She can pick up the onion at (4,2) by:\n- Turning to face up (U) and then interact (I). Then she will have an onion.\n\nThen she can turn down (D) and interact (I) to put the onion into the pot at (4,0). Then the pot at (4,0) will have 2 onions.\n\nThen she needs another onion to complete that pot. She can go to a nearby onion counter? The closest are:\n- (4,2) is now empty? Because she took the onion. But note: after she picks it up, the counter becomes empty. So then (4,2) is walkable? But it's a kitchen counter and now empty. But we decided kitchen counters are not walkable regardless? Actually, the problem says \"non-empty\" tiles cannot be walked on. So if a kitchen counter is empty, is it walkable? The problem does not specify. To be safe, assume that all non-empty tiles (with an item) are not walkable, but when the kitchen counter is empty, it becomes walkable? But then we can stand on it and we cannot interact with it because we are standing on it? So it's better to avoid walking on it.\n\nBut in the game, typically you cannot stand on counters. So let's assume that kitchen counters (even empty) are not walkable. Therefore, the only walkable tiles are the ones that are of type \"empty tile\".\n\nSo Alice at (4,1). After taking the onion at (4,2) and putting it in the pot at (4,0), she now needs another onion. The next closest onion is at (3,2) or (2,2) or (3,4) etc.\n\nBut note: there is an onion dispenser at (4,4). She can go to (4,3) and face up to get an onion from the dispenser? But (4,4) is an onion dispenser. She must be adjacent and facing it. So from (4,3) (which is an empty tile? we need to check) she can face up and interact to get an onion.\n\nBut first, after putting the onion in the pot, she is at (4,1) holding nothing. She can move:\n- Up to (4,2) is not possible because it's a kitchen counter and now empty? But we assume kitchen counters are not walkable. So she must go around.\n\nThe grid:\n\nRow y=0: [K, K, P, K, P, K, K]  (K: kitchen counter, P: pot) -> all non-walkable.\nRow y=1: [K, empty, empty, empty, empty, empty, K]  -> (0,1) and (6,1) are kitchen counters (non-walkable). (1,1) to (5,1) are walkable? But (1,1) is not in the kitchen counter list? The kitchen counters at y=1 are (0,1) and (6,1). So (1,1) to (5,1) are empty? But we don't have information about every tile. We know the non-empty tiles (which are not walkable) and the empty tiles (walkable). But we don't have a full grid layout. We must assume that any tile not listed as a non-empty tile (i.e., not in the kitchen counter with item, dispenser, pot, serving counter) is walkable? Actually, the problem says \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles are the ones we are told: dispensers, pots, serving counters, and kitchen counters that have items. So the rest are walkable.\n\nBut note: there are also empty kitchen counters? We don't know. The list of kitchen counters provided are the ones that are non-empty? Actually, the problem says \"Non-empty Kitchen Counter\" and lists them. So there might be empty kitchen counters that are walkable? But the problem doesn't list them. However, the tile type \"Kitchen Counter\" is fixed, and if it is empty, then it doesn't have an item, so it is not non-empty? So we can walk on it? But then we cannot interact with it because we are standing on it. So it's better not to.\n\nTo avoid confusion, we will plan paths that only use the empty tiles (which are not of any non-empty type).\n\nAlice at (4,1). She can move:\n- Left to (3,1) -> which is empty? We don't know. We have to assume that if not listed, then it's walkable. Similarly, (5,1) is not listed as non-empty, so it's walkable.\n\nBut we know the non-empty tiles from the lists. So any coordinate not in the non-empty lists is walkable.\n\nNon-empty tiles (non-walkable) are:\n- Kitchen counters with items: (0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)\n- Onion dispensers: (2,4), (4,4)\n- Plate dispenser: (0,2)\n- Pots: (2,0), (4,0)\n- Serving counter: (6,2)\n\nSo any other coordinate is walkable.\n\nTherefore, (3,1) is walkable? We don't see it in the non-empty list, so yes.\n\nSo Alice at (4,1) can move:\n- Left to (3,1)\n- Right to (5,1) -> walkable? not in the non-empty list, so yes.\n- Up: (4,2) is non-empty (kitchen counter with onion) -> not walkable.\n- Down: (4,0) is a pot -> not walkable.\n\nSo she can move left or right or stay.\n\nAfter she puts the onion in the pot at (4,0), she is at (4,1). To get another onion, she can go to the onion dispenser at (4,4). How?\n- From (4,1), move up: not possible (blocked by (4,2)). So she must go around.\nOne way: go left to (3,1), then up to (3,2) -> but (3,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion -> not walkable. So she cannot go to (3,2). Similarly, (4,2) is blocked.\n\nAlternative: go right to (5,1), then up to (5,2) -> (5,2) is not in the non-empty list? Let's check: kitchen counters are at (5,0) and (5,4) and (6,0) etc. (5,2) is not listed as non-empty, so it's walkable. Then from (5,2) she can go up to (5,3) -> walkable? (5,3) not listed -> walkable. Then up to (5,4) -> non-empty (kitchen counter with onion) -> not walkable. So she can go to (5,3). Then she can go left to (4,3) -> walkable? (4,3) not listed -> walkable. Then from (4,3) she can face up to interact with the onion dispenser at (4,4).\n\nSo the path for Alice: \n- From (4,1) to (5,1) (R), then (5,2) (U), then (5,3) (U), then (4,3) (L). Then face up (U) and interact to get an onion.\n\nBut that is 4 moves and then interact. Then she must go back to the pot at (4,0). From (4,3) she can go down to (4,2) -> but (4,2) is non-empty (even though she took the onion, it's still a kitchen counter? and now it's empty? But the problem says the tile is a kitchen counter, and when empty we don't know if it becomes walkable. But to be safe, we avoid. So she must go from (4,3) to (4,2) is blocked. So she must go (4,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) is blocked -> so (3,3) to (3,2) not possible. Alternatively, (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (5,2) -> (5,1) -> (4,1). Then from (4,1) she can face down and interact with the pot.\n\nBut note: at (4,1) the pot is below her, so facing down and interact.\n\nSo that would be 4 moves to get to (4,3), then 4 moves back to (4,1) -> 8 moves plus two interacts (get onion and put in pot). And we haven't started the cooking.\n\nThis seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, after Alice puts the first onion (from (4,2)) into the pot at (4,0), she can get an onion from a closer kitchen counter. For example, (3,2) has an onion. How to get to (3,2)? She cannot step on it. So she must stand adjacent. The adjacent tiles are (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), (4,2). But (4,2) is non-empty (kitchen counter) and not walkable. (2,2) is non-empty. (3,1) and (3,3) are walkable.\n\nSo from (4,1) she can move left to (3,1). Then face up to interact with (3,2). But (3,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion. So at (3,1), facing up (U), she can interact to pick up the onion at (3,2). Then she can move down to (3,0) is blocked (it's a kitchen counter). So she must go back to (3,1) and then right to (4,1). Then face down and interact with the pot.\n\nThis is only 2 moves (left to (3,1) and then right back to (4,1)) plus two interacts (pick up and put in pot). So this is better.\n\nSo plan for Alice:\nTurn 77: Face up (U) to pick up the onion at (4,2). But note: she is at (4,1) and facing left. To interact with (4,2) which is above her, she must face up. So first change orientation to U. But the action is either a move or a change orientation or interact. So:\n\nAt turn 77: change orientation to U (action U) -> now facing up. Then she can interact.\n\nBut the action per turn: we can only do one action. So:\n\nTurn 77: change orientation to U (so action U) -> now facing up.\nTurn 78: interact (I) -> picks up onion from (4,2). Now holding onion.\nTurn 79: change orientation to D (action D) -> facing down.\nTurn 80: interact (I) -> puts onion into pot at (4,0). Now the pot has 2 onions. Alice holding nothing.\n\nThen:\nTurn 81: move left to (3,1) (action L).\nTurn 82: change orientation to U (action U) -> facing up to (3,2).\nTurn 83: interact (I) -> picks up onion from (3,2). Now holding onion.\nTurn 84: move right to (4,1) (action R).\nTurn 85: change orientation to D (action D) -> facing down.\nTurn 86: interact (I) -> puts onion into pot at (4,0). Now the pot has 3 onions -> cooking starts. It will be ready at turn 77 + 5 + ... wait, we are at turn 86. So it will be ready at turn 86 + 5 = 91.\n\nBut note: the pot starts cooking automatically when the third onion is added. So at turn 86, the pot starts cooking and will be ready at turn 91.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can work on the other pot at (2,0). Bob is at (1,3). He can pick up an onion from (1,4) or (2,2) or (0,3) or (3,2) etc.\n\nClosest: (1,4) is above him. He is at (1,3) and facing left. So he can change orientation to up (U) and then interact to pick up the onion at (1,4).\n\nThen he can go to the pot at (2,0). How? He must go down to (1,2) (if walkable) then to (2,2) is blocked, so he must go around. The path: (1,3) -> (1,2) (if walkable) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,0) is a pot, not walkable. So he must stand adjacent to the pot. The pot at (2,0) is adjacent to (2,1) (north), (1,0) (east? no, (1,0) is west? Actually, (1,0) is left of (2,0)? (1,0) is at x=1, y=0; (2,0) at x=2, y=0. So adjacent tiles: (2,1) [north], (1,0) [west], (3,0) [east]. But (1,0) and (3,0) are kitchen counters (non-walkable). So the only adjacent tile is (2,1). So Bob must be at (2,1) and face down to interact with the pot.\n\nSo Bob must go to (2,1). From (1,3) to (2,1): \n- (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1). \n- (1,2): not in non-empty list -> walkable.\n- (1,1): not in non-empty list -> walkable.\n- (2,1): not in non-empty list -> walkable.\n\nSo:\nBob at (1,3):\nTurn 77: change orientation to U (to face up for (1,4)) -> action U.\nTurn 78: interact (I) -> pick up onion from (1,4). Now holding onion.\nTurn 79: move down to (1,2) -> action D.\nTurn 80: move down to (1,1) -> action D.\nTurn 81: move right to (2,1) -> action R.\nTurn 82: change orientation to D (to face the pot at (2,0)) -> action D.\nTurn 83: interact (I) -> put onion in pot. Now the pot at (2,0) has 2 onions (since it already had 1). So now it has 2.\n\nThen Bob needs to get another onion for that pot. He can pick up another onion from a nearby counter, e.g., (2,2) is adjacent to (2,1)? (2,2) is north of (2,1). So from (2,1), he can face up (U) and interact to pick up the onion at (2,2). Then he can interact again with the pot (face down and interact) to put the onion.\n\nSo:\nTurn 84: change orientation to U (action U) -> facing up to (2,2).\nTurn 85: interact (I) -> pick up onion from (2,2).\nTurn 86: change orientation to D (action D) -> facing down.\nTurn 87: interact (I) -> put onion in pot at (2,0). Now the pot has 3 onions -> cooking starts at turn 87. Ready at turn 87+5=92.\n\nNow, we have two soups cooking: one at (4,0) ready at turn 91, and one at (2,0) ready at turn 92.\n\nWe need plates to serve them. There is a plate dispenser at (0,2). We need to get plates and then serve at (6,2).\n\nAlice is free at turn 86 (after she put the third onion in the pot at (4,0)) and Bob at turn 87.\n\nAlice can get a plate and serve the soup at (4,0) when it's ready. Similarly, Bob can get a plate for the other soup.\n\nBut note: we need to be at the pot with a plate to serve the soup (which means picking up the soup in a plate). Then take it to the serving counter.\n\nSo for the pot at (4,0): when the soup is ready (turn 91), Alice can be at (4,1) facing down and interact to pick up the soup (if she has a plate). But she needs to have a plate.\n\nSo before turn 91, Alice must get a plate.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2). Alice is at (4,1) at turn 86. How to get to (0,2)? \n\nPath: (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) is a kitchen counter (non-walkable). So she cannot go to (0,1). Alternative: go up? But (4,2) is blocked. So she must go: (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) is blocked -> so (3,1) to (3,0) is blocked. So she must go via (5,1) etc.\n\nAlternatively, she can go to (0,2) from above? \n\nThe plate dispenser at (0,2) is non-walkable. Adjacent tiles: (0,1) (south) -> non-walkable (kitchen counter with onion? but (0,1) is listed as non-empty). (0,3) (north) -> non-walkable (kitchen counter with onion). (1,2) (east) -> walkable? (1,2) not in non-empty list -> walkable.\n\nSo the only adjacent tile is (1,2). So Alice must be at (1,2) and face left to interact with the plate dispenser.\n\nSo path to (1,2): \nFrom (4,1): \n- Left to (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2). \n- (1,1) is walkable? yes. (1,2) is walkable? yes.\n\nSo:\nTurn 86: Alice moves left to (3,1) [L]\nTurn 87: left to (2,1) [L] -> but at turn 87, Bob is at (2,1) putting the onion in the pot? Bob is at (2,1) at turn 83? Then he does actions 84-87 at (2,1) and (2,1) is occupied? Players cannot walk through each other.\n\nProblem: at turn 83, Bob is at (2,1) and stays there until turn 87? He is at (2,1) from turn 81 to ... \n- Turn 81: Bob moves to (2,1) -> now at (2,1)\n- Turn 82: change orientation to D (still at (2,1))\n- Turn 83: interact (still at (2,1))\n- Turn 84: change orientation to U (still at (2,1))\n- Turn 85: interact (still at (2,1))\n- Turn 86: change orientation to D (still at (2,1))\n- Turn 87: interact (still at (2,1))\n\nSo Alice cannot move to (2,1) until Bob leaves. But Bob is at (2,1) until at least turn 87.\n\nSo at turn 87, Bob is at (2,1) and Alice is at (3,1). Then on turn 88, Bob can move away. But we need to coordinate.\n\nAlternatively, Alice can take a different path? But the only path to (1,2) is through (2,1) or via the top? But (3,1) to (3,2) is blocked. So she must go via (2,1). So she must wait until Bob leaves (2,1).\n\nBut Bob is free at turn 88? After turn 87, Bob is done with the pot. He can then go to get a plate for the other soup.\n\nSo at turn 88, Bob can move away from (2,1). For example, he can go to (1,1) to make room.\n\nSo let's adjust:\n\nAt turn 87 (Bob's last action at (2,1)), then:\nTurn 88: Bob moves to (1,1) (action L) -> now (2,1) is free.\nThen Alice can move:\nTurn 88: Alice moves from (3,1) to (2,1) [L] -> now at (2,1)\nTurn 89: Alice moves to (1,1) -> but Bob is at (1,1) at turn 88? So conflict.\n\nWe need to coordinate the movement.\n\nAfter Bob finishes at (2,1) at turn 87, he can move to (3,1) or (1,1) or (2,0) is blocked. So he can move to (3,1) but Alice is at (3,1) at turn 87? \n\nTimeline:\n\nTurn 86: Alice at (3,1) [after moving left from (4,1) at turn 86? Actually, at turn 86: Alice is at (4,1) and moves left to (3,1). So at turn 86: Alice moves to (3,1). Bob is at (2,1) for turns 86 and 87.\n\nTurn 87: Bob is at (2,1) and does interact (put the third onion). Alice is at (3,1) and does what? We haven't planned for Alice at turn 87. At turn 87, Alice is at (3,1). She could wait (S) or try to move, but (2,1) is occupied.\n\nSo at turn 87: Alice stays (S) to avoid conflict.\n\nThen at turn 88: Bob moves to (1,1) (action L) -> now Bob at (1,1). (2,1) free.\nAlice moves to (2,1) (action R) -> but wait, (2,1) is adjacent to (3,1)? Yes, left. So action L? But from (3,1) to (2,1) is left? Actually, (3,1) to (2,1) is left (x decreases). So action L.\n\nThen at turn 89: Alice moves to (1,1) -> but Bob is at (1,1) at turn 88 and 89? So conflict.\n\nAlternatively, Bob at turn 88 moves to (3,1) but that is where Alice is? At turn 87, Alice is at (3,1). So at turn 88, if Bob moves to (3,1), it would be occupied by Alice? So he cannot.\n\nSo Bob should move to (1,1) and then Alice to (2,1) at turn 88. Then at turn 89, Bob moves to (1,2) [U] and Alice moves to (1,1) [L]? But (1,1) is where Bob was, but Bob moved to (1,2) at turn 89.\n\nSo:\nTurn 88: \n- Bob moves left to (1,1) [L] \n- Alice moves left to (2,1) [L] -> now Alice at (2,1), Bob at (1,1)\n\nTurn 89:\n- Bob moves up to (1,2) [U] -> now Bob at (1,2)\n- Alice moves left to (1,1) [L] -> now Alice at (1,1)\n\nBut (1,1) is free at turn 89 because Bob moved away.\n\nThen Alice at (1,1) at turn 89. She can then move up to (1,2) at turn 90? But Bob is at (1,2) at turn 89. So turn 90: Bob can move away? Or Alice can go to (1,2) only if Bob moves.\n\nBut Alice needs to go to (1,2) to interact with the plate dispenser at (0,2). So she must be at (1,2) and face left.\n\nSo at turn 89: Alice is at (1,1). She can move up to (1,2) at turn 90, but Bob is at (1,2) until when? Bob is at (1,2) at turn 89. Bob can then move to (1,3) or (2,2) (blocked) or (0,2) blocked. So he can move to (1,3) [D]? But (1,3) is walkable.\n\nSo:\nTurn 90: \n- Bob moves down to (1,3) [D] \n- Alice moves up to (1,2) [U]\n\nThen at turn 91: Alice at (1,2) and can change orientation to left (L) to face the plate dispenser at (0,2). Then interact.\n\nBut we are at turn 91, and the soup at (4,0) is ready at turn 91. So Alice must be at the pot at (4,0) at turn 91 to serve it? But she is at (1,2) at turn 91.\n\nSo she won't be able to serve until later.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Bob get the plate for the first soup and Alice stay near the pot.\n\nBut let's see the timing.\n\nGiven the complexity, we might need to plan for one soup at a time.\n\nGiven the time, let's focus on the first soup at (4,0) ready at turn 91.\n\nAlice should be near the pot at turn 91 with a plate.\n\nSo she must get a plate before turn 91.\n\nFrom turn 86 (when she finished at (4,1)) to turn 91: 5 turns.\n\nThe path to the plate dispenser and back:\n\nFrom (4,1) to (1,2): \n- (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2): 4 moves.\n\nThen at (1,2), interact to get plate: one action (interact).\n\nThen back to (4,1): \n- (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1): 4 moves.\n\nTotal: 4+1+4 = 9 moves, but we have only 5 turns (86 to 90 inclusive? turns 86,87,88,89,90 -> 5 turns). So not enough.\n\nAlternatively, after getting the plate at (1,2), she can go directly to (4,0) to serve? But she must be at (4,1) to interact with the pot.\n\nSo she must be at (4,1) at turn 91.\n\nShe can get the plate at turn 90 and then move to (4,1) by turn 91? But from (1,2) to (4,1) in one turn? Impossible.\n\nTherefore, we need to start getting the plate earlier.\n\nPerhaps Alice should get the plate before the soup is ready.\n\nIn our initial plan, Alice was busy until turn 86. The soup is ready at turn 91. She has turns 87-90 to get the plate and return.\n\nBut as calculated, it takes 9 actions to get the plate and return to (4,1). She has only 4 turns (87,88,89,90) -> 4 actions. So she can only do 4 actions. That is enough to get to (1,2) but not back.\n\nSo she cannot do it alone.\n\nWe need Bob to help with the plates.\n\nBob is free after turn 87. He can get a plate for the soup at (2,0) which is ready at turn 92, but also for the first soup? But he is at (2,1) at turn 87.\n\nFor the soup at (4,0) ready at turn 91, Bob can try to get the plate.\n\nBob at turn 87 is at (2,1). He can go to (1,2) to get a plate.\n\nPath: (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2): 2 moves.\nThen at (1,2), face west and interact to get plate: one action.\nThen he needs to go to (4,1) to serve the soup at (4,0)? But that's far.\n\nAlternatively, Alice can serve the soup at (4,0) if she has the plate. But she doesn't. So Bob can bring the plate to the pot at (4,0)? But he is at (1,2) after getting the plate.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (4,1): 3 moves (right to (2,2) blocked, so (1,2)->(1,1)->(2,1)->(3,1)->(4,1): 4 moves.\n\nSo total for Bob to get plate and go to (4,1): 2+1+4 = 7 actions. From turn 87 to turn 91 (5 turns: 87,88,89,90,91) -> 5 actions. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, Alice can get the plate while Bob does his tasks, but then she would be away when the soup is ready.\n\nGiven the time constraints, it might be better to have one player focus on plates and serving, and the other on ingredients.\n\nBut both soups are being cooked, and we have limited time.\n\nPerhaps we can have one soup served by Alice and the other by Bob.\n\nFor the soup at (4,0) ready at turn 91:\n- Alice can be at (4,1) at turn 91 with a plate.\n\nBut how does the plate get there? Alice can get the plate earlier and then return.\n\nBut as above, she doesn't have time.\n\nAnother idea: after Alice finishes adding the last onion to the pot at (4,0) at turn 86, she immediately goes for the plate. She doesn't help with the other pot.\n\nSo Alice at turn 86: at (4,1) holding nothing.\nShe goes to get a plate:\nTurn 86: move left to (3,1) [L]\nTurn 87: move left to (2,1) [L] -> but Bob is at (2,1) until turn 87. So at turn 87, Bob is still at (2,1) (doing interact for the third onion). So Alice cannot move to (2,1) at turn 87. She must wait.\n\nTurn 86: Alice to (3,1)\nTurn 87: Alice stays (S) because (2,1) is occupied.\nTurn 88: Alice moves to (2,1) [L] -> now at (2,1)\nTurn 89: Alice moves to (1,1) [L]\nTurn 90: Alice moves to (1,2) [U]\nTurn 91: Alice changes orientation to left (L) and interact (I) to get plate. Now holding plate.\n\nBut the soup at (4,0) is ready at turn 91, but Alice is at (1,2) and doesn't have the plate until turn 91. Then she must go back to (4,1) to serve. That takes 4 moves: (1,2)->(1,1)->(2,1)->(3,1)->(4,1) -> 4 turns (92,93,94,95). Then at turn 95, she can serve the soup.\n\nBut the soup might burn? The problem doesn't say, but typically in Overcooked, soup doesn't burn. It stays until served.\n\nSo that's acceptable.\n\nThen for the other soup at (2,0) ready at turn 92, Bob can serve it.\n\nBob is free after turn 87. He can go to get a plate for himself.\n\nBob at turn 88: at (2,1) holding nothing.\nHe can go to (1,2) to get a plate:\nTurn 88: move left to (1,1) [L]\nTurn 89: move up to (1,2) [U]\nTurn 90: change orientation to left (L) and interact (I) to get plate. Now holding plate at turn 90.\nThen he can stay there or move to the pot at (2,0) which is below him. But to serve, he must be at (2,1) facing down.\n\nSo at turn 91: move down to (1,1) [D]? No, from (1,2) to (1,1) is down. Then at turn 92: move right to (2,1) [R]. Then turn 93: face down (D) and interact to serve the soup at (2,0).\n\nBut the soup is ready at turn 92. So he can serve at turn 93.\n\nAlternatively, after getting the plate at turn 90, he can move to (2,1) in two moves:\nTurn 91: move down to (1,1) [D]\nTurn 92: move right to (2,1) [R]\nThen at turn 92, the soup is ready, so he can face down and interact.\n\nSo turn 93: interact to serve.\n\nBut turn 92 is when the soup is ready, and he is at (2,1) at turn 92, so he can interact at turn 92 if he is facing down.\n\nSo:\nTurn 90: Bob at (1,2) holding plate.\nTurn 91: move down to (1,1) [D]\nTurn 92: move right to (2,1) [R] -> now at (2,1). Then change orientation to down (D) and interact in the same turn? No, one action per turn.\n\nSo at turn 92, he can only move to (2,1). Then at turn 93: face down (D) and then turn 94: interact.\n\nHe can at turn 92, after moving to (2,1), if he is already facing down, he can interact. But what is his orientation? At turn 90, he was facing left to get the plate. Then at turn 91, he moved down to (1,1) -> his orientation might be south? The move action also changes orientation. When you move, you also change orientation to the direction of the move. So when he moves down (D) at turn 91, he is facing down. Then at turn 92, he moves right (R) to (2,1), so he is facing right. Then at turn 93, he must face down (D) and then interact at turn 94.\n\nThis is taking too many turns.\n\nTo optimize, at turn 90: Bob at (1,2) holding plate, facing left.\nTurn 91: change orientation to down (D) -> facing down. Then he can interact with the pot? But he is at (1,2) and the pot at (2,0) is not adjacent. He must be at (2,1) and facing down.\n\nSo he must move to (2,1) first.\n\nThe fastest:\nTurn 91: move down to (1,1) [D] -> now at (1,1), facing down.\nTurn 92: move right to (2,1) [R] -> now at (2,1), facing right.\nTurn 93: change orientation to down (D)\nTurn 94: interact (I) -> serve the soup.\n\n The soup is ready at turn 92, so it can be served from turn 92 onwards.\n\nNow, for the first soup, Alice will serve at turn 95 or later.\n\nBut we are only planning for H turns, say 20 turns from 77, so up to 97.\n\nSo in the interest of time, we can plan for both to be served.\n\nBut the rewards are 20 each, so two soups give 40.\n\nNow, to output the plan for Alice.\n\nWe are only required to output Alice's actions, but optionally Bob's. The task says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can output only Alice's actions.\n\nBut to be clear, we are planning for Alice.\n\nAlice's actions from turn 77 to say turn 91 or more.\n\nWe have:\n\nTurn 77: U (change orientation to up)\nTurn 78: I (interact to pick up onion from (4,2))\nTurn 79: D (change orientation to down)\nTurn 80: I (interact to put onion in pot at (4,0) -> now 2 onions)\nTurn 81: L (move left to (3,1))\nTurn 82: U (change orientation to up to face (3,2))\nTurn 83: I (pick up onion from (3,2))\nTurn 84: R (move right to (4,1))\nTurn 85: D (face down)\nTurn 86: I (put onion in pot at (4,0) -> 3 onions, cooking starts)\nTurn 87: S (stay, because (2,1) is occupied by Bob)\nTurn 88: L (move left to (2,1)) [now at (2,1)]\nTurn 89: L (move left to (1,1)) [now at (1,1)]\nTurn 90: U (move up to (1,2)) [now at (1,2)]\nTurn 91: L (change orientation to left to face the plate dispenser) and then? We have one action. So at turn 91: change orientation to left (L). Then at turn 92: interact to get the plate.\n\nBut then she has the plate at turn 92. Then she can start moving back.\n\nBut the first soup is ready at turn 91, and it can be served from then on.\n\nTo save turns, at turn 91, she is at (1,2) and can interact if she is facing left. But at turn 90, she moved up to (1,2) -> when you move up, you face up. So she is facing up at turn 90. At turn 91, she can change orientation to left (L) and then at turn 92 interact to get the plate.\n\nThen turn 92: I (get plate)\nTurn 93: D (face down) to move south, but then move down to (1,1) with action D.\nTurn 94: R (move right to (2,1))\nTurn 95: R (move right to (3,1))\nTurn 96: R (move right to (4,1))\nTurn 97: D (face down)\nTurn 98: I (serve the soup at (4,0))\n\nThis is taking until turn 98.\n\nAlternatively, after getting the plate, she can go directly to the serving counter? But the soup is in the pot, she must first pick it up from the pot.\n\nSo she must go to (4,1) to pick up the soup from the pot.\n\nGiven the complexity, and since we are only required to plan for Alice, we output her actions for the next 20 turns (H=20) from turn 77.\n\nSo from turn 77 to 96 (20 turns).\n\nBut let's list Alice's actions for turns 77 to 96.\n\nBased on the above, but with adjustment for the plate pickup.\n\nHowever, we see that the initial part is fixed, and the later part is flexible.\n\nSince the task is to maximize reward, and we have two soups, we can try to have Alice serve the first soup and Bob the second.\n\nBut for Alice to serve the first soup, she must have a plate at turn 91 at (4,1).\n\nTo achieve that, she must get the plate earlier. For example, after she finishes adding the second onion to the pot (at turn 80), she could go for the plate instead of adding the third onion. Then Bob can add the third onion to the pot at (4,0).\n\nBut Bob is busy with the other pot.\n\nAlternatively, after adding the second onion at turn 80, Alice goes for the plate, and then when she returns, she can add the third onion and immediately serve if the soup is ready.\n\nBut the soup won't be ready until 5 turns after the third onion is added.\n\nSo it's messy.\n\nGiven the time, I will output the actions for Alice as initially planned for the first 10 turns, and then for the next 10 turns as per the plate fetching.\n\nAlice's actions:\n\nTurn 77: U\nTurn 78: I\nTurn 79: D\nTurn 80: I\nTurn 81: L\nTurn 82: U\nTurn 83: I\nTurn 84: R\nTurn 85: D\nTurn 86: I\nTurn 87: S\nTurn 88: L\nTurn 89: L\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: L\nTurn 92: I\nTurn 93: D\nTurn 94: R\nTurn 95: R\nTurn 96: R\n\nAt turn 96, she is at (4,1) with the plate? Let's see:\n- Turn 90: at (1,2) (after U from (1,1))\n- Turn 91: L (change orientation to left)\n- Turn 92: I (get plate) -> holding plate, at (1,2)\n- Turn 93: D (move down to (1,1)) -> holding plate, at (1,1), facing down\n- Turn 94: R (move right to (2,1)) -> at (2,1), facing right\n- Turn 95: R (move right to (3,1)) -> at (3,1), facing right\n- Turn 96: R (move right to (4,1)) -> at (4,1), facing right\n\nThen she can face down and interact in the next turns.\n\nSo in the next actions, she would do:\n\nTurn 97: D (face down)\nTurn 98: I (serve the soup)\n\nBut we are only planning up to turn 96.\n\nSince we are to plan for H turns, and H=20, from turn 77 to 96 (20 turns: 77 to 96 inclusive is 20 turns? 96-77+1=20 turns).\n\nSo we stop at turn 96.\n\nThe serving will happen after turn 96, but that's beyond the plan.\n\nAlternatively, we can include up to turn 98, but the task says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\" and H is not specified. But in the answer format, we must output a sequence. Since the example doesn't specify H, we can choose H=20.\n\nSo for Alice, 20 actions.\n\nWe have from turn 77 to 96.\n\nSo the actions are:\n\nTurn 77: U\nTurn 78: I\nTurn 79: D\nTurn 80: I\nTurn 81: L\nTurn 82: U\nTurn 83: I\nTurn 84: R\nTurn 85: D\nTurn 86: I\nTurn 87: S\nTurn 88: L\nTurn 89: L\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: L\nTurn 92: I\nTurn 93: D\nTurn 94: R\nTurn 95: R\nTurn 96: R\n\nThis gets her to (4,1) with a plate at turn 96, ready to serve the first soup.\n\nThe first soup has been ready since turn 91, so it's waiting.\n\nBob can serve the second soup around turn 94 or so, but we are not planning for him.\n\nSo total reward: at least 20 for the first soup, and 20 for the second if Bob serves it.\n\nSo this is a plan.\n\nWe could optimize further, but for now, we output this.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice and Bob should collaborate to complete and serve the two partially filled pots. The pot at (4,0) has 1 onion and will be ready 5 turns after the third onion is added, while the pot at (2,0) has 1 onion and will be ready 5 turns after its third onion is added. Alice will focus on completing the pot at (4,0) and then fetch a plate to serve it, while Bob completes the pot at (2,0) and fetches a plate for it. The plan accounts for movement constraints, item carrying, and coordination to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Alice's Action Plan (Turns 77 to 96, 20 turns):\n- **Turns 77-80**: Alice picks up an onion from (4,2) and adds it to the pot at (4,0), increasing it to 2 onions.\n- **Turns 81-86**: Alice picks up another onion from (3,2) and adds it to the pot at (4,0), starting the cooking (ready at turn 91). She then stays to avoid collision with Bob at (2,1).\n- **Turns 87-92**: Alice moves to (1,2), faces the plate dispenser at (0,2), and picks up a plate.\n- **Turns 93-96**: Alice moves back to (4,1) to prepare for serving the soup at the pot (4,0) in subsequent turns.\n\n```\n\\boxed{\nTurn 77: U\nTurn 78: I\nTurn 79: D\nTurn 80: I\nTurn 81: L\nTurn 82: U\nTurn 83: I\nTurn 84: R\nTurn 85: D\nTurn 86: I\nTurn 87: S\nTurn 88: L\nTurn 89: L\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: L\nTurn 92: I\nTurn 93: D\nTurn 94: R\nTurn 95: R\nTurn 96: R\n}\n```\n\n### Key Coordination Notes:\n- **Bob's Role (Optional but Recommended)**: \n  - Bob picks up onions from (1,4) and (2,2) to complete the pot at (2,0) by turn 87 (ready at turn 92). \n  - Bob then moves to (1,2) to pick up a plate (turns 88-90) and serves the soup at (2,0) by turn 94.\n- **Reward Maximization**: \n  - The pot at (4,0) is ready at turn 91, and Alice serves it by turn 98 (after the planned sequence), earning 20 reward. \n  - The pot at (2,0) is ready at turn 92, and Bob serves it by turn 94, earning another 20 reward. \n  - Total reward: 40, achieved within the next 20+ turns. \n\nThis plan ensures both pots are completed and served efficiently, with Alice and Bob coordinating paths to avoid conflicts. Alice ends at (4,1) holding a plate, ready to serve the first soup immediately after the sequence.",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 80. The goal is to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes.\n\nFirst, let's understand the current state:\n\n- Alice is at (4,1), facing Up, holding nothing.\n- Bob is at (2,3), facing Up, holding one onion.\n\nKitchen counters have onions at multiple locations: (6,1), (6,3), (0,3), (4,2), (1,4), (3,4), (3,2), (2,2). Note that (4,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion, which is adjacent to Alice's current position? Let's see the grid:\n\nThe grid layout isn't provided in full, but we have the list of kitchen counters and other tiles. We know:\n- Alice is at (4,1). The tile above her (4,2) is a kitchen counter and has an onion. Since she is facing Up, she is facing (4,2). But note: to interact, she must be adjacent and facing the tile. She is at (4,1) and (4,2) is adjacent (above) and she is facing up, so she can interact with (4,2).\n\nHowever, Alice is holding nothing. If she interacts with the kitchen counter at (4,2) which has an onion, she would pick up that onion? But note: the interaction rule says for kitchen counter: \"Pick up items (if player is empty-handed and counter is occupied)\". So yes, she can pick up the onion.\n\nBut let's see the pots:\n- Pot at (4,0): has 1 onion, not full (needs 3 to start cooking).\n- Pot at (2,0): has 1 onion, not full.\n\nThe recipe we have is for 3 onions, which takes 5 turns to cook and gives 20 reward.\n\nWe need to deliver soup. To make soup, we need to put 3 onions in a pot. Then after 5 turns, the soup is cooked. Then we need a plate to serve it, and then deliver it to the serving counter at (6,2).\n\nCurrently, there are onions scattered on kitchen counters. Bob is holding one onion. He is at (2,3) facing up. The pot at (2,0) is at (2,0). Bob is at (2,3), so he is two steps above the pot? (2,3) to (2,0) is three steps down? Actually, the grid: y=0 is the bottom? The movement: D is (x, y-1) and U is (x, y+1). So if y increases going up, then (2,3) is above (2,0). So Bob is at (2,3) and the pot is at (2,0). He would need to go down three times to get to (2,0) but note that he must be adjacent to the pot to interact. The pot is at (2,0). The adjacent tiles are (1,0), (3,0), (2,1). (2,0) is at the bottom? The kitchen counters at (0,0) and (1,0) etc. are at the bottom.\n\nBob's path to the pot at (2,0): from (2,3) he can go down to (2,2). But (2,2) is a kitchen counter and has an onion? And it's non-empty? Actually, the kitchen counter at (2,2) has an onion. So Bob cannot step on (2,2) because it's a non-empty tile (kitchen counter with an item is non-empty and not walkable). Similarly, (2,1) is not listed as a non-empty tile? We don't have the full grid, but we know the non-empty kitchen counters and dispensers, etc.\n\nThe tile types: \n- Kitchen counters are at the listed positions and if they are occupied, they are non-empty and not walkable. But note: the rule says \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So if a kitchen counter has an item, then it is non-empty and not walkable.\n\nSo the tile (2,2) is a kitchen counter and has an onion, so it is non-empty and Bob cannot walk on it. Similarly, (2,1) is not listed as a kitchen counter? Actually, the list of kitchen counters: \n    Kitchen Counter: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (3, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (0, 1), (6, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (0, 3), (6, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (3, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4)]\n\nSo (2,1) is not a kitchen counter? Then it must be an empty tile? Because dispensers and pots are at specific locations. We have:\n- Onion dispensers: [(2,4), (4,4)]\n- Plate dispenser: [(0,2)]\n- Pot: [(2,0), (4,0)]\n- Serving counter: [(6,2)]\n\nSo (2,1) is not listed in any of these, so it is an empty tile (walkable). Similarly, (2,0) is a pot, which is non-empty and not walkable? The rule: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and pots are non-empty? Actually, the pot is a tile that is non-empty? The rule says \"non-empty tiles\" meaning tiles that are not empty? The tile types include \"Empty Tile\", so anything else is non-empty? But note: the pot is a tile that you can stand adjacent to and interact with. So you cannot stand on the pot tile. Similarly, you cannot stand on a dispenser or a counter.\n\nSo Bob at (2,3) cannot go down to (2,2) because (2,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion -> non-empty, not walkable. So he must go around? The adjacent tiles: \n- Left: (1,3) -> is that walkable? (1,3) is not in the list of non-empty tiles? The non-empty tiles are the ones we listed: kitchen counters (with items), dispensers, pots, serving counters. Also, note that (1,4) is a kitchen counter with an onion -> non-empty. But (1,3) is not listed? So it's empty? Similarly, (3,3) is not listed? So empty.\n\nSo Bob can go left to (1,3) or right to (3,3) or up? Up from (2,3) would be (2,4): but (2,4) is an onion dispenser -> non-empty, not walkable. So Bob can only go left or right? Or down? Down is blocked by (2,2). So he must go left or right.\n\nBut note: Bob is holding an onion. He might want to put it in a pot. The nearest pot? He is at (2,3). The pot at (2,0) is directly below but blocked. The pot at (4,0) is to the right. How to get to (4,0)? From (2,3) he can go right to (3,3) (empty, we assume), then right to (4,3). Then down to (4,2): but (4,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion -> non-empty, not walkable. So he cannot go down to (4,2). Then how? He can go from (4,3) to (4,4)? But (4,4) is an onion dispenser -> non-empty. Or go from (4,3) to (5,3)? (5,3) is not listed? Then empty? Then to (5,2)? (5,2) is not a kitchen counter? The kitchen counters are at (5,0) and (5,4). So (5,2) is empty? Then (5,1)? Then (5,0) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty. Then (4,0) is adjacent to (5,0) but we need to get to (4,0). Actually, to interact with the pot at (4,0), Bob must be adjacent and facing it. The adjacent tiles to (4,0) are (3,0), (5,0), (4,1). (3,0) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty. (5,0) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty. (4,1) is empty? Alice is currently at (4,1) but she will move.\n\nSo the only adjacent tile to (4,0) that is walkable is (4,1). Similarly, for the pot at (2,0): adjacent walkable tiles? (1,0) is kitchen counter -> non-empty, (3,0) is kitchen counter -> non-empty, (2,1) is empty? So (2,1) is the only adjacent walkable tile to (2,0). But to get to (2,1), Bob must go from (2,3) to (2,2) is blocked. So he must go left to (1,3), then down to (1,2): (1,2) is not listed? Then down to (1,1): (1,1) not listed? Then down to (1,0): but (1,0) is kitchen counter -> non-empty. So stuck? Alternatively, from (1,3) go right to (2,3) again? Or from (1,3) go down to (1,2) (if empty), then to (1,1) (if empty), then to (1,0) is non-empty so cannot step. Then how to get to (2,1)? From (1,1) to (2,1) is adjacent? But (1,1) is above (1,0) which is non-empty, but (1,1) itself might be empty? Then from (1,1) to (2,1) is possible? Then Bob can be at (2,1) and face down to interact with the pot at (2,0). But note: the pot at (2,0) is below (2,1) so to interact, Bob must be facing down.\n\nSo Bob can go: from (2,3) -> left to (1,3) [if empty] -> down to (1,2) [if empty] -> down to (1,1) [if empty] -> right to (2,1) [if empty]. Then at (2,1) he can face down and interact to add the onion to the pot at (2,0).\n\nBut note: there is an onion at (2,2) which is blocking the direct path. We must avoid non-empty tiles.\n\nAlternatively, Bob might drop his onion on a kitchen counter and then we can use it later? But that might not be efficient.\n\nMeanwhile, Alice is at (4,1) facing up. She can interact with the kitchen counter at (4,2) which has an onion. Since she is empty-handed, she can pick it up. Then she would be holding an onion.\n\nWhat should she do with it? She can put it in a pot. The nearest pot? (4,0) is below her. She is at (4,1). The pot at (4,0) is adjacent below. So she can face down and interact to add the onion to the pot at (4,0). But note: she is currently facing up. So she must change orientation to down.\n\nBut first, she is at (4,1) and the counter at (4,2) is above. She is facing up, so she can interact to pick up the onion from (4,2). Then she is holding an onion. Then she can turn to face down (without moving) and then interact to put the onion in the pot at (4,0). But note: the interaction requires being adjacent and facing the tile. She is adjacent to (4,0) (since (4,1) is adjacent to (4,0)) and if she faces down, then she can interact.\n\nSo plan for Alice:\n\nTurn 80: Interact (I) with (4,2) to pick up the onion. Now she is holding an onion.\nTurn 81: Change orientation to Down (D) [note: D is move down, but we have to specify the action. The actions are U, D, L, R (which are moves and change orientation) or we can change orientation without moving? The action set: \n- Move (L/R/U/D): changes position and orientation.\n- Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): but the problem says \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" Actually, the problem states: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This is confusing. Let me re-read:\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThis seems incorrectly stated. Typically, changing orientation doesn't move. But the description says \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one\", which implies that if the adjacent tile in the direction you are changing to is empty, then you move? That doesn't make sense.\n\nLooking back:\n\n\"Each player (Alice/Bob) can:\n- Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\n- Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThis is ambiguous. But note: the second action is \"Change Orientation\", which by its name should only change the direction without moving. However, the description says \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one\", which suggests that if the adjacent tile in the direction of the desired orientation is empty, then it moves? That would be the same as the move action. \n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding. Typically in Overcooked, there is an action to change facing without moving. But the problem lists two separate actions: Move and Change Orientation. The move action changes both position and orientation. The change orientation action should only change orientation. But the description for change orientation says: \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This implies that if you try to change orientation to a direction and the adjacent tile in that direction is empty, then you move? That would make it the same as the move action. \n\nAlternatively, it might mean that if you are trying to change orientation to face a non-empty tile, then you don't move? But that doesn't make sense because changing orientation doesn't require moving.\n\nI think there is a mistake in the problem statement. Let me assume that \"Change Orientation\" is an action that only changes the direction without moving. The condition \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one\" might be a red herring? Or it might mean that if you are on the edge and try to change orientation to a direction where there is no tile (like a wall) then it fails? But the problem doesn't mention walls.\n\nTo clarify, I will assume that:\n- Move actions (U, D, L, R) change both position and orientation to that direction.\n- Change Orientation actions (let's denote as, for example, 'F_U' for face up, but the problem says the same letters) but the problem states the same set: {U, D, L, R, I, S}. So how do we distinguish?\n\nLooking at the action set: the player can choose from {U, D, L, R, I, S}. And the description says:\n- Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\n- Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\n\nThis is confusing because both are represented by the same letters. How do we know when we want to change orientation without moving? The problem says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This suggests that when you choose U, D, L, R, if you are trying to move and the adjacent tile is not empty, then you don't move? But that would be the same as the move action.\n\nI think the problem means that there are two types of actions that use U/D/L/R:\n1. Move: which moves in the direction if the adjacent tile is empty and changes orientation to that direction.\n2. Change Orientation: which changes the orientation to the specified direction without moving, but if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty, then the orientation change still happens? The problem doesn't specify.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This implies that if the adjacent tile is empty, then it moves? That would make it identical to the move action.\n\nI think there is an error in the problem. To resolve, note the example: \n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nI believe the intended meaning is: \n- When you choose a direction (U/D/L/R) as a move, you move to that adjacent tile if it is empty and change your orientation to that direction. If it is not empty, you don't move but still change your orientation to that direction? Or do nothing? The problem doesn't specify for move.\n\nBut for change orientation, it says \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one\", which suggests that if the tile is empty, you move? That would be the same as a move action.\n\nI think we have to assume that the actions U/D/L/R are used for both moving and changing orientation, but the effect depends on whether the adjacent tile in that direction is empty or not.\n\nRule clarification:\n- If the player chooses U, D, L, or R:\n  - If the adjacent tile in that direction is empty, then the player moves to that tile and changes orientation to that direction.\n  - If the adjacent tile is not empty, then the player does not move but changes orientation to that direction.\n\nThis is a common interpretation in grid-based games. So the same action U can either move up (if the tile above is empty) or just turn to face up (if the tile above is not empty).\n\nIn that case, we don't have a separate \"change orientation\" action. The move action also serves as a way to change orientation when movement is blocked.\n\nTherefore, the action set is {U, D, L, R, I, S}. Each U/D/L/R action:\n  - Changes the player's orientation to that direction.\n  - If the adjacent tile in that direction is empty, then the player also moves to that tile.\n\nSo for Alice at (4,1) facing up. She wants to pick up the onion from (4,2) which is above her. Since (4,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion -> non-empty, so she cannot move up. But she is already facing up? Actually, she is facing up. To interact, she must be adjacent and facing the tile. She is at (4,1) and (4,2) is above, so if she is facing up, she can interact.\n\nBut note: she is facing up already. So she doesn't need to change orientation. She can just interact.\n\nSo at turn 80: Alice can do I to pick up the onion from (4,2).\n\nThen she is holding an onion. Now she wants to put it in the pot at (4,0) which is below her. So she needs to face down. How? She can choose action D (down). Since the tile below (4,0) is not adjacent to her? She is at (4,1). The tile below her is (4,0). (4,0) is a pot -> non-empty. So if she chooses D (down), then:\n  - The adjacent tile below (4,1) is (4,0) which is non-empty (pot) -> so she doesn't move, but changes her orientation to down.\n\nThen at turn 81: she is at (4,1) facing down, and the pot at (4,0) is adjacent and below her. So she can interact (I) to put the onion in the pot.\n\nSo after two turns, the pot at (4,0) will have 2 onions (previously 1, now one added).\n\nMeanwhile, Bob is at (2,3) holding an onion. He wants to put it in a pot. The pot at (2,0) is blocked by the kitchen counter at (2,2). He must go around. The path I thought: (2,3) -> left to (1,3) -> down to (1,2) -> down to (1,1) -> right to (2,1). Then at (2,1) face down and interact to put the onion in the pot at (2,0).\n\nBut we need to check the walkability:\n- (1,3): is it empty? It's not in the non-empty list, so empty.\n- (1,2): not listed? Then empty.\n- (1,1): not listed? Then empty.\n- (2,1): not listed? Then empty.\n\nBut note: the kitchen counter at (1,0) is non-empty, but that doesn't block (1,1) or (1,2). So Bob can go:\n\nTurn 80: Bob moves left (L) to (1,3). Now at (1,3), orientation left? Actually, when he moves left, he changes orientation to left. But to go down, he needs to change orientation to down? Then at (1,3) he can choose D (down). The tile below (1,3) is (1,2). We assume it's empty? Then he moves down to (1,2) and faces down.\n\nBut note: the action history for Bob: he has taken actions: I, L, R, U, I. We don't know the exact sequence, but we can plan independently.\n\nSo Bob's plan:\nTurn 80: L (moves to (1,3) and faces left)\nBut then he wants to go down. At (1,3) facing left, he can choose D. Since the tile below (1,2) is empty (we assume), then he moves down to (1,2) and faces down.\n\nTurn 81: D (moves to (1,1) and faces down) -> if (1,1) is empty.\n\nTurn 82: D? But the tile below (1,1) is (1,0) which is a kitchen counter -> non-empty. So if he chooses D at (1,1), he will not move (because (1,0) is non-empty) but he will change orientation to down. Then he is at (1,1) facing down. Then he can choose R (right) to go to (2,1). The tile to the right (2,1) is empty? Then he moves to (2,1) and faces right? But then he is at (2,1) and the pot is below at (2,0). So he needs to face down.\n\nSo at (2,1) he can choose D: since the tile below (2,0) is non-empty, he doesn't move but changes orientation to down. Then he can interact.\n\nSo Bob's sequence:\nTurn 80: L (to (1,3), facing left)\nTurn 81: D (to (1,2), facing down)\nTurn 82: D (tries to move down but (1,1) is empty? Actually, at (1,2) he chooses D: adjacent tile below is (1,1). We assume (1,1) is empty, so he moves to (1,1) and faces down.\nTurn 83: R (to (2,1), facing right) [because he moves right to (2,1) and changes orientation to right]\nTurn 84: D (changes orientation to down without moving, because (2,0) is non-empty) -> now facing down at (2,1)\nTurn 85: I (interact with pot at (2,0) to add the onion)\n\nBut this is 6 turns and we are only planning for a few turns? We don't know H, but we can plan for a short horizon.\n\nAlternatively, Bob might go to the pot at (4,0). But Alice is near (4,0) and they might conflict.\n\nBut note: the pot at (4,0) is about to get another onion from Alice. After Alice adds one, it will have 2 onions. Then if Bob adds his onion, it will have 3 and start cooking. So that might be faster.\n\nBob is at (2,3) and the pot at (4,0) is at (4,0). How to get there? The direct path: (2,3) -> (3,3) -> (4,3) -> then down? But (4,3) to (4,2) is blocked by kitchen counter (4,2) with onion. So he must go around: (4,3) -> (5,3) -> (5,2) -> (5,1) -> (5,0) is non-empty, so cannot step. Then to (4,1) but Alice might be there? And (4,1) is adjacent to (4,0). But (4,1) is currently occupied by Alice? And players cannot walk through each other.\n\nSo if Alice is at (4,1) for the next two turns, then Bob cannot go to (4,1). So that path is blocked.\n\nTherefore, the best is for Bob to go to the pot at (2,0) via the detour.\n\nBut let's see the state of the pots:\n\nPot (4,0): currently 1 onion. After Alice adds one, it will have 2 onions. Then we need one more onion to start cooking.\n\nPot (2,0): currently 1 onion. After Bob adds one, it will have 2 onions. Then we need one more.\n\nWe have many onions on the counters. We can use one of them to complete either pot.\n\nBut note: the recipe requires 3 onions. The cooking time is 5 turns. Then we need a plate to serve and deliver.\n\nWe also have a plate dispenser at (0,2). \n\nSo after we start a pot cooking, we have to wait 5 turns, then get a plate, put the soup on the plate, and deliver.\n\nBut we are at turn 80. We want to maximize the reward. We can make two soups? But we have two pots. However, we need to collect more onions.\n\nCurrently, the counters have 8 onions (from the list). And Bob is holding one, and Alice is about to pick up one (but then she will put it in the pot, so it will be in the pot). So after Alice and Bob add their onions, we will have:\n- Pot (4,0): 2 onions -> needs one more.\n- Pot (2,0): 2 onions -> needs one more.\n\nAnd the counters still have 7 onions? Originally 8 counters with onions. Alice picked one from (4,2), so that counter becomes empty? Or does it? The interaction: when Alice picks up the onion from (4,2), then the kitchen counter at (4,2) becomes empty? Yes, because she removed the onion. So now the kitchen counters with onions: 7 left.\n\nSo we have 7 onions on counters and we need 2 more to complete both pots.\n\nBut note: each pot needs one more. So we need two more onions to be added.\n\nWe can assign Alice to get another onion and put it in (4,0) and Bob to get another onion and put it in (2,0). But Bob is going to be busy for several turns to get to (2,1) and add his current onion. Then he can go pick up another onion from a counter.\n\nSimilarly, Alice, after adding her onion to (4,0), will be free to get another onion.\n\nBut the nearest onion for Alice: after she is at (4,1) facing down (after turn 81). Then she can go to get an onion from a nearby counter? The counters with onions: (4,2) is now empty (she just took it). The next nearest might be (3,2) or (2,2) or (3,4) etc.\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2): which is adjacent to (4,2) but (4,2) is a kitchen counter and now empty? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion. How to get to (3,2)? Alice is at (4,1). She can go left to (3,1)? But (3,1) is not listed? So empty? Then from (3,1) she can face up to interact with (3,2)? But (3,2) is above (3,1). So she can go to (3,1) and then face up and interact.\n\nBut note: (3,1) is empty? Then she can move left to (3,1) from (4,1) by choosing L. Then at (3,1) she is facing left? Then she must change orientation to up. So she can choose U: since the tile above (3,1) is (3,2) which is a kitchen counter (non-empty), so she doesn't move but changes orientation to up. Then interact.\n\nSo for Alice after turn 81 (after putting the onion in the pot):\n\nTurn 82: L (moves to (3,1) and faces left) [because from (4,1) left to (3,1) is empty? We assume (3,1) is empty. Then she moves to (3,1) and faces left.\nTurn 83: U (changes orientation to up without moving, because (3,2) is non-empty) -> now facing up at (3,1)\nTurn 84: I (pick up the onion from (3,2))\n\nThen she can go back to the pot at (4,0) to add the onion? But the pot at (4,0) is at (4,0). From (3,1) she can go right to (4,1) [if empty? But at turn 84, Bob might not be there?] and then face down and interact.\n\nBut note: we need to coordinate.\n\nAlternatively, after she picks the onion at (3,2), she can go to (4,1) and then add to the pot.\n\nBut the pot at (4,0) will then have 3 onions and start cooking.\n\nSimilarly, Bob after adding his onion at (2,0) (at turn 85) is at (2,1) facing down. Then he can go to pick another onion. The nearest might be (2,2) which is above him? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter and has an onion? Yes. So he is at (2,1). He can choose U: the tile above (2,1) is (2,2) which is non-empty, so he doesn't move but changes orientation to up. Then interact to pick up the onion from (2,2). Then he can put it in the pot at (2,0) by facing down and interacting again? But the pot at (2,0) now has 2 onions? He just added one at turn 85, so now it has 2. Then he adds another? Then it becomes 3 and starts cooking.\n\nSo Bob:\n\nAfter turn 85 (after adding the onion to (2,0)):\nTurn 86: U (changes orientation to up without moving) -> facing up.\nTurn 87: I (pick up the onion from (2,2))\nTurn 88: D (changes orientation to down without moving) -> facing down.\nTurn 89: I (add the onion to the pot at (2,0)) -> now the pot has 3 onions and starts cooking.\n\nBut note: the pot at (2,0) started cooking at turn 89. Then it will be ready at turn 89+5 = 94.\n\nSimilarly, for the pot at (4,0): if Alice adds her second onion at turn 85? Let's see Alice's timeline:\n\nTurn 80: I (pick onion from (4,2)) -> holding onion\nTurn 81: D (change orientation to down) -> facing down\nTurn 82: I (put onion in pot (4,0)) -> now pot has 2 onions, Alice holding nothing\nTurn 83: L (move to (3,1) and face left)\nTurn 84: U (change orientation to up without moving) -> facing up\nTurn 85: I (pick onion from (3,2)) -> holding onion\nTurn 86: R (move to (4,1) and face right) [from (3,1) to (4,1): right, and (4,1) is empty? We hope so]\nTurn 87: D (change orientation to down without moving, because (4,0) is non-empty) -> facing down\nTurn 88: I (put onion in pot (4,0)) -> now pot has 3 onions, starts cooking at turn 88.\n\nSo pot (4,0) starts at turn 88, ready at turn 93.\n\nThen we need to serve the soups.\n\nTo serve, we need a plate. The plate dispenser is at (0,2). We can assign one player to get plates and serve.\n\nBut we have two soups. We need two plates.\n\nThe plate dispenser: when you interact, you get a plate. But you can only carry one at a time. So we need to make two trips.\n\nAlso, after getting a plate, you have to go to the pot and interact to get the soup (if cooked) and then deliver to (6,2).\n\nWe can plan for one soup first.\n\nBut we are only planning for a few turns? The problem says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\". We don't know H. We can plan for 10 turns? But the cooking takes 5 turns, so we might not see the delivery in 10 turns.\n\nAlternatively, we can plan the immediate actions to set up the soups.\n\nSo for now, let's plan for Alice for the next 8 turns (until she puts the second onion in the pot at (4,0)).\n\nWe also need to plan for Bob? The problem says \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can plan only for Alice, but we must consider Bob's actions to avoid conflict.\n\nBut the problem doesn't require to plan for Bob, but we can if needed. However, the answer format is for Alice only? The boxed answer is for Alice.\n\nThe task: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But the answer format only shows turns and actions, without specifying the player. But the context is that we are controlling Alice? And Bob is the teammate, but we are only planning for Alice? Or we can plan for both?\n\nThe problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can plan for both, but the answer format might be for Alice only? The example answer format shows \"Turn t: action\", but it doesn't say for which player. But the context is that we are to help Alice, so probably we are to output Alice's actions.\n\nSo we output a sequence of actions for Alice.\n\nBut we must consider Bob's actions to avoid conflicts (like occupying the same tile).\n\nSo let's plan Alice's actions for the next 8 turns (t80 to t87) as above:\n\nTurn 80: I (pick onion from (4,2))\nTurn 81: D (change orientation to down, because the tile below is non-empty so no move, but facing down)\nTurn 82: I (put onion in pot (4,0))\nTurn 83: L (move to (3,1) because left is empty? We assume (3,1) is empty. Then moves to (3,1) and faces left)\nTurn 84: U (change orientation to up without moving, because (3,2) is non-empty) -> now facing up\nTurn 85: I (pick onion from (3,2))\nTurn 86: R (move to (4,1) and face right) [because from (3,1) to (4,1) is right, and (4,1) should be empty? Bob is not there?]\nTurn 87: D (change orientation to down without moving) -> facing down\n\nThen at turn 88: she can I to put the onion in the pot (4,0). But we are only planning until turn 87? We can extend.\n\nBut note: at turn 86, she moves to (4,1). Bob might be there? We have to avoid. Bob is at (2,3) at turn 80. He is going to move to (1,3) at turn 80, then (1,2) at turn 81, (1,1) at turn 82, (2,1) at turn 83. Then at turn 84 he changes orientation to down at (2,1). Then at turn 85 he interacts. Then at turn 86 he changes to up, turn 87 he picks the onion from (2,2). So at turn 86, Bob is at (2,1) and at turn 87 he is still at (2,1) (because he only changes orientation and then interacts, no move). So (4,1) is free.\n\nSo Alice can safely move to (4,1) at turn 86.\n\nThen at turn 87: she changes orientation to down.\n\nThen at turn 88: she can interact to put the onion in the pot at (4,0). So we can plan until turn 88.\n\nBut the problem says \"over next several turns\", so we can choose H=9 for Alice (t80 to t88).\n\nSo Alice's actions:\n\nTurn 80: I\nTurn 81: D\nTurn 82: I\nTurn 83: L\nTurn 84: U\nTurn 85: I\nTurn 86: R\nTurn 87: D\nTurn 88: I\n\nBut at turn 88, she puts the onion and the pot starts cooking.\n\nAfter that, she can help with getting plates.\n\nBut we don't need to plan beyond that for now.\n\nWe must check if any of these actions are blocked? For example, at turn 83: Alice moves L from (4,1) to (3,1). Is (3,1) empty? We don't have information that it is occupied. Similarly, at turn 86: moving R from (3,1) to (4,1): is (4,1) empty? Bob is at (2,1) and won't be at (4,1) during these turns.\n\nSo this plan seems feasible.\n\nBut note: at turn 80, when Alice does I, she picks up the onion from (4,2). Then at turn 85, she picks up an onion from (3,2). Both are available.\n\nSo we output the sequence for Alice.\n\nBut the answer format should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 80: I\nTurn 81: D\nTurn 82: I\nTurn 83: L\nTurn 84: U\nTurn 85: I\nTurn 86: R\nTurn 87: D\nTurn 88: I\n}\n\nWe planned for 9 turns (t80 to t88).\n\nBut note: at turn 81, the action D: since the tile below (4,0) is non-empty, she doesn't move and only changes orientation to down. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 84: U: she is at (3,1) and the tile above (3,2) is non-empty, so she doesn't move and changes to up.\n\nAt turn 87: D: she is at (4,1) and the tile below is non-empty, so she changes to down without moving.\n\nThis plan sets the pot at (4,0) to start cooking at turn 88.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob will set the pot at (2,0) to start cooking at turn 89.\n\nThen we can start the plate collection.\n\nBut that is beyond the plan.\n\nSo for now, this is a good plan for Alice.\n\nBut note: we might have a better use of the onions. For example, if we complete one pot first, we can get the soup earlier. But since we are at turn 80 and we can start two soups, it's better to get two soups for 40 reward.\n\nSo the plan is as above.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice and Bob should collaborate to complete two onion soups, each requiring 3 onions and yielding a reward of 20. The current state shows both pots at (2,0) and (4,0) each containing 1 onion. Alice is positioned to quickly add onions to the pot at (4,0), while Bob handles the pot at (2,0). Alice's actions focus on picking up onions from nearby kitchen counters and adding them to the pot at (4,0) to start cooking as soon as possible.\n\n### Alice's Action Plan (Turns 80-88):\n- **Turn 80**: Interact (I) to pick up an onion from the kitchen counter at (4,2). Alice is adjacent and facing up, so this is valid. She now holds an onion.\n- **Turn 81**: Move down (D) to change orientation to down (without moving, as (4,0) is non-empty). This prepares her to interact with the pot.\n- **Turn 82**: Interact (I) to add the onion to the pot at (4,0). The pot now has 2 onions.\n- **Turn 83**: Move left (L) to (3,1) (empty tile) and change orientation to left. This positions her near another onion.\n- **Turn 84**: Move up (U) to change orientation to up (without moving, as (3,2) is non-empty). She now faces the kitchen counter at (3,2).\n- **Turn 85**: Interact (I) to pick up an onion from (3,2). She now holds an onion.\n- **Turn 86**: Move right (R) to (4,1) (empty tile) and change orientation to right. This moves her back to the pot's adjacent tile.\n- **Turn 87**: Move down (D) to change orientation to down (without moving, as (4,0) is non-empty). She now faces the pot.\n- **Turn 88**: Interact (I) to add the onion to the pot at (4,0). The pot now has 3 onions and starts cooking (will be ready at turn 93).\n\n### Coordination with Bob:\n- Bob is at (2,3) holding an onion. His path to the pot at (2,0) is blocked by the kitchen counter at (2,2). He should take the route: (2,3) → (1,3) → (1,2) → (1,1) → (2,1). At (2,1), he changes orientation to down and adds his onion to the pot at (2,0) (turn 85). He then picks up the onion from (2,2) and adds it to the same pot (turn 89), starting cooking at turn 89 (ready at turn 94).\n- This avoids conflicts: Bob is at (2,1) during turns 83-89, while Alice moves through (3,1) and (4,1), which are clear.\n\n### Outcome:\n- Pot (4,0) starts cooking at turn 88 (ready at 93). Pot (2,0) starts cooking at turn 89 (ready at 94). Both soups can be delivered for 40 total reward. Alice's actions ensure efficient use of nearby onions and minimal downtime.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn 80: } I \\\\\n\\text{Turn 81: } D \\\\\n\\text{Turn 82: } I \\\\\n\\text{Turn 83: } L \\\\\n\\text{Turn 84: } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn 85: } I \\\\\n\\text{Turn 86: } R \\\\\n\\text{Turn 87: } D \\\\\n\\text{Turn 88: } I\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 83. The goal is to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes.\n\nKey observations from the current state:\n- Alice is at (4,1), facing down, holding nothing.\n- Bob is at (5,3), facing right, holding an onion.\n\nThere are two pots:\n- Pot at (4,0) has 2 onions (needs one more onion to start cooking).\n- Pot at (2,0) has 1 onion (needs two more onions to start cooking).\n\nThe recipe we know is for 3 onions, which takes 5 turns to cook and gives 20 reward.\n\nThere are onion dispensers at (2,4) and (4,4). Plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nKitchen counters have several onions placed, which can be used as a source of ingredients.\n\nWe note that there are onions on kitchen counters at:\n- (6,1), (6,3), (0,3), (1,4), (3,4), (3,2), (2,2)\n\nSince the pot at (4,0) only needs one more onion, it is more efficient to complete that pot first.\n\nAlice is at (4,1). She is one step above the pot at (4,0). She is facing down, so she is already facing the pot? \nBut note: the pot is at (4,0) and Alice is at (4,1). The adjacent tile below (4,0) is (4,-1) which doesn't exist? Actually, the grid coordinates: \nWe have pots at (2,0) and (4,0). The grid must be from (0,0) to (6,4) as per the kitchen counter locations.\n\nSo (4,1) is above (4,0). Therefore, if Alice moves down to (4,0), she would be on the pot? But note: players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles. The pot is a non-empty tile. So she cannot step on (4,0). Instead, she must stand adjacent and face the pot to interact.\n\nCurrently, Alice is at (4,1) and facing down. The pot is at (4,0) which is adjacent and in the direction she is facing. Therefore, if she interacts, she can do something with the pot.\n\nBut what can she do? She is holding nothing. The pot has 2 onions and is not full. She can add an ingredient only if she is holding one. So she cannot add anything now.\n\nTherefore, Alice must first get an onion.\n\nHow can she get an onion?\n- From an onion dispenser: at (2,4) or (4,4). \n- Or from a kitchen counter that has an onion.\n\nThe nearest source of onion to Alice (at (4,1)) might be:\n- Kitchen counter at (3,2) which is at (3,2) -> one step left and one step up? Actually, (4,1) to (3,2): left to (3,1) then up to (3,2)? But note the grid: \n  - From (4,1): \n    - Left: (3,1) -> is that walkable? We don't have a list of empty tiles, but we know non-empty tiles (like counters, dispensers) are not walkable. \n    - The kitchen counters are at specific locations, but the rest are empty? Actually, the tile types list includes only non-empty tiles. So any tile not in that list is empty.\n\nThe non-empty tiles (kitchen counters, dispensers, pots, serving counter) are provided. So (3,1) is not in the non-empty list, so it is empty and walkable.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) to (3,1) (left) then (3,2) (up) is two moves.\n\nAlternatively, she could go to the onion dispenser at (4,4). From (4,1) to (4,4): move up three times? But (4,2) is a kitchen counter? \nThe kitchen counters are at: (0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4). \nSo (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, so she cannot walk through it. Therefore, she cannot go directly up from (4,1) to (4,4) because (4,2) is blocked.\n\nSo she must take a detour. Alternatively, use a kitchen counter that has an onion.\n\nThe kitchen counter at (3,2) is adjacent to (3,1) and (3,3)? (3,2) is non-empty, so she can stand adjacent and face it to pick up the onion.\n\nSimilarly, there is a kitchen counter at (2,2) which also has an onion.\n\nPlan for Alice:\n- Step 1: Move left to (3,1) (action L). Then she is at (3,1) and facing? After moving left, her orientation becomes left? But the action history says she was facing down. The problem says: Move (L/R/U/D) changes position and orientation. So if she moves left, she will be at (3,1) and facing left.\n\n- Step 2: Now she is at (3,1). From there, she can move up to (3,2)? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, so she cannot step on it. Instead, she must face the kitchen counter at (3,2) to interact. Currently, after moving left, she is facing left. The kitchen counter at (3,2) is above her? So she is at (3,1) and the counter is at (3,2) -> which is above. So she needs to face up. Therefore, she must change orientation to up (action U? but note: the action U can be move or change orientation? Actually, the action set: Move and Change Orientation use the same letters. But note the description:\n\n  - **Move** (L/R/U/D): Changes position *and* orientation.\n  - **Change Orientation** (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\n\nSo to change orientation without moving, she must use the same letter but if she tries to move and the adjacent tile in that direction is non-empty, then she doesn't move and only changes orientation? But the description for change orientation says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This is a bit ambiguous.\n\nActually, the problem states: \n  \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nBut note: the move action always changes orientation to the direction of movement. And if the adjacent tile in the movement direction is not empty, then the move fails? But the problem says for movement: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" It doesn't say it fails if the tile is non-empty. But the constraint: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So if she tries to move up from (3,1) to (3,2) and (3,2) is non-empty, she cannot move there. Therefore, she would not move and perhaps the orientation change still happens? Or the entire action fails? \n\nThe problem says: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" but also \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So if the adjacent tile in the direction is non-empty, then the move is invalid? The problem doesn't specify what happens. However, the \"Change Orientation\" action is explicitly for changing orientation without moving, and it happens only when the adjacent tile is not empty? Actually, the description for Change Orientation: \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This implies that if you use a move action and the adjacent tile is non-empty, then you don't move but you might still change orientation? But that would be confusing.\n\nLooking back: \n  - **Move** (L/R/U/D): Changes position *and* orientation. \n  - **Change Orientation** (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\n\nThis seems to be two different actions. But the action set is {U, D, L, R, I, S}. So how do we distinguish between move and change orientation? \n\nActually, the problem states: \n  \"Each player (Alice/Bob) can:\n   - **Move** (L/R/U/D): Changes position *and* orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\n   - **Change Orientation** (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nBut then in the action set, they are both represented by the same letters? That is ambiguous.\n\nHowever, note the description for Change Orientation: it says \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This suggests that the same action (say U) can be either a move or an orientation change. The rule might be: when a player issues a movement action (U/D/L/R), the system first checks if the adjacent tile in that direction is empty. If it is, then the player moves and the orientation becomes that direction. If it is not empty, then the player does not move but changes orientation to that direction. \n\nThis is a common mechanic in Overcooked. So:\n\n  - If you press U and the tile above is empty, you move up and face up.\n  - If you press U and the tile above is not empty, you don't move but turn to face up.\n\nTherefore, for Alice at (3,1) and currently facing left, if she wants to face up to interact with the counter at (3,2), she can press U. Since (3,2) is non-empty, she doesn't move but turns to face up.\n\nThen, she can press I to interact and pick up the onion from the kitchen counter at (3,2).\n\nSo steps for Alice:\n  Turn 83: L -> moves left to (3,1) and faces left.\n  Turn 84: U -> tries to move up but cannot because (3,2) is non-empty, so she turns to face up (without moving).\n  Turn 85: I -> picks up the onion from (3,2).\n\nNow she is holding an onion.\n\nThen she can go to the pot at (4,0) to add the onion. How?\n  From (3,1) she can move right to (4,1) (action R) -> then she is at (4,1) facing right.\n  Then she needs to face down to interact with the pot at (4,0). So from (4,1), she can press D -> which will try to move down to (4,0). But (4,0) is a pot (non-empty) so she cannot move there. Therefore, she will turn to face down without moving.\n  Then press I to add the onion to the pot.\n\nBut note: after she adds the onion, the pot will have 3 onions and start cooking. It will take 5 turns to cook.\n\nSo after adding, the pot starts cooking at turn 87 (if we count: turn 83: L, 84: U, 85: I, 86: R, 87: D (to face down), 88: I -> add onion).\n\nBut let me write the sequence:\n\nTurn 83: L (to (3,1), face left)\nTurn 84: U (face up, because cannot move up)\nTurn 85: I (pick up onion from (3,2))\nTurn 86: R (move right to (4,1), face right)\nTurn 87: D (face down, because cannot move down to (4,0))\nTurn 88: I (add onion to pot at (4,0))\n\nNow the pot at (4,0) starts cooking at turn 88. It will be ready at turn 88 + 5 = turn 93.\n\nMeanwhile, what about Bob? Bob is at (5,3) holding an onion. He could also help by getting a plate and then serving the soup when ready.\n\nThe pot at (4,0) will be ready at turn 93. We need to deliver the soup.\n\nBob is holding an onion. He could put that onion somewhere? Or use it in another pot? But the other pot at (2,0) has only one onion. We might want to complete that pot too.\n\nBut let's focus on the immediate: we have a pot that will be ready at turn 93. We need to get a plate and then serve the soup.\n\nThe plate dispenser is at (0,2). Bob is at (5,3). He can go to the plate dispenser, but it's far. Alternatively, Alice, after adding the onion, is free and might get the plate.\n\nBut note: after adding the onion, Alice is at (4,1) holding nothing? No, she just added the onion, so she is holding nothing.\n\nSo Alice can go to the plate dispenser at (0,2). How?\n  From (4,1) to (0,2): \n    One path: left to (3,1) -> but she is at (4,1) after turn 88? Actually, after turn 88, she is at (4,1) (she didn't move when she did D and I). So:\n      Turn 89: L -> to (3,1), face left.\n      Turn 90: L -> to (2,1), face left. (Is (2,1) empty? Yes, because not in the non-empty list)\n      Turn 91: U -> to (2,2)? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter (non-empty) -> so she cannot move there. Therefore, she must go around.\n\nAlternatively, from (3,1) she can go up? But (3,2) is non-empty. So she must go to (2,1) then to (1,1) (if that is empty) then to (0,1) (which is a kitchen counter, non-empty) -> then she cannot step on (0,1). \n\nAlternatively, go from (4,1) up? But (4,2) is non-empty. So she must go left to (3,1) then up? but blocked by (3,2). Then she must go to (2,1) and then (1,1) then (1,2)? But (1,2) is not in the non-empty list? Let's check the non-empty tiles:\n\nKitchen Counters: (0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nSo (1,1) and (1,2) are not listed, so they are empty. Similarly, (0,2) is the plate dispenser -> non-empty, so she cannot step on it.\n\nSo from (4,1):\n  Option 1:\n    Turn 89: L to (3,1), face left.\n    Turn 90: L to (2,1), face left.\n    Turn 91: U to (2,2) -> cannot because (2,2) is non-empty -> so she turns to face up? But we don't want that. We want to go to (0,2). So instead, from (2,1) we can go up to (2,2) is blocked, so we go right? That doesn't help. Alternatively, go to (1,1) first.\n\n  Better:\n    Turn 89: L to (3,1), face left.\n    Turn 90: U -> turns to face up (because (3,2) is non-empty, so no move) -> now facing up.\n    Then she is at (3,1) facing up. Then she can move left to (2,1)? But she is facing up, so to move left she must press L. \n        Turn 91: L -> move left to (2,1) and face left.\n    Then Turn 92: U -> to (2,2)? blocked -> so turn to face up.\n    Then Turn 93: U -> still facing up? Then she is at (2,1) facing up. Then she can move left to (1,1) by pressing L? \n        Turn 94: L -> to (1,1) and face left.\n    Then Turn 95: U -> to (1,2) (if (1,2) is empty) -> yes, (1,2) is empty -> move to (1,2) and face up.\n    Then Turn 96: L -> to (0,2) -> but (0,2) is the plate dispenser (non-empty) -> so she cannot move there. Therefore, from (1,2) she must face left to interact with (0,2). \n        Turn 97: L -> face left (without moving, because (0,2) is non-empty) -> now facing left.\n        Turn 98: I -> grab a plate.\n\nThis is too long: 10 turns (from turn 89 to 98) and the soup is ready at turn 93. We need to serve it as soon as it's ready.\n\nAlternatively, Bob might be closer to the plate dispenser? Bob is at (5,3) holding an onion. He could first drop the onion at a kitchen counter and then go to get a plate.\n\nBut note: there is a kitchen counter at (5,4) and (6,3) and (6,1) that have onions, but they are occupied? Actually, we can place an onion on an empty kitchen counter. The kitchen counters that are empty: we don't have a list of which kitchen counters are occupied. We know the non-empty kitchen counters and what they contain. The list provided:\n\n  Kitchen Counter on (6, 1): contains a onion; \n  Kitchen Counter on (6, 3): contains a onion; \n  Kitchen Counter on (0, 3): contains a onion; \n  Kitchen Counter on (1, 4): contains a onion; \n  Kitchen Counter on (3, 4): contains a onion; \n  Kitchen Counter on (3, 2): contains a onion; \n  Kitchen Counter on (2, 2): contains a onion;\n\nSo the kitchen counters that are not listed as containing something are empty? The list of kitchen counter locations is fixed, but some are empty. The ones that are non-empty are listed above. The other kitchen counters (from the list) are: (0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (0,4), (5,4), (6,4) are not mentioned in the non-empty list? Actually, the non-empty kitchen counter list only lists the ones that have items. The others are empty.\n\nSo Bob can drop his onion at an empty kitchen counter near him. For example, (5,0) is a kitchen counter and not listed as having an item -> so it's empty. But (5,0) is at the bottom. Bob is at (5,3). How to get to (5,0)? \n\nFrom (5,3): \n  Move down to (5,2) -> but (5,2) is not in the non-empty list? So it's empty -> walkable. \n  Then (5,1) -> empty? \n  Then (5,0) is a kitchen counter -> non-empty, so he cannot step on it. He must stand adjacent and face it to drop.\n\nSo:\n  Bob can move down to (5,2) (action D) -> then down to (5,1) (action D) -> then at (5,1) he can face down (press D) to face (5,0) and then press I to place the onion.\n\nBut note: he is holding an onion. He can place it on the kitchen counter at (5,0) if it is empty (which it is). \n\nSo Bob's actions:\n  Turn 83: D -> move to (5,2), face down.\n  Turn 84: D -> move to (5,1), face down.\n  Turn 85: D -> cannot move to (5,0) (non-empty) so he turns to face down (he is already facing down? After the last move, he is at (5,1) facing down. So pressing D again: he is facing down and the tile below is non-empty, so he doesn't move and remains facing down? Actually, he was already facing down. So nothing changes? \n\nBut we want him to interact with (5,0). He is at (5,1) and (5,0) is adjacent and he is facing down (towards it). So at turn 85, he can press I to place the onion on (5,0). \n\nBut wait: he moved to (5,1) at turn 84. Then at turn 85, he can do I? \n\nSo Bob's actions starting at turn 83:\n  Turn 83: D -> (5,2), face down.\n  Turn 84: D -> (5,1), face down.\n  Turn 85: I -> place onion on (5,0). Now he is holding nothing.\n\nThen he can go to the plate dispenser at (0,2). But that is far. Alternatively, Alice can get the plate? But we saw it's a long way for Alice.\n\nAlternatively, after Bob drops the onion, he can go to the plate dispenser. But let's see the distance.\n\nBut note: there is a serving counter at (6,2). And the pot at (4,0) is at (4,0). The soup will be ready at turn 93. We need to get a plate and then serve the soup at (6,2).\n\nAfter Bob drops the onion, he is at (5,1) holding nothing. He can then go to the plate dispenser? \n  From (5,1) to (0,2): \n    One way: left to (4,1) -> but (4,1) is where Alice is? At turn 83, Alice is at (4,1). But Alice is moving. By turn 85, Alice is at (3,1) (after turn 83: L to (3,1)) and then turn 84: U (face up) and turn 85: I (still at (3,1)). Then turn 86: R to (4,1) -> so at turn 86, Alice is at (4,1). Bob at turn 85 is at (5,1). At turn 86, Bob is going to move? \n\nWe must coordinate so they don't block each other.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Bob get the plate. But the path might be long.\n\nAnother idea: use the kitchen counter at (6,1) which has an onion? But we don't need more onions for the pot that is cooking. We need a plate.\n\nBut note: there is a plate dispenser at (0,2). We must get a plate from there.\n\nAlternatively, is there a plate on a kitchen counter? The state doesn't mention any plate on counters, only onions. So we have to get a fresh plate.\n\nSo let's plan for Bob to get the plate after he drops the onion.\n\nBob at turn 85: at (5,1), holding nothing.\n\nPath to (0,2):\n  (5,1) -> (4,1) -> but at turn 86, Alice is at (4,1). So they cannot be on the same tile. Therefore, Bob should wait until Alice moves? Or take a different path.\n\nAt turn 86, Alice moves to (4,1) (from (3,1) with R). So at turn 86, Alice is at (4,1). Bob is at (5,1). Bob can move left to (4,1) at turn 86? But then he would be at (4,1) at the same time as Alice -> not allowed. Therefore, Bob must wait or go another way.\n\nBob can go up? From (5,1) to (5,2) -> then (5,3) -> then (4,3) -> ... but that is going away from (0,2).\n\nAlternatively, Bob can go left at turn 86? But (4,1) is occupied by Alice. So he cannot move left. Therefore, he must do something else.\n\nWe can have Bob wait at (5,1) for one turn? Then at turn 87, Alice moves to (4,1) and then at turn 88 she does D and I (so she is at (4,1) for turns 87 and 88). Then at turn 87, Bob can move left to (4,1) -> but again, Alice is there. So until Alice leaves (4,1), Bob cannot go through.\n\nTherefore, Bob should go up to (5,2) at turn 86? Then (5,3) at turn 87? Then we can have him go left to (4,3) at turn 88? Then (3,3) -> but (3,3) is not in non-empty? Then (2,3) -> then (1,3) -> then (0,3) is a kitchen counter (non-empty) -> then from (0,3) to (0,2) is adjacent? But (0,2) is the plate dispenser.\n\nBut (0,3) is a kitchen counter that has an onion? The state says: Kitchen Counter on (0,3): contains an onion. So it's occupied. Bob can stand at (0,3)? No, because it's non-empty. He must stand adjacent to (0,2). The adjacent tiles to (0,2) are: (0,1) [kitchen counter, non-empty], (0,3) [kitchen counter, non-empty], (1,2) [empty?]. So the only accessible adjacent tile is (1,2). \n\nSo Bob must get to (1,2) and face left to interact with (0,2).\n\nSo Bob's path to plate dispenser:\n  From (5,1) at turn 85 (after dropping onion) -> \n  Turn 86: U -> to (5,2), face up.\n  Turn 87: U -> to (5,3), face up.\n  Turn 88: L -> to (4,3), face left.\n  Turn 89: L -> to (3,3), face left. (assuming (3,3) is empty)\n  Turn 90: L -> to (2,3), face left.\n  Turn 91: L -> to (1,3), face left.\n  Turn 92: D -> to (1,2), face down. (because (1,3) to (1,2): down)\n  Turn 93: L -> face left (to face (0,2)) -> but (0,2) is non-empty so he doesn't move, only turns left.\n  Turn 94: I -> grab plate.\n\nThen he has the plate at turn 94. But the soup is ready at turn 93. So he can serve it at turn 94? But he needs to get to the pot at (4,0) to serve the soup? Or can he serve from the serving counter? \n\nTo serve the soup, the player must be holding the soup in a plate. How do we get the soup? We must use the plate on the pot that has the cooked soup. Then the player will be holding the soup plate. Then take it to the serving counter.\n\nSo after the soup is cooked, a player must go to the pot with a plate and interact to get the soup, then go to the serving counter at (6,2) and interact to deliver.\n\nSo at turn 93, the soup at (4,0) is ready. Bob is still on his way to get the plate? At turn 93, Bob is at (1,2) and about to turn left. Then at turn 94 he grabs the plate. Then he must go to the pot at (4,0) to get the soup.\n\nHow long for Bob to go from (1,2) to (4,0)?\n  (1,2) -> (2,2) is kitchen counter (non-empty) -> cannot go. So go down to (1,1) -> then (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> then face down to interact with (4,0).\n\nSteps:\n  Turn 94: I (grab plate at (0,2)) -> at (1,2) holding plate.\n  Turn 95: D -> to (1,1), face down.\n  Turn 96: R -> to (2,1), face right.\n  Turn 97: R -> to (3,1), face right.\n  Turn 98: R -> to (4,1), face right.\n  Turn 99: D -> face down (to interact with pot at (4,0)) -> without moving.\n  Turn 100: I -> get the soup (now holding soup plate).\n\nThen he must go to the serving counter at (6,2). From (4,1) to (6,2):\n  (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (6,1) is kitchen counter -> so from (5,1) he can go up to (5,2) -> then (6,2) is adjacent? But (6,2) is the serving counter (non-empty) so he cannot step on it. He must stand adjacent and face it.\n\nSo:\n  Turn 101: R -> to (5,1), face right.\n  Turn 102: U -> to (5,2), face up.\n  Turn 103: R -> to (6,2)? blocked -> so turn to face right (without moving).\n  Turn 104: I -> deliver the soup.\n\nThis is too many turns and we are at turn 104.\n\nAlternatively, Alice could get the soup? Alice is free after turn 88. She can get the plate.\n\nAt turn 89, Alice is at (4,1) holding nothing. She can go to the plate dispenser? But we saw it's far. But note: she is closer to the pot when the soup is ready. She could get the plate and then serve.\n\nBut how can she get the plate? The same path we planned for Bob.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Bob drop the onion and then immediately go to get the plate, and Alice can stay near the pot and wait for the soup to be ready, then go get a plate? But that would be inefficient.\n\nAnother idea: after Alice adds the onion at turn 88, she is at (4,1). She can immediately go to get a plate. But she is blocked by counters. \n\nWe need a better plan.\n\nLet me think differently: \n\nThe pot at (4,0) will be ready at turn 93. We can have Bob drop his onion at a kitchen counter that is near the plate dispenser? Then he can go get a plate and then come back. But that might not be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the onions on the kitchen counters to complete the other pot? But that doesn't help immediately.\n\nBut note: the kitchen counter at (3,2) had an onion which Alice took. Now it's empty. So we can use it for storage.\n\nBut for the immediate soup, we need to get a plate to the pot at turn 93.\n\nSince Alice is free from turn 89, she can go to get the plate. But the path is long. Let's calculate the minimum steps for Alice to get to the plate dispenser:\n\n  (4,1) -> (3,1) [L] -> (2,1) [L] -> (1,1) [L] -> (1,2) [U] -> then at (1,2) she can face left to interact with (0,2) [L then I].\n\nBut (1,1) to (1,2) is one move up. Then at (1,2) she must turn left to face the dispenser and then interact.\n\nSo:\n  Turn 89: L -> (3,1)\n  Turn 90: L -> (2,1)\n  Turn 91: L -> (1,1)\n  Turn 92: U -> (1,2)\n  Turn 93: L -> face left (to (0,2))\n  Turn 94: I -> grab plate.\n\nThen she has the plate at turn 94. Then she needs to go back to the pot at (4,0) to get the soup.\n\n  Turn 95: R -> face right (doesn't move) -> then move? \n  Actually, at turn 94, she is at (1,2) facing left. To move right, she must press R to turn right? Or press R to move right? \n  Turn 94: after I, she is at (1,2) facing left.\n  Turn 95: R -> turn to face right (without moving) -> now facing right.\n  Turn 96: R -> move to (2,2) -> but (2,2) is a kitchen counter (non-empty) -> so she cannot move there. Therefore, she must go down to (1,1) first.\n\n  Turn 96: D -> to (1,1), face down.\n  Turn 97: R -> to (2,1), face right.\n  Turn 98: R -> to (3,1), face right.\n  Turn 99: R -> to (4,1), face right.\n  Turn 100: D -> face down (to interact with pot).\n  Turn 101: I -> get the soup.\n\nThen she needs to deliver to (6,2):\n  Turn 102: U -> face up (or move? she is at (4,1) facing down. Press U to face up? \n  But to move to the serving counter, she can:\n  Turn 102: R -> to (5,1), face right.\n  Turn 103: U -> to (5,2), face up.\n  Turn 104: R -> to (6,2)? blocked -> turn to face right.\n  Turn 105: I -> deliver.\n\nThis is even later.\n\nGiven the time constraints, we should focus on one soup and then the next.\n\nBut note: the game might continue beyond our horizon H. We are to plan for several turns, say H=10 or 20? The problem doesn't specify H. But we are to plan a sequence of actions.\n\nAlternatively, we can have Alice and Bob work on two pots: one almost full (at (4,0)) and the other at (2,0) with one onion.\n\nAlice can complete the (4,0) pot, then while it's cooking, they can work on the other pot.\n\nFor the (4,0) pot, since it will be ready in 5 turns after we add the onion (turn 88), and we have to get a plate, we might as well have Bob, who is free after dropping the onion, to get the plate and then wait near the pot.\n\nBut the path to the plate dispenser is long.\n\nAnother idea: use the kitchen counters to pass items? But they are far apart.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's focus on the next few turns for Alice.\n\nWe are to output Alice's actions for the next several turns. We can also optionally output Bob's, but the task is for Alice.\n\nThe task says: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\"\n\nSo we can plan for Alice only, and assume Bob will do something reasonable, or we can plan for both. But the answer format only requires actions for Alice? \n\nThe answer format: \n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nIt doesn't say for whom. But the context is for Alice. The teammate is Bob.\n\nThe task: \"plan a sequence of actions ... for Alice (and optionally Bob)\"\n\nSo we are to output Alice's actions. Bob's actions are optional. We can assume Bob will be controlled separately.\n\nTherefore, we focus on Alice's actions.\n\nAlice's goal: to maximize the total reward. So she should work on completing the soups.\n\nAt turn 83, Alice is at (4,1) holding nothing. The pot at (4,0) needs one onion. The nearest onion is at (3,2) (kitchen counter).\n\nSo as planned:\n  Turn 83: L -> move to (3,1), face left.\n  Turn 84: U -> cannot move up, so face up.\n  Turn 85: I -> pick up onion from (3,2).\n\nThen she has the onion. Then she should go to the pot at (4,0) to add it.\n\n  Turn 86: R -> move to (4,1), face right.\n  Turn 87: D -> cannot move down, so face down.\n  Turn 88: I -> add onion to pot.\n\nThen she is free. Then she can go to get a plate for this soup.\n\n  Turn 89: L -> to (3,1), face left.\n  Turn 90: L -> to (2,1), face left.\n  Turn 91: L -> to (1,1), face left.\n  Turn 92: U -> to (1,2), face up.\n  Turn 93: L -> face left (towards plate dispenser).\n  Turn 94: I -> grab plate.\n\nThen she has a plate. Then she should go to the pot to get the soup. But the soup is ready at turn 93. So at turn 94, she can start moving back.\n\n  Turn 95: R -> face right.\n  Turn 96: D -> to (1,1), face down.\n  Turn 97: R -> to (2,1), face right.\n  Turn 98: R -> to (3,1), face right.\n  Turn 99: R -> to (4,1), face right.\n  Turn 100: D -> face down.\n  Turn 101: I -> get the soup.\n\nThen deliver to (6,2):\n  Turn 102: R -> to (5,1), face right.\n  Turn 103: U -> to (5,2), face up.\n  Turn 104: R -> face right (towards serving counter at (6,2)).\n  Turn 105: I -> deliver.\n\nThis is a lot of turns. We might only be planning for a short horizon, say 10 turns. Then we only output until turn 93 or so.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify H. Since the soup is ready at turn 93, and we are at turn 83, that's 10 turns away. So we might plan for 10 turns: until turn 93.\n\nSo for Alice, from turn 83 to 93 (10 actions):\n\n  Turn 83: L\n  Turn 84: U\n  Turn 85: I\n  Turn 86: R\n  Turn 87: D\n  Turn 88: I\n  Turn 89: L\n  Turn 90: L\n  Turn 91: L\n  Turn 92: U\n  Turn 93: L   (face left at (1,2))\n\nThen at turn 93, the soup is ready, and Alice is at (1,2) facing left, holding nothing. She has not grabbed the plate yet.\n\nAlternatively, after she adds the onion at turn 88, she can try to help with the other pot at (2,0) which has one onion. It needs two more onions.\n\nShe could get an onion and add to that pot.\n\nAt turn 89, she is at (4,1) holding nothing. She can go to a kitchen counter with an onion or to an dispenser.\n\nThe nearest onion might be at (3,2) but she just took it, so it's empty now. The next nearest might be at (2,2) or (3,4) or (4,4) (dispenser).\n\nFor example, to (2,2): \n  From (4,1): \n    Turn 89: L to (3,1)\n    Turn 90: U to (3,2) -> blocked -> face up.\n    Then she is at (3,1) facing up. Then she can move left to (2,1) (press L) -> then at (2,1) she can face up to interact with (2,2) which has an onion.\n\n    Turn 91: L to (2,1), face left.\n    Turn 92: U to (2,2) -> blocked -> face up.\n    Turn 93: I -> pick up onion from (2,2).\n\nThen she has an onion. Then she can add it to the pot at (2,0).\n\n  Turn 94: D -> to (2,1), face down.\n  Turn 95: D -> to (2,0)? blocked (pot) -> face down.\n  Turn 96: I -> add onion. Then the pot will have 2 onions.\n\nBut this is beyond turn 93.\n\nSince we are only planning for Alice and for a limited horizon, and the task doesn't specify H, we might choose H=10 turns.\n\nSo for the next 10 turns, Alice will complete the (4,0) pot and start heading for a plate or for the next onion.\n\nGiven that, the first plan until turn 93 (10 actions) is:\n\n  Turn 83: L\n  Turn 84: U\n  Turn 85: I\n  Turn 86: R\n  Turn 87: D\n  Turn 88: I\n  Turn 89: L\n  Turn 90: L\n  Turn 91: L\n  Turn 92: U\n  Turn 93: L\n\nBut at turn 93, she is at (1,2) and she can then interact to grab a plate on turn 94.\n\nThis is a valid plan for the next 10 turns.\n\nBut to maximize reward, we might consider that Bob might be getting the plate. Since we don't control Bob, we assume he will be doing something reasonable. For example, after dropping the onion, he might go to get a plate.\n\nSo to be safe, Alice can also work on the second pot.\n\nAfter turn 88, she is at (4,1). The pot at (2,0) is close. She can go to (2,0) to add an onion if she gets one.\n\nFrom (4,1) to (2,0):\n  (4,1) -> (3,1) [L] -> (2,1) [L] -> then at (2,1) she can face down to interact with (2,0).\n\nBut she needs an onion. She can pick one from (2,2) or (3,2) (but (3,2) is empty now) or (2,2) has an onion.\n\nSo after turn 88:\n  Turn 89: L -> (3,1)\n  Turn 90: U -> cannot move to (3,2) -> face up.\n  Turn 91: L -> (2,1), face left.\n  Turn 92: U -> face up (towards (2,2))\n  Turn 93: I -> pick up onion from (2,2)\n\nThen she has an onion and is at (2,1). Then she can add it to the pot at (2,0) on turn 94: D (face down) and turn 95: I.\n\nSo for 10 turns, we only get to turn 93, which is:\n\n  Turn 83: L\n  Turn 84: U\n  Turn 85: I\n  Turn 86: R\n  Turn 87: D\n  Turn 88: I\n  Turn 89: L\n  Turn 90: U\n  Turn 91: L\n  Turn 92: U\n  Turn 93: I\n\nThis way, at turn 93, she has an onion and is at (2,1), and can then add it to the pot at (2,0) on the next turn.\n\nThis seems better because it progresses the second pot.\n\nTherefore, I choose this latter plan.\n\nAlice's actions from turn 83 to turn 93 (10 actions):\n\nTurn 83: L\nTurn 84: U\nTurn 85: I\nTurn 86: R\nTurn 87: D\nTurn 88: I\nTurn 89: L\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: L\nTurn 92: U\nTurn 93: I\n\nSo she ends up holding an onion (picked from (2,2)) and at (2,1), facing up.\n\nThen she can add it to the pot at (2,0) in the next turn.\n\nThis is a good setup for the next soup.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 83: L\nTurn 84: U\nTurn 85: I\nTurn 86: R\nTurn 87: D\nTurn 88: I\nTurn 89: L\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: L\nTurn 92: U\nTurn 93: I\n}\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice should focus on completing the pot at (4,0) first, as it only requires one more onion to start cooking (it currently has 2 onions). After adding the onion, she should work on the second pot at (2,0) by collecting an onion from a nearby kitchen counter. This sequence optimizes coordination by ensuring the first pot starts cooking quickly and progresses the second pot.\n\n### Alice's Action Plan (Turns 83 to 93):\n- **Turn 83: L**  \n  Move left to (3,1) and face left. This positions Alice closer to the onion on the kitchen counter at (3,2).\n- **Turn 84: U**  \n  Change orientation to up (facing (3,2)) without moving, as (3,2) is a kitchen counter and non-walkable.\n- **Turn 85: I**  \n  Interact to pick up the onion from (3,2). Alice is now holding an onion.\n- **Turn 86: R**  \n  Move right to (4,1) and face right. This positions Alice above the pot at (4,0).\n- **Turn 87: D**  \n  Change orientation to down (facing (4,0)) without moving, as (4,0) is a pot and non-walkable.\n- **Turn 88: I**  \n  Interact to add the onion to the pot at (4,0). The pot now has 3 onions and starts cooking (will be ready at turn 93). Alice is now holding nothing.\n- **Turn 89: L**  \n  Move left to (3,1) and face left. This moves Alice toward the kitchen counter at (2,2), which has an onion for the second pot.\n- **Turn 90: U**  \n  Change orientation to up (facing (3,2)) without moving. This reorients Alice to access (2,2) later.\n- **Turn 91: L**  \n  Move left to (2,1) and face left. This positions Alice below the kitchen counter at (2,2).\n- **Turn 92: U**  \n  Change orientation to up (facing (2,2)) without moving, as (2,2) is a kitchen counter.\n- **Turn 93: I**  \n  Interact to pick up the onion from (2,2). Alice is now holding an onion for the second pot at (2,0).\n\n### Why This Plan?\n- **Completes First Pot Quickly**: By turn 88, the pot at (4,0) is cooking and will be ready at turn 93 (5-turn cook time). This sets up a future reward of 20.\n- **Progresses Second Pot**: Alice collects an onion for the pot at (2,0) (currently 1 onion) by turn 93. She can add it next turn (turn 94) to advance toward another soup.\n- **Efficient Pathing**: Minimizes movement by leveraging nearby kitchen counters (3,2) and (2,2) for onions, avoiding long detours.\n- **Coordination with Bob**: Bob is holding an onion at turn 83. He can drop it on an empty kitchen counter (e.g., (5,0)) and then fetch a plate from (0,2) for the soup ready at turn 93. This parallel effort maximizes efficiency.\n\n### Expected Outcome:\n- Pot at (4,0) starts cooking at turn 88 and will be ready at turn 93.\n- Alice will be at (2,1) holding an onion at turn 93, ready to add it to the pot at (2,0) on turn 94.\n- Bob can deliver the first soup (from pot (4,0)) around turn 94-98, earning 20 reward, while Alice prepares the second pot.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 83: L\nTurn 84: U\nTurn 85: I\nTurn 86: R\nTurn 87: D\nTurn 88: I\nTurn 89: L\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: L\nTurn 92: U\nTurn 93: I\n}",

There are no tomato dispensers, so we can only make onion soup.\n\nCurrent game state at turn 86:\n\n- Alice: at (3,1), facing left, holding nothing.\n- Bob: at (5,1), facing down, holding nothing.\n\nKitchen counters have onions at: (6,1), (6,3), (0,3), (1,4), (3,4), (3,2), (2,2), (5,0). That's a lot of onions scattered around.\n\nPots:\n- Pot at (4,0): has 2 onions, not full, cooking not started.\n- Pot at (2,0): has 1 onion, not full, cooking not started.\n\nServing counter is at (6,2).\n\nThe goal is to deliver cooked soups. Since pots need 3 onions to start cooking, and cooking takes 5 turns, I need to add ingredients to the pots to complete them and then serve them.\n\nFirst, let's look at the pot at (4,0): it has 2 onions, so it needs one more onion to start cooking.\n\nPot at (2,0) has 1 onion, so it needs two more onions.\n\nPlayers can carry one item at a time. There are onion dispensers at (2,4) and (4,4), but also many onions on kitchen counters that can be picked up.\n\nTo maximize efficiency, Alice and Bob should work together to add onions to the pots quickly.\n\nAlice is at (3,1), facing left. Left of her is (2,1), which should be an empty tile since it's not listed as non-empty. Tile types: kitchen counters are at specific positions, but (2,1) isn't listed, so it should be walkable.\n\nSimilarly, Bob is at (5,1), facing down.\n\nAction history: Alice's recent actions: D, I, D, I, L. Bob's: R, R, D, D, I. But I don't think I need to use the history much, except to understand how they got there, but for planning forward, I can focus on current state.\n\nNow, I need to plan a sequence of actions for Alice for the next H turns. H isn't specified, so I should choose a reasonable horizon, say until we can deliver a soup or something. But since cooking takes time, I need to think longer term.\n\nThe pot at (4,0) is almost full; it needs one more onion. If we add one onion, it will start cooking immediately and take 5 turns to cook.\n\nSimilarly, pot at (2,0) needs two onions.\n\nOnce cooked, someone needs to grab a plate, serve the soup from the pot, and deliver it to the serving counter.\n\nPlate dispenser is at (0,2).\n\nServing counter is at (6,2).\n\nAlso, there are onions on counters that can be used instead of going to dispensers, saving time.\n\nFor example, Alice is at (3,1). If she moves left to (2,1), then she can face down to interact with pot at (2,0)? Pot at (2,0) is at (2,0), which is below (2,1)? Positions: (2,0) is at row 0, column 2? Typically in grids, (x,y) might be column and row, but here it's listed as (x,y), and moves: L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y), U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1). So y increases up, I think? U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so higher y is north.\n\nIn the grid, (0,0) is bottom-left? Let's see the tile positions.\n\nKitchen counters: (0,0), (1,0), etc., but (0,0) is listed, and (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), so rows from 0 to 4? y from 0 to 4.\n\n(0,0) to (6,4), I think.\n\nAlice at (3,1), which is x=3,y=1.\n\nPot at (2,0): x=2,y=0\n\nPot at (4,0): x=4,y=0\n\nTo interact with a pot, player must be adjacent and facing it.\n\nFor pot at (2,0), adjacent tiles are: (2,1) north, (1,0) west, (3,0) east, (2,-1) but y=-1 invalid, so only (2,1), (1,0), (3,0).\n\nSimilarly for pot at (4,0): adjacent are (4,1), (3,0), (5,0).\n\nNow, (3,0) is a kitchen counter, and it has an onion? Non-empty kitchen counters: (5,0) has onion, but (3,0) is not listed in non-empty, so it might be empty or not present. Kitchen counters exist at (3,0)? Tile types: kitchen counter positions include (3,0)? From the list: Kitchen Counter: [(0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), ...] yes, (3,0) is a kitchen counter, but in non-empty list, it says (5,0) has onion, but (3,0) is not mentioned, so it might be empty. Non-empty kitchen counters are listed separately: \"Kitchen Counter on (6,1): contains a onion; ... (5,0): contains a onion;\" and (3,0) is not in the non-empty list, so (3,0) kitchen counter is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (1,0) is a kitchen counter but not listed as non-empty, so empty.\n\nBack to Alice: at (3,1), facing left. Left is west, so (2,1). (2,1) should be empty tile, since not listed.\n\nIf Alice moves left to (2,1), she can then face down to interact with pot at (2,0)? From (2,1), facing down (south) to (2,0), which is the pot. Yes.\n\nBut pot at (2,0) has only one onion, and Alice is holding nothing. To add an onion, she needs to be holding an onion.\n\nSimilarly, Bob at (5,1), facing down. Down is (5,0), which is a kitchen counter with an onion? (5,0) is a kitchen counter with an onion.\n\nBob is at (5,1), facing down. If he interacts, since he's facing down and (5,0) is adjacent below, and it's a kitchen counter with an item, he can pick it up if he's empty-handed. Interact with kitchen counter: if player empty-handed and counter occupied, can pick up item.\n\nSo Bob can pick up the onion from (5,0) by interacting, since he's at (5,1) facing down, and (5,0) is adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, Alice needs to get an onion to add to a pot.\n\nNow, for the pot at (4,0), it needs one more onion. If we add it, it starts cooking.\n\nPot at (2,0) needs two more.\n\nSince pot at (4,0) is closer to being ready, it might be better to complete that first.\n\nAlice is at (3,1), which is above (3,0), but (3,0) is a kitchen counter, empty, so nothing there.\n\nThere is a kitchen counter at (3,2) with an onion. (3,2) is a kitchen counter with onion.\n\nAlice at (3,1), facing left. (3,1) to (3,2) is north? y+1 is up, so from (3,1) to (3,2) is U, up.\n\nCurrently facing left, so to interact with (3,2), she needs to face up.\n\nShe can move up to (3,2)? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter with an item, so it's not empty, so she cannot walk onto it. Players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles.\n\nSo to interact with (3,2), she needs to be adjacent and facing it.\n\nAdjacent tiles to (3,2): (3,1) south, (3,3) north, (2,2) west, (4,2) east.\n\n(3,1) is empty, Alice is there now.\n\n(2,2) is kitchen counter with onion, (4,2) is kitchen counter, but in non-empty list, (2,2) has onion, (4,2) not listed, so empty? Non-empty: (3,2) has onion, (2,2) has onion, (4,2) is a kitchen counter but not listed as non-empty, so empty.\n\nKitchen counter positions include (4,2), and it's not in non-empty list, so it's empty.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) might be empty or not, but not listed.\n\nSo from (3,1), Alice can face up to interact with (3,2). Since she is at (3,1), which is adjacent south of (3,2), and facing up would be towards (3,2), so she can interact to pick up the onion from the counter.\n\nInteract: if player is on empty tile adjacent to the tile and facing it.\n\nAlice at (3,1), which is empty, adjacent to (3,2) to the north. If she faces up, she can interact to pick up the onion, since she is empty-handed.\n\nThen she would be holding an onion.\n\nSimilarly, Bob can pick up the onion from (5,0) by interacting from (5,1) facing down.\n\nNow, what to do with the onions.\n\nAlice can add her onion to a pot. Which pot? Pot at (4,0) needs one, pot at (2,0) needs two.\n\nPot at (4,0) is at (4,0), Alice at (3,1). After picking up onion from (3,2), she would be at (3,1) holding onion.\n\nThen to add to pot at (4,0): adjacent tiles are (4,1), (3,0), (5,0).\n\n(4,1) should be empty, (3,0) is kitchen counter empty, (5,0) has onion but occupied.\n\nAlice can move to (4,1)? (4,1) not listed, so empty tile.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (4,1) is right, R.\n\nThen from (4,1), she can face down to (4,0) and interact to add onion.\n\nSimilarly, for pot at (2,0), from (3,1) she could go left to (2,1), then face down to (2,0).\n\nBut since (4,0) only needs one, it might be better to add there.\n\nBob is at (5,1), can pick up onion from (5,0) by facing down and interacting.\n\n(5,0) has onion, Bob at (5,1) facing down, so he can interact now to pick it up.\n\nThen he would be holding an onion.\n\nHe can add it to a pot. Pot at (4,0) is at (4,0), adjacent tiles include (5,0) but (5,0) is occupied, so he can't be there. He needs to be at an empty adjacent tile.\n\nFrom (5,1), he can move left to (4,1)? (4,1) should be empty.\n\nThen from (4,1), face down to (4,0) and interact to add onion.\n\nSimilarly, he could go to other pots.\n\nBut (4,0) needs one, so if either Alice or Bob adds an onion there, it starts cooking.\n\nPot at (2,0) needs two onions.\n\nNow, cooking takes 5 turns. Once cooking starts, after 5 turns, it can be served.\n\nTo serve, a player needs a clean plate, gets it from plate dispenser at (0,2), then go to the pot, interact to serve the soup (if holding plate and pot has cooked soup), then go to serving counter at (6,2) to deliver.\n\nBut since cooking takes time, we need to plan for that.\n\nAlso, there are many onions on counters, so we can use those instead of dispensers.\n\nFor example, to add onions to pot at (2,0), we can pick up onions from nearby counters.\n\nCounters with onions: (6,1), (6,3), (0,3), (1,4), (3,4), (3,2), (2,2), (5,0) but (5,0) might be picked up by Bob.\n\n(3,2) is near Alice.\n\n(2,2) is also near, at (2,2).\n\nAlice at (3,1), (2,2) is west and north? From (3,1), (2,2) is left and up, so not adjacent directly. She would need to move.\n\nFirst, let's get the pot at (4,0) started.\n\nAlice can pick up onion from (3,2) by facing up and interacting.\n\nCurrent turn t=86.\n\nAlice action: since she is at (3,1), facing left. To interact with (3,2) above, she needs to face up. So she can change orientation to U.\n\nInteract requires facing the tile, so she needs to face up.\n\nAction: change orientation to U.\n\nThen, with orientation up, she can interact to pick up onion from (3,2).\n\nSimilarly for Bob.\n\nBut actions are per turn, one action per player per turn, I think? The task is to plan actions for Alice, and optionally Bob, but the answer format is for Alice, I think. Let me see.\n\n\"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\" but the answer format shows only actions for Alice, like \"Turn t: a_t\" for Alice.\n\nIt says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", but in the answer format, it's only Alice's actions listed.\n\nLook: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t_1} Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} ... } \" and a_t for Alice.\n\nIt doesn't mention Bob's actions in the output. So probably I only need to output Alice's actions, and assume Bob will act reasonably or something. But to maximize, I need to coordinate, so I should suggest what Bob should do, but since the output is only for Alice, I need to make a plan that works with Bob's potential actions.\n\nPerhaps I can assume Bob will cooperate, and I can plan for both, but only output Alice's part.\n\nThe problem says \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\", so I might include Bob's actions in the plan, but for output, only Alice's are listed? I think the answer format is only for Alice.\n\nTo be safe, I'll plan for both, but output only Alice's actions as per format.\n\nSince Bob is also a player, and we need to coordinate, I should consider what Bob might do.\n\nFrom Bob's action history: R, R, D, D, I. He was moving right, right, down, down, interact. At turn 86, he is at (5,1) facing down, and (5,0) has onion, so he might interact to pick it up.\n\nSimilarly, Alice was D,I,D,I,L, so she might have been interacting with something.\n\nBut at current state, let's plan forward.\n\nFirst, to start cooking pot at (4,0), which needs one onion.\n\nAlice can get an onion from (3,2) and add it.\n\nBut she needs to face up first.\n\nTurn 86: Alice changes orientation to U to face up.\n\nThen turn 87: she interacts with (3,2) to pick up onion.\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nThen she needs to add to pot. Pot at (4,0) is at (4,0). From (3,1), she can move right to (4,1) on turn 88.\n\nThen turn 89: face down to face (4,0).\n\nTurn 90: interact to add onion to pot at (4,0).\n\nAfter adding, pot has 3 onions, cooking starts at turn 90, so it will be ready at turn 95 (90 + 5).\n\nMeanwhile, Bob at (5,1) facing down. On turn 86, he can interact to pick up onion from (5,0).\n\nThen he is holding onion. He can add it to a pot. But pot at (4,0) will be filled by Alice, so he should add to pot at (2,0) or something.\n\nPot at (2,0) needs two onions.\n\nBob at (5,1) after picking up onion, can move to (4,1) to add to (4,0), but if Alice is doing that, it might be redundant, and pot might be full.\n\nSince Alice is adding to (4,0), Bob should work on the other pot.\n\nHe can go to pot at (2,0).\n\nBut (2,0) is at (2,0), Bob at (5,1), far.\n\nHe can add to (2,0) but need to move there.\n\nThere are onions on counters, so he could pick another onion or add to pot.\n\nAfter adding, he can get another item.\n\nBut let's focus on Alice first.\n\nFor Alice, after adding onion to (4,0) at turn 90, the pot starts cooking.\n\nNow, Alice is at (4,1), facing down, holding nothing after interact (since she added the onion).\n\nThen she can work on the other pot.\n\nPot at (2,0) needs two onions.\n\nShe can get an onion from nearby, say from (2,2) or (3,2) but (3,2) she just picked, it might be empty now? When she picked from (3,2), it should be empty now, unless another onion, but it had one onion.\n\nKitchen counters can have multiple items? No, each counter can hold one item, I think. From the description, \"Kitchen Counter: Pick up items (if player empty-handed and counter occupied) or place items (if player holding item and counter empty).\" So each counter can hold one item at a time.\n\nSo after Alice picks up from (3,2), it is empty.\n\nSimilarly, other counters have onions.\n\nFor example, (2,2) has onion, which is at (2,2).\n\nAlice at (4,1) after adding to pot.\n\n(4,1) to (2,2): (2,2) is left and up, so move left to (3,1), then up to (3,2), but (3,2) is empty, or directly to (2,2)? From (4,1) to (3,1) left, then from (3,1) to (2,1) left? (2,1) should be empty.\n\nThen from (2,1), she can face up to interact with (2,2), which has onion.\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), adjacent tiles: (2,1) south, (2,3) north, (1,2) west, (3,2) east.\n\n(2,1) is empty, so she can be at (2,1), face up, interact to pick up onion from (2,2).\n\nThen she can add to pot at (2,0).\n\nFrom (2,1), face down to (2,0), interact to add onion.\n\nPot at (2,0) had one onion, after adding, it has two, still needs one more.\n\nThen she needs to get another onion.\n\nBut there are many, she can get from another counter.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob can help.\n\nBut since I'm only planning for Alice, I'll continue.\n\nAlso, for the cooking pot, after 5 turns, it can be served.\n\nPot at (4,0) starts cooking at turn 90, ready at turn 95.\n\nAt turn 95, someone needs to serve it.\n\nTo serve, need a clean plate from (0,2), go to pot, interact to get soup, then go to serving counter at (6,2) to deliver.\n\nSimilarly, for pot at (2,0), if we add onions, it can start cooking.\n\nNow, let's list Alice's actions.\n\nStart at turn 86.\n\nAlice at (3,1), facing left, holding nothing.\n\nTo pick up from (3,2): need to face up.\n\nTurn 86: U (change orientation to up)\n\nNow facing up.\n\nTurn 87: I (interact with (3,2) to pick up onion) → now holding onion.\n\nThen, to go to pot at (4,0): move right to (4,1).\n\nTurn 88: R (move to (4,1))\n\nNow at (4,1), facing? After move, orientation changes? The action: move changes position and orientation. Specifically, when you move, you move to the adjacent tile and your orientation changes to the direction you moved.\n\nFrom the action description: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" So when you move, you change position and your orientation becomes the direction you moved.\n\nSimilarly, \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" But for change orientation, no move, only orientation change.\n\nAnd interact: no move.\n\nIn this case, for turn 88, she moves R to (4,1), so after move, she is at (4,1) facing right (since she moved right).\n\nBut to interact with pot at (4,0), she needs to face down.\n\nSo she needs to change orientation to down.\n\nTurn 89: D (change orientation to down) — but D could be move down or orientation down? Actions: Move D or Change Orientation D? The actions are: Move (L/R/U/D) or Change Orientation (L/R/U/D) or Interact (I) or Stay (S).\n\nSo to change orientation without moving, she needs to use Change Orientation action.\n\nAfter turn 88, she is at (4,1) facing right.\n\nTurn 89: Change orientation to D (down)\n\nNow facing down.\n\nTurn 90: I (interact with (4,0) to add onion) → now pot has 3 onions, cooking starts. Alice holding nothing.\n\nNow, turn 90, cooking starts, ready at turn 95.\n\nAlice at (4,1) facing down.\n\nNow, she can work on pot at (2,0).\n\nPot at (2,0) has one onion, needs two more.\n\nAlice can get another onion.\n\nNearby, (2,2) has onion at (2,2).\n\nFrom (4,1), she can move left to (3,1).\n\nTurn 91: L (move left to (3,1), now facing left)\n\nThen from (3,1), move left to (2,1).\n\nTurn 92: L (move left to (2,1), now facing left)\n\nNow at (2,1), facing left.\n\nTo pick up from (2,2): (2,2) is north, so she needs to face up.\n\nTurn 93: U (change orientation to up)\n\nNow facing up.\n\nTurn 94: I (interact with (2,2) to pick up onion) → now holding onion.\n\nThen add to pot at (2,0): from (2,1), she is already adjacent south, and can face down to interact.\n\nBut currently facing up, so need to change orientation.\n\nTurn 95: D (change orientation to down)\n\nTurn 96: I (interact to add onion to pot at (2,0))\n\nNow pot had one, now has two onions. Still needs one more to start cooking.\n\nAlice holding nothing.\n\nShe needs to get another onion for the pot.\n\nMeanwhile, the soup at (4,0) is ready at turn 95.\n\nAt turn 95, someone should serve it.\n\nBob might be available.\n\nBut let's see Alice.\n\nShe can continue to get another onion for pot at (2,0).\n\nFor example, from (2,1), she can go to other counters.\n\n(3,2) is empty, (2,2) she just picked, empty.\n\nNearby, (1,4) or others, but far.\n\n(3,4) has onion, but at (3,4), which is north.\n\nFrom (2,1), she can move up to (2,2)? But (2,2) is kitchen counter with item, but she just picked it, so now empty? After she picked onion from (2,2) at turn 94, it is empty now.\n\nSo she can move to (2,2)? But kitchen counter is not empty tile, players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles, but now it is empty, so she can walk onto it? When a kitchen counter is empty, it is still a tile, but players can walk on it? Tile types: empty tile is walkable, dispensers, pots, serving counter, kitchen counter are non-empty tiles, I think.\n\nFrom the description: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and non-empty tiles include kitchen counters, etc.\n\nKitchen counter is a tile type, and when it has an item, it's occupied, but even when empty, it is still a kitchen counter tile, which is not an empty tile, so players cannot walk on it, only interact from adjacent.\n\nConfirm: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" so kitchen counter is not empty tile, so players cannot walk on it, only interact from adjacent empty tiles.\n\nSimilarly for other non-empty tiles.\n\nSo (2,2) is a kitchen counter tile, so Alice cannot walk on it, even if empty. She can only interact from adjacent tiles like (2,1), (2,3), etc.\n\nAfter picking from (2,2), she is at (2,1), and (2,2) is now empty kitchen counter.\n\nTo get another onion, she can go to another counter, e.g. (3,4) or (1,4), but let's see positions.\n\n(3,4) has onion, at x=3,y=4.\n\nFrom (2,1), she can move up to (2,2)? Cannot, not walkable. Move right to (3,1), which is empty.\n\nTurn 96: after adding to pot at turn 96, she is at (2,1) facing down.\n\nAfter turn 96 I, she added onion, now at (2,1) facing down, holding nothing.\n\nThen she can move right to (3,1).\n\nTurn 97: R (move to (3,1), facing right)\n\nThen from (3,1), move up to (3,2)? (3,2) is kitchen counter, empty now, not walkable. So she can only go to (3,2) if she moves, but cannot, so she needs to go around or to other tiles.\n\nFrom (3,1), she can move up? To (3,2) not possible, so move right to (4,1) or left to (2,1), but (2,1) she just left.\n\nTo go north, (3,2) is blocked, so she needs to go to (4,1) or (2,1), then to (4,2) or (2,3), but (4,2) is kitchen counter, might be empty.\n\n(4,2) is kitchen counter, not listed as non-empty, so empty, but still not walkable.\n\nThe only walkable tiles are empty tiles.\n\nFor example, from (3,1), adjacent: left (2,1), right (4,1), down? (3,0) is kitchen counter, not walkable, up (3,2) kitchen counter, not walkable. So she can only move left or right.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) can move left to (1,1)? (1,1) not listed, if empty, or right to (3,1), or up? (2,2) not walkable, down to (2,0) pot, not walkable.\n\nSo Alice at (2,1) can only move left to (1,1) if empty, or right to (3,1).\n\n(1,1) should be empty, not listed.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) can move left to (3,1), right to (5,1), or up? (4,2) not walkable, down to (4,0) not walkable.\n\nBack to Alice at (2,1) after turn 96.\n\nShe can move to (3,1) on turn 97: R to (3,1), facing right.\n\nThen from (3,1), she can go to (3,2) by interacting, but to interact, she needs to be adjacent and facing, which she is, at (3,1) south of (3,2), but (3,2) is empty, so she can place an item or pick up, but no item, so nothing to do.\n\nShe can move to (4,1) to go north or something.\n\nBut to get an onion, she needs to go to a counter with onion.\n\nFor example, (3,4) has onion at (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is at y=4, Alice at y=1, so need to go north.\n\nBut the area might have limited access.\n\nFor example, row y=2 has kitchen counters at (2,2),(3,2),(4,2), all non-walkable, so players can only be on y=0,1,3,4? y=0 has pots and counters, not all walkable.\n\nWalkable tiles are only the empty ones not occupied by non-empty tiles.\n\nFor instance, positions like (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) are likely empty and walkable.\n\n(1,1) not listed, so empty.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3), etc.\n\nTo go from (3,1) to (3,4), she needs to go around, since y=2 is blocked by counters.\n\nShe can go to (3,3) or something.\n\n(3,3) not listed, if empty.\n\nFrom (3,1), she can move right to (4,1), then from (4,1), move up? (4,2) not walkable, so she can only move left or right on y=1.\n\nThen to go north, she needs to go to a column where y=2 has no counter or to y=3.\n\nFor example, at x=1, (1,1) can move up to (1,2)? (1,2) is not listed as a kitchen counter or other, so it might be an empty tile.\n\nTile types: only specific positions are non-empty, others are empty tiles.\n\nFrom the list: kitchen counters at (0,0),(1,0),(3,0),(5,0),(6,0),(0,1),(6,1),(2,2),(3,2),(4,2),(0,3),(6,3),(0,4),(1,4),(3,4),(5,4),(6,4)\n\nDispensers: onion at (2,4),(4,4), plate at (0,2)\n\nPots at (2,0),(4,0)\n\nServing at (6,2)\n\nSo for example, position (1,1): not in any list, so it is an empty tile, walkable.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2): not listed, so empty tile.\n\n(1,3): not listed, empty.\n\n(2,1): empty, as before.\n\n(2,3): not listed, empty.\n\n(3,1): empty.\n\n(3,3): not listed, empty.\n\n(4,1): empty.\n\n(4,3): not listed, empty.\n\n(5,1): empty.\n\n(5,2): not listed, empty.\n\n(5,3): not listed, empty.\n\n Etc.\n\nSo Alice can move to (3,1), then to (3,2) is not possible, but she can move to (3,3)? From (3,1), to go to (3,3), she can go to (3,3) directly? Not adjacent, need path.\n\nFrom (3,1), she can move up? But (3,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so she cannot move directly to (3,3).\n\nShe needs to go to another row.\n\nFor example, move left to (2,1), then from (2,1) move up to (2,2)? Not walkable, so move to (2,3) if possible.\n\n(2,3) not listed, so empty tile.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (2,3) not adjacent; (2,1) to (2,2) not possible, so she can go to (1,1) first or to (3,1), then to (4,1), etc., but to go north, she can go to x=1 or x=5 where y=2 is empty.\n\nAt x=1, (1,2) is empty tile, so from (2,1) she can move left to (1,1), then from (1,1) move up to (1,2), then from (1,2) move up to (1,3), etc.\n\nSimilarly, at x=5, (5,2) empty, so from (5,1) move up to (5,2).\n\nBut for Alice at (2,1), to go to (3,4), she can go to (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) but (1,4) is kitchen counter with onion, not walkable, so she can go to (1,3), then interact with (1,4) if facing.\n\nBut it's far.\n\n(3,4) has onion, at (3,4).\n\nFrom (3,1), she can go to (3,3) via (3,2) not possible, so go to (4,1) -> (4,2) not walkable, so go to (5,1) -> (5,2) -> (5,3) -> (5,4) but (5,4) kitchen counter, not walkable.\n\nThen to (3,4), from (5,3) to (4,3) to (3,3) to (3,4)? (3,4) not walkable.\n\nShe can be at (3,3), which is empty, then face north to interact with (3,4).\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut it's multiple moves.\n\nFor now, since pot at (2,0) needs one more onion, and Alice is close, she can get it from nearby.\n\nAfter turn 96, she is at (2,1) facing down.\n\nShe can move to (3,1) on turn 97: R to (3,1), facing right.\n\nThen from (3,1), she can move to (4,1) on turn 98: R to (4,1), facing right.\n\nNow at (4,1), facing right.\n\nThen she can go north to (4,2)? Not walkable, so move to (5,1) on turn 99: R to (5,1), facing right.\n\nAt (5,1), she can move up to (5,2) on turn 100: U to (5,2), facing up.\n\nThen at (5,2), she can move left to (4,2)? (4,2) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so move to (5,3) U to (5,3), facing up.\n\nThen at (5,3), move left to (4,3) on turn 101: L to (4,3), facing left.\n\nThen to (3,3) turn 102: L to (3,3), facing left.\n\nThen at (3,3), she can face up to interact with (3,4) which has onion.\n\nTurn 103: U (change orientation up)\n\nTurn 104: I (pick up onion from (3,4))\n\nThen she has onion, can add to pot at (2,0).\n\nBut pot at (2,0) is far, at (2,0).\n\nFrom (3,3) to (2,0): need to go south and west.\n\nMove down to (3,2) not possible, so move to (3,3) to (4,3) to (4,2) not, etc, or to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) empty, from (3,3) move left to (2,3) turn 105: L to (2,3), facing left.\n\nThen at (2,3), move down to (2,2) not possible, so move to (2,4)? (2,4) is onion dispenser, not walkable.\n\n(2,3) to (2,2) not, so she can only move to (1,3) or (2,4) not, or down? (2,3) to (2,2) not, so adjacent tiles: (2,4) north, but (2,4) is dispenser, not walkable, (2,2) south not walkable, (1,3) west, (3,3) east.\n\n(1,3) should be empty.\n\nSo move to (1,3) on turn 106: L to (1,3), facing left.\n\nThen at (1,3), she can move down to (1,2) on turn 107: D to (1,2), facing down.\n\nThen at (1,2), move down to (1,1) on turn 108: D to (1,1), facing down.\n\nThen at (1,1), move right to (2,1) on turn 109: R to (2,1), facing right.\n\nThen at (2,1), face down to pot at (2,0).\n\nTurn 110: D (change orientation down)\n\nTurn 111: I (add onion to pot at (2,0))\n\nNow pot had two onions (after Alice added earlier), so now has three, starts cooking at turn 111.\n\nThen ready at turn 116.\n\nBut this is many turns, and we have the first soup ready at turn 95.\n\nAt turn 95, soup at (4,0) is ready.\n\nAlice is busy with this, so Bob should serve it.\n\nBut I'm not controlling Bob.\n\nFor the first soup, Alice could serve it.\n\nLet's think differently.\n\nAfter adding to (4,0) at turn 90, Alice is at (4,1) facing down.\n\nInstead of working on (2,0), she can go to get a plate to serve the soup when ready.\n\nPlate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nFrom (4,1) to (0,2): far.\n\nFor example, move left to (3,1), then to (2,1), then to (1,1), then to (1,2), then to (0,2)? (0,2) is plate dispenser, not walkable, so she can be at (0,1) or (0,3) or (1,2).\n\n(0,1) is kitchen counter with onion? Non-empty kitchen counters: (0,1) is not listed; listed are (6,1), (6,3), (0,3), etc. (0,3) has onion, but (0,1) is a kitchen counter position, but not listed as non-empty, so empty.\n\nKitchen counter positions include (0,1), and it's not in non-empty list, so empty kitchen counter.\n\nPlayers cannot walk on it, so to access plate dispenser at (0,2), she can be at (0,1), (0,3), or (1,2).\n\n(0,1) is adjacent east? (0,2) has adjacent tiles: (0,1) west, (0,3) east, (1,2) south, and north? (0,3) is east? Positions: (0,2) at x=0,y=2.\n\nAdjacent: (0,1) south (y-1), (0,3) north (y+1), (1,2) east (x+1), and west x-1 invalid.\n\nSo she can be at (0,1), (0,3), or (1,2).\n\n(0,1) is kitchen counter, empty, not walkable, so she can be at (1,2) or (0,3).\n\n(0,3) is kitchen counter with onion, not walkable.\n\n(0,3) has onion, so occupied.\n\nSo the only accessible tile is (1,2), which is empty tile.\n\nFrom (1,2), she can face west to interact with (0,2) plate dispenser.\n\nSimilarly, (0,1) she can be at if empty, but (0,1) is kitchen counter, not walkable, so she cannot stand there.\n\nOnly from (1,2) or (0,3), but (0,3) occupied, so only (1,2).\n\nFrom Alice's position at (4,1), to (1,2): move left to (3,1), then to (2,1), then to (1,1), then to (1,2) up.\n\nTurn 91: L to (3,1), facing left\n\nTurn 92: L to (2,1), facing left\n\nTurn 93: L to (1,1), facing left\n\nTurn 94: U to (1,2), facing up\n\nThen at (1,2), facing up, but to interact with (0,2), she needs to face west, since (0,2) is west of (1,2)? (1,2) to (0,2) is west, so she needs to face left.\n\nTurn 95: L (change orientation left)\n\nTurn 96: I (interact with plate dispenser to get plate) → now holding clean plate.\n\nThen she needs to go to pot at (4,0) to serve the soup.\n\nBut at turn 95, the soup is ready, so she can serve.\n\nBut she is at (1,2), far from (4,0).\n\nMove to (1,1) down, then to (2,1) right, to (3,1) right, to (4,1) right, then face down to (4,0).\n\nMany moves.\n\nTurn 97: D to (1,1), facing down\n\nTurn 98: R to (2,1), facing right\n\nTurn 99: R to (3,1), facing right\n\nTurn 100: R to (4,1), facing right\n\nTurn 101: D (change orientation down)\n\nTurn 102: I (serve soup from pot at (4,0)) → now holding soup in plate.\n\nThen she needs to deliver to serving counter at (6,2).\n\nFrom (4,1), move right to (5,1), then to (6,1)? (6,1) is kitchen counter with onion, not walkable, so move to (5,2) up, then to (6,2)? (6,2) is serving counter, not walkable.\n\nServing counter at (6,2), adjacent tiles: (6,1) south, (6,3) north, (5,2) west.\n\n(6,1) kitchen counter with onion, occupied, not accessible.\n\n(6,3) kitchen counter with onion, occupied.\n\n(5,2) empty tile.\n\nSo from (5,2), she can face east to interact with (6,2).\n\nAlice at (4,1) after serving, move to (5,1) turn 103: R to (5,1), facing right\n\nTurn 104: U to (5,2), facing up\n\nTurn 105: R (change orientation right? But to face east for (6,2), from (5,2), (6,2) is east, so face right.\n\nTurn 105: R (change orientation right)\n\nTurn 106: I (interact to deliver soup) → reward 20.\n\nBut this is turn 106, and she just delivered.\n\nBut the pot at (2,0) is not started yet.\n\nWith Bob helping, it could be faster.\n\nSince Bob is also there, he can serve the first soup.\n\nFor example, at turn 86, Bob at (5,1) facing down, can interact to pick up onion from (5,0).\n\nThen he can add to pot at (4,0) or (2,0).\n\nIf he adds to (4,0), it starts cooking, but Alice is also doing that.\n\nTo avoid duplication, Bob can work on the other pot.\n\nOr, after picking up onion, he can go to get a plate for the soup.\n\nBut let's assume for Alice's plan, she focuses on one thing.\n\nPerhaps the best is for Alice to complete the pot at (4,0) and then get a plate to serve it.\n\nBut it takes many turns.\n\nSince there are onions on counters, for pot at (2,0), Alice can add the second onion quickly.\n\nAfter adding to (4,0) at turn 90, Alice at (4,1) facing down.\n\nThen move left to (3,1) turn 91: L to (3,1), facing left\n\nMove left to (2,1) turn 92: L to (2,1), facing left\n\nThen at (2,1), face up to pick up onion from (2,2) turn 93: U to face up\n\nTurn 94: I pick up onion from (2,2)\n\nNow holding onion.\n\nThen face down to add to pot at (2,0) turn 95: D to face down\n\nTurn 96: I add onion to pot at (2,0)\n\nPot had 1, now 2 onions.\n\nThen she needs one more onion.\n\nFrom (2,1), she can move to (1,1) to get from (1,4) or something, but far.\n\n(6,1) has onion, but far.\n\nBob can add the last onion.\n\nFor Alice, she can stay or do something else.\n\nBut at turn 95, soup at (4,0) is ready, so she can go to serve it.\n\nFrom (2,1) at turn 96, after adding, she is at (2,1) facing down.\n\nThen move right to (3,1) turn 97: R to (3,1), facing right\n\nMove right to (4,1) turn 98: R to (4,1), facing right\n\nThen at (4,1), face down turn 99: D to face down\n\nTurn 100: I serve soup from (4,0) if it is cooked, at turn 95 it is ready, so at turn 100 she can serve, assuming no one else did.\n\nThen holding soup, need to deliver to (6,2).\n\nMove right to (5,1) turn 101: R to (5,1), facing right\n\nThen move up to (5,2) turn 102: U to (5,2), facing up\n\nThen face right turn 103: R to face right\n\nTurn 104: I deliver to (6,2)\n\nReward at turn 104.\n\nThen for the other pot, if Bob adds the last onion, it can start cooking.\n\nBut I think for Alice's actions, I can plan to complete one delivery.\n\nSince the horizon H is not specified, I can plan for about 10 turns or until a delivery.\n\nBut let's see the initial state.\n\nAnother idea: Alice can go directly to get a plate after adding the onion to (4,0).\n\nAt turn 90, Alice at (4,1) facing down.\n\nInstead of going to (2,0), she can go to (1,2) for plate.\n\nTurn 91: L to (3,1), facing left\n\nTurn 92: L to (2,1), facing left\n\nTurn 93: L to (1,1), facing left\n\nTurn 94: U to (1,2), facing up\n\nTurn 95: L (change orientation left to face west)\n\nTurn 96: I get plate from (0,2)\n\nNow holding plate.\n\nThen go to (4,0) to serve soup.\n\nTurn 97: D to (1,1), facing down\n\nTurn 98: R to (2,1), facing right\n\nTurn 99: R to (3,1), facing right\n\nTurn 100: R to (4,1), facing right\n\nTurn 101: D to face down\n\nTurn 102: I serve soup from (4,0)\n\nThen to deliver.\n\nTurn 103: R to (5,1), facing right\n\nTurn 104: U to (5,2), facing up\n\nTurn 105: R to face right\n\nTurn 106: I deliver to (6,2)\n\nSo around turn 106 delivery.\n\nIf she serves at turn 102, soup is ready since turn 95, so yes.\n\nBut at turn 95, when soup is ready, she is at (1,2) getting plate, so she can serve only at turn 102.\n\nBob might serve it earlier if he is free.\n\nBut for planning, I'll assume Alice does this.\n\nTo save turns, she can get the plate before the soup is ready.\n\nCooking starts at turn 90, ready at 95.\n\nShe can get the plate during the cooking time.\n\nFor example, after adding onion at turn 90, she can immediately go for the plate.\n\nTurn 91: L to (3,1)\n\nTurn 92: L to (2,1)\n\nTurn 93: L to (1,1)\n\nTurn 94: U to (1,2)\n\nTurn 95: L to face left\n\nTurn 96: I get plate\n\nNow turn 96, she has plate, but soup ready at 95, so she can go to serve.\n\nTurn 97: D to (1,1)\n\nTurn 98: R to (2,1)\n\nTurn 99: R to (3,1)\n\nTurn 100: R to (4,1)\n\nTurn 101: D to face down\n\nTurn 102: I serve\n\nSame as above.\n\nIf she gets the plate earlier, but she was busy adding the onion.\n\nAt turn 86 to 90 she was adding the onion.\n\nNo time.\n\nSo minimum around turn 102 for delivery.\n\nFor the sequence, I can output from turn 86 to say turn 102.\n\nBut let's list Alice's actions for the next few turns to start the process.\n\nSince the pot at (4,0) needs only one onion, and Alice is close, she should do that.\n\nThen for Bob, he can pick up onion from (5,0) and add to (2,0) or something.\n\nBut for Alice's plan:\n\nTurn 86: U (face up to interact with (3,2))\n\nTurn 87: I (pick up onion from (3,2))\n\nTurn 88: R (move to (4,1), facing right)\n\nTurn 89: D (face down to interact with (4,0))\n\nTurn 90: I (add onion to (4,0), cooking starts)\n\nThen she can go for the plate.\n\nTurn 91: L (move to (3,1), facing left)\n\nTurn 92: L (move to (2,1), facing left)\n\nTurn 93: L (move to (1,1), facing left)\n\nTurn 94: U (move to (1,2), facing up)\n\nTurn 95: L (change orientation left to face west for (0,2))\n\nTurn 96: I (get plate from dispenser)\n\nTurn 97: D (move to (1,1), facing down)\n\nTurn 98: R (move to (2,1), facing right)\n\nTurn 99: R (move to (3,1), facing right)\n\nTurn 100: R (move to (4,1), facing right)\n\nTurn 101: D (face down)\n\nTurn 102: I (serve soup from (4,0))\n\nThen she can deliver, but it's separate.\n\nFor the sequence, I can stop here or continue to delivery.\n\nBut at turn 102 she serves, so she needs to deliver.\n\nTurn 103: R (move to (5,1), facing right)\n\nTurn 104: U (move to (5,2), facing up)\n\nTurn 105: R (change orientation right to face east for (6,2))\n\nTurn 106: I (deliver to serving counter)\n\nSo Alice's actions from turn 86 to 106.\n\nBut H is not specified, so I can output for about 20 turns or until key action.\n\nSince the task is to maximize reward, and this delivers one soup, reward 20.\n\nWith the other pot, if Bob works on it, we can get another, but for Alice's part, this is fine.\n\nAt the beginning, Alice could have added to (2,0) first, but (4,0) is closer to being full.\n\nBob can add to (4,0) faster.\n\nFor example, Bob at (5,1) facing down, can interact on turn 86 to pick up onion from (5,0), then move left to (4,1) on turn 87, face down turn 88, interact turn 89 to add to (4,0), same as Alice.\n\nBut Alice is also doing it, so they might both try, but only one can add.\n\nTo coordinate, Alice can do something else.\n\nBut since I'm only planning for Alice, I'll proceed with Alice adding to (4,0).\n\nSo the plan is as above.\n\nFor the answer, list Alice's actions.\n\nTurn 86: U\nTurn 87: I\nTurn 88: R\nTurn 89: D\nTurn 90: I\nTurn 91: L\nTurn 92: L\nTurn 93: L\nTurn 94: U\nTurn 95: L\nTurn 96: I\nTurn 97: D\nTurn 98: R\nTurn 99: R\nTurn 100: R\nTurn 101: D\nTurn 102: I\nTurn 103: R\nTurn 104: U\nTurn 105: R\nTurn 106: I\n\nBut turn 105 is change orientation R, not move.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 105, she is at (5,2), needs to face right for (6,2), so change orientation.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 89, D is change orientation.\n\nIn the actions, when it's move or change orientation, it's specified by the action.\n\nFor example, \"Move R\" or \"Change Orientation R\", but in the action set, it's just the letter, so for move R it's R, for change orientation R it's also R? No.\n\nThe actions are: Move (L/R/U/D), Change Orientation (L/R/U/D), Interact (I), Stay (S).\n\nSo for move, it's one of L/R/U/D for moving in that direction.\n\nFor change orientation, it's a separate action, also with L/R/U/D for the direction to face.\n\nBut in the notation, how to distinguish? In the action list, it's the same letter, but the context determines if it's move or change orientation.\n\nFrom the description: \"Each player can: Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nSo when a player performs L/R/U/D, it could be move or change orientation.\n\nBut in the action, it's specified as Move or Change Orientation.\n\nIn the answer format, it's just a_t in {U,D,L,R,I,S}, so for move U, it's U, for change orientation U, it's also U? That would be ambiguous.\n\nLet's see the action history: Alice's action history: D, I, D, I, L\n\nFor example, D could be move down or change orientation down.\n\nBut in context, from position, we can infer.\n\nIn planning, for Alice, when she does U on turn 86, it is change orientation to up, not move, because she is at (3,1), and (3,2) is north, not walkable, so she can't move up, so it must be change orientation.\n\nSimilarly, when she is at (4,1) and does D on turn 89, she can't move down to (4,0) because it's not empty, so it must be change orientation.\n\nIn general, when a player performs L/R/U/D, if the adjacent tile in that direction is empty and walkable, it could be move, but if not, it must be change orientation.\n\nBut the player can choose to change orientation even if move is possible.\n\nIn the plan, I need to specify the action type.\n\nBut in the answer, it's just the letter, so I think it's fine, as the game engine knows.\n\nFor turn 86: Alice at (3,1), to face up, she does Change Orientation U.\n\nAction: U\n\nThen turn 87: Interact I\n\nTurn 88: Move to (4,1), so Move R\n\nAction: R\n\nTurn 89: Change orientation to down, so Change Orientation D\n\nAction: D\n\nTurn 90: Interact I\n\nAnd so on.\n\nFor the sequence, I'll output the actions as above.\n\nTo save time, after adding the onion, she can go directly to (5,2) or something for delivery, but she needs a plate first.\n\nI think the plan is reasonable.\n\nSo for Alice, actions from turn 86 to 106 as listed.\n\nBut for the box, I need to output the sequence.\n\nSince H is not specified, I can output for 20 turns or so.\n\nTurn 86 to 105 is 20 turns? 86 to 105 is 20 actions: 86,87,...,105 is 20 turns.\n\n86 to 105 inclusive is 20 turns.\n\n105 is turn number, actions from t=86 to t=105 is 20 actions.\n\nt=86: first action, t=87: second, ..., up to t=105: 20th action.\n\nThen at t=106 she delivers.\n\nBut I can stop at t=105.\n\nOr include t=106.\n\nSince the soup is delivered at t=106, I'll include it.\n\nSo sequence:\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice should prioritize completing the nearly full pot at (4,0) (which has 2 onions and needs 1 more to start cooking) and then serve the cooked soup. This leverages the existing onions on kitchen counters to save time, avoiding dispensers. The pot at (4,0) will start cooking at turn 90 and be ready at turn 95. Alice will then fetch a plate from the dispenser at (0,2) and serve/deliver the soup by turn 106 for a reward of 20. Bob can independently work on the other pot at (2,0) by adding onions (e.g., picking up onions from nearby counters like (5,0) or (2,2)), but since the task only requires Alice's actions, the plan focuses on her sequence.\n\n### Key Steps in Alice's Plan:\n1. **Turns 86-87:** Pick up an onion from the kitchen counter at (3,2) by facing up and interacting.\n2. **Turns 88-90:** Move to (4,1), face down, and add the onion to pot (4,0), starting cooking (ready at turn 95).\n3. **Turns 91-96:** Navigate to (1,2) and get a plate from the dispenser at (0,2) by facing west.\n4. **Turns 97-102:** Return to (4,1), face down, and serve the cooked soup from pot (4,0).\n5. **Turns 103-106:** Move to (5,2), face east, and deliver the soup to the serving counter at (6,2) for reward.\n\nThis sequence ensures one soup is delivered efficiently. Coordination with Bob is implicit: he can add the last onion to pot (4,0) if Alice doesn't (but she does), or work on pot (2,0) to start another soup, but Alice's actions are optimized for immediate reward.\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence (Turns 86 to 106):\n- Turn 86: U (change orientation to up to face (3,2))\n- Turn 87: I (interact to pick up onion from (3,2))\n- Turn 88: R (move right to (4,1), facing right)\n- Turn 89: D (change orientation to down to face (4,0))\n- Turn 90: I (interact to add onion to pot (4,0); cooking starts)\n- Turn 91: L (move left to (3,1), facing left)\n- Turn 92: L (move left to (2,1), facing left)\n- Turn 93: L (move left to (1,1), facing left)\n- Turn 94: U (move up to (1,2), facing up)\n- Turn 95: L (change orientation to left to face (0,2))\n- Turn 96: I (interact to get plate from dispenser (0,2))\n- Turn 97: D (move down to (1,1), facing down)\n- Turn 98: R (move right to (2,1), facing right)\n- Turn 99: R (move right to (3,1), facing right)\n- Turn 100: R (move right to (4,1), facing right)\n- Turn 101: D (change orientation to down to face (4,0))\n- Turn 102: I (interact to serve soup from pot (4,0); now holding soup)\n- Turn 103: R (move right to (5,1), facing right)\n- Turn 104: U (move up to (5,2), facing up)\n- Turn 105: R (change orientation to right to face (6,2))\n- Turn 106: I (interact to deliver soup to serving counter (6,2); reward +20)\n\n### Notes:\n- **Total Turns:** 21 actions (turns 86 to 106) for one delivery. H=21 is chosen to complete the delivery.\n- **Efficiency:** Uses existing onions (e.g., (3,2)) to avoid dispensers. Cooking time (turns 90-95) overlaps with plate fetching.\n- **Bob's Role:** Bob can pick up the onion from (5,0) on turn 86 (interact down) and add it to pot (2,0) to start another soup, but Alice's actions are independent.\n- **Reward Maximization:** This delivers one soup quickly. If Bob completes pot (2,0), a second soup can be served later for more reward, but Alice's sequence is fixed.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn 86: } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn 87: } I \\\\\n\\text{Turn 88: } R \\\\\n\\text{Turn 89: } D \\\\\n\\text{Turn 90: } I \\\\\n\\text{Turn 91: } L \\\\\n\\text{Turn 92: } L \\\\\n\\text{Turn 93: } L \\\\\n\\text{Turn 94: } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn 95: } L \\\\\n\\text{Turn 96: } I \\\\\n\\text{Turn 97: } D \\\\\n\\text{Turn 98: } R \\\\\n\\text{Turn 99: } R \\\\\n\\text{Turn 100: } R \\\\\n\\text{Turn 101: } D \\\\\n\\text{Turn 102: } I \\\\\n\\text{Turn 103: } R \\\\\n\\text{Turn 104: } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn 105: } R \\\\\n\\text{Turn 106: } I\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 90. Alice is at (4,1) holding an onion, facing Up. Bob is at (3,3) holding nothing, facing Left.\n\nThe goal is to maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes. The only recipe provided requires 3 onions and cooks in 5 turns, giving 20 reward.\n\nCurrent state of pots:\n- Pot at (4,0): has 2 onions. It needs one more onion to start cooking (which takes 5 turns).\n- Pot at (2,0): has 1 onion. It needs two more onions.\n\nThere are many onions scattered on kitchen counters (at (6,1), (6,3), (0,3), (1,4), (3,4), (2,2), (5,0)). Also note the onion dispensers at (2,4) and (4,4) and the plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nAlice is holding an onion and is at (4,1). She is one step above the pot at (4,0). To put her onion in the pot at (4,0), she needs to be adjacent and facing the pot. Currently, she is at (4,1) and facing Up. The pot is at (4,0), which is directly below her. So she is adjacent (above it) but she is facing Up, which is away from the pot. Therefore, to interact with the pot below, she must face Down.\n\nSteps for Alice to put her onion in the pot at (4,0):\n1. Change orientation to Down (so that she is facing the pot). Since she is adjacent and facing the pot, she can then interact.\nBut note: the action for changing orientation without moving requires that the adjacent tile in the direction of orientation is not empty? Actually, the rule says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" Actually, the rule for moving says that you change position and orientation. For changing orientation, it says: \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This seems to imply that changing orientation is only allowed when the adjacent tile in the new direction is not empty? That doesn't make sense because we can change orientation without moving even if the adjacent tile is empty? \n\nLooking back: \n- \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding. Let me clarify the rule from the problem:\n\n\"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nThis is confusing. Actually, the rule is: \n- When you choose to move (L/R/U/D), you change position and orientation. But if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty (i.e., not walkable), then you don't move and only change orientation? \n\nBut the problem says: \n- \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\"\n- Then separately: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nSo the \"Change Orientation\" action is distinct. It changes only the orientation, and it does not move. The condition \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one\" is confusing. Actually, I think it means: if you try to change orientation to a direction and the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty, then you cannot move? But the action is not moving. \n\nAlternatively, it might be that the rule is: if you use a \"Change Orientation\" action, then you change your orientation to that direction, but if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty, then you do nothing? That doesn't make sense because you can face a wall or a counter. \n\nI think the intended meaning is that the \"Change Orientation\" action always changes the orientation, regardless of the adjacent tile. The note about \"no move\" might be to clarify that it doesn't move, especially when the adjacent tile is non-empty (so that you don't accidentally try to move into a non-empty tile by using the move action). \n\nBut the problem says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" \n\nI interpret this as: when you choose a direction for changing orientation, if the adjacent tile in that direction is not empty, then you do not move (which is obvious because it's an orientation change) and you change orientation. But if the adjacent tile is empty, then what? The rule doesn't say. I think the rule is poorly worded. \n\nLooking at the context, I believe the \"Change Orientation\" action always changes the orientation and never moves, regardless of adjacent tiles. The condition about the adjacent tile being non-empty might be a mistake. \n\nTherefore, I will assume that a \"Change Orientation\" action (say, D) will make the player face down, and it doesn't depend on what is adjacent. \n\nSo, for Alice at (4,1) facing Up: \n- She can change orientation to Down (by using the 'D' action for orientation change? But note: the actions are U, D, L, R, I, S. The problem does not have separate codes for orientation change and movement. \n\nWait, the problem lists the actions as: Move (L/R/U/D) and Change Orientation (L/R/U/D) and Interact (I) and Stay (S). But in the answer format, we have to use one of {U, D, L, R, I, S}. \n\nThis is ambiguous. How do we differentiate between moving and changing orientation? \n\nReading again: \n- \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation.\" \n- \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\nBut the problem says: \"Each player (Alice/Bob) can:\" and then lists the actions. And then in the answer format, we have to use one of {U, D, L, R, I, S}. \n\nSo I think the action set is: \n- If you choose U, D, L, R: that is a move action. It will try to move in that direction and change orientation to that direction. If the move is blocked (because the adjacent tile is not empty), then you don't move, but you still change orientation? \n\nBut the rule for move says: \"Changes position and orientation\" but if the adjacent tile is not empty, then you cannot move. Then what happens? \n\nThe problem says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So if you try to move into a non-empty tile, you stay in place. But what about orientation? \n\nThe problem doesn't specify. However, in typical implementations, if a move is blocked, you don't move and your orientation changes to the direction you tried to move. \n\nSimilarly, the \"Change Orientation\" action: the problem says it changes orientation without moving, and the condition \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one\" might be a mistake. \n\nBut note: the problem says for Change Orientation: \"No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This suggests that if you choose a Change Orientation action, then if the adjacent tile in that direction is non-empty, you don't move (which is always true because it's an orientation change) and you change orientation? \n\nI think the problem intends that the actions U, D, L, R are used for both moving and changing orientation. Specifically, when you choose U, D, L, R:\n- If the adjacent tile in that direction is empty, then you move and change orientation to that direction.\n- If the adjacent tile is not empty, then you don't move, but you change your orientation to that direction.\n\nTherefore, we don't have a separate action for changing orientation without moving. The move action also changes orientation, and if blocked, it only changes orientation.\n\nSo, for Alice to face down, she can try to move down. But the tile below her (4,0) is a pot, which is non-empty (so she cannot walk on it). Therefore, if she does D (move down), she will not move but will change her orientation to down.\n\nThen, she will be at (4,1) facing down, adjacent to the pot at (4,0). Then she can interact (I) to put her onion into the pot.\n\nSo the sequence for Alice at turn 90 and 91:\n- Turn 90: D (try to move down -> blocked, so she turns to face down)\n- Turn 91: I (interact with the pot below -> puts onion in pot)\n\nAfter that, the pot at (4,0) will have 3 onions and start cooking. The cooking will take 5 turns, so it will be ready at turn 96.\n\nNow, we also need to deliver the soup. To deliver, we need a plate with the soup. So someone must get a plate and then serve the soup from the pot to the plate, and then take it to the serving counter.\n\nThe plate dispenser is at (0,2). Currently, Bob is at (3,3) holding nothing. He could go to the plate dispenser and get a plate.\n\nBut note: there is a pot at (2,0) that has only 1 onion. We could also try to complete that pot? However, the recipe only requires 3 onions and we have one pot that will be completed by Alice. The other pot is only 1/3. We have to consider the time: the cooking takes 5 turns, and we are at turn 90. We want to maximize the number of soups delivered.\n\nAlternatively, we can focus on delivering the one that will be ready at turn 96. But note that we have to get a plate and then serve the soup and then deliver.\n\nPlan for Bob:\nBob is at (3,3). He is holding nothing. He can go to the plate dispenser at (0,2). \n\nThe path from (3,3) to (0,2): \n- We can go left and then down? But we have to avoid obstacles.\n\nThe grid: \n- The kitchen counters are at: [(0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)]\n\nSo, at (3,2) there is a kitchen counter. So Bob cannot walk on (3,2). \n\nBob is at (3,3). He can move left to (2,3)? \nWhat is at (2,3)? It's not in the kitchen counter list, so it's empty? Similarly, (2,2) is a kitchen counter, so (2,3) is above it? \n\nThe grid coordinates: \n- (0,0) to (6,4) probably.\n\nWe can map:\n\nRow y=4: counters at (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)\nRow y=3: counters at (0,3), (6,3) -> so (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) are walkable? But Bob is at (3,3) so that is walkable. \n\nTo get to (0,2) from (3,3):\nOne path: \n- Left to (2,3) -> then left to (1,3) -> then left to (0,3) -> then down to (0,2). But (0,3) is a kitchen counter? Yes, (0,3) is a kitchen counter. So Bob cannot step on (0,3). \n\nAlternatively: \n- From (3,3) go down? But down to (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> blocked.\n- So he must go left to (2,3), then down to (2,2)? (2,2) is a kitchen counter -> blocked.\n- Then how? \n\nAnother way: \n- From (3,3) go up? But y+1 is up? The problem says U is (x, y+1). So at (3,3) going up to (3,4). But (3,4) is a kitchen counter -> blocked.\n\nSo Bob's current position (3,3) is surrounded? \n- North (3,4): counter -> blocked.\n- South (3,2): counter -> blocked.\n- East (4,3): not a counter? Let's check: the kitchen counters are listed, and (4,3) is not there -> so empty? \n- West (2,3): not a counter -> empty.\n\nSo Bob can go west to (2,3) or east to (4,3). \n\nBut he needs to go to (0,2). From (2,3) he can go north to (2,4)? (2,4) is an onion dispenser -> non-empty? But onion dispenser is a dispenser, which is not walkable? The problem says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and dispensers are non-empty? \n\nThe tile types: \n- Empty Tile: walkable.\n- Dispensers: non-empty -> not walkable.\n- Pot: non-empty -> not walkable.\n- Serving Counter: non-empty -> not walkable.\n- Kitchen Counter: non-empty -> not walkable.\n\nSo Bob cannot step on any of these non-empty tiles. Only empty tiles are walkable.\n\nTherefore, the path must consist of empty tiles.\n\nLet's list the empty tiles. The grid is 7x5 (x from 0 to 6, y from 0 to 4). \n\nNon-empty tiles: \n- Kitchen Counters: (0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)\n- Onion Dispensers: (2,4), (4,4)\n- Plate Dispenser: (0,2) -> but note: (0,2) is a plate dispenser, so non-empty -> not walkable.\n- Pots: (2,0), (4,0)\n- Serving Counter: (6,2)\n\nSo the walkable tiles are the ones not in the above lists.\n\nFor example, (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3) ... etc.\n\nBut we don't have a full grid, so we assume the rest are empty.\n\nBob at (3,3) can go to:\n- West: (2,3) -> empty? (not in non-empty list) -> walkable.\n- East: (4,3) -> empty? (not in non-empty list) -> walkable.\n\nFrom (2,3), he can go to:\n- North: (2,4) -> onion dispenser -> not walkable.\n- South: (2,2) -> kitchen counter -> not walkable.\n- West: (1,3) -> empty? (not in non-empty list) -> walkable.\n- East: back to (3,3)\n\nFrom (1,3): \n- North: (1,4) -> kitchen counter -> blocked.\n- South: (1,2) -> empty? (not in non-empty list) -> walkable.\n- West: (0,3) -> kitchen counter -> blocked.\n\nSo from (1,3) he can go south to (1,2). \n\n(1,2) is not in the non-empty list, so it's empty.\n\nThen from (1,2) he can go west to (0,2)? (0,2) is a plate dispenser -> non-empty, so not walkable. But he doesn't need to step on the plate dispenser. He can stand adjacent and face it to interact.\n\nTo interact with the plate dispenser at (0,2), Bob must be adjacent and facing it. Adjacent positions: (0,1) is a kitchen counter (non-empty, so not walkable), (0,3) is a kitchen counter (non-empty, not walkable), (1,2) is the only adjacent empty tile? \n\nSo Bob can stand at (1,2) and face west to interact with the plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nSo the path for Bob:\n- From (3,3) move west to (2,3) -> one move.\n- Then west to (1,3) -> second move.\n- Then south to (1,2) -> third move.\n- Then change orientation to west (by trying to move west? But west is (0,2) which is non-empty, so he will turn west without moving). Then interact.\n\nBut note: at (1,2), he is adjacent to (0,2) (west) and (1,1) (south) and (1,3) (north) and (2,2) (east, but (2,2) is kitchen counter, non-empty). \n\nSo to face west, he can try to move west (which is blocked) so he turns west. Then he can interact.\n\nSo Bob's actions to get a plate:\n1. Move left (L) to (2,3) -> turn 90: if we start at turn 90, but we are planning for Alice and Bob simultaneously? \n\nWe have to plan for both. The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". It doesn't say we must plan for Bob? But to maximize collaboration, we should consider Bob's actions too. However, the answer format only asks for Alice's actions? \n\nThe problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". So we can plan for Alice and also suggest what Bob should do, but the answer format only shows Alice's actions? \n\nBut the answer format is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nSo it only shows actions for Alice? But the problem says \"for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". How to interpret? \n\nI think we are to plan Alice's actions, and we can assume Bob will act optimally as well? Or we can coordinate by specifying Bob's actions? But the answer format does not include Bob. \n\nRe-reading: \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob ... plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But the answer format only has one action per turn. \n\nI think we are to plan Alice's actions, and we must assume that Bob will act in a way that we suggest? But the answer format doesn't have Bob. \n\nPerhaps we are only to output Alice's actions, and we hope that Bob (being controlled by another agent) will act appropriately? But the problem says \"collaborate\", so we must consider Bob's actions to avoid conflicts and to coordinate. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think we should focus on Alice's actions and assume that Bob will be controlled by a separate agent (or we can describe what Bob should do, but the answer only requires Alice's actions). \n\nBut to maximize the reward, we need both players to work together. Therefore, I will plan Alice's actions and also describe what Bob should do, but in the answer box, I will only write Alice's actions. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might expect that we plan for both, but the answer format is only for Alice? \n\nLooking at the example: the current state includes Bob's state and action history, so we must account for Bob. \n\nI think the intended way is to plan Alice's actions, and we can assume that Bob will act optimally (or according to a plan we have in mind) but we don't output his actions. \n\nSo for now, I will plan Alice's actions and note what Bob should do to collaborate.\n\nBack to Alice:\n\nAt turn 90: Alice is at (4,1) holding an onion, facing Up. We want her to put the onion in the pot at (4,0). \n- Action at turn 90: D (to face down and try to move down -> blocked, so she turns down and stays at (4,1))\n- Then at turn 91: I (interact with the pot below -> puts onion in the pot at (4,0)). Now the pot has 3 onions and starts cooking. Alice is now holding nothing.\n\nAfter turn 91, Alice is free. She can then help with getting a plate or with the other pot.\n\nBut the soup in (4,0) will be ready at turn 96 (90+6? Actually, the turn when the onion is added is turn 91? So the cooking starts at turn 91 and will take 5 turns, so ready at turn 96.\n\nNow, we need a plate to serve the soup. Bob is going to get the plate, but it will take him 4 turns (as above: three moves and one interact) to get the plate. \n\nBob's actions (if he starts at turn 90):\n- Turn 90: L (move left to (2,3)) -> now at (2,3), facing left? \n- Turn 91: L (move left to (1,3)) -> now at (1,3), facing left.\n- Turn 92: D (move down to (1,2)) -> now at (1,2), facing down? But we want him to face west. \n- Turn 93: L (try to move west -> blocked, so he turns west) -> now facing west at (1,2).\n- Turn 94: I (interact with plate dispenser at (0,2)) -> grabs a plate. Now Bob is holding a plate.\n\nThen, Bob must bring the plate to the pot at (4,0) to serve the soup. But the soup won't be ready until turn 96. \n\nBob is at (1,2) holding a plate. He must go to (4,0). But (4,0) is a pot, so he doesn't step on it. He must be adjacent and facing the pot.\n\nThe path from (1,2) to (4,0):\n- He can go east to (2,2) -> but (2,2) is a kitchen counter -> blocked.\n- So he must go south? (1,1) is empty? (not in non-empty list) -> walkable.\n- Then from (1,1) he can go east to (2,1) -> empty? (not in non-empty list) -> walkable.\n- Then from (2,1) go east to (3,1) -> empty? (not in non-empty list) -> walkable.\n- Then from (3,1) go east to (4,1) -> empty? (at turn 91, Alice was at (4,1) but then she will move? And at turn 91 Alice is at (4,1) and then she does I at turn 91, so at turn 92 Alice is still at (4,1) but then she might move. We have to avoid collision.\n\nAlternatively, Bob can go from (1,2) to (1,1) to (2,1) to (3,1) to (4,1). But (4,1) is where Alice is? \n\nAt turn 91: Alice is at (4,1) and she does I (interact) and remains at (4,1). Then at turn 92, Alice might move away.\n\nBut we are planning for Alice. After Alice puts the onion in the pot at turn 91, she is free. We can have her move away to allow Bob to come to (4,1) to serve the pot.\n\nSo let's plan:\n\nAt turn 92: Alice is at (4,1) holding nothing. She can move away to let Bob come. For example, she can move up to (4,2)? But (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> blocked. She can move left to (3,1) or right to (5,1) or down? Down is (4,0) which is the pot -> blocked.\n\nSo the only moves are left or right? \n- Left: (3,1) -> empty? (not in non-empty list) -> walkable.\n- Right: (5,1) -> but (5,0) is a kitchen counter? (5,0) is non-empty, but (5,1) is not in the non-empty list -> so it's empty? \n\nSo Alice can move left to (3,1) or right to (5,1). \n\nLet's choose left to (3,1) so that Bob can come to (4,1) to serve the pot.\n\nBob will be at (1,2) at turn 94 (after grabbing the plate). Then:\n- Turn 94: Bob is at (1,2) holding plate, facing west. He needs to go to (4,1) to serve the pot at (4,0) (which is below (4,1)). But he must be at (4,1) and facing down to interact with the pot.\n\nSo Bob's path:\n- Turn 94: after I, he is at (1,2) facing west. He needs to go to (4,1). \n- First, he can change orientation to south? By trying to move down? But down is (1,1). \n  - Turn 94: D (move down to (1,1)) -> now at (1,1), facing down.\n- Turn 95: R (move right to (2,1)) -> now at (2,1), facing right.\n- Turn 96: R (move right to (3,1)) -> but at turn 96, Alice might be at (3,1)? \n\nWe have to coordinate so that Alice moves away and doesn't block.\n\nWe plan for Alice:\n\nTurn 90: D (turn down at (4,1))\nTurn 91: I (put onion in pot at (4,0)) -> now holding nothing.\nTurn 92: L (move left to (3,1)) -> now at (3,1), facing left? (because she moved left)\n\nThen at turn 93, 94, ... she can help with something else.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob:\n- Turn 90: L (to (2,3))\n- Turn 91: L (to (1,3))\n- Turn 92: D (to (1,2))\n- Turn 93: L (turn west without moving, because blocked by (0,2)) -> now facing west.\n- Turn 94: I (grab plate from dispenser) -> now holding plate.\n- Turn 94: then D (move down to (1,1)) -> facing down.\n- Turn 95: R (move right to (2,1)) -> facing right.\n- Turn 96: R (move right to (3,1)) -> but at turn 96, Alice is at (3,1) (since she moved there at turn 92 and hasn't moved). So they would collide? \n\nBob cannot move to (3,1) if Alice is there. So we need Alice to move away from (3,1) by turn 96.\n\nAt turn 92, Alice is at (3,1). She can then move again at turn 93: \n- She can move up to (3,2)? But (3,2) is a kitchen counter -> blocked.\n- Down to (3,0)? (3,0) is a kitchen counter -> blocked.\n- Left to (2,1) -> empty? (not in non-empty list) -> walkable. But then Bob will be going to (2,1) at turn 95? \n- Right to (4,1) -> but at turn 92, (4,1) is free? But we want Bob to come to (4,1) later.\n\nAlternatively, Alice can move up? Blocked. So only left or right? \n\nIf she moves left to (2,1) at turn 93, then Bob at turn 95 is going to (2,1) -> again collision.\n\nSo better: at turn 93, Alice moves right to (4,1). But (4,1) is adjacent to the pot at (4,0) and we want Bob to come there to serve the soup. But if Alice is at (4,1), Bob cannot be there.\n\nSo we must have Alice leave (4,1) and (3,1) and go elsewhere.\n\nAfter turn 92: Alice at (3,1). At turn 93, she can move down? Blocked. Up? Blocked. Left to (2,1) or right to (4,1). \n\nBut if she moves right to (4,1) at turn 93, then at turn 94 she can move up? Blocked. Or down? Blocked. Or right to (5,1) -> which is empty? \n- Turn 93: R (to (4,1)) \n- Turn 94: R (to (5,1)) -> now at (5,1)\n\nThen (4,1) is free for Bob.\n\nBob's plan:\n- Turn 94: at (1,2) after grabbing plate, he moves down to (1,1) -> turn 94: D\n- Turn 95: R to (2,1)\n- Turn 96: R to (3,1) -> now at (3,1), which is free because Alice left at turn 93.\n- Then turn 97: R to (4,1) -> now at (4,1), facing right? But we want him to face down to interact with the pot at (4,0).\n\nSo at turn 97, Bob is at (4,1) facing right. He needs to face down. So:\n- Turn 97: D (try to move down -> blocked, so he turns down) -> now facing down.\n- Turn 98: I (interact with pot) -> serves the soup: he puts the plate into the pot and gets a soup in plate. Now he is holding a soup in plate.\n\nThen he must deliver the soup to the serving counter at (6,2). He is at (4,1). He can go to (5,1) and then to (6,1) but (6,1) is a kitchen counter -> blocked. So he must go to (5,1) and then up to (5,2) (if walkable) and then to (6,2).\n\nBut (5,2) is not in the non-empty list, so it's empty? \n- (5,0) is kitchen counter, (5,1) is empty, (5,2) is empty? \n- Then from (5,2) to (6,2): (6,2) is serving counter -> non-empty, so he cannot step on it. He must stand adjacent and face it.\n\nAdjacent to (6,2): \n- (6,1): kitchen counter -> non-empty, not walkable.\n- (6,3): kitchen counter -> non-empty, not walkable.\n- (5,2): empty -> so he can stand at (5,2) and face east to interact with (6,2).\n\nSo Bob's path for delivery:\n- From (4,1) at turn 98 after serving: \n  - Turn 98: after I, he is at (4,1) holding soup. Then:\n  - Turn 99: R (to (5,1)) -> facing right.\n  - Turn 100: U (move up to (5,2)) -> facing up.\n  - Turn 101: R (try to move right to (6,2) -> blocked, so he turns right) -> facing east.\n  - Turn 102: I (interact to deliver) -> gets the reward.\n\nBut the soup was ready at turn 96, but Bob served it at turn 98? The soup is ready at the beginning of turn 96? Then it can be served at any time after. So no problem.\n\nNow, what about Alice? After she moves to (5,1) at turn 94, she can help with the other pot? \n\nThe other pot at (2,0) has only one onion. We could try to complete it? \n\nBut we have many onions on counters. For example, at (5,0) there is an onion on a kitchen counter? The state says: \"Kitchen Counter on (5,0): contains a onion\". But (5,0) is a kitchen counter and non-empty. So Alice can pick it up? \n\nAlice at (5,1) at turn 94. She is holding nothing. She can interact with the kitchen counter at (5,0) if she is adjacent and facing it. \n\n(5,0) is below (5,1). So she is adjacent (above it). She is facing? At turn 94: she moved right to (5,1) and that move would make her face right? \n\nSo to face down, she can try to move down (blocked) to turn down. Then interact.\n\nSo:\n- Turn 94: Alice is at (5,1) (after moving right at turn 93 and 94? Let me check her timeline:\n\nAlice:\n- Turn 90: D -> at (4,1) facing down.\n- Turn 91: I -> at (4,1) facing down, now holding nothing.\n- Turn 92: L -> to (3,1), facing left.\n- Turn 93: R -> to (4,1), facing right.\n- Turn 94: R -> to (5,1), facing right.\n\nThen at turn 95: \n- She can do D (to turn down, because moving down is blocked) -> now facing down.\n- Turn 96: I (interact with kitchen counter at (5,0)) -> picks up the onion.\n\nThen she can take that onion to the other pot at (2,0). \n\nBut the pot at (2,0) has one onion. It needs two more. We could add two onions to make it cook. But we are at turn 96, and cooking takes 5 turns, so it would be ready at turn 101. Then we would need to deliver it. But we are only planning for a few turns? The problem says \"over next several turns (say, H turns)\" but doesn't specify H. We are at turn 90, and we have planned until turn 96 for Alice? \n\nWe might not have enough turns to complete a second soup? And also, we don't know how long the game lasts. But since the problem doesn't specify, we can try to complete one soup and then start the second.\n\nHowever, the immediate goal is to get the first soup delivered. We have a soup that will be ready at turn 96, and Bob is going to serve it at turn 98 and deliver at turn 102. \n\nAlice can start gathering onions for the next soup. But we have only one pot that is partially filled (at (2,0)).\n\nAlternatively, she can help by getting another plate? But we only need one plate per soup.\n\nGiven that we are not sure about the total time, we might focus on the first soup and then the second.\n\nBut for now, let's plan Alice's actions until she picks up the onion at (5,0) and then takes it to the pot at (2,0).\n\nAfter turn 96: Alice picks up the onion at (5,0). Now she is holding an onion. She needs to go to the pot at (2,0). \n\nPath from (5,1) to (2,0):\n- (5,1) -> (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> then above (2,0). \nBut (2,0) is a pot, so she must stand adjacent and face it. The adjacent positions: (1,0) is kitchen counter -> blocked, (2,1) is above, (3,0) is kitchen counter -> blocked. So she must stand at (2,1) and face down.\n\nSo:\n- Turn 97: Alice moves left to (4,1) -> facing left? \n- Turn 98: left to (3,1) -> facing left.\n- Turn 99: left to (2,1) -> now at (2,1), facing left.\n- Turn 100: D (turn down, because moving down is blocked) -> facing down.\n- Turn 101: I (put onion in pot at (2,0)) -> now the pot has 2 onions.\n\nThen she needs to get another onion. There are onions on counters, e.g., at (6,1) or (6,3) or (0,3) etc. \n\nBut we are at turn 101, and the pot at (2,0) needs one more onion. \n\nAlternatively, Bob is going to deliver the first soup at turn 102, then he can help.\n\nBut we are only planning for Alice. And we have to stop at some H. \n\nGiven that the problem doesn't specify H, we can plan for about 10 turns? \n\nBut in the answer, we have to list Alice's actions for the next H turns. Let's set H=10? \n\nBut the problem says \"over next several turns\", so we can choose a reasonable horizon.\n\nAlternatively, we can plan until the first soup is delivered? But we are only controlling Alice.\n\nTo summarize:\n\nAlice's actions for the next 10 turns (t90 to t99):\n\nTurn 90: D (turn down to face pot)\nTurn 91: I (put onion in pot at (4,0))\nTurn 92: L (move left to (3,1))\nTurn 93: R (move right to (4,1)) -> but then we have to free (4,1) for Bob? Actually, at turn 93, Bob is still at (1,2) or (1,1). \nBut we decided that Alice should move to (5,1) to avoid blocking Bob. So:\n\nTurn 93: R (to (4,1)) -> but then turn 94: R (to (5,1))\n\nBut turn 93: move to (4,1) and then turn 94: move to (5,1). Then at turn 95: D (turn down to face the kitchen counter at (5,0))\nTurn 96: I (pick up onion from (5,0))\n\nThen:\nTurn 97: L (to (4,1))\nTurn 98: L (to (3,1))\nTurn 99: L (to (2,1))\nTurn 100: D (turn down to face pot at (2,0))\nTurn 101: I (put onion in pot) -> now the pot has 2 onions.\n\nWe are at turn 101, which is beyond 10 turns from 90? 90 to 99 is 10 turns (t90 to t99: 10 actions). \n\nThe turns: \n- t90: action 1\n- t91: action 2\n- ...\n- t99: action 10\n\nSo we can output 10 actions for Alice.\n\nBut at turn 100 and 101, that would be t90+10 and t90+11, which is beyond our 10 turns. \n\nSo let's plan for 10 turns: t90 to t99 (10 actions).\n\nSo Alice's actions for 10 turns:\n\n1. Turn 90: D\n2. Turn 91: I\n3. Turn 92: L\n4. Turn 93: R\n5. Turn 94: R\n6. Turn 95: D\n7. Turn 96: I\n8. Turn 97: L\n9. Turn 98: L\n10. Turn 99: L\n\nAt turn 99, she arrives at (2,1). Then she can turn down at turn 100 and interact at turn 101, but that's beyond.\n\nAlternatively, we can adjust: after picking up the onion at turn 96, she can go directly to (2,1) in fewer moves? \n\nFrom (5,1) to (2,1): \n- Left to (4,1) -> turn 97\n- Left to (3,1) -> turn 98\n- Left to (2,1) -> turn 99\n\nSo three moves. \n\nBut we have to output 10 actions, so the above 10 actions are for turns 90 to 99.\n\nNote: at turn 99, she is at (2,1) holding an onion. Then she still needs to face down and interact to put it in the pot. But that would be turn 100 and 101, which we don't output.\n\nBut we are only planning for 10 turns.\n\nAlternatively, we can have her help with the first soup? But she doesn't have a plate. \n\nOr after she picks up the onion at (5,0), she can take it to the pot at (2,0) and put it in, but that would take until turn 101. \n\nGiven the constraints, we output 10 actions.\n\nBut we must ensure that in the first few turns, we set up the first soup and then Alice starts gathering for the next.\n\nWe could have Alice get a plate for the second soup? But the second soup isn't started yet. \n\nAnother idea: after Alice puts the onion in the pot at (4,0) at turn 91, she could go to the plate dispenser to get a plate for the first soup? But Bob is already doing that. \n\nIt would be inefficient for both to get plates. \n\nSo the plan above seems reasonable.\n\nTherefore, Alice's actions for the next 10 turns (t90 to t99):\n\nTurn 90: D\nTurn 91: I\nTurn 92: L\nTurn 93: R\nTurn 94: R\nTurn 95: D\nTurn 96: I\nTurn 97: L\nTurn 98: L\nTurn 99: L\n\nBut note: at turn 93, she moves R to (4,1). But Bob might be moving? We have to avoid collision. At turn 93, Bob is at (1,3) or (1,2)? \n\nBob's timeline (if he follows the plan):\n- Turn 90: L -> (2,3)\n- Turn 91: L -> (1,3)\n- Turn 92: D -> (1,2)\n- Turn 93: L -> turn west at (1,2) (without moving)\n- Turn 94: I -> grab plate\n\nSo at turn 93, Bob is at (1,2) and does L (turns west). Alice is at (4,1) at turn 93 (after moving R from (3,1) to (4,1)). They are not at the same location. Then at turn 94, Alice moves R to (5,1) and Bob does I at (1,2). Then at turn 95, Alice does D at (5,1) and Bob moves D to (1,1). \n\nSo no collision.\n\nAlso, at turn 97,98,99: Alice moves from (5,1) to (4,1) to (3,1) to (2,1). Bob at turn 97: he is at (2,1)? \n\nBob:\n- Turn 94: I at (1,2) -> then D to (1,1) [at turn 94? Actually, he can do one action per turn. So after I at turn 94, he is still at (1,2). Then turn 95: D to (1,1). Turn 96: R to (2,1). \n\nSo at turn 96: Bob is at (2,1). Then turn 97: Bob moves R to (3,1). \n\nBut Alice at turn 97: moves L from (5,1) to (4,1). At turn 98: Alice moves L to (3,1). But at turn 98, Bob is at (3,1)? \n\nBob at turn 97: R to (3,1) -> so at turn 97, Bob is at (3,1). Then at turn 98, Bob moves R to (4,1). \n\nAlice at turn 98: moves L to (3,1). But Bob is at (3,1) at turn 97 and then moves to (4,1) at turn 98. So at turn 98, when Alice moves to (3,1), Bob has just left (3,1) to (4,1). So they don't collide? \n\nAt turn 97:\n- Bob: moves to (3,1) -> so at the end of turn 97, Bob is at (3,1).\n- Alice: moves to (4,1) at turn 97? No, Alice at turn 97: from (5,1) moves left to (4,1). So at turn 97, Alice is at (4,1) and Bob is at (3,1). \n\nThen turn 98:\n- Bob: moves R to (4,1) -> but Alice is at (4,1) at the beginning of turn 98? So Bob cannot move to (4,1) because it's occupied by Alice. \n\nCollision! \n\nWe need to avoid that.\n\nTherefore, we must adjust.\n\nAfter Alice picks up the onion at (5,0) at turn 96, she should wait a turn or go a different way.\n\nAt turn 96: Alice is at (5,1) and does I to pick up the onion from (5,0). Then at turn 97, she can stay? Or move left to (4,1) but Bob is coming.\n\nBob at turn 96: moves to (3,1). Then at turn 97: Bob moves to (4,1). So at turn 97, Bob is moving to (4,1). Alice cannot be at (4,1) at turn 97.\n\nSo Alice should not move to (4,1) at turn 97. She can stay at (5,1) for one turn? \n\nBut then she blocks her own path.\n\nAlternatively, she can move down? Blocked. Up? Blocked. Right? To (6,1) is blocked. So only left. \n\nBut if she moves left to (4,1) at turn 97, then she and Bob would both be trying to occupy (4,1) at the same turn? \n\nThe rule: \"Players cannot walk onto/through each other.\" So if Alice tries to move to (4,1) at turn 97 and Bob also tries to move to (4,1) at turn 97, then both would fail? But that's bad.\n\nAlternatively, Alice can wait at (5,1) until Bob passes.\n\nSo:\n- Turn 97: Alice stays (S) at (5,1). \n- Then at turn 98: Bob is at (4,1) (after moving there at turn 97). Alice can then move left to (4,1)? But Bob is there at turn 98. \n\nNo, at turn 98, Bob is at (4,1) and then he moves to (5,1)? No, Bob's plan is to move to (4,1) at turn 97 and then at turn 98 he does D to turn down? But we planned for Bob to move to (4,1) at turn 97 and then at turn 98 he turns down and then at turn 99 he interacts.\n\nSo at turn 98, Bob is at (4,1) facing down. Then at turn 99, he interacts.\n\nAlice can move to (4,1) at turn 98? But Bob is there. So she cannot.\n\nAlice must wait until Bob leaves (4,1). But Bob will stay at (4,1) to interact with the pot at turn 99? \n\nBob's actions at the pot:\n- Turn 97: move to (4,1) [from (3,1)]\n- Turn 98: D (turn down) -> stays at (4,1)\n- Turn 99: I (interact) -> stays at (4,1)\n\nSo Bob is at (4,1) from turn 97 to at least turn 99. \n\nAlice cannot go to (4,1) during that time.\n\nSo Alice should go to (2,1) via a different route? There is no other route from (5,1) to (2,1) without going through (4,1) and (3,1). \n\nTherefore, we must have Alice wait until Bob finishes serving.\n\nSo after turn 96, Alice can stay at (5,1) for a few turns.\n\nAlternatively, she can go to get another onion from a counter and then come back. But that might be inefficient.\n\nGiven the time, we decide to have Alice wait for two turns and then go.\n\nSo adjust Alice's actions:\n\nTurn 90: D\nTurn 91: I\nTurn 92: L\nTurn 93: R\nTurn 94: R\nTurn 95: D\nTurn 96: I   (now holding onion at (5,1))\nTurn 97: S   (stay to avoid collision)\nTurn 98: S   (stay again)\nTurn 99: L   (to (4,1)) -> but at turn 99, Bob is at (4,1) doing I? So collision.\n\nBob is at (4,1) from turn 97 to 99. So at turn 99, Alice cannot move to (4,1).\n\nSo Alice must wait until turn 100 to move, but we are only outputting until turn 99.\n\nTherefore, for the sake of the plan, we output the first 10 actions including two stays.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 90: D\nTurn 91: I\nTurn 92: L\nTurn 93: R\nTurn 94: R\nTurn 95: D\nTurn 96: I\nTurn 97: S\nTurn 98: S\nTurn 99: S   (wait until the way is clear)\n\nOr at turn 99, she can try to move left, but it's blocked by Bob. So she must stay.\n\nAlternatively, she can move in a different direction? Only left is available, but it's blocked.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 90: D\nTurn 91: I\nTurn 92: L\nTurn 93: R\nTurn 94: R\nTurn 95: D\nTurn 96: I\nTurn 97: S\nTurn 98: S\nTurn 99: S\n}\n\nThis is not ideal, but it avoids collision and we have started the second onion gathering.\n\nAfter turn 99, she can then move to (4,1) and then to (3,1) and (2,1) to deliver the onion to the pot.\n\nBut that's beyond the 10 turns.\n\nThis is a conservative plan.\n\nAnother idea: after turn 96, Alice could go to a different kitchen counter to get an onion that is closer to the pot at (2,0)? For example, there is an onion at (2,2) -> but (2,2) is a kitchen counter and has an onion. But (2,2) is at the same x as the pot, but above. \n\nFrom (5,1) to (2,2): but (2,2) is a kitchen counter, so she cannot walk on it. She must stand adjacent. But (2,2) is surrounded? \n- North: (2,3) -> empty\n- South: (2,1) -> empty\n- East: (3,2) -> kitchen counter -> blocked\n- West: (1,2) -> empty\n\nSo she can stand at (2,1) or (2,3) or (1,2) to interact. \n\nBut she is at (5,1). She can go to (2,1) which is the same as before. \n\nAlternatively, she can go to (2,3) and then face south to interact with (2,2). \n\nBut (2,2) has an onion, so she can pick it up. \n\nThe path: (5,1) -> (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) is blocked by Bob. \n\nShe can go up? From (5,1) to (5,2) -> empty? Then to (5,3) -> empty? Then to (4,3) -> empty? Then to (3,3) -> empty? Then to (2,3) -> empty. \n\nThen at (2,3), she can face south to interact with (2,2). \n\nThis avoids the area where Bob is.\n\nSo:\n- Turn 97: U (from (5,1) to (5,2))\n- Turn 98: U (to (5,3))\n- Turn 99: L (to (4,3))\n- Turn 100: L (to (3,3))\n- Turn 101: L (to (2,3))\n- Turn 102: D (turn south)\n- Turn 103: I (pick up onion from (2,2))\n\nBut we are only planning until turn 99.\n\nSo for turns 97-99:\n- Turn 97: U\n- Turn 98: U\n- Turn 99: L\n\nThis gets her to (4,3) at turn 99.\n\nSo Alice's actions:\n\nTurn 90: D\nTurn 91: I\nTurn 92: L\nTurn 93: R\nTurn 94: R\nTurn 95: D\nTurn 96: I\nTurn 97: U\nTurn 98: U\nTurn 99: L\n\nNow, no collision with Bob.\n\nAnd she is on her way to get the onion at (2,2) or another one.\n\nThis is better.\n\nSo we choose this.\n\nFinal plan for Alice (10 actions):\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 90: D\nTurn 91: I\nTurn 92: L\nTurn 93: R\nTurn 94: R\nTurn 95: D\nTurn 96: I\nTurn 97: U\nTurn 98: U\nTurn 99: L\n}\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice and Bob must collaborate efficiently. The current state shows that the pot at (4,0) has 2 onions and needs 1 more to start cooking a soup (requiring 3 onions, cooking for 5 turns, and yielding a reward of 20). Alice is at (4,1) holding an onion, ideally positioned to complete this pot. Bob is at (3,3) holding nothing and should fetch a plate from the dispenser at (0,2) to serve the soup once cooked.\n\nAlice's immediate priority is to add her onion to the pot at (4,0). She is adjacent to the pot but facing up, so she must face down to interact. After adding the onion, she should move away to avoid blocking Bob's path to the pot. Alice can then gather another onion (e.g., from the kitchen counter at (5,0)) for the partially filled pot at (2,0) (which has 1 onion). However, after picking up the onion, she must navigate around Bob's movement to the pot at (4,0). The chosen path avoids collisions: Alice moves upward to (5,2) and then left toward (4,3) to access other onions.\n\nBob's expected actions (not output, but for coordination):\n- Turn 90: Move left (L) to (2,3).\n- Turn 91: Move left (L) to (1,3).\n- Turn 92: Move down (D) to (1,2).\n- Turn 93: Turn west (L, blocked, so only orientation change).\n- Turn 94: Interact (I) to grab a plate from (0,2).\n- Turn 95: Move down (D) to (1,1).\n- Turn 96: Move right (R) to (2,1).\n- Turn 97: Move right (R) to (3,1).\n- Turn 98: Move right (R) to (4,1).\n- Turn 99: Turn down (D, blocked, so only orientation change).\n- Turn 100: Interact (I) to serve the soup from (4,0).\n\nAlice's action sequence for turns 90 to 99 (10 turns) is optimized for collaboration:\n\n- **Turns 90-91**: Alice faces down and interacts to add her onion to the pot at (4,0), starting the cooking process (ready at turn 96).\n- **Turns 92-94**: Alice moves left then right twice to (5,1), clearing the path for Bob.\n- **Turns 95-96**: Alice faces down and interacts to pick up an onion from the kitchen counter at (5,0).\n- **Turns 97-99**: Alice moves up twice and left to (4,3), avoiding Bob's path and positioning to gather more onions (e.g., from (2,2) or others) for the pot at (2,0) in subsequent turns.\n\nThis plan ensures the first soup is cooked and served by Bob, while Alice initiates the next soup. No player collisions occur.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 90: D\nTurn 91: I\nTurn 92: L\nTurn 93: R\nTurn 94: R\nTurn 95: D\nTurn 96: I\nTurn 97: U\nTurn 98: U\nTurn 99: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 94. We need to plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally for Bob, but the task is to plan for Alice) to maximize the total reward.\n\nFirst, let's understand the current state:\n\n- Alice: at (5,1), facing down (D), holding nothing.\n- Bob: at (3,3), facing right (R), holding one onion.\n\nThere are two pots:\n- Pot (4,0): has 2 onions, needs one more onion to start cooking (since recipe requires 3 onions). Cooking time is 5 turns for the onion soup (recipe 1).\n- Pot (2,0): has 1 onion, needs two more onions.\n\nThere are many onions lying around on kitchen counters, but note: the recipe requires 3 onions and gives 20 reward.\n\nThe serving counter is at (6,2).\n\nWe have onion dispensers at (2,4) and (4,4), but note that Bob is already holding an onion and there are onions on counters. We also have a plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\nSince the pot at (4,0) already has 2 onions, it is the closest to being ready. We need to add one more onion to it and then it will start cooking. After 5 turns, it will be ready to serve. Then we need a plate to serve it.\n\nSo the plan should focus on:\n1. Getting the third onion into pot (4,0).\n2. While that cooks, get a plate and be ready to serve.\n\nBut note: Bob is holding an onion and is at (3,3). He can deliver that onion to pot (4,0) or to pot (2,0). However, pot (4,0) is closer to being completed.\n\nLet's see Bob's position: (3,3). He is facing right (R). The pot (4,0) is at (4,0). How can he get there?\n\nFrom (3,3):\n- He can move down to (3,2) [if that tile is empty? We know (3,2) is a kitchen counter, but it is non-empty? Actually, the non-empty kitchen counters are listed and (3,2) is one of them? Wait, the list of kitchen counters: (0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4). So (3,2) is a kitchen counter. But note: the non-empty ones are listed separately. The non-empty ones are: (6,1): onion, (6,3): onion, (0,3): onion, (1,4): onion, (3,4): onion, (2,2): onion, (5,0): onion, (4,2): onion. So (3,2) is a kitchen counter but it is empty? Because it is not listed in the non-empty ones. Therefore, Bob can walk on (3,2) because it's an empty tile? Wait, no: kitchen counters are non-empty tiles? Actually, the tile types are:\n\n- Kitchen Counter: are non-empty? But the non-empty kitchen counters are specified separately. So a kitchen counter can be empty? And if it's empty, it is walkable? Actually, the rules say:\n\n- Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\n\nAnd the kitchen counter is a tile type. But when it is empty, it might be walkable? The rules say:\n\n- **Kitchen Counter:** Temporary item storage.\n\nAnd in the constraints: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So if a kitchen counter is empty, it is walkable? But the tile type is still a kitchen counter. However, the rules for movement: \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\" and \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So if a kitchen counter has no item, it is empty and therefore walkable? But the tile is still a counter, but without an item. So yes, we can walk on empty kitchen counters.\n\nTherefore, (3,2) is a kitchen counter but it is empty (since it's not in the non-empty list) so Bob can walk on it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) is non-empty (has an onion) so Bob cannot walk on (4,2).\n\nBob's path to pot (4,0):\n- Current: (3,3)\n- He can move down to (3,2) [empty kitchen counter, walkable]\n- Then down to (3,1): what is (3,1)? Not in the list of non-empty tiles? The tile types: we don't have a list of every tile, but we know the non-empty ones. Also, we know the grid must be 7x5? Because positions go from (0,0) to (6,4). But we don't have a full map. However, we can assume that any tile not listed as a dispenser, pot, serving counter, or kitchen counter (with item) is an empty tile? Actually, the kitchen counters without items are walkable. And the dispensers, pots, serving counters are non-empty and not walkable? The rules say: non-empty tiles are not walkable. So:\n\n- Dispensers: non-empty (because they are sources) -> not walkable.\n- Pot: non-empty? Actually, a pot is a tile that can be interacted with, and it can have ingredients. So it is non-empty? The rules don't explicitly say, but we cannot walk on it because it's a non-empty tile? Actually, the rules say: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and a pot is a tile that is always non-empty? Or can it be empty? The pot is a tile that is used for cooking, so it's always there. We cannot walk on it because it's a fixed object. Similarly, dispensers and serving counters are fixed and non-walkable.\n\nSo:\n\n- Empty tile: walkable.\n- Dispensers: non-walkable.\n- Pot: non-walkable.\n- Serving counter: non-walkable.\n- Kitchen counter: if it has an item, non-walkable; if empty, walkable? But the rules say: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and it's a tile type. However, the constraint says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" So if a kitchen counter is empty, it is an empty tile? Then it should be walkable. But if it has an item, then it's non-empty and not walkable.\n\nSo for Bob to get to (4,0) from (3,3):\n- (3,3) -> (3,2): kitchen counter without item -> walkable.\n- (3,2) -> (3,1): we don't know what (3,1) is. It's not listed as any non-empty tile? The non-empty tiles are only the ones with items or the fixed objects? Actually, we have the list of fixed objects (tile types) and then the non-empty kitchen counters (which have items). So (3,1) is not listed as a kitchen counter, dispenser, pot, or serving counter. Therefore, it must be an empty tile? So walkable.\n\nThen (3,1) -> (4,1): what is (4,1)? Not listed, so empty tile? Then (4,1) -> (4,0): but (4,0) is a pot, non-walkable. So Bob must stand adjacent to (4,0) and face it to interact.\n\nSo Bob can go: from (3,3) down to (3,2), then down to (3,1), then right to (4,1). Then he is adjacent to the pot (4,0) and can face down to interact (if he is facing down, he can interact with (4,0)). But note: he is holding an onion, so he can add it to the pot.\n\nAlternatively, he could go: (3,3) -> right to (4,3). What is at (4,3)? Not listed as non-empty? Then (4,3) is empty? Then down to (4,2): but (4,2) is a kitchen counter and has an onion (non-empty) so not walkable. So he cannot go that way. So the path via (3,1) is better.\n\nBob can do:\n- Turn 94: move down to (3,2) [action D]\n- Turn 95: move down to (3,1) [D]\n- Turn 96: move right to (4,1) [R]\n- Turn 97: change orientation to down [D] (so he faces the pot at (4,0))\n- Turn 98: interact [I] to add the onion.\n\nThen the pot at (4,0) will have 3 onions and start cooking at turn 98. It will be ready at turn 98 + 5 = 103.\n\nMeanwhile, what about Alice? She is at (5,1), holding nothing. She can help by getting a plate and then being ready to serve the soup when it's done.\n\nPlate dispenser is at (0,2). So Alice needs to go to (0,2) to get a plate.\n\nPath for Alice from (5,1) to (0,2):\n\n- (5,1) -> (4,1): but Bob will be at (4,1) at turn 96? At turn 94, Bob is at (3,3). At turn 95, Bob at (3,2). At turn 96, Bob at (3,1). Then at turn 97, Bob moves to (4,1). So at turn 94,95,96: (4,1) is free? So Alice can move left to (4,1) at turn 94? But then at turn 97 Bob moves to (4,1) and Alice would be there? That would cause a collision.\n\nWe must avoid collision.\n\nSo let's plan Alice's moves:\n\nTurn 94: Alice is at (5,1). She can move left to (4,1) [L]. But then at turn 95, Bob is at (3,2) and Alice is at (4,1). Then at turn 96, Bob moves to (3,1) and Alice can move left to (3,1) [L]? But Bob is moving to (3,1) at the same turn? Then they would both try to occupy (3,1) at turn 96 -> collision.\n\nAlternatively, Alice can go via a different route.\n\nThe grid: we don't have the full grid, but we know the positions of obstacles.\n\nAnother path: from (5,1) to (5,2) [up]? What is (5,2)? Not listed as non-empty? So empty tile? Then (5,2) -> (4,2): but (4,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion -> non-walkable. So no.\n\n(5,1) to (6,1): (6,1) is a kitchen counter and has an onion -> non-walkable.\n\n(5,1) to (5,0): (5,0) is a kitchen counter and has an onion -> non-walkable.\n\nSo the only available move from (5,1) is left to (4,1) or up to (5,2) if (5,2) is empty? We don't have information about (5,2). But it's not listed as any non-empty tile, so we assume it's an empty tile.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) is not in the list of kitchen counters? The kitchen counters are at: (0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4). So (5,2) is not a kitchen counter? Then it's an empty tile? So walkable.\n\nSo Alice can go:\n- Turn 94: move up to (5,2) [U]\n- Then she can move left to (4,2)? But (4,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion -> non-walkable. So she cannot.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,2) she can move up to (5,3)? (5,3) is not listed as non-empty? Then empty. Then left to (4,3) [if empty], then down to (4,2) but again (4,2) is non-walkable? So that doesn't help.\n\nThe only way to the left is via (4,1). But we have to coordinate with Bob.\n\nAlternatively, Alice can wait for Bob to move away.\n\nPlan:\n\nBob is going to (3,1) at turn 96, and then to (4,1) at turn 97. So at turn 94,95,96: (4,1) is free. But at turn 97, Bob will be at (4,1). So Alice can use (4,1) at turn 94 and 95, but then she must leave by turn 97.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 94: Alice moves left to (4,1) [L]\nTurn 95: Alice moves left to (3,1) [L]? But Bob is moving to (3,1) at turn 96? And at turn 95, Bob is at (3,2). So at turn 95, Alice moves to (3,1) -> then at turn 96, Bob moves to (3,1) but Alice is already there? Collision.\n\nSo Alice should not go to (3,1).\n\nAfter Alice moves to (4,1) at turn 94, she can move up to (4,2)? But (4,2) is non-walkable. Or down to (4,0)? (4,0) is a pot -> non-walkable. So she is stuck at (4,1) until she moves away.\n\nAt turn 95, she can move back to (5,1) [R]? Then at turn 96, she can move up to (5,2) [U]. Then at turn 97, Bob moves to (4,1), so (4,1) is occupied. Then at turn 97, Alice can move left from (5,2) to (4,2)? But (4,2) is non-walkable.\n\nSo that doesn't help.\n\nAnother idea: Alice can go to the plate dispenser via the top? From (5,1) to (5,2) [U] at turn 94, then (5,3) [U] at turn 95, then (5,4)? But (5,4) is a kitchen counter and has an onion? The non-empty kitchen counters include (5,4): onion? Actually, the non-empty kitchen counters are listed: (5,4) has an onion? The list: (1,4): onion, (3,4): onion, (5,4): onion? Yes, (5,4) is non-empty. So (5,4) is non-walkable. So Alice cannot go to (5,4).\n\nSo the only viable path to the plate dispenser is through the bottom? But the bottom is blocked by pots and counters.\n\nLet me sketch the grid:\n\nWe have:\n- Rows y=0 to y=4, columns x=0 to x=6.\n\nAt y=0: kitchen counters at (0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0); pots at (2,0) and (4,0).\nAt y=1: kitchen counters at (0,1) and (6,1) [both non-empty? (6,1) has an onion, (0,1) is not in non-empty list? So (0,1) is empty?]\nAt y=2: kitchen counters at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2); and plate dispenser at (0,2); serving counter at (6,2). And (2,2) and (4,2) have onions, (3,2) is empty.\nAt y=3: kitchen counters at (0,3) and (6,3) [both have onions?]\nAt y=4: kitchen counters at (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4); and onion dispensers at (2,4) and (4,4). And (1,4), (3,4), (5,4) have onions.\n\nSo the grid:\n\ny=4: [0:KC(empty? no, (0,4) is kitchen counter but not listed in non-empty? Actually, non-empty kitchen counters: (0,4) is not listed? The non-empty ones are: (6,1), (6,3), (0,3), (1,4), (3,4), (2,2), (5,0), (4,2). So (0,4) is not listed -> empty. Similarly, (0,0) is not in non-empty -> empty? But (0,0) is a kitchen counter but empty? So walkable? But (0,0) is at the bottom left.\n\nActually, the non-empty kitchen counters are explicitly listed. So any kitchen counter not listed is empty and hence walkable.\n\nSo for Alice at (5,1) to (0,2):\n\nOne possible path: \n- (5,1) -> (5,0): but (5,0) is kitchen counter with onion -> non-walkable. So no.\n- (5,1) -> (4,1): empty? yes, if not occupied by Bob. Then (4,1) -> (3,1): empty? yes. Then (3,1) -> (2,1): what is (2,1)? Not listed -> empty. Then (2,1) -> (1,1): empty? Then (1,1) -> (0,1): kitchen counter, but empty? (0,1) is a kitchen counter and not in non-empty list -> empty -> walkable. Then (0,1) -> (0,2): but (0,2) is the plate dispenser -> non-walkable. So Alice must stand adjacent to (0,2) to interact.\n\nFrom (0,1), she can face up (U) to interact with (0,2) because (0,2) is above (0,1). Or from (1,2) she can face left.\n\nBut we have to avoid Bob.\n\nBob is going to (3,2) at turn 95, then (3,1) at turn 96, then (4,1) at turn 97.\n\nSo if Alice wants to go to (0,2), she can:\n\nTurn 94: move left to (4,1) [L]  (Bob is at (3,3) and moves to (3,2) at turn 94? But we are planning for Alice at turn 94. At turn 94, Bob is at (3,3) and he will move down to (3,2) at turn 94? But we can coordinate Bob's actions? The task is to plan for Alice, but we can assume Bob is going to deliver the onion? Actually, the task says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice (and optionally Bob)\". But we don't control Bob? The problem says: \"plan a sequence of actions for Alice\", so we only plan for Alice. Bob's actions are not controlled by us. But we can assume that Bob will continue to deliver the onion? Or we have to work with the fact that Bob might be moving.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Help Alice collaborate with Bob\", so we can assume that Bob is also trying to cooperate. But we only plan for Alice.\n\nSo to avoid collision, Alice might take a different route or wait.\n\nAlternative route for Alice: go to (5,2) then (6,2)? But (6,2) is serving counter -> non-walkable. Or (5,2) to (5,3) [U] at turn 95, then (5,3) to (4,3) [L] at turn 96, then (4,3) to (3,3) [L] at turn 97? But at turn 97, Bob is at (4,1), so (3,3) is free? Then from (3,3) to (2,3) [L] at turn 98, then (2,3) to (1,3) [L] at turn 99, then (1,3) to (0,3) [L] but (0,3) is kitchen counter with onion -> non-walkable. So she can stop at (1,3) and then face left to interact with (0,3) but that's an onion, not a plate.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nShe needs to get to the plate dispenser at (0,2). The adjacent tiles to (0,2) are: (0,1), (0,3), (1,2). (0,1) and (0,3) are kitchen counters, and (1,2) is what? Not listed, so empty.\n\nSo she can stand at (1,2) and face left to interact with (0,2).\n\nHow to get to (1,2):\n\nFrom (5,1): \n- (5,1) -> (4,1) [L] at turn 94\n- (4,1) -> (3,1) [L] at turn 95 -> but at turn 95, Bob is at (3,2), so (3,1) is free.\n- (3,1) -> (2,1) [L] at turn 96\n- (2,1) -> (1,1) [L] at turn 97\n- (1,1) -> (1,2) [U] at turn 98\n\nThen at (1,2), she can face left [L] at turn 99 and interact [I] at turn 100 to get a plate.\n\nBut then she has a plate. Meanwhile, the soup at (4,0) will be ready at turn 103. She needs to go to (4,0) to serve it.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (4,0): \n- (1,2) -> (1,1) [D] turn 100? But we are at turn 100 she is interacting. So turn 100: interact to get plate. Then turn 101: move down to (1,1) [D]\n- turn 102: move right to (2,1) [R]\n- turn 103: move right to (3,1) [R]\n- turn 104: move down to (3,0)? But (3,0) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So she must go to (4,1) first.\n- turn 103: from (3,1) to (4,1) [R]\n- turn 104: at (4,1), she can face down [D] to interact with pot (4,0) to serve the soup.\n\nBut the soup is ready at turn 103? The pot started cooking at turn 98 (when Bob added the onion) and takes 5 turns, so ready at turn 103. At turn 103, the soup is ready. At turn 104, Alice can serve it.\n\nBut at turn 103, Alice is at (3,1). She moves to (4,1) at turn 103? But then at turn 104, she faces down and interacts.\n\nBut Bob might be in the way? Bob after turn 98: he added the onion at turn 98, so at turn 99 he is free. We don't know what Bob will do. But we are only planning for Alice.\n\nAlternatively, Alice can be more efficient.\n\nAnother idea: after Alice gets the plate, she can go directly to the serving counter? But the soup must be served from the pot? No, the soup is in the pot. To serve, you need to use a plate at the pot to get the soup on the plate, then deliver it to the serving counter.\n\nSo first, Alice must go to the pot with the plate to pick up the soup.\n\nNow, let's see the timing:\n\n- Bob adds onion at turn 98 -> pot starts cooking at turn 98.\n- Ready at turn 103.\n- Alice: \n  - Turn 100: get plate at (0,2) [if she is at (1,2) and interacts at turn 100]\n  - Then she needs to go to (4,1) by turn 103 or 104.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (4,1): \n  - Turn 101: (1,2) -> (2,2) [R]? But (2,2) is a kitchen counter with an onion -> non-walkable. So she cannot.\n  - Turn 101: (1,2) -> (1,1) [D]\n  - Turn 102: (1,1) -> (2,1) [R]\n  - Turn 103: (2,1) -> (3,1) [R]\n  - Turn 104: (3,1) -> (4,1) [R]\n\nThen at turn 105: face down [D] and interact [I] to serve the soup from the pot.\n\nBut that's turn 105, which is after the soup is ready.\n\nAlternatively, can she be faster?\n\nFrom (1,2) to (4,1) in 3 turns? Without going through (2,2) because it's blocked.\n\n(1,2) -> (1,1) [D] turn 101\n(1,1) -> (2,1) [R] turn 102\n(2,1) -> (3,1) [R] turn 103\n(3,1) -> (4,1) [R] turn 104\n\nSo minimum 4 turns after getting the plate.\n\nShe gets the plate at turn 100, then moves and is at (4,1) at turn 104, then interacts at turn 105.\n\nThe soup is ready at turn 103, so she can interact at turn 104 or later.\n\nBut at turn 104, she is at (4,1) and can interact with the pot below her by facing down and interacting.\n\nSo she serves the soup at turn 104? But to serve, she needs to be at (4,1) and face down to the pot at (4,0) and interact. Then she will have the soup on the plate. Then she must deliver it to the serving counter at (6,2).\n\nFrom (4,1) to (6,2):\n- (4,1) -> (5,1) [R] turn 105\n- (5,1) -> (6,1) [R] but (6,1) is kitchen counter with onion -> non-walkable. So she cannot.\n- Alternatively, from (4,1) to (4,2)? (4,2) is kitchen counter with onion -> non-walkable.\n- So she must go: (4,1) -> (5,1) [R] turn 105\n- Then (5,1) -> (5,2) [U] turn 106\n- Then (5,2) -> (6,2) [R] turn 107? But (6,2) is serving counter -> non-walkable. So she must stand adjacent and face it.\n\nAdjacent to (6,2) are: (6,1), (6,3), (5,2). (6,1) and (6,3) are non-walkable (kitchen counters with items). So only (5,2) is walkable. She can be at (5,2) and face right to interact with (6,2).\n\nSo:\n- Turn 105: (4,1) to (5,1) [R]\n- Turn 106: (5,1) to (5,2) [U]\n- Turn 107: face right [R] (to face (6,2))\n- Turn 108: interact [I] to deliver.\n\nThis is turn 108.\n\nBut we are only planning for several turns, say H=10? We don't know H, but we can plan until the delivery.\n\nHowever, there is another pot at (2,0) with one onion. We might want to use that too, but the first soup is more immediate.\n\nBut let's focus on the first soup.\n\nFor Alice, the plan is to get a plate and then serve the soup.\n\nBut we have a problem: at turn 94, if Alice moves left to (4,1), she will be in the path of Bob? But Bob is moving to (3,2) at turn 94? At turn 94, Bob is at (3,3). If Bob moves down to (3,2) at turn 94, then at turn 94, Alice moves to (4,1). No conflict.\n\nAt turn 95: Bob moves down to (3,1) [D]? In our initial plan for Bob, we had him move to (3,1) at turn 96. But we don't control Bob. Let's assume that Bob will move toward the pot to deliver the onion. So he will move down at turn 94 to (3,2), then down to (3,1) at turn 95, then right to (4,1) at turn 96, then face down and interact at turn 97.\n\nThen Alice at turn 94: moves to (4,1) [L] -> but at turn 94, Bob is at (3,3) and moving to (3,2), so (4,1) is free.\nTurn 95: Alice can move to (3,1) [L]? But at turn 95, Bob is moving to (3,1) as well? That would be a collision at (3,1) on turn 95.\n\nSo to avoid, Alice should not go to (3,1) on turn 95.\n\nAfter Alice is at (4,1) at turn 94, she can stay there at turn 95 [S], then at turn 96, Bob moves to (4,1)? But Bob is at (3,1) at turn 95, and at turn 96 he moves to (4,1). So at turn 96, Alice is at (4,1) and Bob moves to (4,1) -> collision.\n\nSo Alice must leave (4,1) before turn 96.\n\nSo at turn 95, Alice should move away. She can move up to (4,2)? But (4,2) is non-walkable. Or down to (4,0)? non-walkable. Or left to (3,1)? but then she would be at (3,1) at turn 95, and at turn 96, Bob moves to (3,1) -> collision. Or right to (5,1) [R] at turn 95.\n\nThen she is back at (5,1) at turn 95.\n\nThen at turn 96, she can move up to (5,2) [U].\n\nThen she is at (5,2) at turn 96.\n\nThen she can move left to (4,2)? but (4,2) is non-walkable.\n\nSo she is stuck.\n\nPerhaps she can wait at (5,1) and let Bob pass.\n\nTurn 94: Alice stays [S] or moves up to (5,2) [U].\n\nIf she moves up to (5,2) at turn 94:\n- Then at turn 95, she can move up to (5,3) [U]\n- Turn 96: move left to (4,3) [L]\n- Turn 97: move left to (3,3) [L] -> but at turn 97, Bob is at (4,1), so (3,3) is free.\n- Turn 98: move down to (3,2) [D] -> (3,2) is an empty kitchen counter, walkable.\n- Turn 99: move down to (3,1) [D] -> (3,1) is empty.\n- Turn 100: move down to (3,0)? (3,0) is kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So she can't.\n\nFrom (3,1) at turn 99, she can move right to (4,1) [R] at turn 100, but then she is at (4,1) and the pot is below.\n\nBut this is late.\n\nAnd she still needs to get a plate.\n\nThis seems inefficient.\n\nAnother idea: Alice can get an onion from a kitchen counter and put it in the pot at (2,0) or (4,0)? But Bob is already delivering one to (4,0), so (4,0) will be full. (2,0) has only one onion, so needs two more.\n\nBut there are many onions on counters. For example, at (6,1) there is an onion. Alice is at (5,1), adjacent to (6,1) but she is not facing it. She is facing down. To interact with (6,1), she needs to be at an adjacent empty tile and face it. (6,1) is at the right of (5,1). So she can face right and interact.\n\nSo at turn 94: change orientation to right [R] (now facing right)\nTurn 95: interact [I] to pick up the onion from (6,1)? But (6,1) is a kitchen counter with an onion, and she is empty-handed, so she can pick it up.\n\nThen she is holding an onion.\n\nThen she can deliver it to a pot. The closest pot is (4,0) or (2,0). (4,0) will be filled by Bob, so she can go to (2,0) which has one onion.\n\nFrom (5,1) holding onion:\n- Turn 96: move left to (4,1) [L]\n- Turn 97: move left to (3,1) [L]\n- Turn 98: move left to (2,1) [L]\n- Turn 99: face down [D] to interact with pot (2,0) to add the onion.\n\nThen the pot (2,0) will have 2 onions.\n\nThen she needs to get another onion to complete it, or let someone else do it.\n\nBut then she is not getting the plate for the first soup.\n\nThis might not be efficient.\n\nGiven the time constraints, let's focus on the first soup.\n\nWe have an alternative: Alice can get a plate from the plate dispenser after Bob has passed.\n\nOr, Alice can go to the plate dispenser via the bottom after Bob has left the area.\n\nBob's path:\n- Turn 94: move down to (3,2) [D]\n- Turn 95: move down to (3,1) [D]\n- Turn 96: move right to (4,1) [R]\n- Turn 97: face down [D]\n- Turn 98: interact [I] (add onion to (4,0))\n\nThen after turn 98, Bob is free. (4,1) might be occupied by Bob until turn 98? At turn 98, Bob is at (4,1) and interacts, so he stays there.\n\nThen Alice can start moving at turn 94 to (5,2) [U] to avoid the conflict.\n\nThen at turn 95, move up to (5,3) [U]\nTurn 96: move left to (4,3) [L]\nTurn 97: move left to (3,3) [L]\nTurn 98: move down to (3,2) [D] (empty kitchen counter)\nTurn 99: move down to (3,1) [D] -> but at turn 98, Bob is at (4,1), and at turn 99, Bob might move away? We don't know. But Alice can move to (3,1) at turn 99.\nTurn 100: move left to (2,1) [L]\nTurn 101: move left to (1,1) [L]\nTurn 102: move up to (1,2) [U]\nTurn 103: face left [L] to interact with plate dispenser at (0,2)\nTurn 104: interact [I] to get plate.\n\nThen she has the plate at turn 104.\n\nThen she needs to go to the pot (4,0) to serve the soup, which is ready at turn 103.\n\nSo at turn 104, the soup is ready. She can serve it from turn 104 onwards.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (4,1):\n- Turn 105: (1,2) -> (1,1) [D]\n- Turn 106: (1,1) -> (2,1) [R]\n- Turn 107: (2,1) -> (3,1) [R]\n- Turn 108: (3,1) -> (4,1) [R] -> but at (4,1), she can face down [D] at turn 109 and interact [I] at turn 110.\n\nThen she has the soup on the plate.\n\nThen deliver to (6,2):\n- Turn 111: (4,1) -> (5,1) [R]\n- Turn 112: (5,1) -> (5,2) [U]\n- Turn 113: face right [R]\n- Turn 114: interact [I] to deliver.\n\nThis is very late.\n\nWe need a better plan.\n\nNotice that there is a kitchen counter at (0,3) with an onion, but we don't care.\n\nAnother idea: Alice can get a plate from the plate dispenser first, but taking a long path that avoids the bottom.\n\nOr, perhaps Alice can get a plate after the soup is cooking, and be closer.\n\nBut the plate dispenser is at (0,2), far away.\n\nPerhaps Bob, after delivering the onion, can get a plate? But we only control Alice.\n\nLet's think of a plan where Alice does nothing for a few turns to let Bob pass, then heads for the plate.\n\nTurn 94: Alice stays [S] or moves to (5,2) [U] to avoid.\nTurn 95: Alice stays or moves to (5,3) [U]\n\nThen after Bob has left (3,1) and (4,1) (after turn 98), she can move to (4,1) at turn 99.\n\nThen from (4,1) at turn 99, she can move left to (3,1) [L] turn 100, then to (2,1) [L] turn 101, then to (1,1) [L] turn 102, then to (1,2) [U] turn 103, then face left [L] turn 104, interact [I] turn 105 to get plate.\n\nThen from (1,2) to (4,1) as before, arriving at turn 109.\n\nStill late.\n\nPerhaps she can use an onion from a closer kitchen counter to put in the other pot, and let Bob's action complete the first pot.\n\nBut then we have two pots cooking.\n\nBut the first pot will be ready sooner.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's assume that Alice will get the plate while the soup is cooking.\n\nWe have to start somewhere.\n\nSimplest plan for Alice:\n\n1. Get to the plate dispenser as fast as possible without conflicting with Bob.\n2. Then return to the pot to serve when ready.\n\nTo avoid conflict with Bob, she can take the top path.\n\nTurn 94: Alice moves up to (5,2) [U]\nTurn 95: Alice moves up to (5,3) [U]\nTurn 96: Alice moves left to (4,3) [L]\nTurn 97: Alice moves left to (3,3) [L]\nTurn 98: Alice moves down to (3,2) [D] (empty kitchen counter)\nTurn 99: Alice moves down to (3,1) [D]\nTurn 100: Alice moves left to (2,1) [L]\nTurn 101: Alice moves left to (1,1) [L]\nTurn 102: Alice moves up to (1,2) [U]\nTurn 103: Alice changes orientation to left [L] (facing (0,2))\nTurn 104: Alice interacts [I] (gets plate)\n\nThen she has the plate at turn 104.\n\nThe soup at (4,0) is ready at turn 103.\n\nShe can then go to (4,0) to serve the soup:\n\nFrom (1,2):\nTurn 105: move down to (1,1) [D]\nTurn 106: move right to (2,1) [R]\nTurn 107: move right to (3,1) [R]\nTurn 108: move right to (4,1) [R]\nTurn 109: face down [D] \nTurn 110: interact [I] (serve the soup from the pot)\n\nThen she has the soup on the plate.\n\nThen deliver to (6,2):\nTurn 111: move right to (5,1) [R] from (4,1) to (5,1)\nTurn 112: move up to (5,2) [U]\nTurn 113: face right [R]\nTurn 114: interact [I] (deliver)\n\nBut this is very long.\n\nWe can try to optimize by having her move to (4,1) earlier if possible, but we have to avoid Bob.\n\nAfter turn 98, Bob is at (4,1) and has delivered. He might move away. If he does, then Alice can use (4,1) sooner. But we don't know.\n\nSince the task is to plan for Alice only, and we don't control Bob, we must assume he might stay or move unpredictably.\n\nTo be safe, we avoid (4,1) until after turn 98.\n\nAnother idea: Alice can get a plate from the plate dispenser by a shorter path after turn 98.\n\nFor example, at turn 94, Alice moves up to (5,2) [U] to wait.\nTurn 95: stay [S]\nTurn 96: stay [S]\nTurn 97: stay [S]\nTurn 98: stay [S] (waiting for Bob to deliver)\nTurn 99: move left to (4,2) -> but (4,2) is non-walkable. So no.\nTurn 99: move down to (5,1) [D]\nTurn 100: move left to (4,1) [L] (now free, because Bob might have moved)\nTurn 101: move left to (3,1) [L]\nTurn 102: move left to (2,1) [L]\nTurn 103: move left to (1,1) [L]\nTurn 104: move up to (1,2) [U]\nTurn 105: face left [L]\nTurn 106: interact [I] (get plate)\n\nThis is even later.\n\nGiven the constraints, perhaps the best is to have Alice help with the second pot.\n\nBut let's calculate the reward for the first soup: 20 points.\n\nAnd it will be ready at turn 103.\n\nIf Alice can serve it by turn 103 or 104, that would be good, but she can't.\n\nPerhaps Bob can serve the soup after he delivers the onion? But he is not holding a plate.\n\nAfter Bob delivers the onion at turn 98, he is at (4,1) holding nothing. He can then go to get a plate.\n\nBut we control only Alice.\n\nSo for Alice, the most immediate contribution is to get the plate for the first soup.\n\nBut it will take time.\n\nPerhaps Alice can get a plate now, even if it's far, and then be there when the soup is ready.\n\nBut the soup is ready in 5 turns after turn 98, i.e., turn 103.\n\nAlice from (5,1) to (0,2) takes at least 8 turns (as in the first path idea), then to (4,1) takes 4 more turns, so 12 turns from turn 94, which is turn 106.\n\nSo not by turn 103.\n\n The minimum turns for Alice to get to (0,2):\n- (5,1) -> (4,1): 1 turn\n- (4,1) -> (3,1): 1 turn\n- (3,1) -> (2,1): 1 turn\n- (2,1) -> (1,1): 1 turn\n- (1,1) -> (1,2): 1 turn ( then face left and interact: 2 turns) -> total 6 turns to get the plate.\n\nSo turns 94 to 99: 6 turns, so at turn 99 she has the plate.\n\nThen from (1,2) to (4,1): 4 turns ( as before), so arrive at turn 103.\n\nThen at turn 104, she can interact with the pot.\n\nSo if she can get to (4,1) by turn 103, she can interact at turn 104.\n\nBut to get to (4,1) by turn 103, she must leave (1,2) at turn 100.\n\nBut she gets the plate at turn 99? Let's timeline:\n\nTurn 94: (5,1) -> (4,1) [L]\nTurn 95: (4,1) -> (3,1) [L] \nTurn 96: (3,1) -> (2,1) [L]\nTurn 97: (2,1) -> (1,1) [L]\nTurn 98: (1,1) -> (1,2) [U]\nTurn 99: face left [L] \nTurn 100: interact [I] to get plate.\n\nSo at turn 100, she has the plate.\n\nThen turn 100: move down to (1,1) [D]\nTurn 101: move right to (2,1) [R]\nTurn 102: move right to (3,1) [R]\nTurn 103: move right to (4,1) [R]\nTurn 104: face down [D]\nTurn 105: interact [I] to serve the soup.\n\nSo the soup is ready at turn 103, and she serves it at turn 105.\n\nThen deliver to (6,2) as before.\n\nBut to avoid collision with Bob:\n\nAt turn 94: Bob is at (3,3), moves to (3,2) [D] -> no conflict with Alice at (4,1)\nTurn 95: Bob moves to (3,1) [D] -> Alice moves to (3,1) [L] -> both try to occupy (3,1) -> collision.\n\nSo we must avoid that.\n\nTherefore, Alice should wait at (4,1) for one turn or move somewhere else at turn 95.\n\nTurn 95: after moving to (4,1) at turn 94, at turn 95, Alice can move up to (4,2) -> but (4,2) is non-walkable. Move down to (4,0) -> non-walkable. Move left to (3,1) -> but that's where Bob is moving. Move right to (5,1) [R].\n\nThen at turn 95, Alice is at (5,1) and Bob is at (3,1) -> no collision.\n\nThen at turn 96, Alice can move left to (4,1) [L] -> but at turn 96, Bob is moving to (4,1) [R] -> collision at (4,1).\n\nSo not good.\n\nTurn 95: Alice at (4,1) moves to (3,1) [L] -> collision with Bob at (3,1).\n\nSo the only safe move at turn 95 from (4,1) is to (5,1) [R].\n\nThen at turn 96, Alice is at (5,1), and she can move to (4,1) [L] -> but at turn 96, Bob is moving to (4,1) -> collision.\n\nSo she cannot use the bottom path until after turn 98.\n\nGiven the above, the safest is to take the top path as in the long route.\n\nOr, perhaps Alice can get an onion from a close counter and put it in the pot at (2,0) to start another soup.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 94: Alice changes orientation to right [R] ( to face (6,1))\nTurn 95: interact [I] to pick up the onion from (6,1)\nTurn 96: move left to (4,1) [L] -> but may conflict with Bob.\nInstead, after picking up the onion, she can go to (2,0) to add it.\n\nTurn 96: move left to (4,1) [L] ( if free)\nTurn 97: move left to (3,1) [L] \nTurn 98: move left to (2,1) [L]\nTurn 99: face down [D] \nTurn 100: interact [I] to add onion to pot (2,0)\n\nThen the pot (2,0) will have 2 onions.\n\nThen she is free to get a plate for the first soup.\n\nBut the first soup will be ready at turn 103, and she is at (2,1) at turn 100.\n\nShe can then go to get a plate.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (0,2): \n- (2,1) -> (1,1) [L] turn 101\n- (1,1) -> (1,2) [U] turn 102\n- face left [L] turn 103\n- interact [I] turn 104 to get plate.\n\nThen from (1,2) to (4,1) to serve the first soup, but the first soup is at (4,0), and it's ready at turn 103, but she is at (1,2) at turn 104 with a plate.\n\nShe can then go to (4,0) to serve, but it will be late.\n\nOr, after adding the onion to (2,0) at turn 100, she can go to the plate dispenser, and then serve the first soup if she can get there by turn 103, but she can't.\n\nGiven the time constraints, it's better to focus on the first soup and have Alice get the plate as fast as possible, even if it means taking a long path.\n\nSo I will choose the top path for Alice to get the plate, and then serve the first soup.\n\nAlice's plan:\n\nTurn 94: U ( to (5,2) )\nTurn 95: U ( to (5,3) )\nTurn 96: L ( to (4,3) )\nTurn 97: L ( to (3,3) )\nTurn 98: D ( to (3,2) )\nTurn 99: D ( to (3,1) )\nTurn 100: L ( to (2,1) )\nTurn 101: L ( to (1,1) )\nTurn 102: U ( to (1,2) )\nTurn 103: L ( face left to (0,2) )\nTurn 104: I ( get plate )\n\nThen continue to serve the soup.\n\nBut we are to plan for several turns, say 10 turns, so until turn 104 for turn 94 to turn 94+10=104.\n\nSo for turns 94 to 104 (11 actions).\n\nSo actions for Alice:\n\nTurn 94: U\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: L\nTurn 97: L\nTurn 98: D\nTurn 99: D\nTurn 100: L\nTurn 101: L\nTurn 102: U\nTurn 103: L\nTurn 104: I\n\nThis gets her the plate at turn 104.\n\nThen she can proceed to the pot.\n\nBut the soup is ready at turn 103, so it will wait.\n\nThis is a safe plan that avoids conflicts.\n\nSo I think this is reasonable.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward, Alice should prioritize obtaining a plate from the plate dispenser at (0,2) to be ready to serve the onion soup cooking in the pot at (4,0). The pot at (4,0) already contains 2 onions and will start cooking when Bob adds the third onion (which he is holding and is likely to deliver soon). The soup will cook for 5 turns and yield a reward of 20 upon delivery. Alice's path to the plate dispenser avoids conflicts with Bob and non-walkable tiles, using the upper route for safety and efficiency.\n\nAlice's action sequence for turns 94 to 104 is as follows:\n\n- **Turn 94: U** – Move up to (5,2) to avoid potential collision with Bob and start the path to the plate dispenser.\n- **Turn 95: U** – Move up to (5,3), continuing the safe upper path.\n- **Turn 96: L** – Move left to (4,3), away from Bob's expected path.\n- **Turn 97: L** – Move left to (3,3), progressing toward the plate dispenser.\n- **Turn 98: D** – Move down to (3,2), an empty kitchen counter tile (walkable as it has no item).\n- **Turn 99: D** – Move down to (3,1), now clear of Bob's area after his expected delivery.\n- **Turn 100: L** – Move left to (2,1), advancing toward the plate dispenser.\n- **Turn 101: L** – Move left to (1,1), nearing the target.\n- **Turn 102: U** – Move up to (1,2), adjacent to the plate dispenser at (0,2).\n- **Turn 103: L** – Change orientation to face left, preparing to interact with the plate dispenser.\n- **Turn 104: I** – Interact to grab a plate from the dispenser at (0,2).\n\nBy turn 104, Alice will be holding a plate. She can then proceed to the pot at (4,0) (which will be ready by turn 103) to serve the soup and deliver it to the serving counter at (6,2) for the reward. This plan ensures Alice avoids collisions with Bob, who is expected to deliver the third onion to the pot at (4,0) around turn 98, and efficiently utilizes the available time to prepare for serving.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 94: U \\\\\nTurn 95: U \\\\\nTurn 96: L \\\\\nTurn 97: L \\\\\nTurn 98: D \\\\\nTurn 99: D \\\\\nTurn 100: L \\\\\nTurn 101: L \\\\\nTurn 102: U \\\\\nTurn 103: L \\\\\nTurn 104: I\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 97. The goal is to maximize the total reward by delivering soup recipes.\n\nKey observations from the game state:\n- Alice is at (4,1) holding an onion, facing Up (U).\n- Bob is at (5,3) holding an onion, facing Up (U).\n- There are two pots:\n  1. Pot at (4,0) contains 2 onions (needs 1 more onion to start cooking).\n  2. Pot at (2,0) contains 1 onion (needs 2 more onions to start cooking).\n- The recipe is only for 3 onions (reward 20, cooking time 5 turns).\n- There are many onions scattered on kitchen counters and also held by players.\n\nSince we are at turn 97, and the pot at (4,0) is almost full (2 onions), it would be efficient to complete that pot and then serve the soup after cooking.\n\nHowever, note that the pot at (4,0) is at (4,0). Alice is at (4,1) holding an onion. She is one step above the pot and facing Up. But the pot is at (4,0), which is below her. Therefore, to interact with the pot, she needs to face Down (D) and be adjacent to it.\n\nCurrently, Alice is at (4,1) and the pot is at (4,0). She is adjacent (above) and if she faces Down, she can interact to add her onion.\n\nBut note: the pot requires one more onion to start cooking. So if Alice adds her onion, the pot will have 3 onions and start cooking immediately. Then it will take 5 turns to cook.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob is at (5,3) holding an onion. He can either:\n  a) Bring his onion to the other pot at (2,0) which has 1 onion (needs 2 more) or \n  b) Bring it to a kitchen counter for storage, or \n  c) Try to help with the pot at (4,0) but that pot will be full after Alice adds her onion.\n\nSince the pot at (4,0) will be full after Alice adds her onion, Bob cannot add his onion there. Therefore, Bob should either put his onion on a kitchen counter or take it to the other pot at (2,0).\n\nBut note: there are already many onions on kitchen counters (we have 7 kitchen counters with onions). We don't really need more. We should use them to fill the pots.\n\nPlan:\n1. Alice should add her onion to the pot at (4,0) to complete it. This will start cooking (3 onions) and the cooking will finish at turn 97 + 5 = 102.\n\n   Steps for Alice at turn 97:\n     - She is at (4,1) facing U. The pot is at (4,0) (below her). She needs to face Down to interact.\n     - So she can either:\n          Option A: Move Down to (4,0) and then interact? But note: the pot is at (4,0) and it's non-empty. Players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles. So she cannot step on the pot. Therefore, she must interact from her current position (4,1) by facing Down.\n\n     - Therefore, at turn 97, Alice should change orientation to Down (D) so that she is facing the pot. But note: the action for changing orientation without moving is to use the direction key? The problem says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" But in this case, she is adjacent to the pot (which is non-empty) so if she tries to move Down, she would not move and just change orientation? Or does she have to use a separate action for changing orientation?\n\n     The problem states two types of actions:\n        - Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. If the adjacent tile (in the direction of movement) is not empty, then the player doesn't move but still changes orientation.\n        - Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): This is a separate action that only changes orientation without attempting to move.\n\n     However, the problem says: \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" This is confusing. Actually, reading carefully:\n\n        \"Move (L/R/U/D): Changes position and orientation. Specifically, L (x-1, y), R (x+1, y), U (x, y+1), D (x, y-1).\"\n\n        and\n\n        \"Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\"\n\n     But note: the Change Orientation action does not change position. The description might be a bit off. Actually, the Change Orientation action only changes the orientation and does not attempt to move. The condition about the adjacent tile is probably for the Move action: when you try to move, if the adjacent tile is not empty, you don't move but change orientation.\n\n     However, the problem lists \"Change Orientation\" as a separate action. So we have:\n\n        - Move: when you press a direction, you attempt to move and always change orientation to that direction. If movement is blocked, you only change orientation.\n        - Change Orientation: a separate action that only changes orientation without moving.\n\n     But the problem says: \"Each player can: ... Change Orientation (L/R/U/D): No move if the adjacent tile is not an empty one.\" -> This seems to describe the same behavior as when a move is blocked. It might be that the \"Change Orientation\" action is redundant because you can achieve the same by trying to move in a blocked direction? However, the problem lists it as a distinct action.\n\n     Clarification: The problem states that the action set is {U, D, L, R, I, S}. So we have the four direction keys (which are used for both moving and changing orientation) and Interact and Stay.\n\n     How it works for direction keys:\n        - If the adjacent tile in the direction is empty and walkable, then the player moves and changes orientation to that direction.\n        - If the adjacent tile is not empty (or not walkable), then the player does not move but changes orientation to that direction.\n\n     Therefore, there isn't a separate \"Change Orientation\" action that doesn't attempt to move. The direction keys always change the orientation and attempt to move (but move only if possible).\n\n     So for Alice at (4,1) facing U, to face the pot at (4,0) (which is below her), she needs to face Down. She can do that by pressing D (Down). Since the tile below (4,0) is a pot (non-empty, non-walkable), she will not move but will change orientation to Down.\n\n     Then, in the next turn, she can press I to interact, because now she is adjacent and facing the pot.\n\n     Alternatively, she could do it in one turn? But the interaction requires being adjacent and facing the object. At turn 97, she is adjacent (above the pot) but facing Up (away). So she is not facing the pot. Therefore, she must first face the pot.\n\n     So at turn 97, Alice should press D (Down) to change orientation to Down (without moving, because the tile below is non-empty). Then at turn 98, she can press I to interact and add the onion.\n\n2. After Alice adds the onion to the pot at (4,0), that pot will start cooking (3 onions). It will be ready at turn 97 + 1 (for the interaction) + 5 = 103? Actually, the cooking starts immediately after the third ingredient is added. So the cooking starts at turn 98 (if she adds at turn 98). Then it will be ready at turn 98 + 5 = 103.\n\n3. Now, we need to serve the soup at turn 103. To serve, we need a plate and then deliver to the serving counter.\n\n   - There is a plate dispenser at (0,2). \n   - The serving counter is at (6,2).\n\n4. Meanwhile, Bob is at (5,3) holding an onion. He can either:\n   - Take his onion to the pot at (2,0) which currently has 1 onion. It needs 2 more. But note there are many onions on the counters. Alternatively, we might not need to use that pot immediately because we are already cooking one pot which will yield 20. And we are at turn 97, so we might not have time to cook a second pot? We don't know the total number of turns, but the goal is to maximize the reward in the next several turns (H turns). We are not given H, but typically we plan for the immediate future.\n\n   However, since we are at turn 97, and the cooking time for the first pot is 5 turns (ready at 103), we can plan to serve that and then possibly start another one? But note: Bob is holding an onion and there is another pot that is partially filled. We can use the onions on the counters to fill the second pot.\n\n   But let's see: if we want to serve the soup from the first pot at turn 103, we need to have a plate and then bring the plate with soup to the serving counter.\n\n   Steps for serving:\n     a) Someone must get a plate from the plate dispenser at (0,2).\n     b) Then bring that plate to the pot at (4,0) to serve the soup (after it's cooked).\n     c) Then bring the soup (on the plate) to the serving counter at (6,2).\n\n   Since Alice is at (4,0) after adding the onion? Actually, after adding the onion, she will still be at (4,1) and facing down. Then she can be free to move.\n\n   Alternatively, Bob can be assigned to get the plate and serve.\n\n   Let's assign roles:\n\n   - Alice: after adding the onion, she can go to get a plate? But she is at (4,1) and the plate dispenser is at (0,2). That's a long way. Alternatively, she can stay near the pot and wait for the soup to cook? But that might not be efficient.\n\n   - Bob is at (5,3) holding an onion. He can put the onion on a kitchen counter first and then go get a plate.\n\n   There are kitchen counters available? The kitchen counters are at various locations. The one at (6,3) has an onion, but we can use an empty one? Actually, the problem lists the non-empty kitchen counters. There are 7 non-empty (all with onions). There are more kitchen counters? The list of kitchen counters: [(0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)]. Only the ones that are non-empty are listed. The others are empty? So we can use an empty kitchen counter to store Bob's onion.\n\n   Let's choose an empty kitchen counter near Bob. Bob is at (5,3). The kitchen counters at (5,0), (5,4) are empty? We don't have information about the others. The non-empty ones are listed. So any kitchen counter not listed in the non-empty state is empty.\n\n   Non-empty kitchen counters: (6,1), (6,3), (0,3), (1,4), (3,4), (2,2), (4,2). So the others are empty.\n\n   For example, (5,0), (5,4) are empty? (5,0) is a kitchen counter? Yes, it's in the list. And it's not in the non-empty list, so it's empty.\n\n   Bob can put his onion on (5,4) which is above him? He is at (5,3). (5,4) is adjacent above? He is facing Up (U). So if he moves Up to (5,4), he can interact to place the onion? But (5,4) is a kitchen counter. However, to interact, he must be adjacent and facing the counter. He is at (5,3) and (5,4) is above. He is facing Up, so if he moves Up to (5,4), he would step on it? But note: kitchen counters are non-empty? Actually, the tile (5,4) is a kitchen counter and currently empty. But players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles? The kitchen counter is a tile that is walkable when empty? Actually, the problem says: \"Kitchen Counter: Temporary item storage.\" and \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles\". Since (5,4) is empty, Bob can walk onto it? But the problem doesn't explicitly say that kitchen counters are walkable. However, the tile types: Empty tile is walkable. Other tiles: dispensers, pot, serving counter, kitchen counter. The problem says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles\". And a tile is non-empty if it has an item (for kitchen counter) or is a dispenser/pot/serving counter? Actually, the dispensers, pots, serving counters, and kitchen counters are fixed objects. The problem says \"non-empty tiles\" probably refers to tiles that have an item (like an onion on a kitchen counter) or are a fixed object that blocks movement? \n\n     Clarification: \n        - \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\"\n        - Other tiles (dispensers, pot, serving counter, kitchen counter) are not walkable? Or are they?\n\n     The problem says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles.\" and defines non-empty tiles as having an item (for kitchen counter) or being a fixed object? Actually, the fixed objects (like dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters) are always non-empty in the sense that they are not empty tiles? \n\n     However, the problem states: \"Interact (I): Player can interact with a non-empty tile if it is 1) standing on an empty tile adjacent to the tile and 2) facing the tile.\"\n\n     This implies that the player must be on an empty tile and adjacent to the target tile. Therefore, the fixed objects (dispensers, pots, serving counters, kitchen counters) are not walkable. So Bob cannot walk onto (5,4) because it's a kitchen counter (a fixed object) and non-walkable.\n\n     Therefore, to place an item on an empty kitchen counter, Bob must be on an adjacent empty tile and face the kitchen counter.\n\n     Bob is at (5,3). The kitchen counter at (5,4) is above him. He is facing Up. So he is adjacent (below the counter) and facing it? But note: the counter is at (5,4) and he is at (5,3). He is below the counter and facing Up, so he is facing the counter. Therefore, he can interact to place his onion on (5,4) without moving.\n\n     But wait: the kitchen counter at (5,4) is empty? We assume so because it's not in the non-empty list. So at turn 97, Bob can press I to interact and place his onion on (5,4). Then he will be free.\n\n5. After Bob places the onion, he can then go to the plate dispenser at (0,2) to get a plate. The path from (5,3) to (0,2) is long. Alternatively, we might have Alice do it because she is closer? Alice is at (4,1) and the plate dispenser is at (0,2). The distance for Alice: from (4,1) to (0,2) is 4 steps in x and 1 in y, so at least 5 moves? Bob is at (5,3) to (0,2): 5 steps in x and 1 in y, so at least 6 moves? So Alice is closer.\n\n   Alternatively, we can have Bob start moving towards the plate dispenser immediately without placing the onion? But he is holding an onion and cannot pick up a plate until he puts it down. So he must place the onion first.\n\n   But note: we have many onions on counters. We don't need Bob's onion immediately. So we can have him place it and then go for the plate.\n\n   However, the cooking will finish at turn 103. We are at turn 97. We have 6 turns until then. The plate must be at the pot at turn 103 to serve immediately.\n\n   How long does it take to get the plate to the pot?\n     - From plate dispenser (0,2) to pot (4,0): \n          (0,2) -> ... -> (4,0): at least 4 steps in x and 2 in y -> 6 moves? But we can use a path.\n\n     Actually, let's map the grid. We don't have a grid layout, but we know the positions of obstacles. The kitchen counters and other fixed objects are at specific positions. We must avoid them.\n\n     We know the fixed objects (non-walkable) are the kitchen counters (even when empty?), dispensers, pots, serving counters. And also the other player.\n\n     However, we can assume that the rest of the tiles are empty and walkable.\n\n     The grid is 7x5? The positions go from x=0 to 6 and y=0 to 4? \n\n     The path from (0,2) to (4,0):\n        One possible path: (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) but (2,2) is a kitchen counter and non-walkable? And it has an onion? So it's occupied and non-walkable. So we must avoid (2,2). Similarly, (3,2) and (4,2) are kitchen counters and non-walkable.\n\n        So we cannot go straight along y=2. We must go around.\n\n        Alternative route:\n          (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,0) \n        But note: (0,1) is a kitchen counter? The list of kitchen counters includes (0,1) and it is non-empty? Actually, the non-empty kitchen counters are listed: (0,1) is not in the non-empty list? The non-empty ones are: (6,1), (6,3), (0,3), (1,4), (3,4), (2,2), (4,2). So (0,1) is a kitchen counter but empty? Then it is non-walkable? The problem says players cannot walk onto non-empty tiles? But what about empty fixed objects? The problem says: \"Players cannot walk onto/through non-empty tiles\". So if a tile is a fixed object (like a kitchen counter) and empty, is it walkable? \n\n        The problem doesn't explicitly say. But from the interaction condition: the player must be on an empty tile adjacent to the target tile. This implies that the fixed objects are not walkable. Therefore, even an empty kitchen counter is non-walkable.\n\n        So we must avoid all fixed objects (kitchen counters, dispensers, pots, serving counters). \n\n        Therefore, the path must avoid:\n          - All kitchen counters: [(0,0), (1,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0), (0,1), (6,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (0,3), (6,3), (0,4), (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)]\n          - Dispensers: onion at [(2,4), (4,4)] and plate at (0,2)\n          - Pots: (2,0), (4,0)\n          - Serving counter: (6,2)\n\n        So the walkable tiles are the empty tiles and the ones that are not these.\n\n        The grid is 7x5. Let's mark the non-walkable tiles:\n\n          y=0: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0) [pot], (3,0), (4,0) [pot], (5,0), (6,0)\n          y=1: (0,1), (6,1) [has onion? but non-walkable anyway]\n          y=2: (0,2) [plate dispenser], (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (6,2) [serving counter]\n          y=3: (0,3), (6,3)\n          y=4: (0,4), (1,4), (2,4) [onion dispenser], (3,4), (4,4) [onion dispenser], (5,4), (6,4)\n\n        So the walkable tiles are:\n\n          y=0: none (all are non-walkable)\n          y=1: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) -> but note (0,1) and (6,1) are non-walkable, so (1,1) to (5,1) are walkable? \n          y=2: (1,2) -> because (0,2) is dispenser, (2,2) to (4,2) are kitchen counters, (6,2) serving counter -> so only (1,2) and (5,2) are walkable? \n          y=3: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) -> because (0,3) and (6,3) are non-walkable.\n          y=4: none? because all are non-walkable? \n\n        This doesn't look right. How do players move? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"Empty Tile: Walkable space.\" and the other tiles are not empty. Therefore, only the tiles that are not listed as any fixed object are walkable. But we don't have a complete list of every tile. We are only given the positions of the fixed objects. So the rest are empty and walkable.\n\n        The fixed objects are:\n          Kitchen Counters: 17 positions\n          Onion Dispensers: 2 positions\n          Plate Dispenser: 1 position\n          Pots: 2 positions\n          Serving Counter: 1 position\n\n        Total fixed: 23. The grid is 7*5=35 tiles. So 12 tiles are walkable.\n\n        We don't have the exact positions of the walkable tiles, but we can infer that the players are on walkable tiles and can move to adjacent walkable tiles.\n\n        Given the complexity, we'll assume that there is a path from (0,2) to (4,0) that avoids fixed objects. One possible path:\n\n          (0,2) -> cannot go left, down, or right? (0,2) is the plate dispenser. The player must be adjacent to it to interact? But to get the plate, the player must stand on an adjacent empty tile and face the dispenser.\n\n        How does one get a plate from (0,2)? The adjacent empty tiles to (0,2) are: \n          - (0,1): but (0,1) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable.\n          - (0,3): kitchen counter -> non-walkable.\n          - (1,2): is that walkable? We don't know. But if it's not a fixed object, then it is walkable.\n\n        The fixed objects at y=2: (0,2) dispenser, (2,2) kitchen counter, (3,2) kitchen counter, (4,2) kitchen counter, (6,2) serving counter. So (1,2) and (5,2) are not listed as fixed objects? So they are empty and walkable.\n\n        So to get a plate from (0,2), a player must be at (1,2) and face Left (towards (0,2)).\n\n        Similarly, from (1,2) the player can go to (1,1) or (1,3) if they are walkable.\n\n        (1,1): is it a fixed object? The kitchen counters include (1,0) but not (1,1). So (1,1) is walkable.\n\n        So path from (0,2) to (4,0):\n\n          Start at (1,2) [because we must be at (1,2) to get the plate] -> then move to (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> then down to (4,0) is not possible because (4,0) is a pot and non-walkable. So we must interact with the pot from (4,1).\n\n        So the plate must be brought to (4,1). Then the player can face down and interact with the pot to serve the soup.\n\n        Steps for the plate:\n          - Go to (1,2) and face Left to get the plate: that takes 0 moves if already there? But we are not there.\n          - Then from (1,2) to (1,1) (1 move down)\n          - Then to (2,1) (1 move right)\n          - Then to (3,1) (1 move right)\n          - Then to (4,1) (1 move right)\n\n          Total: 4 moves to get to (4,1) with the plate.\n\n        Then, at (4,1) facing Down, interact to serve the soup from the pot.\n\n        Then, the player must take the soup to the serving counter at (6,2). From (4,1) to (6,2): \n          (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (6,1) but (6,1) is a kitchen counter (non-walkable) and it has an onion? So we cannot step there.\n\n          Alternatively: (4,1) -> (4,2) but (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable.\n          So we must go: (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (5,2) -> (6,2) but (5,2) is walkable? The fixed objects at y=2: (0,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (6,2). So (5,2) is not listed -> walkable.\n\n          So: (4,1) -> (5,1) (1 right) -> (5,2) (1 up) -> then at (5,2) face Right to interact with (6,2) serving counter? But (6,2) is adjacent to (5,2) and to the right. So the player at (5,2) facing Right can interact to deliver.\n\n          Steps: from (4,1) to (5,1) to (5,2) (2 moves) and then interact.\n\n        So total for serving after getting the plate to (4,1): 2 more moves and an interact.\n\n        But note: the plate is obtained at (1,2). The total moves for the plate carrier: \n          - Move to (1,2): let's say starting from somewhere.\n          - Then 4 moves to (4,1) (via (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1))\n          - Then 2 moves to (5,2) and then interact.\n\n        Plus the initial interaction at (1,2) to get the plate.\n\n        So total actions: 1 (interact to get plate) + 4 (moves) + 2 (moves to serving) + 1 (interact to deliver) = 8 actions.\n\n        And we have from turn 98 to turn 103: 6 turns? (turn 98,99,...,103) -> 6 actions? Not enough.\n\n        Alternatively, we can have two players: one gets the plate and the other serves.\n\n        But note: the soup is ready at turn 103. We can start getting the plate earlier.\n\n        We are at turn 97. After turn 97, we have turns 98,99,100,101,102,103,... \n\n        Plan:\n\n          Turn 97: \n            Alice: D (to face down towards the pot at (4,0))\n            Bob: I (to place the onion on the kitchen counter at (5,4) from (5,3) facing up)\n\n          Turn 98:\n            Alice: I (add onion to pot at (4,0)) -> now the pot has 3 onions and starts cooking (will be ready at turn 98+5=103)\n            Bob: ? After placing, he is free. We can send Bob to get the plate.\n\n          Bob's journey to get the plate:\n\n            Bob is at (5,3) after placing the onion. He is facing up? After interacting, his orientation is still up? The problem doesn't specify, but we'll assume that after an interact, the orientation remains the same.\n\n            To go to (0,2) for the plate:\n\n            Path: (5,3) -> (5,2) is walkable? (5,2) is walkable? Yes. So:\n              Turn 98: Bob moves Up? But he is at (5,3) and (5,4) is above but non-walkable (kitchen counter). So he cannot move up. He must move left or down? \n\n            He can move left to (4,3). Is (4,3) walkable? We don't have a fixed object at (4,3) -> walkable. Then to (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2). Then at (1,2) he can get the plate.\n\n            Steps:\n              Turn 98: Bob moves Left to (4,3) -> orientation Left.\n              Turn 99: Left to (3,3)\n              Turn 100: Left to (2,3)\n              Turn 101: Left to (1,3)\n              Turn 102: Down to (1,2) -> now at (1,2), and he needs to face Left to interact with the plate dispenser at (0,2). So at turn 102, he moves to (1,2) and faces? When he moves down from (1,3) to (1,2), he changes orientation to Down. Then he needs to face Left to interact with (0,2). So:\n\n              Turn 103: Bob changes orientation to Left (by trying to move left? But (0,2) is adjacent and non-walkable, so he can press Left and it will change orientation to Left without moving) -> then he can interact? But he can't interact on the same turn as moving? He can only do one action per turn.\n\n            So at turn 103: Bob is at (1,2) facing Down. He needs to face Left to get the plate. So he does: Left (to change orientation to Left) -> then he can interact at turn 104? \n\n            But the soup is ready at turn 103. We want to serve at turn 103. But Bob isn't even at the pot with the plate until after turn 104.\n\n            Alternatively, at turn 102, when he moves Down to (1,2), he could do it in a way that he ends up facing Left? But when moving down, his orientation becomes Down. So he must use turn 103 to face Left and then turn 104 to interact to get the plate.\n\n            Then he has to bring the plate to (4,1): 4 moves (as before) -> turns 104: get plate, then 105: to (1,1), 106: (2,1), 107: (3,1), 108: (4,1). Then at (4,1) he must face Down to interact with the pot: turn 109: face Down (if not already) and then interact to serve? Then turn 110: move to (5,1), 111: move to (5,2), 112: interact to deliver. This is too late.\n\n        Therefore, we need to get the plate earlier.\n\n        Alternative: have Alice get the plate after she adds the onion.\n\n          Turn 97: Alice: D (to face down)\n          Turn 98: Alice: I (add onion) -> now free at (4,1) facing down.\n\n          Then Alice can go to get the plate:\n\n            From (4,1) to (1,2): \n              Path: (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> that's 4 moves.\n\n            Then at (1,2) she must face Left to get the plate.\n\n            So:\n              Turn 99: Alice moves Left to (3,1) [facing left? because she moved left]\n              Turn 100: Left to (2,1)\n              Turn 101: Left to (1,1)\n              Turn 102: Up to (1,2) -> now at (1,2) facing up? because she moved up? \n              Turn 103: Change orientation to Left (by pressing Left) -> then she can interact to get the plate.\n\n            But the soup is ready at turn 103. We are at turn 103 and she is getting the plate at (1,2). Then she has to bring it back to (4,1): 4 moves (as before) -> turns 104 to 107, and then serve at turn 108. And then deliver at turn 109-110. Too late.\n\n        How about if we get the plate before the soup is ready? We have 5 turns of cooking. We can get the plate during the cooking time.\n\n          The cooking starts at turn 98 (when Alice adds the onion). It will be ready at turn 103.\n\n          So between turn 98 and 102, we have 5 turns to get the plate and be at (4,1) by turn 103.\n\n          Alice's journey to get the plate and return:\n\n            Turn 98: after adding onion, she is at (4,1) facing down.\n            Turn 99: move Left to (3,1) [facing left]\n            Turn 100: move Left to (2,1)\n            Turn 101: move Left to (1,1)\n            Turn 102: move Up to (1,2) [facing up]\n            Turn 103: at (1,2), she needs to face Left to get the plate. So she presses Left to change orientation to Left. Then she can interact to get the plate? But that's turn 103. Then she has the plate at (1,2) at turn 103.\n\n            But the soup is ready at turn 103. She needs to be at (4,1) with the plate at turn 103 to serve it immediately.\n\n            She is at (1,2) at turn 103. She needs to go to (4,1): 3 moves right and 1 move down? But she has to move:\n\n              Turn 104: move Right to (2,2) -> but (2,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So she cannot go that way.\n\n            She must go (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1): 4 moves.\n\n            So she would arrive at (4,1) at turn 107. Then turn 108: face down and interact to serve. Then turn 109-110 to deliver. Too late.\n\n        Therefore, we must have two players: one stays to serve the soup and the other gets the plate.\n\n        But Alice is the one who is near the pot. After she adds the onion, she can stay near the pot and wait. Then Bob can be the one to get the plate.\n\n        Revised plan:\n\n          Turn 97:\n            Alice: D (face down to prepare to add onion)\n            Bob: I (place onion on (5,4))\n\n          Turn 98:\n            Alice: I (add onion to pot at (4,0)) -> pot starts cooking (ready at turn 103)\n            Bob: Start moving to get the plate.\n\n          Bob's journey from (5,3) after turn 98:\n\n            He is at (5,3) after placing the onion. He is facing up? But after interacting, orientation remains up.\n\n            We need him to get to (1,2) by turn 102 or 103 at the latest.\n\n            Path: (5,3) -> (5,2) is walkable? Yes. But to move down from (5,3) to (5,2): \n              Turn 98: Bob moves Down to (5,2) -> facing down.\n            Then he can move left to (4,2) but (4,2) is a kitchen counter -> non-walkable. So he must go via (4,3) and then down to (4,2) is not possible.\n\n            Alternative: go left from (5,3) to (4,3), then down to (4,2) is not possible. So go to (4,3), then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), then down to (1,2).\n\n            Steps for Bob:\n              Turn 98: move Left to (4,3) -> facing left.\n              Turn 99: move Left to (3,3)\n              Turn 100: move Left to (2,3)\n              Turn 101: move Left to (1,3)\n              Turn 102: move Down to (1,2) -> now at (1,2) facing down.\n              Turn 103: change orientation to Left (press Left) to face the plate dispenser, then interact to get the plate.\n\n            But then at turn 103, he gets the plate. But the soup is ready at turn 103, and he is at (1,2) with the plate. He needs to bring it to (4,1) to serve. That takes 4 moves (as before) -> turns 104 to 107. Then serve at turn 108. Then deliver at turn 109-110.\n\n          This is too slow.\n\n        Given the time constraints, we might not be able to serve the soup immediately at turn 103. But we can still serve it later. The reward is the same whenever it is served, as long as it's not burned? The problem doesn't say anything about burning. So we can serve it later.\n\n        But we are to maximize the total reward in the next several turns (H turns). We are not given H, so we assume H is large enough to complete the serving.\n\n        However, the immediate goal is to get this soup served as soon as possible to free up the pot for the next one.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the onions on the counters to fill the other pot and cook a second soup while the first is cooking. But that might be even more complex.\n\n        Given the complexity of the path and the tight timeline, we might focus on completing the first soup and then serving it, even if it takes a few extra turns.\n\n        Also, note that there is a kitchen counter at (4,2) which is above the pot. It has an onion. But we might use that as a temporary storage for a plate? But we cannot, because the plate dispenser is the only source.\n\n        Another idea: after the soup is ready, we can have Alice leave the area and go get the plate? But then the soup is sitting in the pot and we can serve it anytime.\n\n        Let's change roles:\n\n          - Alice adds the onion at turn 98, then she can immediately head to get the plate.\n          - Bob, after placing his onion, can go to the other pot at (2,0) and start filling it with onions from the counters.\n\n        But then who will be there to serve the soup at turn 103? No one. We can have Alice get the plate and then come back to serve.\n\n        The timeline for Alice to get the plate and return:\n\n          Turn 98: Alice at (4,1) facing down (after adding onion) -> then she moves Left to (3,1) [facing left]\n          Turn 99: Left to (2,1)\n          Turn 100: Left to (1,1)\n          Turn 101: Up to (1,2) [facing up]\n          Turn 102: Left (change orientation to face Left) and then interact to get the plate.\n          Turn 103: move Right to (2,2) -> but (2,2) is non-walkable. So she must go down to (1,1) first: \n                   instead, at turn 103: move Down to (1,1) [facing down]\n          Turn 104: Right to (2,1)\n          Turn 105: Right to (3,1)\n          Turn 106: Right to (4,1) -> now at (4,1) facing right.\n          Turn 107: face Down (press Down) to face the pot.\n          Turn 108: interact to serve the soup.\n          Then deliver: \n             Turn 109: Right to (5,1)\n             Turn 110: Up to (5,2)\n             Turn 111: face Right and interact to deliver.\n\n        This is 14 turns after turn 98 (until turn 111) to deliver. And we get 20 points.\n\n        Meanwhile, the other pot at (2,0) has 1 onion. Bob can fill it with two more onions from the counters. There are plenty of onions on counters.\n\n        But the challenge is to deliver multiple soups. However, the immediate planning horizon is not specified.\n\n        Given the instructions, we are to plan for the next several turns (H turns). We can choose H=10 or so.\n\n        But the problem doesn't specify H. We are to output a sequence of actions for Alice for the next several turns.\n\n        Since the most impactful action is to complete the soup at (4,0) and then serve it, we focus on that.\n\n        Given the time constraints, we might not be able to serve within 10 turns, but we can start the process.\n\n        Therefore, for the next few turns, we can have:\n\n          Alice:\n            Turn 97: D (face down to interact with the pot)\n            Turn 98: I (add onion)\n            Then she should head west to get the plate.\n\n          Bob:\n            We are not required to plan for Bob, but we can suggest. However, the question asks for Alice's actions.\n\n        So for Alice:\n\n          Turn 97: D\n          Turn 98: I\n          Then she needs to move west to (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2)\n\n        So:\n\n          Turn 99: L (move left to (3,1) and face left)\n          Turn 100: L ( to (2,1) and face left)\n          Turn 101: L ( to (1,1) and face left)\n          Turn 102: U ( to (1,2) and face up) -> but at (1,2) she is above the dispenser? She needs to face left to interact.\n\n          Turn 103: L ( to change orientation to left, without moving because the left tile (0,2) is non-walkable)\n          Turn 104: I ( to grab the plate)\n\n        Then she can start heading back.\n\n        But we are only asked to plan for Alice, and for several turns. We can output until turn 104.\n\n        However, we might want to be more efficient. At turn 102, she is at (1,1) and wants to go to (1,2). But (1,2) is walkable. She can move up. Then at (1,2) she is facing up. Then at turn 103, she changes to face left and then turn 104 interact.\n\n        Alternatively, on turn 102 when she is at (1,1), she can face left and then move up? But she can only do one action.\n\n        So the above is fine.\n\n        But note: at turn 102, when she is at (1,1), if she moves up to (1,2), she will be at (1,2) and facing up. Then at turn 103, she can press Left to face left (without moving) and then turn 104 interact.\n\n        So:\n\n          Turn 97: D\n          Turn 98: I\n          Turn 99: L\n          Turn 100: L\n          Turn 101: L   [now at (1,1) facing left]\n          Turn 102: U   [now at (1,2) facing up]\n          Turn 103: L   [change orientation to left]\n          Turn 104: I   [grab plate]\n\n        This is 8 turns.\n\n        We can stop here or continue. But the problem says \"plan a sequence of actions over next several turns (say, H turns)\". We can choose H=8.\n\n        But note: the most recent action history for Alice is 5 actions: D, D, I, L, U. This is for turns before 97. We are starting at turn 97.\n\n        We output for Alice from turn 97 to turn 104.\n\n        However, we are at turn 97, and we are planning for turns 97 to 104 (8 turns).\n\n        But the problem might expect a fixed H. Since not specified, we'll output 8 turns.\n\n        But wait, Bob might be in the way? For example, when Alice is moving from (4,1) to (3,1) to (2,1) to (1,1) to (1,2), what if Bob is moving in the same area? We are not controlling Bob, so we assume he will not block Alice. Or we can assume that the players will coordinate to avoid blocking.\n\n        Given the complexity, we output the plan for Alice.\n\n        Therefore, Alice's actions for turns 97 to 104:\n\n          Turn 97: D\n          Turn 98: I\n          Turn 99: L\n          Turn 100: L\n          Turn 101: L\n          Turn 102: U\n          Turn 103: L\n          Turn 104: I\n\n        This gets her the plate at turn 104.\n\n        Then beyond turn 104, she can head back to the pot to serve the soup.\n\n        But we stop at turn 104.\n\n        However, the initial instructions say: \"plan a sequence of actions ... over next several turns (say, H turns)\". We choose H=8.\n\n        Let's hope that Bob will handle the other tasks or not block.\n\n        Alternatively, we might have a simpler plan: after Alice adds the onion, she can wait and let Bob get the plate. But then we are not controlling Bob.\n\n        Given the task is to output Alice's actions, we do the above.\n\n        But note: there is a kitchen counter at (4,2) which is very close to the pot. It has an onion. Alice could, after adding the onion, go to (4,2) to pick up that onion? But (4,2) is a kitchen counter and non-walkable. She would have to be at (4,1) or (3,2) or (4,3) to interact with it. She is at (4,1) and (4,2) is above. If she faces up and interacts, she could pick up the onion on (4,2) if it's still there. But that would be a distraction.\n\n        We want to get the plate.\n\n        Therefore, the plan is as above.\n\n        Output:\n\n          Turn 97: D\n          Turn 98: I\n          Turn 99: L\n          Turn 100: L\n          Turn 101: L\n          Turn 102: U\n          Turn 103: L\n          Turn 104: I\n\n        But note: at turn 102, when she moves Up to (1,2), she might be blocked by Bob? Bob might be moving in the area. We don't know. We assume he is not at (1,2) at that turn.\n\n        This is a risk, but without controlling Bob, we do our best.\n\n        Alternatively, we could have Alice wait at (4,1) and let Bob get the plate, but then we are not sure what Bob will do.\n\n        Given the information, we stick to the plan.\n\n        Final answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the total reward from delivered soup recipes, Alice should focus on completing the nearly full pot at (4,0) and then initiate the process to serve the cooked soup. The pot at (4,0) currently has 2 onions and requires one more onion to start cooking (which takes 5 turns). Alice is holding an onion and is positioned at (4,1), adjacent to the pot. After adding the onion, she should immediately head to the plate dispenser at (0,2) to fetch a plate, as a plate is required to serve the soup once cooked. This plan ensures the soup starts cooking promptly and the plate is acquired efficiently for future serving.\n\n### Alice's Action Sequence (Turns 97–104):\n- **Turn 97: D**  \n  Alice faces down (toward the pot at (4,0)) to prepare for interaction. Since the tile below (4,0) is non-walkable, this changes orientation without moving.\n  \n- **Turn 98: I**  \n  Alice interacts with the pot at (4,0) to add her onion. The pot now has 3 onions and starts cooking (will be ready at turn 103).\n\n- **Turn 99: L**  \n  Alice moves left to (3,1), facing left, to begin the journey to the plate dispenser.\n\n- **Turn 100: L**  \n  Alice moves left to (2,1), facing left.\n\n- **Turn 101: L**  \n  Alice moves left to (1,1), facing left.\n\n- **Turn 102: U**  \n  Alice moves up to (1,2), facing up. This positions her adjacent to the plate dispenser at (0,2).\n\n- **Turn 103: L**  \n  Alice faces left (toward the plate dispenser) without moving, as the left tile (0,2) is non-walkable.\n\n- **Turn 104: I**  \n  Alice interacts with the plate dispenser at (0,2) to grab a clean plate. She is now holding a plate and ready to return to serve the soup.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- **Completing the Pot (Turns 97–98):** Adding Alice's onion to the pot at (4,0) starts cooking immediately, leveraging the existing 2 onions. This maximizes efficiency, as the soup will be ready at turn 103.\n- **Acquiring the Plate (Turns 99–104):** Alice moves west to (1,2) via the walkable path [(3,1), (2,1), (1,1)], then interacts with the plate dispenser. This path avoids fixed objects (e.g., kitchen counters at (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)) and is the shortest route.\n- **Coordination with Bob:** Bob is holding an onion at (5,3). He should place it on an empty kitchen counter (e.g., (5,4)) to free himself, then assist by either:\n  - Fetching additional onions from dispensers/counters to fill the other pot at (2,0) (which has 1 onion), or\n  - Helping deliver the soup by bringing the plate to Alice or the serving counter after turn 104.\n- **Serving the Soup:** After turn 104, Alice will return to (4,1) with the plate. At turn 103+, she can interact with the cooked pot (facing down) to serve the soup, then deliver it to the serving counter at (6,2) for a 20-point reward.\n\nThis plan optimizes Alice's actions for immediate impact (starting the soup) and prepares for serving. Bob should be directed to support filling the second pot or assisting with delivery to maximize total rewards.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn 97: D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 98: I} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 99: L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 100: L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 101: L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 102: U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 103: L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn 104: I}\n}",
