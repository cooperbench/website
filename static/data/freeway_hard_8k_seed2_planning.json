        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,0) at turn t1=4 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens at turn T if the player is on a freeway y_T and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The player is only on one freeway per turn, based on their y-position at that turn.\n\nImportant note: when moving, if you move to a different y at turn T, you are not on that new y until turn T+1. So at turn T, you are on y_T, and you decide an action to go to y_{T+1}. So collision is checked based on where you are at the beginning of the turn, before moving.\n\nThe collision rule says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\" And the note clarifies: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you won't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nBut for the freeway you are on at turn T, y_T, if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T, you collide.\n\nNow, the car spans are given at turn t1=4, and we need to compute their positions at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway at t1=4:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: head h=-48, tail τ=-71, direction right, speed 24. Since it's right-moving, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)]? The rule says: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\" But in the table, for freeway 1, it says (-48, -71, right, 24). I think the head and tail are given, so for right-moving, head is the front, so if it's moving right, head should be larger than tail? But here h=-48, τ=-71, so τ < h since -71 < -48, so for right-moving, as time increases, both head and tail increase.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head and tail decrease.\n\nBut in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving, except I need to confirm the direction.\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24) — since right, and τ=-71, h=-48, so at T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-4), h + s(T-4)] = [-71 + 24(T-4), -48 + 24(T-4)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-48, -83, right, 36) → Span(T) = [-83 + 36(T-4), -48 + 36(T-4)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2? (-48, -83, right, 36) → same as above\n\nFreeway 4: (-48, -83, right, 36) → same\n\nFreeway 5 has three cars: (48, 37, right, 6), (12, 1, right, 6), (-24, -35, right, 6)\n\nFor each: first car: h=48, τ=37, right, s=6 → Span(T) = [37 + 6(T-4), 48 + 6(T-4)]\n\nSecond car: h=12, τ=1, right, s=6 → [1 + 6(T-4), 12 + 6(T-4)]\n\nThird car: h=-24, τ=-35, right, s=6 → [-35 + 6(T-4), -24 + 6(T-4)]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5? It says (48, 37, right, 6), (12, 1, right, 6), (-24, -35, right, 6) — identical to freeway 5.\n\nBut freeway 5 and 6 both have the same cars? That might be possible.\n\nFreeway 7: (48, 37, right, 12) → one car: h=48, τ=37, right, s=12 → Span(T) = [37 + 12(T-4), 48 + 12(T-4)]\n\nFreeway 8: (48, 37, right, 4) → one car: h=48, τ=37, right, s=4 → [37 + 4(T-4), 48 + 4(T-4)]\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,0) at turn t1=4. y=0 is not a freeway, so no cars there, so at turn 4, since y=0, no collision possible. The freeways are from y=1 to y=8.\n\nPlayer needs to reach y=9, which is also not a freeway, so once at y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nBut to get there, player must pass through y=1 to y=8, and at each turn when on a freeway, avoid collision.\n\nSince the player moves one step at a time, and y changes by at most 1 per turn, it will take at least 9 turns to go from y=0 to y=9, since each U increases y by 1, so minimum H=9 turns, with all actions U.\n\nBut we need to check if that path is safe, i.e., no collision when on y=k for k=1 to 8 at the respective turns.\n\nIn this case, since we start at turn 4, and we take actions at turn t=4,5,6,... up to when we reach y=9.\n\nLet me denote the turn sequence. Set t=0 as the first action turn relative to t1, but since t1 is given, I'll use absolute turns.\n\nStart at turn T=4, position y=0.\n\nAfter action at T=4, y changes to y_5, and so on.\n\nThe position after action: at turn T, player is at y_T, then chooses action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T, with Δy based on a_T.\n\nCollision at turn T depends on y_T and the cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nFor example, at T=4, y_4=0, which is not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nAfter action a_4, y_5 is set, and at T=5, we check collision based on y_5 and cars on freeway y_5 at turn T=5.\n\nSimilarly for each turn.\n\nThe goal is to have y_{4+H} =9 for some H, and we want minimal H.\n\nSince y increases by at most 1, min H is 9, with y_T for T=4 to 12: y4=0, y5=1, y6=2, ..., y12=8, then at T=12, action to go to y13=9.\n\ny_T at turn T: at T=4, y=0; after action, at T=5, y=1 if a4=U, etc.\n\nTo be at y=9 at some turn, say at turn T_final, y_{T_final} =9.\n\nSince we start at y=0 at T=4, if we go up each turn, at T=4, y=0; T=5, y=1; ... T=12, y=8; T=13, y=9. So after 9 actions, at turn T=13, y=9. But the turn index: from T=4 to T=12 inclusive, that's 9 actions: a4 to a12, and y13=9.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t1=4, so actions a4 to a_{4+H-1}, and position after H actions is y_{4+H}.\n\nWe want y_{4+H} =9.\n\nStart at y4=0, after H actions, y_{4+H} =9.\n\nSince each action changes y by -1,0,1, to go from 0 to 9, min H is 9 with all U.\n\nNow, y_{4+H} =9, so if H=9, y13=9.\n\nDuring the path, for turns T from 4 to 12, y_T is from 0 to 8, and at each T, we need no collision when on freeway, i.e., for y_T from 1 to 8.\n\nAt T=4, y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nAt T=5, if y5=1, then on freeway 1, need to check if 0 in span of car on freeway 1 at T=5.\n\nSimilarly for other turns and freeways.\n\nFirst, let's compute the car spans at different turns.\n\nSet Δt = T - 4, so at time T, Δt = T-4.\n\nFor freeway 1: car at T: Span = [-71 + 24*Δt, -48 + 24*Δt]\n\nCollision if 0 in this interval for some car, but only one car.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSince all cars are on different freeways, and we care about the freeway we are on at turn T.\n\nNow, for the min-time path, let's first check if going straight up is possible, i.e., all U actions.\n\nActions: a4=U, a5=U, ..., a12=U\n\nThen positions: T=4, y=0 (safe)\n\nT=5, y=1 (freeway 1)\n\nAt T=5, Δt=1, freeway 1 span: [-71 + 24*1, -48 + 24*1] = [-71+24, -48+24] = [-47, -24]\n\n0 in [-47,-24]? No, since both negative. So safe.\n\nT=6, y=2 (freeway 2)\n\nFreeway 2: car: [-83 + 36*Δt, -48 + 36*Δt] at Δt=2 (T=6)\n\nΔt= T-4, T=6, Δt=2\n\nSpan: [-83 + 36*2, -48 + 36*2] = [-83+72, -48+72] = [-11, 24]\n\n0 in [-11,24]? Yes, 0 is between -11 and 24. So collision would occur at T=6 if on freeway 2.\n\nBut y=2 at T=6, so on freeway 2, and 0 in span, so collision. So cannot be on freeway 2 at T=6 with this car.\n\nFreeway 2 has one car with that span.\n\nSo at T=6, if y=2, collision.\n\nTherefore, the straight up path has collision at T=6 on freeway 2.\n\nSo we need to avoid that.\n\nPerhaps delay going to y=2, or go down or something, but we need to go up eventually.\n\nSince min time is 9, but with collision, we might need more turns or different path.\n\nH could be larger if we use S or D actions, but that might increase time.\n\nFirst, let's find when it's safe to be on each freeway.\n\nFor each freeway k, and at turn T, we can check if it is occupied, i.e., if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that T.\n\nSince each freeway has cars, and we need for a given T and k, whether position 0 is occupied.\n\nThe player must be on y=k at turn T, and if occupied, collision.\n\nTo avoid collision, for the turns when on freeway k, it must not be occupied at that turn.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway and time, whether 0 is in the car span.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: only one car, span at T: [ -71 + 24*(T-4) , -48 + 24*(T-4) ]\n\nSet occupied if min <= 0 <= max.\n\nSince head and tail, for right-moving, tail <= head, so min is tail+ sΔt, max is head + sΔt.\n\nSimilarly for left, but all right here.\n\nSo for freeway 1: min = -71 + 24*(T-4), max = -48 + 24*(T-4)\n\n0 in [min,max] iff min <= 0 <= max.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, min <= 0 <= max iff min <= 0 and 0 <= max, but since min < max usually, it's when min <=0 and max>=0, but need to handle equality.\n\nSince it's a closed interval, min <=0 <= max.\n\nNow, for freeway 1:\n\nmin <=0: -71 +24Δt <=0 => 24Δt <=71 => Δt <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so Δt <=2 since integer.\n\nmax >=0: -48 +24Δt >=0 => 24Δt >=48 => Δt >=2\n\nSo at Δt=2, min = -71+48= -23 <=0, max= -48+48=0 >=0, so 0 in [-23,0], yes occupied.\n\nAt Δt=1, min=-47, max=-24, both <0, 0 not in.\n\nAt Δt=0, min=-71, max=-48, both <0.\n\nAt Δt=3, min=-71+72=1, max=-48+72=24, min=1>0, so 0 not <= min? 0 < min, not in [1,24].\n\nSo freeway 1 occupied only when Δt=2, i.e., T=6.\n\nAt T=6, Δt=2, occupied.\n\nAt other times, not occupied.\n\nT=4: Δt=0, min=-71, max=-48, 0 not in.\n\nT=5: Δt=1, min=-47, max=-24, 0 not in.\n\nT=6: Δt=2, min=-23, max=0, 0 in.\n\nT=7: Δt=3, min=1, max=24, 0 not in.\n\nT=8: Δt=4, min=25, max=48, etc.\n\nSo only at T=6, freeway 1 is occupied? No, freeway 1 is y=1, and occupied at T=6.\n\nBut for other times, not occupied.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car, span at T: [ -83 +36*(T-4), -48 +36*(T-4) ]\n\nmin = -83 +36Δt\n\nmax = -48 +36Δt\n\n0 in [min,max] iff min <=0 and max>=0.\n\nmin <=0: -83 +36Δt <=0 => 36Δt <=83 => Δt <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so Δt <=2\n\nmax >=0: -48 +36Δt >=0 => 36Δt >=48 => Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so Δt >=2 since integer Δt.\n\nSo for Δt=2: min <=0 and max>=0.\n\nAt Δt=2: min= -83+72= -11 <=0, max= -48+72=24 >=0, so yes.\n\nAt Δt=1: min= -83+36= -47 <=0, but max= -48+36= -12 <0, so max<0, 0 not in.\n\nAt Δt=3: min= -83+108=25>0, max= -48+108=60>0, min>0, not <=0.\n\nSo freeway 2 occupied only at T=6 (Δt=2).\n\nT=6, Δt=2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Cars: (-48,-83,right,36) same as freeway 2.\n\nSo identical, occupied only at T=6.\n\nFreeway 4: also same, (-48,-83,right,36), so occupied only at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 5: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6) so span at T: [37 +6*(T-4), 48 +6*(T-4)]\n\nmin = 37 +6Δt, max=48+6Δt\n\nSince 37 and 48 positive, and increasing, min and max always positive for Δt>=0? At Δt=0, min=37, max=48, both >0.\n\nAs Δt increases, larger, so min >=37 >0, so 0 never in span for this car. Always positive, so never at position 0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,6) span: [1 +6Δt, 12 +6Δt]\n\nmin=1+6Δt >=1>0, max>0, so always positive, 0 never in span.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,6) span: [-35 +6Δt, -24 +6Δt]\n\nmin = -35 +6Δt, max= -24 +6Δt\n\n0 in [min,max] iff min <=0 and max>=0.\n\nmin <=0: -35 +6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=35 => Δt <= 35/6 ≈5.833, so Δt <=5\n\nmax >=0: -24 +6Δt >=0 => 6Δt >=24 => Δt >=4\n\nSo for Δt=4,5\n\nAt Δt=4: min= -35+24= -11 <=0, max= -24+24=0 >=0, so 0 in.\n\nAt Δt=5: min= -35+30= -5 <=0, max= -24+30=6 >=0, 0 in.\n\nAt Δt=3: min= -35+18= -17 <=0, max= -24+18= -6 <0, max<0, 0 not in.\n\nAt Δt=6: min= -35+36=1>0, max= -24+36=12>0, not.\n\nSo for freeway 5, only the third car can have 0 in span, at Δt=4 and 5, i.e., T=8 and T=9.\n\nT=4 + Δt, so Δt=4, T=8; Δt=5, T=9.\n\nAnd first two cars never have 0 in span.\n\nSo freeway 5 occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5, identical cars, so occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow freeway 7: one car (48,37,right,12) span: [37 +12*(T-4), 48 +12*(T-4)]\n\nmin=37+12Δt >0 always, max>0, so never occupied, since 0 not in [min,max] as min>=37>0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: (48,37,right,4) span: [37 +4*(T-4), 48 +4*(T-4)]\n\nmin=37+4Δt >=37>0, always, so never occupied.\n\nFreeway 8 min at Δt=0 is 37>0, yes.\n\nSo summary for each freeway when occupied:\n\n- y=1: occupied only at T=6\n\n- y=2: occupied only at T=6\n\n- y=3: occupied only at T=6 (since same as y=2)\n\n- y=4: occupied only at T=6\n\n- y=5: occupied at T=8 and T=9\n\n- y=6: occupied at T=8 and T=9\n\n- y=7: never occupied\n\n- y=8: never occupied\n\ny=7 and y=8 are always safe.\n\nNow, the player starts at T=4, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe dangerous times are when we are on a freeway that is occupied at that turn.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If on y=1,2,3,4 at T=6, collision.\n\n- If on y=5 or y=6 at T=8 or T=9, collision.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are always safe, so no issue.\n\nTo minimize turns, we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on the bad positions at bad times.\n\nSince min H=9, with y_T from T=4 to T=12: y4=0, y5=1, y6=2, y7=3, y8=4, y9=5, y10=6, y11=7, y12=8, then y13=9.\n\nBut at T=6, y=2, which is freeway 2, occupied at T=6, collision.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, y=4? In this path, at T=8, y=4, but freeway 4 is occupied only at T=6, not at T=8. Freeway 4 occupied at T=6, but at T=8, not occupied.\n\nIn the path: T=8, y=4, freeway 4.\n\nBut freeway 4 occupied only at T=6, at T=8, Δt=4, min= -83 +36*4= -83+144=61>0, max= -48+144=96>0, not occupied. So safe.\n\nBut at T=6, y=2, freeway 2 occupied, collision.\n\nAlso at T=9, y=5, freeway 5 occupied at T=9? In the path, T=9, y=5, freeway 5 occupied at T=8 and T=9, so yes, at T=9, on y=5, occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly, T=10, y=6, freeway 6 occupied at T=8 and T=9, but T=10, Δt=6, for freeway 6, third car min= -35+6*6= -35+36=1>0, not occupied, so at T=10, y=6, not occupied.\n\nBut at T=9, y=5, occupied.\n\nSo in the all-up path, collisions at T=6 (on y=2) and T=9 (on y=5).\n\nWe need to avoid these.\n\nOne way is to delay or advance the time we are on certain freeways.\n\nFor example, for y=2,3,4, they are only dangerous at T=6, so if we are not on them at T=6, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 and 6 dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\ny=7 and 8 always safe.\n\nSince we start at T=4, y=0, we can go up slowly or fast, but with delays.\n\nTo minimize H, we want as few delays as possible.\n\nH is the number of turns, so more actions mean larger H, but we can reach faster by going up, but with detours.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, and we need to cross y=1 to 8.\n\nThe critical points are avoiding being on y=1,2,3,4 at T=6, and avoiding being on y=5 or y=6 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nSince y=1,2,3,4 all have the same issue at T=6, and similarly for y=5,6.\n\nNow, the player can stay on a freeway or move to avoid the bad times.\n\nFor example, at T=6, we should not be on y=1,2,3, or 4.\n\nSo possible to be on y=0, or y=5,6,7,8, or y=9 but not yet.\n\ny=0 is safe, but at T=6, if we are at y=0, that means we haven't moved up much.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at T=6: is freeway 5 occupied at T=6? Earlier, for y=5, occupied at T=8 and T=9, not at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, Δt=2, for freeway 5, third car min= -35+12= -23 <=0? max= -24+12= -12 <0, so 0 not in span, and other cars not, so freeway 5 not occupied at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 not occupied at T=6.\n\ny=7 and 8 never occupied.\n\nSo at T=6, we can be on y=0,5,6,7,8 safely, but not on y=1,2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8 and T=9, we should not be on y=5 or y=6.\n\nAt T=8, if on y=7 or y=8, safe, or y=9, or lower.\n\nNow, let's plan the path.\n\nStart at T=4, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 by some turn.\n\nMinimal H=9 might be possible with adjustments.\n\nSince at T=6 we need to avoid y=1-4, we could be on y=0 or higher than 4.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, so we can stay at y=0 for some turns.\n\nSimilarly, for later.\n\nBut staying increases H.\n\nWe could go up faster to skip some levels.\n\nFor example, if we go up to y=5 quickly, but let's see.\n\nFirst, at T=4: we can choose to stay or go up.\n\nIf we go up at T=4, to y5=1.\n\nBut at T=5, y=1, freeway 1 not occupied at T=5, as we saw earlier, min=-47,max=-24<0, not occupied, so safe.\n\nThen at T=5, we need to choose action for y6.\n\nIf we go up to y6=2, but at T=6, y=2 occupied, collision. Not good.\n\nIf at T=5, we stay, then y6=1, but at T=6, y=1, freeway 1 occupied at T=6? Earlier for freeway 1, at T=6, occupied, yes.\n\nFreeway 1 occupied at T=6, as we calculated.\n\nAt T=6, on y=1, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down from y=1, to y=0, but y=0 is safe.\n\nBut let's systematically.\n\nTo avoid being on y=1,2,3,4 at T=6, we can either be below or above at T=6.\n\nBelow: y<=0, but y=0 is the only below, since y min=0.\n\nAbove: y>=5 at T=6.\n\nBut at T=6, y_6 is the position at turn 6.\n\nFrom start, T=4, y=0.\n\nAfter two actions (at T=4 and T=5), we can be at y6.\n\nPossible y6: if both U, y6=2; if U then S, y6=1; if U then D, y6=0; if S then U, y6=1; etc.\n\nSo y6 can be 0,1, or 2.\n\nCannot be higher than 2 in two steps from y=0.\n\nMax y6=2 with two U.\n\nMin y6=0, with two D, but D from y=0, y cannot go below 0, so if at y=0 and D, y stays 0? The update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy = +1 if U, -1 if D, 0 if S, and y in [0,9], so if y_t=0 and a_t=D, then y_{t+1} = max(0, 0-1) =0? I think it's clamped, so y cannot be negative.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, cannot go above.\n\nSo at T=4, y=0, if a4=D, y5=0; if a4=S, y5=0; if a4=U, y5=1.\n\nSimilarly, from y5=0, same.\n\nSo from T=4 to T=6, after two actions, y6 can be 0,1, or 2.\n\nCannot be 3 or higher.\n\nTherefore, at T=6, we must be at y=0,1, or 2.\n\nBut y=1 and y=2 are both occupied at T=6 (freeway 1 and 2), and y=0 is safe.\n\ny=3 and 4 are also occupied, but we cannot be there anyway.\n\nSo the only safe position at T=6 is y=0.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y=0 at T=6.\n\nThat means, from T=4 to T=6, we need to end up at y=0.\n\nAt T=4, y=0.\n\nAfter a4, y5 set.\n\nThen after a5, y6 set.\n\nWe need y6=0.\n\nPossible sequences:\n\n- a4=S or D, then y5=0, then a5=S or D, y6=0.\n\n- a4=U, y5=1, then a5=D, y6=0.\n\nIf a4=U, y5=1, then a5=S, y6=1, but y6=1 occupied, not good.\n\nSimilarly, if a4=U, y5=1, a5=U, y6=2, occupied.\n\nSo only ways to have y6=0: either stay at 0 both turns, or go up then down.\n\nBut we need to minimize time, so staying might be slower.\n\nNow, after T=6, we need to go up to 9.\n\nBut we also have to avoid the later collisions at T=8 and T=9 on y=5 and y=6.\n\nFirst, let's get to T=6 safely at y=0.\n\nNow, options:\n\nOption 1: Stay at y=0 for first two turns.\n\na4=S, y5=0\n\na5=S, y6=0\n\nSafe at T=6.\n\nThen from there, we need to go to y=9.\n\nBut we have the issue at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow, at T=6, y=0.\n\nWe can start moving up.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to increase y by 9, so min 9 actions from start, but we used two actions to stay, so we are at T=6, y=0, which is same as start, effectively delayed.\n\nFrom T=6, y=0, we need to reach y=9.\n\nMin actions: 9 actions to go up to y=9 at T=6+9=15, y15=9.\n\nBut we can start from T=6.\n\nActions from a6 to a14, 9 actions, y15=9.\n\nH=10? From t1=4, actions a4 to a_{4+H-1}, y_{4+H}=9.\n\nIf we use a4 and a5 to stay or adjust, then a6 to a14 to go up, y15=9, so 4+H =15, H=11? Let's see.\n\nStart: T=4, y=0\n\nAfter a4: y5\n\nAfter a5: y6\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{k}: y_{k+1}\n\nWe want y_{4+H} =9.\n\nAt T=4, before any action, y=0.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{4+H} =9.\n\nFor example, if all U from T=4, a4 to a12, 9 actions, y13=9.\n\nIn this case, with delay: we have a4 and a5 such that y6=0.\n\nThen from there, we need to reach y=9 in as few steps as possible.\n\nMin steps from y=0 to y=9 is 9 steps with all U.\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions during the path.\n\nSpecifically, avoid being on y=5 or y=6 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nT=8 and T=9 are fixed times.\n\nNow, at T=6, y=0.\n\nThen after actions:\n\nAt T=6, we choose a6, then y7 set.\n\nAt T=7, y7, choose a7, y8 set.\n\nAt T=8, y8, choose a8, y9 set.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWe need to set the path so that at T=8 and T=9, we are not on y=5 or y=6.\n\nPossible to be on other y.\n\ny=7 and 8 are always safe, so we can be there at any time.\n\ny=0 to 4 might be safe except at certain times, but T=8 and T=9, for y=1,2,3,4, they are not occupied except at T=6, which is past, so at T=8,9, they should be safe.\n\nSimilarly y=5 and 6 only occupied at T=8,9, so we need to avoid them at those times.\n\nNow, let's list the positions over time from T=6 onwards.\n\nT=6: y=0 (safe)\n\nNow, we want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nSuppose we go up each turn from here.\n\nThen:\n\na6=U, y7=1\n\nAt T=7, y=1, freeway 1: at T=7, Δt=3, min= -71+72=1? Earlier: for freeway 1, at Δt=3, min=1, max=24, both >0, 0 not in, so not occupied. Safe.\n\na7=U, y8=2\n\nAt T=8, y=2, freeway 2: at T=8, Δt=4, min= -83+144=61? Freeway 2 min= -83 +36*4= -83+144=61>0, max=96>0, not occupied. Safe.\n\nBut now at T=8, y=2, which is not y=5 or 6, so safe from that.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on y=5 or 6 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nNow continue: a8=U, y9=3\n\nAt T=9, y=3, freeway 3: at T=9, Δt=5, min= -83+180=97>0, not occupied. Safe.\n\na9=U, y10=4\n\nT=10, y=4, freeway 4: Δt=6, min= -83+216=133>0, safe.\n\na10=U, y11=5\n\nT=11, y=5, freeway 5: at T=11, Δt=7, min for third car: -35 +6*7= -35+42=7>0, not occupied. Safe.\n\na11=U, y12=6\n\nT=12, y=6, freeway 6: similarly, Δt=8, min third car -35+48=13>0, safe.\n\na12=U, y13=7\n\nT=13, y=7, freeway 7 always safe.\n\na13=U, y14=8\n\nT=14, y=8, safe.\n\na14=U, y15=9, done.\n\nBut we reached at y15=9, with actions from a6 to a14, 9 actions, but we had a4 and a5 before.\n\nIn this sequence, from T=6 y=0 to T=15 y=9, 9 turns.\n\nBut at T=8 and T=9, where are we?\n\nIn this path:\n\nT=8: y=2 (after a8? Let's list turns carefully.\n\nT=6: position y=0, choose a6\n\nAfter a6, y7 set to 1 (if U)\n\nT=7: y=1, choose a7=U, y8=2\n\nT=8: y=2, choose a8=U, y9=3\n\nT=9: y=3, choose a9=U, y10=4\n\n...\n\nAt T=8, y=2, not 5 or 6, safe.\n\nT=9, y=3, not 5 or 6, safe.\n\nNo problem with y=5 or 6 at T=8,9.\n\nAnd we avoided the T=6 issue by being at y=0.\n\nNow, total actions: from T=4 to T=14, that's 11 actions: a4 to a14, y15=9.\n\nH=11, since 4+H-1=14, so H=11.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nEarlier I had a4 and a5 to get to y6=0.\n\nIn the above, I used a4 and a5 both to stay or something to have y6=0.\n\nFor example, one way: a4=S, y5=0; a5=S, y6=0.\n\nThen a6=U, y7=1; a7=U, y8=2; a8=U, y9=3; a9=U, y10=4; a10=U, y11=5; a11=U, y12=6; a12=U, y13=7; a13=U, y14=8; a14=U, y15=9.\n\n11 actions.\n\nWith a4=U, y5=1; a5=D, y6=0; then same as above from a6.\n\nStill, from y6=0, need 9 ups to y15=9.\n\nBut we start from T=4, y=0.\n\nAfter a4 and a5, we are at T=6, y=0, same as start but two turns later.\n\nTo save time, perhaps we can reach a higher y earlier or something.\n\nSince at T=6 we must be at y=0, and from there we go up, but in the up path, we are at low y at T=8 and T=9, which is fine since not on y=5 or 6.\n\nBut H=11.\n\nIs it possible to reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be at higher y at T=6, but earlier we saw it's impossible to be above y=2 at T=6 from start.\n\ny6 max 2, which is occupied, so we must be at y=0 at T=6.\n\nSo we have to lose at least two turns to be at y=0 at T=6 instead of y=2.\n\nCompared to min time, we are two turns slower, H=11 instead of 9.\n\nBut min H=9 might be possible if we can avoid the collisions differently.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up faster to skip some levels, but from y=0, in two steps, max y=2, which is bad at T=6.\n\nWe could go up to y=5 quickly after T=6.\n\nBut we need to handle the later issue.\n\nAnother idea: at T=8 and T=9, avoid y=5 and y=6.\n\nSo we can be on other y at those times.\n\nFor example, at T=8, if we are on y=7 or 8, safe, or lower.\n\nSimilarly at T=9.\n\nIn the path, we can time to be on safe positions.\n\nBut we also have the T=6 constraint.\n\nFirst, we must be at y=0 at T=6.\n\nThen from T=6 y=0, we need to reach y=9.\n\nThe critical times are T=8 and T=9.\n\nAt T=8, we should not be on y=5 or y=6.\n\nSimilarly at T=9.\n\nIn the upward path, if we go up steadily, at T=8, if we start from T=6 y=0:\n\nT=6: y=0\n\na6=U, T=7: y=1\n\na7=U, T=8: y=2\n\nAt T=8, y=2, not 5 or 6, safe.\n\na8=U, T=9: y=3\n\nAt T=9, y=3, not 5 or 6, safe.\n\nThen continue to y=9 at T=15.\n\nBut at T=9, y=3, fine.\n\nTo reach faster, we need to go up faster after T=6.\n\nBut from y=0 at T=6, we can only increase one per turn, so min to y=9 is 9 turns, y at T=15.\n\nUnless we can be at higher y earlier, but no.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 before T=15, but from T=6, y=0, to y=9, it takes at least 9 actions, so turn T=15.\n\nBut we have to start from a6.\n\nActions a6 to a14 for y7 to y15=9.\n\ny15=9.\n\nNow, with a4 and a5 to get to y6=0.\n\nFor example, with a4=S, a5=S, or a4=U, a5=D, etc.\n\nIn both cases, two actions to be at y6=0.\n\nThen 9 actions to y15=9.\n\nTotal 11 actions from a4 to a14.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can avoid the y=5 and y=6 issue, but in this path we are not on them at T=8 or T=9, so fine.\n\nPerhaps we can save time by not staying but going up and down, but it still takes two actions to return to 0.\n\nFor example, a4=U, y5=1; a5=D, y6=0; then same as above.\n\nStill, from y6=0, need 9 ups.\n\na4=S, y5=0; a5=S, y6=0; then same.\n\nNo saving.\n\nBut is there a way to be at y=9 earlier? No, because we must go through the levels.\n\nUnless we can skip some, but no, y changes by at most 1.\n\nSo min H is 11.\n\nBut let's think about the later part.\n\nWe have to avoid being on y=5 or y=6 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nIn the above path, at T=8 we are at y=2, T=9 at y=3, not on 5 or 6.\n\nBut if we go faster after T=6, we might be on y=5 or 6 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nFor example, from T=6 y=0:\n\na6=U, y7=1\n\na7=U, y8=2  (T=8 y=2)\n\na8=U, y9=3  (T=9 y=3)\n\nTo be at higher y at T=8, but from y=0 at T=6, after two actions (a6 and a7), y8 can be 0,1,2.\n\nCannot be higher.\n\nSo at T=8, y8 <=2 <5, so not on y=5 or 6, automatically safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, after a8, y9 set, which can be up to 3, less than 5, so not on y=5 or 6.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus, with H=11, we can reach.\n\nBut perhaps we can start moving earlier.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 and y=8 are always safe, we can go directly to them.\n\nBut to reach them, we need to go through lower levels.\n\nFor example, at T=6 we are at y=0.\n\nInstead of going slow, we can go up, but still same.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=5 at a time when it is safe, but not at T=8 or 9.\n\nFor example, at T=10, y=5 is safe, since freeway 5 not occupied at T=10.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in the min time path, we would be at y=5 at T=9 if no delay, but we have delay.\n\nIn our case with delay, we are at y=5 later.\n\nBut H=11 seems necessary.\n\nBut let's check if we can reach with H=10.\n\nSuppose H=10, then y_{4+10}=y14=9.\n\nSo we start at T=4 y=0, after 10 actions, y14=9.\n\nNow, positions: at T=6, we must be at y=0 to avoid collision.\n\ny at T=6 must be 0.\n\nNow, from T=4 to T=6, two actions, to go from y4=0 to y6=0, so we must have actions that keep y=0 or return to 0.\n\nNet zero change in two steps.\n\nThen from T=6 y=0 to T=14 y=9, which is 8 steps? Turns: after a6, y7; ... after a13, y14.\n\nActions a6 to a13, 8 actions, from y6=0 to y14.\n\ny14 after 8 actions from y6=0.\n\nMax y with 8 actions: if all U, y14=8, but we need y14=9, impossible.\n\ny6=0, after a6, y7 <=1; after a7, y8<=2; ... after a13, y14 <= 8, since 8 actions, each +1 max, so y14 <=8 <9.\n\nCannot reach y=9 in 8 actions from y=0.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=0, min 9 actions.\n\nIn H=10, we have 10 actions: a4 to a13, y14= something.\n\ny14 = y4 + sum of Δy from t=4 to 13, 10 actions? Let's see.\n\nAt T=4, before action, y=0.\n\nAfter a4, y5 = 0 + Δy4\n\nAfter a5, y6 = y5 + Δy5\n\n...\n\nAfter a13, y14 = y13 + Δy13\n\nWe want y14 =9.\n\nThe number of actions is from a4 to a13 inclusive, that's 10 actions.\n\nThe position after k actions: after first action, y5; after second, y6; ... after tenth action, y14.\n\nFrom y4=0 to y14=9, so the sum of Δy over 10 actions must be +9.\n\nSince each Δy <=1, min number of actions is 9, but with 10 actions, we can have one S or D, but since we need +9, we must have exactly 9 U and one S, or 8 U and one D and one S, etc., but net +9 in 10 actions.\n\nBut at T=6, we need y6=0.\n\ny6 is after two actions: after a4 and a5.\n\ny6 = y4 + Δy4 + Δy5 = 0 + Δy4 + Δy5\n\nWe need y6=0, so Δy4 + Δy5 =0.\n\nSince Δy = -1,0,1, so possibilities: both 0, or +1 and -1, or -1 and +1, etc.\n\nBut since y4=0, if Δy4 = -1, y5 = max(0,0-1)=0, similarly.\n\nSo y6=0 implies that the net change from T=4 to T=6 is zero.\n\nThen for the remaining 8 actions (a6 to a13), we need to go from y6=0 to y14=9, so net +9 in 8 actions.\n\nBut each action Δy <=1, so max increase 8 in 8 actions, y14 <=8 <9, impossible.\n\nTherefore, with H=10, we cannot reach y14=9 because from y6=0 we can only get to y14<=8 with 8 actions.\n\nThus H=10 is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, H=9: actions a4 to a12, 9 actions, y13=9.\n\nBut at T=6, y6 must be 0, but with three actions: a4,a5,a6, y7 is after three actions.\n\ny6 is after two actions: a4 and a5.\n\ny6 = result after two actions from start.\n\nWith two actions, y6 can be 0,1,2 as before.\n\nTo have y6=0, but we need y13=9 with 9 actions, but y13 from y6=0 with 7 actions (a6 to a12), max y13=7<9, impossible.\n\nIf y6=1, then from y6=1 to y13=9 with 7 actions, max y13=8<9.\n\nIf y6=2, max y13=9, but y6=2 is occupied at T=6, collision.\n\nSo indeed, for H=9, we must have y6=2 to reach y13=9, but y6=2 causes collision.\n\nThus H=9 impossible.\n\nH=10 impossible as above.\n\nH=11: actions a4 to a14, 11 actions, y15=9.\n\nWith y6=0, then from y6=0 to y15=9 with 9 actions (a6 to a14), min 9 U, y15=9.\n\nAnd during the path, as we planned, no collisions.\n\nThus minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, we need a sequence.\n\nFor example, one way: stay at y=0 for first two turns.\n\na4: S\n\na5: S\n\nThen at T=6, y=0\n\nThen go up each turn:\n\na6: U, y7=1\n\nT=7, y=1, safe as before\n\na7: U, y8=2\n\nT=8, y=2, freeway 2 not occupied at T=8, safe\n\na8: U, y9=3\n\nT=9, y=3, freeway 3 not occupied at T=9, safe\n\na9: U, y10=4\n\nT=10, y=4, freeway 4 not occupied, safe\n\na10: U, y11=5\n\nT=11, y=5, freeway 5: at T=11, Δt=7, min third car -35+42=7>0, not occupied, safe\n\na11: U, y12=6\n\nT=12, y=6, freeway 6: similarly, Δt=8, min -35+48=13>0, safe\n\na12: U, y13=7\n\nT=13, y=7, freeway 7 always safe\n\na13: U, y14=8\n\nT=14, y=8, freeway 8 always safe\n\na14: U, y15=9\n\nNow, we need to output the actions from t1=4 onwards.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t1=4: a4\n\nt1+1=5: a5\n\netc.\n\nIn this case:\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nThen Turn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nBut we have up to a14, which is turn 14.\n\nH=11, actions from t=4 to t=14 inclusive, 11 actions.\n\nWe can use the go up then down at start.\n\na4: U\n\na5: D\n\nThen y5=1, y6=0\n\nThen same as above from a6: U, etc.\n\nBut in this case, at T=5, y=1, which is safe, as we saw.\n\nThen a5=D, y6=0.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut in terms of number of actions, same.\n\nNow, to minimize H, both ways same.\n\nBut perhaps we can save one action by not going down, but we have to be at y=0 at T=6.\n\nIn the go up then down, we are at y=1 at T=5, which is safe, then down to y=0 at T=6.\n\nIn the stay, we are at y=0 at T=5 and T=6.\n\nBut both require 11 actions to reach y=9.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to output.\n\nBut in the go up then down, we have an extra D action, but since we need net zero for the first two, it doesn't save.\n\nNow, another thing: we need to avoid the later collisions, but in this path, we are fine.\n\nBut earlier I thought about y=5 and y=6 at T=8 and T=9, but in this slow path, we are not there at that time.\n\nSince y=7 and 8 are safe, we could go to them faster, but from low y, it takes time.\n\nFor example, after T=6, if we could jump to y=7, but we can't.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence, let's write one.\n\nAlso, we need to make sure that when we are on freeways, no collision.\n\nIn the sequence above, with stay first:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 4: S  (y5=0)\n\nTurn 5: S  (y6=0)\n\nTurn 6: U  (y7=1)\n\nAt T=7, y=1, freeway 1: T=7, Δt=3, span [-71+72=1, -48+72=24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 7: U  (y8=2)\n\nT=8, y=2, freeway 2: span [-83+36*4= -83+144=61, -48+144=96], both >0, 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 8: U  (y9=3)\n\nT=9, y=3, freeway 3: similar, span at T=9, Δt=5, min=-83+180=97>0, safe.\n\nTurn 9: U  (y10=4)\n\nT=10, y=4, freeway 4: Δt=6, min=-83+216=133>0, safe.\n\nTurn 10: U  (y11=5)\n\nT=11, y=5, freeway 5: at T=11, Δt=7, third car span: min=-35+42=7, max=-24+42=18, both >0, 0 not in. Other cars not, so safe.\n\nTurn 11: U  (y12=6)\n\nT=12, y=6, freeway 6: similar, Δt=8, third car min=-35+48=13>0, safe.\n\nTurn 12: U  (y13=7)\n\nT=13, y=7, freeway 7: always safe.\n\nTurn 13: U  (y14=8)\n\nT=14, y=8, freeway 8: always safe.\n\nTurn 14: U  (y15=9)\n\nReached.\n\nWith the other start: a4=U, then a5=D.\n\nTurn 4: U (y5=1)\n\nAt T=5, y=1, freeway 1: T=5, Δt=1, span [-71+24= -47, -48+24= -24], both <0, 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 5: D (y6=0)\n\nThen same as above from turn 6.\n\nEither way.\n\nNow, for the output, we need the sequence for turns starting from t1=4.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be like:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 4: S Turn 5: S Turn 6: U Turn 7: U Turn 8: U Turn 9: U Turn 10: U Turn 11: U Turn 12: U Turn 13: U Turn 14: U }\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n\nSince the player reaches at turn 15, but the last action is at turn 14.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from turn 4 to turn 14.\n\nH=11.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter sequence if we go to y=9 faster, but not possible.\n\nAnother thought: since at T=8 and T=9, we need to avoid y=5 and y=6, but if we are on y=5 at T=7, for example, it might be safe.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=5 at T=11, which is safe.\n\nBut if we could be on y=5 earlier, but we are delayed by the T=6 issue.\n\nFor example, without delay, we could be on y=5 at T=9, but T=9 is occupied, so not safe.\n\nBut in our case, we avoid that.\n\nI think 11 is minimal.\n\nSo for the sequence, I'll go with the stay or the up-down.\n\nBut in the up-down, we have a down action, which might not be necessary, but it's fine.\n\nTo make it simple, let's use the stay sequence.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nIn the output, it should be for each turn.\n\nThe initial position is at turn t1=4, so we start from turn 4 action.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 4: a4, etc.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write the sequence clearly.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) is 11. This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a freeway when it is occupied at position \\(x = 0\\).\n\n### Collision Avoidance Reasoning:\n- **At turn \\(T = 6\\):** Freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3, 4\\) are occupied at \\(x = 0\\). To avoid collision, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, as \\(y = 0\\) is not a freeway) at \\(T = 6\\). This requires actions at turns 4 and 5 that result in \\(y_6 = 0\\).\n- **At turns \\(T = 8\\) and \\(T = 9\\):** Freeways \\(y = 5\\) and \\(y = 6\\) are occupied at \\(x = 0\\). The sequence ensures the player is not on \\(y = 5\\) or \\(y = 6\\) at these turns.\n- **Freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\):** Never occupied, so being on these freeways is always safe.\n- **Other turns and freeways:** Occupancy is avoided as per the car span calculations.\n\n### Sequence Justification:\n- **Turns 4 and 5 (Actions S, S):** Keep the player at \\(y = 0\\), ensuring safety at \\(T = 6\\).\n- **Turns 6 to 14 (Actions U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U):** Move the player up one unit per turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 15.\n  - At \\(T = 7\\), \\(y = 1\\): Freeway 1 not occupied (span [1, 24], 0 not in interval).\n  - At \\(T = 8\\), \\(y = 2\\): Freeway 2 not occupied (span [61, 96], 0 not in interval).\n  - At \\(T = 9\\), \\(y = 3\\): Freeway 3 not occupied (span [97, 180], 0 not in interval).\n  - At \\(T = 10\\), \\(y = 4\\): Freeway 4 not occupied (span [133, 216], 0 not in interval).\n  - At \\(T = 11\\), \\(y = 5\\): Freeway 5 not occupied (third car span [7, 18], 0 not in interval).\n  - At \\(T = 12\\), \\(y = 6\\): Freeway 6 not occupied (third car span [13, 48], 0 not in interval).\n  - At \\(T = 13\\), \\(y = 7\\): Freeway 7 always safe.\n  - At \\(T = 14\\), \\(y = 8\\): Freeway 8 always safe.\n- After action at turn 14, \\(y_{15} = 9\\), reaching the goal.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H = 11\\) turns, which is minimal, as \\(H = 9\\) or \\(H = 10\\) are impossible due to the collision constraint at \\(T = 6\\) and the need to increase \\(y\\) by 9 units.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t=6, and I start at y=0. Actions are U (up), D (down), or S (stay), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For each car, I have its head, tail, direction, and speed at turn t=6. I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car spans x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe collision condition is that at turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that same turn T. Importantly, when I move to a new row, I'm not considered on that row until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and I only enter y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nThe player position update is: at each turn, I choose an action, and y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t based on the action. But for collision, it says: collision occurs at turn T if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T at turn T. And y_T is the position at turn T, I think.\n\nReading carefully: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\ny_T is the player's y-position at turn T.\n\nWhen I perform an action at turn T, it affects y_{T+1}. So at the start of turn T, I am at y_T. I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nBut for collision, it's checked at turn T based on y_T.\n\nThe note says: if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I won't collide with cars on y_{T+1} if 0 is in span at T but not at T+1.\n\nThis means that the collision check is at the beginning of the turn or something? Let me clarify the timing.\n\nFrom the player update: y_{t+1} is set based on action at t. So at time t, position is y_t.\n\nThen, for collision at turn T: it depends on y_T, and the car spans at turn T.\n\nWhen I take action at T, it moves me to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nSo during turn T, I am at position y_T, and I might collide if on that freeway, a car covers x=0 at that time.\n\nThen, after the action, I move to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nThe note emphasizes that when I decide to move, I'm not on the new row until the next turn, so for collision on the new row, it's only checked when I'm there at that turn.\n\nFor example, if at turn T I move from y to y+1, at turn T I am on y, so collision check for y at turn T. At turn T+1, I am on y+1, so collision check for y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay, I'm on same row.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9, which is the top row, and no cars on y=9, I assume, since freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, no cars mentioned there.\n\nThe grid has y=0 to 9, but cars only on y=1 to 8.\n\nSo y=0 and y=9 are starting and ending points with no cars.\n\nI start at y=0 at turn t=6.\n\nI need to get to y=9 at some turn, say t=6+H, where after H actions, y_{6+H} =9.\n\nThe sequence is from t=6 to t=6+H-1, and after H actions, at turn t=6+H, position is (0,9).\n\nThe minimal H.\n\nNow, cars: for each freeway, I have cars with their positions at turn t=6.\n\nCars move with constant speed, left or right.\n\nFor left-moving, span moves left, for right-moving, span moves right.\n\nThe span is given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nDirection is right, so it's moving right.\n\nHead and tail: for right-moving, it says head and tail, but in the span, for right-moving, it should be [tail, head] or something? Let's see the update.\n\nFrom the car update rules:\n\nFor left-moving: span at t1 is [h, τ], and at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, decreasing x.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: span at t1 is [τ, h]? It says: for right-moving, \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but for right-moving, head and tail might be confusing.\n\nLook at freeway 5: (48, 37, right, 6), etc.\n\nFor right-moving, if head is larger, tail smaller, so span should be [tail, head] since it's moving right.\n\nIn the update, for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] where τ is tail, h is head, so tail < head.\n\nThen at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ] with h > τ? [h, τ] with h head, τ tail, but if moving left, head should be left or right?\n\nLet's see: left-moving, span [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nSince moving left, both decrease.\n\nBut [h, τ] implies h and τ, which is larger?\n\nIn the notation, it might not be ordered.\n\nIn the collision, we care about the span containing 0.\n\nFor a car, the span at time T is an interval, and we need to know if 0 is in that interval.\n\nThe direction tells us how it moves.\n\nFor each car, given (head, tail, dir, speed) at t1=6.\n\nBut head and tail, which is left or right? It doesn't specify, but from the direction, we can infer.\n\nFor right-moving, dir=right, and Span(t1) = [τ, h] with τ < h, so tail is left, head is right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, dir=left, Span(t1) = [h, τ] with h > τ, so head left, tail right.\n\nBut in the table, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), so we need to interpret based on dir.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nDir=right, so for right-moving, tail should be smaller, head larger.\n\n-48 and -71, -48 > -71, so head = -48, tail = -71, so Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-71, -48]? No.\n\nAccording to rule: for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] with τ tail, h head, and τ < h.\n\nHere, tail = -71, head = -48, so τ = -71, h = -48, so Span(t1) = [-71, -48] at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, τ] with h left, τ right, h > τ.\n\nBut in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving except possibly others.\n\nLet's list all cars at t=6.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head -48, tail -71, dir right, speed 24 → so span at t=6: [tail, head] = [-71, -48]\n\nSince dir right.\n\nFreeway 2: (-48, -83, right, 36) → tail -83, head -48, span [-83, -48]\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2? (-48, -83, right, 36) → span [-83, -48]\n\nFreeway 4: same, (-48, -83, right, 36) → span [-83, -48]\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (48, 37, right, 6), (12, 1, right, 6), (-24, -35, right, 6)\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nFirst car: head 48, tail 37? 48>37, so tail=37, head=48, span [37,48]\n\nBut tail should be smaller, yes 37<48, so [37,48]\n\nSecond car: head 12, tail 1, 12>1, tail=1, head=12, span [1,12]\n\nThird car: head -24, tail -35, -24 > -35, so tail=-35, head=-24, span [-35,-24]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5? (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6) → same spans [37,48], [1,12], [-35,-24]\n\nFreeway 7: (48,37,right,12) → head 48, tail 37, span [37,48] at t=6\n\nFreeway 8: (48,37,right,4) → [37,48] at t=6\n\nAll cars are right-moving, I think, no left-moving mentioned.\n\nDirections are all \"right\".\n\nNow, I need to find when these spans contain x=0 at various turns.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, and cars move horizontally, the key is to avoid being on a freeway row when a car on that row has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nLet t be the turn number, with t=6 current.\n\nAt any future turn T, for each freeway row, I need to know if there is a car that has 0 in its span at T.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need for each row, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., some car covers x=0.\n\nThen, I can only be on that row at times when it is safe.\n\nAnd I need to go from y=0 at t=6 to y=9 at some t, with actions changing y.\n\ny starts at 0 at t=6.\n\nAfter each action, y changes.\n\nLet me define the time from current: let τ = T - t1, so τ=0 at current turn t=6.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some τ=H, after H turns, so at time τ=H, position y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from τ=0 to τ=H-1.\n\nNow, for each freeway k=1 to 8, I need the set of τ where the row is unsafe, i.e., some car on that row has span containing 0 at time τ (since t1=6, T=t1 + τ, so ΔT=τ).\n\nFor a car with span at t1: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + sτ, h + sτ] where s is speed, τ is time since t1.\n\nSet ΔT = τ.\n\nFor a right-moving car, span at time T = t1 + τ is [τ_t1 + s τ, h_t1 + s τ]\n\nWhere τ_t1 and h_t1 are tail and head at t1.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, but all are right-moving.\n\nSo in general, span at τ is [tail_0 + s τ, head_0 + s τ] for right-moving car.\n\n0 is in span if tail_0 + s τ ≤ 0 ≤ head_0 + s τ\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but no left.\n\nSo for each car, the times τ when it covers 0.\n\nThen for each row, since multiple cars, unsafe if any car on that row covers 0 at τ.\n\nNow, for each row, list the cars:\n\nRow 1: one car: tail_0 = -71, head_0 = -48, s=24\n\nSo span at τ: [-71 + 24τ, -48 + 24τ]\n\n0 in span if -71 + 24τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 24τ\n\nWhich is:\n\n-71 + 24τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 24τ ≤ 71 ⇒ τ ≤ 71/24 ≈ 2.958\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -48 + 24τ ⇒ 48 ≤ 24τ ⇒ τ ≥ 48/24 = 2\n\nSo for τ in [2, 2.958] approximately, but τ integer since turns are discrete.\n\nτ is turn offset, integer.\n\nSo τ ≥ 2 and τ ≤ 2.958, so τ=2 and τ=3? τ=2: -71 + 24*2 = -71 + 48 = -23 ≤ 0, and -48 + 48 = 0 ≤ 0? 0 ≤ 0 is true.\n\n-48 + 24τ at τ=2: -48 + 48 =0, so 0 ≤ 0 true.\n\nAt τ=3: -71 + 72 =1? -71 + 24*3 = -71 + 72 =1, and 1 ≤ 0? No.\n\n0 ≤ -48 + 72 =24, true, but -71+72=1 ≤0? 1 ≤0 false.\n\nSo only when both inequalities:\n\n-71 +24τ ≤0 and 0 ≤ -48 +24τ\n\nAt τ=2: -71+48= -23 ≤0 true, 0 ≤ -48+48=0 true.\n\nAt τ=3: -71+72=1 ≤0? 1≤0 false, so not satisfied.\n\nτ=1: -71+24= -47 ≤0 true, 0 ≤ -48+24= -24? 0≤-24 false.\n\nSo only at τ=2, for this car.\n\nSimilarly, row 2: car with tail=-83, head=-48, s=36\n\nSpan: [-83 +36τ, -48 +36τ]\n\n0 in: -83+36τ ≤0 and 0≤ -48+36τ\n\nFirst: -83+36τ ≤0 ⇒ 36τ ≤83 ⇒ τ ≤ 83/36 ≈2.305\n\nSecond: 0≤ -48+36τ ⇒ 48≤36τ ⇒ τ ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333\n\nSo τ from 1.333 to 2.305, so integer τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2: -83+72= -11 ≤0 true, 0≤ -48+72=24 true.\n\nAt τ=1: -83+36= -47≤0 true, but 0≤ -48+36= -12? 0≤-12 false.\n\nτ=3: -83+108=25≤0? false.\n\nSo only τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, row 3: same as row 2, car (-48,-83,right,36) same, so only unsafe at τ=2.\n\nRow 4: same, only τ=2.\n\nNow row 5: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6) → tail=37, head=48, s=6\n\nSpan: [37+6τ, 48+6τ]\n\n0 in: 37+6τ ≤0 and 0≤48+6τ\n\nBut 37+6τ ≤0? Since τ≥0, 37+6τ ≥37>0, so never ≤0. Thus 0 never in span. This car is always to the right, never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,6) → tail=1, head=12, s=6\n\nSpan: [1+6τ, 12+6τ]\n\n0 in: 1+6τ ≤0 and 0≤12+6τ\n\n1+6τ ≤0 ⇒ 6τ≤-1, impossible since τ≥0. So never unsafe.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,6) → tail=-35, head=-24, s=6\n\nSpan: [-35+6τ, -24+6τ]\n\n0 in: -35+6τ ≤0 and 0≤ -24+6τ\n\nFirst: -35+6τ ≤0 ⇒ 6τ ≤35 ⇒ τ ≤ 35/6 ≈5.833\n\nSecond: 0≤ -24+6τ ⇒ 24≤6τ ⇒ τ ≥4\n\nSo τ from 4 to 5.833, so τ=4,5.\n\nAt τ=4: -35+24= -11≤0 true, 0≤ -24+24=0 true.\n\nAt τ=5: -35+30= -5≤0 true, 0≤ -24+30=6 true.\n\nAt τ=6: -35+36=1≤0? false.\n\nSo unsafe at τ=4 and τ=5.\n\nNow, row 5 has multiple cars, but only this third car can cover 0, at τ=4 and 5.\n\nThe other cars don't cover 0 ever.\n\nSimilarly, row 6: same as row 5, cars (48,37,right,6) never covers 0, (12,1,right,6) never, (-24,-35,right,6) covers at τ=4,5.\n\nSo row 6 unsafe at τ=4,5.\n\nNow row 7: one car (48,37,right,12) → tail=37, head=48, s=12\n\nSpan: [37+12τ, 48+12τ]\n\n0 in: 37+12τ ≤0? impossible, always positive, so never unsafe.\n\nRow 8: one car (48,37,right,4) → tail=37, head=48, s=4\n\nSpan: [37+4τ, 48+4τ]\n\nSimilarly, always positive, never covers 0.\n\nSo summary of unsafe times for each row:\n\nRow 1: unsafe at τ=2\n\nRow 2: unsafe at τ=2\n\nRow 3: unsafe at τ=2\n\nRow 4: unsafe at τ=2\n\nRow 5: unsafe at τ=4 and τ=5\n\nRow 6: unsafe at τ=4 and τ=5\n\nRow 7: always safe (no car covers 0)\n\nRow 8: always safe\n\nRows 7 and 8 are always safe, since no car ever covers x=0.\n\nRow 7 has a car, but it starts at x=37 to 48, moving right, so x increasing, never reaches left to 0.\n\nSimilarly row 8.\n\nNow, y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nI start at y=0 at τ=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some τ=H.\n\nActions: U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, 0.\n\ny must be integer 0 to 9.\n\nTo minimize H, I probably want to go up as fast as possible, but need to avoid unsafe rows at unsafe times.\n\nSince rows 1-4 are only unsafe at τ=2, and rows 5-6 unsafe at τ=4,5.\n\nAnd rows 7-8 always safe.\n\nAlso, y=0 safe, y=9 safe.\n\nNow, at τ=0, I am at y=0.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of moves: since I need to increase y by 9, with actions U (+1), I could do it in 9 moves, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nBut since there are safe paths, I might do it fast.\n\nH is the number of actions, so from τ=0 to τ=H, after H actions, at time τ=H, y=9.\n\nAt each step, I choose action.\n\nThe position y_τ at time τ.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0.\n\nAfter action at τ=0, y_1 is set, and so on.\n\nCollision at time τ if y_τ is between 1 and 8 and that row is unsafe at τ.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, y=0, which is safe.\n\nI can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go up, to y=1 at next time, but at τ=0, I am on y=0.\n\nLet me denote the state.\n\nAt time τ (offset), position y_τ.\n\nAction a_τ determines y_{τ+1}.\n\nCollision at τ if 1≤ y_τ ≤8 and row y_τ is unsafe at time τ.\n\nFor τ=0: y=0, not on freeway, so no collision.\n\nNow, I need to ensure that for all τ, when y_τ is between 1 and 8, it is safe at that τ.\n\nAnd finally at some τ=H, y_τ=9.\n\nNow, unsafe times:\n\nRow 1: unsafe only τ=2\n\nRow 2: unsafe τ=2\n\nRow 3: unsafe τ=2\n\nRow 4: unsafe τ=2\n\nRow 5: unsafe τ=4 and 5\n\nRow 6: unsafe τ=4 and 5\n\nRow 7: safe all τ\n\nRow 8: safe all τ\n\nSince rows 1-4 all unsafe only at τ=2, I need to not be on rows 1-4 at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, not on rows 5-6 at τ=4 and τ=5.\n\nRows 7-8 always safe.\n\nNow, I start at y=0, τ=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal H: if I go up every time, I can reach y=9 in 9 steps: at τ=0, y=0; after U, τ=1, y=1; after U, τ=2, y=2; but at τ=2, if y=2, row 2 is unsafe at τ=2, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I am on any row 1-4 at τ=2, collision.\n\nSo I need to not be on rows 1-4 at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=4 and 5, not on rows 5 or 6.\n\nNow, τ=2 is a critical point.\n\nAt τ=2, I must be on y=0 or y=5 or above, since rows 1-4 unsafe.\n\ny=5 is row 5, but row 5 unsafe at τ=4 and 5, not at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, row 5 is safe, since unsafe only at τ=4,5.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 safe at τ=2.\n\nSo at τ=2, I can be on y=0, or y=5,6,7,8, or y=9 but y=9 is goal.\n\ny=5 and above except rows 5-6 at τ=4,5, but at τ=2 it's ok.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is safe.\n\nNow, I start at τ=0, y=0.\n\nI need to choose actions to avoid being on low rows at τ=2.\n\nOne way: I can go up to a safe row before τ=2.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, I am at y=0.\n\nI can choose S: stay, then at τ=1, y=1? Action at τ=0: if I choose S, y_{1} = y_0 + 0 =0, so at τ=1, y=0.\n\nIf I choose U, y_{1} =1.\n\nIf D, y_{1}= -1, but y must be >=0, so D from y=0: y_{1} = max(0, y_t -1) or something? The update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=0 and choose D, y_{t+1} = 0 -1 = -1, but must be in [0,9], so I think it should be clamped, but not specified.\n\nLook back: \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\", so probably, if action would make it out, it stays at boundary.\n\nSimilarly for y=9 and U.\n\nSo, from y=0, D: y_{t+1} =0, since can't go below.\n\nSimilarly, from y=9, U: y_{t+1}=9.\n\nIn this case, at y=0, D or S both keep y=0.\n\nU moves to y=1.\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nNow, back to path.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0.\n\nI need to be not on rows 1-4 at τ=2.\n\nPossible positions at τ=2:\n\n- If I stay at y=0: for example, choose S or D at τ=0 and τ=1.\n\n- Or go up to higher rows.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9, so I might want to go up.\n\nNow, at τ=2, I must be on y=0 or y>=5.\n\ny=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nNow, from τ=0, I can go up.\n\nFor example, if I go U at τ=0, then at τ=1, y=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, if I go U, at τ=2, y=2, but y=2 at τ=2 is row 2, unsafe.\n\nIf at τ=1, y=1, I can go S or D, but D to y=0, or S to y=1.\n\nIf I go D at τ=1, from y=1, y_{2} =1-1=0.\n\nOr S, y_{2}=1.\n\nBut at τ=2, if y=1, row 1 unsafe at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is safe.\n\nSo at τ=1, if y=1, I must go to y=0 at τ=2, by choosing D.\n\nIf I choose S, y=1 at τ=2, collision.\n\nIf U, y=2 at τ=2, collision.\n\nSo only choice is D to y=0.\n\nBut that means I waste moves.\n\nI could go up faster or slower.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=5 or above by τ=2.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0.\n\nIf I go U at τ=0, to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=1, I need to go up, but to reach y=5 by τ=2, I need to increase by 4 in one step, impossible, since max +1 per step.\n\nFrom y=1 at τ=1, I can only go to y=0,1,2 at τ=2.\n\nBut y=1 and 2 unsafe at τ=2, so must go to y=0.\n\nThus, if I go to y=1 at τ=1, I have to go back to y=0 at τ=2.\n\nThen I am at y=0, τ=2, safe.\n\nBut I wasted two moves to go up and down, back to start.\n\nAt τ=0, I could stay at y=0.\n\nChoose S at τ=0, then at τ=1, y=0.\n\nThen at τ=1, I can choose S again, to y=0 at τ=2.\n\nOr choose U, to y=1 at τ=2, but y=1 at τ=2 unsafe.\n\nSo only S or D to stay at y=0.\n\nSo to avoid collision at τ=2, I must be at y=0 at τ=2.\n\nBecause if I am on any row 1-4 at τ=2, collision, and I cannot reach row 5 or above by τ=2 from y=0 in two steps? From τ=0 to τ=2, two actions.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0.\n\nAfter first action, at τ=1, y can be 0 or 1.\n\nIf y=0 at τ=1, after second action, y at τ=2 can be 0 or 1.\n\nIf y=1 at τ=1, after second action, y at τ=2 can be 0,1,2.\n\nBut all positions at τ=2 except y=0 are unsafe if on row 1-4, but since y=1,2,3,4 are all rows 1-4, and all unsafe at τ=2, so only y=0 is safe at τ=2.\n\ny=5 and above are safe at τ=2, but I cannot reach them by τ=2.\n\nMax I can be is, if I go U U: at τ=1 y=1, τ=2 y=2, which is unsafe.\n\nCannot reach y=3 or higher.\n\nSo indeed, at τ=2, I must be at y=0 to be safe.\n\nNo choice.\n\nSo at τ=2, y=2 must be 0.\n\nNow, after that, I need to go up.\n\nBut now, at τ=4 and 5, rows 5 and 6 are unsafe.\n\nSo I need to not be on row 5 or 6 at τ=4 and τ=5.\n\nNow, at τ=2, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe critical times are τ=4 and 5 for rows 5-6.\n\nI can be on other rows.\n\nAlso, rows 7-8 always safe.\n\nNow, from τ=2, y=0.\n\nI need to go up.\n\nBut I have to avoid rows 5-6 at τ=4 and 5.\n\nτ=4 and 5 are specific times.\n\nLet me plan the path from τ=2 onwards.\n\nAt τ=2, y=0.\n\nI can choose actions.\n\nIf I go U, at τ=3, y=1.\n\nThen at τ=3, I can go U again, to y=2 at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=4, if on row 5 or 6, unsafe, but y=2 is row 2, which is not row 5 or 6, and row 2 is safe at τ=4, since unsafe only at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, row 5-6 unsafe at τ=4,5, but row 2 is fine.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nAt τ=4, y=2.\n\nThen I can continue up.\n\nBut row 5-6 unsafe at τ=4 and 5, so when I reach row 5 or 6, I need to not be there at τ=4 or 5.\n\nNow, times: τ=4 and τ=5.\n\nAt τ=2, y=0.\n\nIf I go U at τ=2, to y=1 at τ=3.\n\nThen U at τ=3, to y=2 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=2, which is row 2, safe.\n\nThen at τ=4, I can go U to y=3 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5, y=3, row 3, which is safe at τ=5, since unsafe only at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=5, I can go U to y=4 at τ=6.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I need to pass rows 5 and 6.\n\nRows 5 and 6 are unsafe only at τ=4 and 5, but at later times, they are safe.\n\nFor example, at τ=6, row 5 is safe, since unsafe only τ=4,5.\n\nSimilarly row 6.\n\nSo in this path, at τ=4, I am at y=2, not on row 5-6.\n\nAt τ=5, y=3, not on row 5-6.\n\nThen at τ=6, I can be at y=4, say.\n\nThen go to y=5 at τ=7, which is after τ=5, so row 5 safe at τ=7.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nLet's see the sequence.\n\nStart: τ=0, y=0\n\nTo avoid τ=2 issue, we must have at τ=2, y=0.\n\nSo for τ=0 and τ=1, we need to be at y=0 at τ=2.\n\nOptions:\n\n- At τ=0, choose S or D, so y at τ=1 =0\n\n- At τ=1, choose S or D, so y at τ=2 =0\n\nSo for example:\n\nAction at τ=0: S (or D), then at τ=1, y=0\n\nAction at τ=1: S (or D), then at τ=2, y=0\n\nNow from τ=2, y=0\n\nNow go up:\n\nAction at τ=2: U, then at τ=3, y=1\n\nAction at τ=3: U, then at τ=4, y=2\n\nAt τ=4, y=2, safe (row 2 safe at τ=4)\n\nAction at τ=4: U, then at τ=5, y=3\n\nAt τ=5, y=3, safe (row 3 safe)\n\nAction at τ=5: U, then at τ=6, y=4\n\nAction at τ=6: U, then at τ=7, y=5\n\nNow at τ=7, y=5, row 5.\n\nIs row 5 safe at τ=7? Unsafe only at τ=4,5, τ=7>5, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, action at τ=7: U, then τ=8, y=6\n\nRow 6 at τ=8, unsafe at τ=4,5, so τ=8 safe.\n\nAction at τ=8: U, τ=9, y=7\n\nAction at τ=9: U, τ=10, y=8\n\nAction at τ=10: U, τ=11, y=9\n\nNow at τ=11, y=9, reached.\n\nBut is this minimal? H=11 actions? τ from 0 to 10 actions, at τ=11 position.\n\nNumber of actions: from τ=0 to τ=10, 11 actions? Let's see.\n\nAt time τ=0, position y=0.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at start.\n\nAfter first action at τ=0, position at τ=1.\n\nAfter k actions, position at τ=k.\n\nTo have position at τ=H be y=9, I need H actions from τ=0 to τ=H-1.\n\nIn this case, at τ=11, y=9, so H=11 actions: τ=0 to 10.\n\nBut I think I can do better.\n\nSince rows 7 and 8 are always safe, I could go directly to them faster, but I have to pass through lower rows.\n\nAnother way: after τ=2, y=0, I could go up faster or avoid the τ=4,5 issue differently.\n\nBut in the above, I am not affected by τ=4,5 because I am below row 5 at that time.\n\nNow, can I reach y=9 faster?\n\nFor example, if I could be at higher y earlier.\n\nBut at τ=2, I must be at y=0, so I lose time.\n\nFrom τ=0 to τ=2, I have to stay at y=0, no progress.\n\nThen from y=0 at τ=2, I need 9 steps to reach y=9, so minimum H=11 if I go directly up.\n\nBut perhaps I can go to row 7 or 8 earlier, but I have to go through rows.\n\nSince rows 7 and 8 are safe, I could go up to row 7 quickly after τ=2.\n\nBut from y=0, it takes multiple steps.\n\nFor example, at τ=2, y=0.\n\nIf I go U every time: τ=3 y=1, τ=4 y=2, τ=5 y=3, τ=6 y=4, τ=7 y=5, τ=8 y=6, τ=9 y=7, τ=10 y=8, τ=11 y=9. Same as before.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=2, safe; τ=5, y=3, safe, as before.\n\nI could stay at some point, but that would make H larger.\n\nOr go down, but worse.\n\nAnother idea: to avoid rows 5-6 at τ=4,5, I could be above them or below.\n\nBut at τ=4,5, I could be on row 7 or 8.\n\nFor example, at τ=4, if I am on y=7 or 8.\n\nBut from τ=2, y=0, at τ=4 is two steps later.\n\nAt τ=2, y=0.\n\nAfter action at τ=2: U, τ=3 y=1\n\nAction at τ=3: U, τ=4 y=2 — y=2, not 7.\n\nCannot reach high in two steps.\n\nSo impossible to be on row 7 or 8 at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=5, from τ=2, three steps: τ=2 y=0, τ=3 y=1, τ=4 y=2, τ=5 y=3 — y=3, not 7.\n\nSo I cannot be above row 4 at τ=4 or 5 with this start.\n\nBut rows 5-6 are unsafe, but I can be below, like in the path.\n\nI could delay going up or something.\n\nBut in the above path, it works, H=11.\n\nBut perhaps I can start going up later or something, but I need to reach y=9.\n\nSince rows 7-8 are always safe, I might go directly to them after τ=2.\n\nBut still need to pass lower rows.\n\nAnother thought: at τ=4 and 5, I need to not be on row 5 or 6.\n\nI could be on row 5 or 6 at other times.\n\nIn the above, I pass row 5 at τ=7, which is safe.\n\nBut can I pass earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be on row 5 at τ=3 or τ=6, etc.\n\nBut from τ=2 y=0, at τ=3 I can be y=1, not 5.\n\nSo earliest to reach row 5 is τ=7, as above.\n\nτ=2 y=0, after U at τ=2, τ=3 y=1; U at τ=3, τ=4 y=2; U at τ=4, τ=5 y=3; U at τ=5, τ=6 y=4; U at τ=6, τ=7 y=5. Yes, τ=7.\n\nSimilarly for row 6 at τ=8.\n\nNow, but I have to go to y=9.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster to higher rows by not staying low, but I have to.\n\nAnother idea: since I have to be at y=0 at τ=2, what if I go up before τ=2 to a safe row, but I cannot reach safe rows above by τ=2.\n\nUnless I start from y=0 earlier.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0.\n\nIf I go U at τ=0, to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=1, I must go D to y=0 at τ=2, as we said.\n\nBut at τ=1, if I could go to a high row, but I can't.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I can be on row 5 at τ=2, but impossible.\n\nSo I think H=11 is necessary with this constraint.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can skip some rows or something.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to y=0 at τ=2, then up, but same.\n\nOr, another path: after τ=2, I go up slower or faster, but I think 11 is min.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach y=9 earlier by going to safe rows.\n\nFor example, rows 7 and 8 are always safe, so if I can reach row 7 quickly, then I can stay or go up.\n\nBut from y=0 at τ=2, to row 7, I need 7 steps: τ=3 y=1, τ=4 y=2, ..., τ=8 y=6, τ=9 y=7.\n\nThen from y=7, to y=9, two more steps: τ=10 y=8, τ=11 y=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf I reach y=7 at τ=9, then U to y=8 at τ=10, U to y=9 at τ=11.\n\nBut in the first path, I reached y=9 at τ=11 also.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 earlier if I don't have the τ=2 constraint.\n\nBut I do.\n\nUnless I can be at y=5 or above at τ=2, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps for the τ=4,5 issue, I can be on row 4 or something at τ=4, but row 4 is safe except at τ=2.\n\nRow 4 unsafe only at τ=2, so at τ=4, safe.\n\nIn the first path, I was at y=2 at τ=4, which is fine.\n\nBut can I be higher at τ=4?\n\nFor example, if at τ=2 y=0, after two actions, at τ=4 y= max 2 if U U.\n\ny=2.\n\nCannot be higher.\n\nSo y=2 at τ=4 is the highest possible.\n\nThen at τ=5, y=3 if I go U.\n\ny=3 at τ=5, safe.\n\nThen continue.\n\nSo I think H=11 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's see the answer format; I need to output the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, τ=0 to τ=10 actions.\n\nNow, for the cars, I think I covered all.\n\nBut row 5 and 6 have multiple cars, but only the one car affects, and I avoided the unsafe times.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, at τ=4 and τ=5, I am at y=2 and y=3, which are rows 2 and 3, safe at that time.\n\nThen I go up to y=5 at τ=7, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, but I need to write the actions for turns starting from t=6.\n\nCurrent turn t=6 is τ=0.\n\nSo actions at t=6 + τ for τ=0 to 10.\n\nIn the answer, it should be Turn t: a_t for t from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=6, H=11 actions? After 11 actions, at time t=6+11=17, position y=9.\n\nNumber of turns: from t=6 to t=16, actions at t=6 to 16, 11 actions, position at t=17 is (0,9).\n\nt=17 is the turn when position is y=9 after the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=6 to t=16 inclusive.\n\nNow, let's list the actions.\n\nFirst, to stay at y=0 until τ=2.\n\nAt τ=0 (t=6): since y=0, to stay, I can choose S or D.\n\nSimilarly at τ=1 (t=7).\n\nThen at τ=2 (t=8), go U.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn t=6: action, let's say S (stay)\n\nThen at t=7 (τ=1): S or D, say S\n\nThen at t=7, position y=0? After action at t=6: if S, y_{7} = y_6 + 0 =0, so at t=7, y=0.\n\nSimilarly, action at t=7: if S, y_{8} =0, so at t=8, y=0.\n\nThen action at t=8: U, so y_{9} =0 +1 =1, so at t=9, y=1.\n\nt=8 is τ=2? t=6 is τ=0, t=7 τ=1, t=8 τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, t=8, position y=0.\n\nAction at t=8: U, so y_{t+1} for t=8, y_9 = y8 +1 =0+1=1, so at t=9, y=1.\n\nThen action at t=9 (τ=3): U, so y_{10} =1+1=2, at t=10, y=2.\n\nThen action at t=10 (τ=4): U, so y_{11} =2+1=3, at t=11, y=3.\n\nAction at t=11 (τ=5): U, so y_{12} =3+1=4, at t=12, y=4.\n\nAction at t=12 (τ=6): U, so y_{13} =4+1=5, at t=13, y=5.\n\nNow at t=13, τ=7, y=5, row 5, safe.\n\nAction at t=13: U, so y_{14} =5+1=6, at t=14, y=6.\n\nAction at t=14: U, so y_{15} =6+1=7, at t=15, y=7.\n\nAction at t=15: U, so y_{16} =7+1=8, at t=16, y=8.\n\nAction at t=16: U, so y_{17} =8+1=9, at t=17, y=9.\n\nNow, H=11 actions, from t=6 to t=16.\n\nBut at t=17, position is (0,9), reached.\n\nNow, is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose I try to go up immediately but avoid row 5-6 at τ=4,5.\n\nBut at τ=4, if I am on y=5 or 6, unsafe, but I cannot be there that early.\n\nIf I stay at y=0 longer, but that delays reaching y=9.\n\nFor example, at τ=2, y=0, but instead of going up, I stay, then at τ=3, y=0, then go up.\n\nBut then I reach later.\n\nFor example, at τ=3, y=0, then U to y=1 at τ=4, etc., but at τ=4, y=1, safe, but I start later, so reach y=9 later, say at τ=12 or something, worse.\n\nGo down, but y=0 min.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I can be on row 7 or 8 at τ=4, but impossible from y=0 at τ=2.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's double-check the unsafe times.\n\nFor row 5, unsafe at τ=4 and τ=5.\n\nτ=4: from t=6, T= t1 + τ =6 +4=10\n\nAt T=10, if on row 5, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly τ=5, T=11.\n\nIn the path, at T=10, t=10, which is τ=4, y=2, not row 5.\n\nAt T=11, τ=5, y=3, not row 5.\n\nThen at T=13, τ=7, y=5, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, but rows 7 and 8 are always safe, so if I can reach them faster, but I cannot from here.\n\nAnother thought: at τ=0, instead of staying, I go up to y=1 at τ=1, then at τ=1, I go down to y=0 at τ=2, same as staying.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, for the actions, I used S at first, but D would be same since y=0.\n\nIn the sequence, I can use S or D, but S is better, no move.\n\nIn answer, probably use S.\n\nNow, write the sequence.\n\nActions from t=6 to t=16.\n\nt=6: S\n\nt=7: S\n\nt=8: U\n\nt=9: U\n\nt=10: U\n\nt=11: U\n\nt=12: U\n\nt=13: U\n\nt=14: U\n\nt=15: U\n\nt=16: U\n\nAfter t=16 action, y=9 at t=17.\n\nBut H=11 turns.\n\nBut let's see if I can reduce by one.\n\nFor example, if I go U at t=7 or something.\n\nAt t=6, τ=0, y=0.\n\nIf I go U at t=6, then at t=7, y=1 (τ=1).\n\nThen at t=7, I must go D to avoid being at y=1 at τ=2 (t=8).\n\nAction at t=7: D, so y_{8} =1-1=0, at t=8, y=0.\n\nSame as before, but I used one U and one D, same as two S.\n\nThen from t=8, same as before.\n\nSo sequence: t=6: U, t=7: D, t=8: U, etc.\n\nBut then at t=13 to t=16 same, but I have U and D instead of S, same number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, from y=0 at t=8, go U to t=9 y=1, t=10 y=2, t=11 y=3, t=12 y=4, t=13 y=5, t=14 y=6, t=15 y=7, t=16 y=8, then need t=17: U to y=9 at t=18.\n\nAfter action at t=16: y=8, to y=9 at t=17? Action at t=16: U, y_{17} =9.\n\nt=16 action, y at t=17 is 9.\n\nIn this case, if I start with U at t=6 and D at t=7, at t=8 y=0.\n\nThen t=8: U, t=9 y=1\n\nt=9: U, t=10 y=2\n\nt=10: U, t=11 y=3\n\nt=11: U, t=12 y=4\n\nt=12: U, t=13 y=5\n\nt=13: U, t=14 y=6\n\nt=14: U, t=15 y=7\n\nt=15: U, t=16 y=8\n\nt=16: U, t=17 y=9\n\nSame as before, 11 actions from t=6 to t=16.\n\nIf I use S S, same.\n\nNo saving.\n\nPerhaps I can skip waiting at some point.\n\nFor example, after reaching y=4, I can go directly to y=7 or something, but no, must go step by step.\n\nSo I think 11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on row 5 and 6.\n\nRow 5 unsafe at τ=4 and 5, which is t=10 and t=11.\n\nIn the path, at t=10, y=2; t=11, y=3; both safe.\n\nThen at t=13, y=5, which is after, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=9 faster by using rows 7-8 earlier, but I need to pass through.\n\nAnother idea: since rows 7 and 8 are safe, I could go up to y=8 and stay, but I need to reach y=9.\n\nBut staying doesn't help.\n\nGo to y=9 directly.\n\nBut I have to go through y=8.\n\nNo shortcut.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, for the first two actions, I used S, but I can use D or S, but S is better.\n\nSimilarly, in the output, probably use S for stay.\n\nNow, write in the box.\n\nBut the turn starts from t=6.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for freeway 5 and 6, there are three cars, but only one affects, but I think I considered.\n\nNow, about the direction: all cars are right-moving, so I think correct.\n\nSo the minimal H is 11.\n\nSequence of actions:\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nAfter Turn 16 action, position at turn 17 is (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=6 to t=16.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t: a_t for each turn.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write it.\n\nPerhaps I can start with U and then D, but same H.\n\nI think S is fine.\n\nNow, in the output, it should be like:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 6: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so for t=6 to 16.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10?\n\nSuppose I reach y=9 at τ=10.\n\nThen at τ=10, y=9.\n\nBut from τ=0 y=0, in 10 steps, I need to increase by 9, so must have 9 U and one S or something, but with one S, I increase by 8 in 10 steps, y=8 at τ=10, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 in H actions, I need exactly 9 U and possibly S or D, but D would decrease, so I need at least 9 U, and if I have S, it takes more actions.\n\nMinimal actions: 9 U, no S or D, but in this case, I cannot because of collisions.\n\nWith 9 U, I can reach in 9 actions, but here I need two extra actions to stay at y=0 at τ=2.\n\nIn those two actions, I used S, so no U, so I need two more U later.\n\nIn 11 actions, I have 9 U and 2 S, to reach y=9.\n\nIf I could have 9 U in fewer, but I cannot because I must not move up during τ=0 and τ=1 effectively, or move up and down, but same.\n\nFor example, if I go U at τ=0 and D at τ=1, I have one U and one D, net zero, then 9 U, total 11 actions.\n\nSame as 2 S and 9 U.\n\nNo way with 10 actions.\n\nIf I use D somewhere, worse.\n\nSo H=11 is minimal.\n\nThus the sequence.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) is 11, with actions taken from turn 6 to turn 16. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on rows 1-4 at \\(\\tau = 2\\) (turn 8) and not on rows 5-6 at \\(\\tau = 4\\) and \\(\\tau = 5\\) (turns 10 and 11), where \\(\\tau = T - t_1\\) is the time offset from turn 6.\n\n- At \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn 6), the player is at \\(y = 0\\) (safe). Staying (S) keeps the player at \\(y = 0\\) for the next turn.\n- At \\(\\tau = 1\\) (turn 7), staying (S) again keeps the player at \\(y = 0\\).\n- At \\(\\tau = 2\\) (turn 8), the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) to avoid rows 1-4, which are unsafe at this time. Moving up (U) to \\(y = 1\\).\n- From \\(\\tau = 3\\) to \\(\\tau = 6\\) (turns 9 to 12), moving up (U) each turn progresses to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 10 (\\(\\tau = 4\\)) and \\(y = 3\\) at turn 11 (\\(\\tau = 5\\)), avoiding rows 5-6 which are unsafe at these times.\n- At \\(\\tau = 7\\) (turn 13), reaching \\(y = 5\\) is safe since row 5 is only unsafe at \\(\\tau = 4\\) and \\(\\tau = 5\\).\n- Continuing up (U) each turn reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 17 after the action at turn 16.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n- Turn 6: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\))\n- Turn 7: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\))\n- Turn 8: U (move to \\(y = 1\\))\n- Turn 9: U (move to \\(y = 2\\))\n- Turn 10: U (move to \\(y = 3\\))\n- Turn 11: U (move to \\(y = 4\\))\n- Turn 12: U (move to \\(y = 5\\))\n- Turn 13: U (move to \\(y = 6\\))\n- Turn 14: U (move to \\(y = 7\\))\n- Turn 15: U (move to \\(y = 8\\))\n- Turn 16: U (move to \\(y = 9\\))\n\nThis sequence ensures no collision:\n- At turn 8 (\\(\\tau = 2\\)), \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not on freeway).\n- At turn 10 (\\(\\tau = 4\\)), \\(y = 2\\) (row 2 safe at \\(\\tau = 4\\) since unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 2\\)).\n- At turn 11 (\\(\\tau = 5\\)), \\(y = 3\\) (row 3 safe at \\(\\tau = 5\\) since unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 2\\)).\n- Rows 5 and 6 are avoided at turns 10 and 11, and when reached at turns 13 and 14, they are safe.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 6: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 8, and I'm at y=0.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For each freeway, there are cars with positions given at turn t_1=8. Since the cars move at constant speed, I can find their positions at any future turn T by using the update rules.\n\nThe collision condition is that at turn T, if I'm on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn, then I collide. Also, when I move, I'm not on the new row until the next turn, so I only care about the row I'm currently on for collision.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=8 for simplicity. I need to find actions for t=8,9,10,... up to when I reach y=9.\n\ny starts at 0, and I need to get to 9, so I must move up. But I have to avoid the freeways when cars are covering x=0.\n\nThe grid is 2D, but I only move vertically; horizontally, I'm fixed at x=0. The cars move horizontally on their freeways.\n\nFor each freeway y from 1 to 8, I need to check when a car covers x=0 at turn T.\n\nThe car positions are given at t=8.\n\nFor a left-moving car: span at t=8 is [h, τ], so at time T, span is [h - s(T-8), τ - s(T-8)]\n\nSince it's left-moving, I assume h > τ or something? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nBut for left-moving, if it's moving left, the head should be decreasing, so probably h is the right end? I think there might be confusion in notation.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nThis is messy. Let me interpret.\n\nFor right-moving: at t_1, span is [τ, h], meaning from left to right, τ to h, with τ < h. Then at T, it moves right, so [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: span at t_1 is [h, τ], but if it's moving left, probably h is the right end, τ left end? But [h, τ] with h and τ, it might be that h > τ or h < τ.\n\nIn the left-moving case, it says [h, τ] and then [h - s dt, τ - s dt], so if it's moving left, the coordinates decrease, so h should be the larger coordinate, τ smaller. But in the span [h, τ], if h > τ, it's from τ to h, but written as [h, τ] which is unusual; usually we write min to max.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nI think it's better to think in terms of the min and max of the span.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, for freeway k, if there is a car such that 0 is between the min and max of its span at that turn.\n\nLet me define for each car, the position of the front and back.\n\nBut the direction is given.\n\nLet me list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nBut direction is right, but the numbers: h = -48, τ = -71? -48 > -71, so if it's right-moving, the span should be [τ, h] with τ < h? But here τ = -71, h = -48, so τ < h, and direction right.\n\nIn the table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nSince direction is right, and τ = -71, h = -48, so at t=8, span from τ to h: -71 to -48.\n\nThen at time T, since right-moving, span is [τ + s(T-8), h + s(T-8)] = [-71 + 24(T-8), -48 + 24(T-8)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be different.\n\nBut here all cars seem to be right-moving except possibly others.\n\nFreeway 1: right-moving, so at T, span [ -71 + 24(T-8), -48 + 24(T-8) ]\n\n0 is in span if min <= 0 <= max, so -71 + 24(T-8) <= 0 <= -48 + 24(T-8)\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nI need to find for each freeway, when 0 is covered by a car at turn T.\n\nAlso, multiple cars on some freeways.\n\nLet me list all freeways and their cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nSo span at T: [ -71 + 24(T-8), -48 + 24(T-8) ]\n\n0 in span iff -71 + 24(T-8) <= 0 <= -48 + 24(T-8)\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nFirst, 0 <= -48 + 24(T-8) => 48 <= 24(T-8) => 2 <= T-8 => T >= 10\n\nAnd -71 + 24(T-8) <= 0 => 24(T-8) <= 71 => T-8 <= 71/24 = 2.958, so T-8 <= 2 since T integer? T-8 <= floor(71/24) but inequality.\n\n24(T-8) <= 71, T-8 <= 71/24 = 2.958, so since T integer, T-8 <= 2\n\nSimilarly, T >= 10 from above.\n\nT >= 10 and T-8 <= 2, but T-8 <=2 means T<=10, so T=10.\n\nT >=10 from 0 <= -48 +24(T-8), and T-8 <=2 from -71+24(T-8) <=0.\n\nT-8 <=2.958, so T-8 <=2 for inequality <=, but 24(T-8) <=71, T-8 <=71/24=2.958, so for integer T, T-8 <=2.\n\nThen T>=10 and T<=10, so only at T=10, 0 is covered? Let's check.\n\nAt T=10, T-8=2, min = -71 +24*2 = -71+48= -23\n\nMax = -48 +48=0? -48 +24*2= -48+48=0\n\nSo span [-23,0] at T=10, so 0 is included, since 0 <=0 is true.\n\nAt T=9, T-8=1, min= -71+24= -47, max= -48+24= -24, span [-47,-24], 0 not in.\n\nAt T=11, T-8=3, min= -71+72=1, max= -48+72=24, span [1,24], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, only at T=10, x=0 is covered.\n\nNow freeway 2: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nSimilarly, span at T: [ -83 + 36(T-8), -48 + 36(T-8) ]\n\n0 in span iff -83 +36(T-8) <=0 <= -48 +36(T-8)\n\nFirst, 0 <= -48 +36(T-8) => 48 <=36(T-8) => 48/36=4/3≈1.333 <= T-8, so T-8 >=2 since integer? 1.333, so T-8 >=2? Let's see.\n\n48 <=36(T-8), so 36(T-8) >=48, T-8 >=48/36=4/3≈1.333, since T integer, T-8 >=2? T-8 >= ceil(1.333)=2? No.\n\nInequality: T-8 >= 48/36 = 4/3, so for integer T, T-8 >= 2 since 4/3≈1.333, ceil is 2? But T-8 must be at least 2 because if T-8=1, 36*1=36<48, not >=48. T-8=2, 72>=48 yes.\n\nSimilarly, upper: -83 +36(T-8) <=0 => 36(T-8) <=83 => T-8 <=83/36≈2.305, so T-8 <=2.\n\nThus T-8 >=2 and T-8 <=2, so T=10.\n\nAt T=10, min= -83 +36*2= -83+72= -11, max= -48+72=24, span [-11,24], 0 included.\n\nAt T=9, min= -83+36= -47, max= -48+36= -12, span [-47,-12], 0 not.\n\nT=11, min= -83+108=25, max= -48+108=60, span [25,60], no.\n\nSo freeway 2 also only at T=10.\n\nBut freeway 2 has one car? Yes.\n\nNow freeway 3: (-48, -83, right, 36) same as freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, only T=10.\n\nFreeway 4: (-48, -83, right, 36) same, only T=10.\n\nNow freeway 5: three cars: (48, 37, right, 6), (12, 1, right, 6), (-24, -35, right, 6)\n\nAll right-moving, speed 6.\n\nFor each, find when 0 in span.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6) span at T: [37 +6(T-8), 48+6(T-8)] since τ=37, h=48, and right-moving, so [τ + s dt, h + s dt] = [37 +6(T-8), 48+6(T-8)]\n\n0 in [37+6dt, 48+6dt]? Since min=37+6dt, max=48+6dt, both positive for T>=8, so min >=37>0, so 0 never in span for this car.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,6) span [1 +6(T-8), 12+6(T-8)]\n\nAt T=8, dt=0, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nFor 0 to be in, min <=0<=max, but min=1+6dt >=1>0, so never <=0, so 0 never covered.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,6) span [-35 +6(T-8), -24+6(T-8)]\n\n0 in span iff -35+6dt <=0 <= -24+6dt\n\nFirst, 0 <= -24+6dt => 24 <=6dt => dt >=4\n\nAnd -35+6dt <=0 => 6dt <=35 => dt <=35/6≈5.833, so dt<=5\n\nThus dt>=4 and dt<=5, so T-8=4 or 5, T=12 or 13.\n\nAt T=12, dt=4, min= -35+24= -11, max= -24+24=0, span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nT=13, dt=5, min= -35+30= -5, max= -24+30=6, span [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nT=11, dt=3, min= -35+18= -17, max= -24+18= -6, all negative, 0 not in.\n\nT=14, dt=6, min= -35+36=1, max= -24+36=12, all positive, no.\n\nSo for freeway 5, car 3 covers x=0 at T=12 and T=13.\n\nCars 1 and 2 never cover x=0.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5, I think? (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6) same, so same as freeway 5, covered at T=12 and 13.\n\nNow freeway 7: (48,37,right,12) one car.\n\nSpan at T: [37 +12(T-8), 48+12(T-8)]\n\nMin=37+12dt >=37>0, so never covers x=0.\n\nFreeway 8: (48,37,right,4) one car.\n\nSpan [37 +4(T-8), 48+4(T-8)] min>=37>0, never covers x=0.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have cars starting at positive x, moving right, so x=0 never covered.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway when x=0 is occupied:\n\nFreeway 1: only at T=10\n\nFreeway 2: only at T=10\n\nFreeway 3: only at T=10\n\nFreeway 4: only at T=10\n\nFreeway 5: at T=12 and 13\n\nFreeway 6: at T=12 and 13\n\nFreeway 7: never\n\nFreeway 8: never\n\nI need to get from y=0 to y=9, moving up or down or stay, but since I start at 0 and need to go to 9, I should move up.\n\nEach turn, I can go up, down, or stay, but staying might not help much since I need to move up.\n\nBut to avoid collisions, I might need to time my movement so that when I'm on a freeway, it's not occupied.\n\nThe collision is only when I am on the freeway at that turn, and x=0 is covered.\n\nSince I move vertically, at turn T, I am on row y_T.\n\nIf at that turn, for that row, x=0 is covered, I collide.\n\nOtherwise, no collision.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I decide action to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nBut at turn T, I am on y_T, so I care about row y_T at time T.\n\nThen after action, at T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, so I care about row y_{T+1} at time T+1.\n\nNow, I start at t=8, y=0.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, so no cars, so at t=8, I am safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which might be safe, but y=9 is not listed, I think y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nSo y=0 and y=9 should be safe.\n\nNow, to go from y=0 to y=9, I need to pass through y=1 to 8, but not necessarily stay, I can move through quickly.\n\nEach move, I can change y by -1,0,+1, so to go from 0 to 9, minimum turns is 9, if I go up every time.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied.\n\nSpecifically, for each freeway row, I need to not be there when x=0 is covered for that row.\n\nNow, from above, the occupied times:\n\nRow 1: occupied only at t=10\n\nRow 2: only at t=10\n\nRow 3: only at t=10\n\nRow 4: only at t=10\n\nRow 5: occupied at t=12 and 13\n\nRow 6: occupied at t=12 and 13\n\nRows 7 and 8: never occupied.\n\nAlso, rows 1-4 are occupied only at t=10, and rows 5-6 at t=12,13.\n\nI need to plan my path so that when I am on row k at turn T, if k is occupied at T, I avoid.\n\nSince rows 1-4 are only bad at t=10, I should avoid being on row 1,2,3, or 4 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, avoid row 5 or 6 at t=12 or 13.\n\nNow, let's think about timing.\n\nStart at t=8, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since I need to increase y by 9, and each up move increases by 1, I need at least 9 moves up. But I can stay or move down, which might waste turns, so minimal H should be 9 if possible, but I might need to delay to avoid bad times.\n\nH is the number of turns including the starting point? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=8 to t=8+H-1, and at t=8+H-1, y=9.\n\nAt turn t=8, I am at y=0, and I take action a_t for t=8,8+1,..., up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and after H actions, I am at y=9.\n\nAfter t actions, I am at y_{t_1 + t}.\n\nDefine the turns.\n\nSet t=8 as the starting turn.\n\nAt time t, I am at position y_t.\n\nAt turn t, I take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nI start at t=8, y_8 = 0.\n\nI need to find H such that y_{8+H} = 9? Let's see.\n\nAfter H actions, I have applied a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}, so from t=t_1 to t=t_1 + H-1, that's H actions.\n\nAfter that, I am at y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nt_1=8, so at turn 8+H, y_{8+H} =9.\n\nAnd I start at t=8, y_8=0.\n\nThe number of actions is H, so I go from y_8 to y_{8+H} in H steps.\n\ny increases from 0 to 9, so I need at least 9 steps if I only go up, but I can go down or stay, so H >=9.\n\nNow, the time when I am on each row.\n\nFor example, if I go up every turn, I would be:\n\nt=8: y=0\n\na8=U, then t=9: y=1\n\na9=U, t=10: y=2\n\na10=U, t=11: y=3\n\na11=U, t=12: y=4\n\na12=U, t=13: y=5\n\na13=U, t=14: y=6\n\na14=U, t=15: y=7\n\na15=U, t=16: y=8\n\na16=U, t=17: y=9\n\nBut at t=10, I am at y=2, and row 2 is occupied at t=10, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, at t=12, y=4, but row 4 is not occupied at t=12? Row 4 is occupied only at t=10, which is past.\n\nIn this path:\n\nt=9: y=1, row 1 occupied? Row 1 occupied at t=10, not t=9.\n\nt=9: y=1, row 1 at t=9: is it occupied?\n\nFrom above, row 1 only at t=10, not t=9, so at t=9, y=1 should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=10: y=2, row 2 occupied at t=10, collision.\n\nSo in this path, at t=10, I collide on row 2.\n\nI need to avoid being on rows 1,2,3,4 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, rows 5 and 6 at t=12 and 13.\n\nIn the above, at t=12, y=4, row 4 is safe since only bad at t=10.\n\nt=13: y=5, row 5 occupied at t=13, collision.\n\nSo both issues.\n\nI need to not be on rows 1-4 at t=10, and not on rows 5-6 at t=12 and 13.\n\nNow, rows 7 and 8 are always safe.\n\nI can be on other rows at other times.\n\nSince rows 1-4 are only bad at t=10, I can be on them at other times, similarly for 5-6 except t=12,13.\n\nBut t=12 and 13 both bad for 5-6.\n\nNow, let me think about the sequence.\n\nI start at t=8, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 by some turn.\n\nThe critical times are t=10 for rows 1-4, and t=12,13 for rows 5-6.\n\nTo minimize H, I should move as fast as possible but avoid those.\n\nOne way is to delay or advance my movement so that I am not on the bad rows at bad times.\n\nFor example, at t=10, I should not be on y=1,2,3,4.\n\nSo I could be below or above.\n\nSimilarly at t=12,13, not on y=5 or 6.\n\nNow, since I start from y=0 at t=8, I need to go up.\n\nI could stay at y=0 for a few turns or move down, but y=0 is bottom, I can't go below 0, so I can stay or go up.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 is top.\n\nLet me list possible y at each time.\n\nAt t=8: y=0 (safe)\n\nNow, for t=9: I can be at y=0,1, or -1 but y min=0, so y=0 or 1.\n\nIf I go up, y=1; if stay, y=0; if down, but y=0, down to y=0 I think? From y=0, if I do D, y_{t+1} = y_t -1, but y_t=0, so y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1) or something? The update says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on action, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so from y=0, if D, Δy=-1, y_{t+1} = -1, but must be in [0,9], so probably it clamps to 0? Or is it not allowed?\n\nLook back: \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\", and Δy is defined, so if y_t=0 and a_t=D, then y_{t+1} = -1 not in [0,9], so probably it stays at 0 or something. But not specified.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, U might not go to 10.\n\nIn the player update: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δ y_t, where Δy_t = +1 if U, -1 if D, 0 if S, and y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\"\n\nBut it doesn't say what happens if out of bound. Probably, it is clamped, so if y_t=0 and D, y_{t+1}=0; if y_t=9 and U, y_{t+1}=9.\n\nI think we can assume that.\n\nSimilarly for other bounds.\n\nSo from y=0, D or S keeps at 0; U goes to 1.\n\nFrom y=9, U or S keeps at 9; D goes to 8.\n\nBack to t=8: y=0\n\nAt t=9: I can choose to stay (y=0) or go up to y=1.\n\nIf I go up to y=1 at t=9, then at t=9 I am on row 1. Is row 1 occupied at t=9? From above, row 1 only at t=10, not t=9, so safe.\n\nThen at t=10, if I am still on row 1 or move to row 2, etc., but row 1 at t=10 is bad.\n\nIf at t=9 I am at y=1, then at t=10, I can go to y=0,1,2.\n\nBut y=0 safe, y=1 at t=10 bad, y=2 at t=10 also bad.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay at t=8, at t=9 y=0.\n\nThen at t=10, I can be at y=0 (safe), or y=1 (bad), or if I go up from y=0 to y=1 at t=10, but at t=10 I am on y=1 which is bad.\n\nI need to not be on rows 1-4 at t=10.\n\nSo at t=10, I should be at y<=0 or y>=5.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, or y=5,6,7,8,9.\n\ny=5 and 6 might be bad at other times, but at t=10, rows 5 and 6 are safe, since only bad at t=12,13.\n\nAt t=10, row 5 is not occupied, row 6 not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, rows 7,8 always safe.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nSo at t=10, I can be at y=0,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSimilarly, for t=12 and t=13, I need to not be on y=5 or 6.\n\nSo at t=12 and t=13, I should be at y<=4 or y>=7.\n\ny=4 is row 4, which is safe except at t=10, but t=12 is after, so safe.\n\ny=3,2,1,0 safe except at t=10.\n\ny=7,8 safe.\n\nNow, back to path.\n\nI start at t=8, y=0.\n\nI need to get to a safe position at t=10.\n\nSafe y at t=10: 0,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut I am at y=0 at t=8, and I need to move.\n\nIf I want to be at y=0 at t=10, I can stay at y=0 for both turns.\n\nAt t=8, I can S or D to stay at y=0.\n\nThen at t=9, S or D to stay at y=0.\n\nThen at t=10, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nThen from there, I need to go to y=9.\n\nBut I need to avoid rows 5-6 at t=12,13.\n\nt=10 is done, now t=11 onwards.\n\nAt t=10, y=0.\n\nThen I need to go up.\n\nEach move up takes one turn.\n\nIf I go up every turn from t=10:\n\nt=10: y=0\n\na10=U, t=11: y=1\n\na11=U, t=12: y=2\n\na12=U, t=13: y=3\n\na13=U, t=14: y=4\n\na14=U, t=15: y=5\n\nBut at t=12, y=2, row 2 is safe? Row 2 only bad at t=10, t=12 is fine.\n\nt=13: y=3, safe.\n\nt=14: y=4, safe.\n\nt=15: y=5, now row 5 at t=15: is it occupied? Row 5 bad at t=12,13, not t=15, so safe.\n\nThen continue to y=9.\n\nBut at t=15 y=5, then a15=U, t=16 y=6\n\nt=16 y=6, row 6 at t=16: bad? Row 6 bad at t=12,13, not t=16, safe.\n\na16=U, t=17 y=7\n\na17=U, t=18 y=8\n\na18=U, t=19 y=9\n\nBut I reached at t=19, which is late, H=12? Let's count turns.\n\nStart t=8 y=0.\n\nActions from t=8 to t=18? After H actions, at t=8+H.\n\nAt t=8, after 0 actions, y=0.\n\nAfter first action a8, at t=9, y= something.\n\nAfter H actions, at t=8+H.\n\ny_{8+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, at t=10 y=0 (after 2 actions: a8 and a9 both S or D to stay).\n\nThen from t=10 to t=19: from y=0 to y=9, 9 steps up, so at t=19 y=9.\n\nSo H such that 8+H=19, H=11.\n\nActions: from t=8 to t=18? a_t for t=8 to t=8+H-1.\n\nt=8 to t=8+H-1, that's H actions, to reach at t=8+H.\n\nSet t=8+H =19, so H=11.\n\nActions at t=8 to t=17? t=8 to t=18? t=8+H-1 = t=18.\n\nSequence: a8, a9, ..., a17, a18? t from 8 to 18 inclusive, that's 11 actions: t=8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18.\n\nAfter a18, at t=19 y=9.\n\nBut I can do better.\n\nIn the above, I stayed at y=0 for t=9 and t=10? At t=8: y=0\n\nSuppose a8=S, so at t=9 y=0\n\na9=S, at t=10 y=0\n\nThen a10=U, t=11 y=1\n\na11=U, t=12 y=2\n\na12=U, t=13 y=3\n\na13=U, t=14 y=4\n\na14=U, t=15 y=5\n\na15=U, t=16 y=6\n\na16=U, t=17 y=7\n\na17=U, t=18 y=8\n\na18=U, t=19 y=9\n\nH=11.\n\nBut I could be faster by not staying.\n\nFor example, at t=10, I could be at y=5 or higher.\n\nHow?\n\nFrom t=8, I have two turns to get to a high y by t=10.\n\nAt t=8 y=0\n\nI can go up.\n\nSuppose at t=8, I go up: a8=U, so at t=9 y=1\n\nNow at t=9 y=1, which is safe since row 1 not occupied at t=9.\n\nThen at t=9, I need to go somewhere for t=10.\n\nAt t=10, I need y not 1,2,3,4.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=9, I can go to y=0,1,2 at t=10.\n\nBut y=0 safe, y=1 bad, y=2 bad at t=10.\n\nSo only choice is to go down to y=0 at t=10.\n\na9=D, so at t=10 y=0.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nI could go to higher y.\n\nBut from t=8 to t=10, only two actions, I can increase y by at most 2.\n\nSo at t=10, y can be at most 2, if I go up both times.\n\nBut y=0,1,2: y=0 safe, y=1 bad, y=2 bad at t=10.\n\nSo only possible to be at y=0 at t=10 by going down or staying.\n\nCannot be at y=5 at t=10 from y=0 in two steps.\n\nSo at t=10, I must be at y=0 to be safe.\n\nNo choice.\n\nThen from there, I need to go to y=9.\n\nNow, the next issue is to avoid rows 5-6 at t=12 and 13.\n\nIn the path above, I reach y=5 at t=15, which is after t=13, so safe.\n\nBut t=15 is late.\n\nI could go faster after t=10.\n\nAfter t=10, at y=0.\n\nt=11: I can go to y=1\n\nt=12: to y=2, etc.\n\nBut at t=12 and t=13, I need to not be on y=5 or 6.\n\nIn the slow path, I am at y=2 at t=12, y=3 at t=13, both below 5, so safe.\n\nBut I can be higher if I go faster, but I have to avoid being on y=5 or 6 at t=12 or 13.\n\nFor example, if I go up faster, I might reach y=5 earlier.\n\nBut at t=12 or 13, if I am on y=5 or 6, bad.\n\nSo let's see when I can be on each row.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=10, I start moving up.\n\nt=10: y=0\n\na10=U, t=11: y=1\n\na11=U, t=12: y=2\n\na12=U, t=13: y=3\n\na13=U, t=14: y=4\n\na14=U, t=15: y=5\n\netc.\n\nAt t=12, y=2, safe; t=13, y=3, safe.\n\nBut if I want to go faster, I need to be at higher y sooner, but with the constraint at t=12 and t=13.\n\nSuppose at t=12, I want to be at y <=4 or y>=7.\n\nSimilarly for t=13.\n\nBut from t=10 y=0, to t=12, two actions, I can reach y=0,1,2.\n\ny=0,1,2 all <=4, so possible, e.g. y=2 as above.\n\nTo be at y>=7 at t=12, from t=10 y=0, in two actions, impossible, since max y=2.\n\nSimilarly for t=13, from t=10 to t=13, three actions, can reach y=3 max if all up.\n\ny=3 <=4, so can be y=3 at t=13, as above.\n\nCannot be y=7 at t=13.\n\nSo in this case, I must be at low y at t=12 and t=13, specifically y<=3 or so, which is fine, and I avoid the bad rows by being below.\n\nThen I continue up.\n\nBut it takes many turns to reach y=9.\n\nTo save time, I could go up faster after the critical times.\n\nAnother idea: since rows 7 and 8 are always safe, I could go directly to higher rows after t=10.\n\nBut from t=10 y=0, I need to go through the lower rows.\n\nUnless I delay or something.\n\nI could stay at low rows longer to wait for the bad times to pass.\n\nFor rows 5-6, bad at t=12,13, so if I am on row 5 or 6 before or after, it's ok.\n\nFor example, if I can be on row 5 at t=11 or t=14, safe.\n\nSimilarly for row 6.\n\nIn the current path, I am on row 5 at t=15, which is fine.\n\nBut I can be earlier.\n\nLet me list the times I can be on each row safely.\n\nFor row 1: safe except t=10\n\nSo I can be on row 1 at t=8,9,11,12,... but not t=10.\n\nSimilarly row 2: safe except t=10\n\nRow 3: except t=10\n\nRow 4: except t=10\n\nRow 5: safe except t=12 and 13\n\nRow 6: except t=12 and 13\n\nRows 7,8: always safe.\n\nNow, I start at t=8 y=0.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe critical points are t=10 and t=12,13.\n\nAt t=10, I must be at y=0, as we established.\n\nThen from t=10 y=0, I need to move up.\n\nNow, at t=12 and t=13, I need to be at y<=4 or y>=7.\n\nFrom t=10 to t=12, two steps: from y=0, I can go to y=0,1,2 at t=12.\n\nAll <=4, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, at t=13, from y at t=12, I can go to y-1,y,y+1 at t=13.\n\nIf at t=12 y=0,1,2, then at t=13 y can be 0,1,2,3 or 1,2,3 or 2,3,4 respectively, all <=4, so y<=4 at t=13, which is safe.\n\nSo no problem, I can be at low y.\n\nThen from there, I can go up fast to y=9.\n\nFor example, from t=10 y=0\n\nI can go up as fast as possible.\n\na10=U, t=11 y=1\n\na11=U, t=12 y=2\n\na12=U, t=13 y=3\n\na13=U, t=14 y=4\n\na14=U, t=15 y=5\n\na15=U, t=16 y=6\n\na16=U, t=17 y=7\n\na17=U, t=18 y=8\n\na18=U, t=19 y=9\n\nH=11 as before.\n\nBut from t=14 y=4, I am going up, but rows 5 and 6 are safe after t=13, so I can go through them.\n\nIn this case, at t=15 y=5, t=16 y=6, both after t=13, safe.\n\nBut I can start going up faster from t=11 or something.\n\nAt t=11 y=1, I can go up to y=2 at t=12, etc., same as above.\n\nSince I have to be at low y at t=12 and t=13, I can't be higher.\n\nUnless I go up slower before, but that would make it worse.\n\nAnother idea: at t=10, I am at y=0, but I could have been at higher y at t=10 if I moved faster, but earlier we saw I can't because of the constraint at t=10.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=0 at t=10 by moving, but it's the same.\n\nOr, I could go down to y=0 at t=10 from higher, but I start from low.\n\nLet's consider the time to pass the bad spots.\n\nFor rows 1-4, I need to not be on them at t=10, so I can cross them before or after t=10.\n\nSimilarly for rows 5-6, before or after t=12,13.\n\nFor example, I could cross rows 1-4 before t=10 or after t=10.\n\nSimilarly for 5-6 before t=12 or after t=13.\n\nNow, I start at t=8 y=0.\n\nIf I want to cross rows 1-4 before t=10, I need to be at y>=5 by t=10.\n\nBut from t=8 to t=10, two actions, I can reach at most y=2, impossible to be at y=5.\n\nSo I must cross rows 1-4 after t=10.\n\nSimilarly, for rows 5-6, I can cross before t=12 or after t=13.\n\nIf I cross before t=12, I need to be at y>=7 by t=12.\n\nBut from t=10 y=0, to t=12, two actions, max y=2, impossible.\n\nSo I must cross rows 5-6 after t=13.\n\nTherefore, I have to be below row 5 until after t=13.\n\nSpecifically, at t=13, I should be at y<=4, then after that, I can go up to rows 5-6 and above.\n\nIn the path, at t=13 I am at y=3 or 4, then go up.\n\nTo minimize time, I should go up as fast as possible except when I need to be low.\n\nBut in this case, from t=10 to t=13, I need to be at y<=4 at t=13, and I start at y=0 at t=10.\n\nI can reach y=3 at t=13 with three up moves: t=10 y=0, a10=U t=11 y=1, a11=U t=12 y=2, a12=U t=13 y=3.\n\nThen from there, I go up: a13=U t=14 y=4, a14=U t=15 y=5, a15=U t=16 y=6, a16=U t=17 y=7, a17=U t=18 y=8, a18=U t=19 y=9.\n\nStill H=11.\n\nAt t=13 y=3, but I can be at y=4 at t=13 if I go faster, but from y=0 at t=10, with three actions, I can be at y=3 if I go up all, or y=4? Max is +3, so y=3 at t=13.\n\ny at t=10: 0\n\nAfter one action: t=11 y=1\n\nAfter two: t=12 y=2\n\nAfter three: t=13 y=3\n\nYes.\n\nIf I stay or move down, it would be lower, worse.\n\nSo y=3 at t=13 is the highest I can be.\n\nThen to y=9, need 6 more up moves, to t=19.\n\nBut let's count the turns.\n\nt=8: start y=0\n\nTo be at y=0 at t=10, I need to stay at y=0 for t=9 and t=10.\n\nSo actions:\n\nt=8: S (stay at y=0)\n\nt=9: S (stay at y=0) for t=10 y=0\n\nThen t=10: U, to t=11 y=1\n\nt=11: U, to t=12 y=2\n\nt=12: U, to t=13 y=3\n\nt=13: U, to t=14 y=4\n\nt=14: U, to t=15 y=5\n\nt=15: U, to t=16 y=6\n\nt=16: U, to t=17 y=7\n\nt=17: U, to t=18 y=8\n\nt=18: U, to t=19 y=9\n\nSo actions from t=8 to t=18, that's 11 actions, H=11.\n\nBut I can save time by not staying at y=0 for both t=9 and t=10.\n\nAt t=8, I can go up to y=1 at t=9, which is safe, then at t=9, go down to y=0 at t=10, so at t=10 y=0 still, but I used one up and one down, net zero, same as staying.\n\nBut I moved, but position same.\n\nThen from t=10 same as above.\n\nNo gain.\n\nPerhaps for the rows 5-6, I can cross them before t=12.\n\nBut to cross before t=12, I need to be at y>=7 by t=12.\n\nBut from t=10 y=0, impossible in two steps.\n\nAfter t=13, I can cross.\n\nBut after t=13, I can go fast.\n\nAnother idea: since rows 7 and 8 are always safe, I can go to them directly, but I have to go through the lower rows.\n\nUnless I start moving earlier.\n\nAt t=8, I am at y=0, I can go up at t=8 to y=1 at t=9.\n\nThen at t=9, I am at y=1, safe.\n\nNow, for t=10, I need to not be on 1-4, so I must go down to y=0 at t=10.\n\nThen at t=10 y=0.\n\nSame as before.\n\nI could be at y=5 at t=10, but impossible.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I can be on row 5 at t=11, for example.\n\nBut to be at y=5 at t=11, from t=8 y=0, in three actions: t=8 to t=11, three actions.\n\nAt t=11, after three actions from t=8.\n\nt=8: y=0\n\nAfter a8: t=9 y=?\n\nAfter a9: t=10 y=?\n\nAfter a10: t=11 y=?\n\nTo have y=5 at t=11, I need to increase by 5 in three actions, impossible since max +3, to y=3.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nSimilarly, any high position early is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11, with the path above.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose at t=10 I am at y=0, as must.\n\nThen from t=10 to t=13, I need to be at y<=4 at t=13.\n\nWith three actions from t=10 to t=13, I can be at y=3 at t=13, as max.\n\nThen from t=13 y=3 to t=19 y=9, six actions.\n\nTotal from t=8 to t=19, 11 turns.\n\nActions start from t=8 to t=18 for 11 actions.\n\nBut at t=8, I am already at y=0, so for t=8, I can choose to stay or go up, but in this case I stay to be safe at t=9 and t=10.\n\nIn the path, at t=8 I stay, t=9 stay, both at y=0.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut I could at t=8 go up to y=1 at t=9, then at t=9 go down to y=0 at t=10, so I am at y=1 at t=9 and y=0 at t=10.\n\nThen same from there.\n\nThe net effect is the same, and H is same.\n\nIn terms of sequence, it might not matter.\n\nBut for the answer, I need the actions.\n\nNow, about rows 5-6: in this path, I pass row 5 at t=15, row 6 at t=16, both after t=13, so safe.\n\nNow, is there a way to be at higher y earlier?\n\nFor example, if I could be at y=4 at t=13 instead of y=3.\n\nBut from t=10 y=0, with three up moves: t=11 y=1, t=12 y=2, t=13 y=3, cannot be y=4.\n\nIf I go slower, I might be lower, worse.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 before t=19.\n\nFor example, if I start going up earlier, but I have to be at y=0 at t=10.\n\nAt t=8, if I go up to y=1 at t=9, then down to y=0 at t=10, then I have used two actions to be back at start.\n\nThen from t=10 same.\n\nNo gain.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=12 and t=13, I can be at y=4, for example.\n\nIn the path, at t=13 I am at y=3, but I can be at y=4 at t=13 if I start from higher, but I can't.\n\nPerhaps after t=10, I can go up to y=4 quickly, but then at t=13 I am at y=4 or something.\n\nt=10 y=0\n\na10=U, t=11 y=1\n\na11=U, t=12 y=2\n\na12=U, t=13 y=3\n\nIf I want y=4 at t=13, I need four actions from t=10, but t=10 to t=13 is three actions: a10,a11,a12 to reach t=13.\n\nAfter a12 at t=13.\n\nTo have y=4 at t=13, I need to increase by 4 from t=10, but only three actions, max +3, y=3.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSo I think H=11 is the minimum.\n\nBut let's see if I can save a turn at the end or something.\n\nPerhaps I can be on row 5 at t=11.\n\nBut to be at y=5 at t=11, from t=8, impossible as before.\n\nt=11 is before t=12, so row 5 at t=11 is safe since only bad at t=12,13.\n\nBut I can't reach it.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 at t=11 safe.\n\nBut from y=0 at t=10, to y=5 at t=11? One action, can only go to y=1.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think it's not possible.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow for the sequence.\n\nIn the path, I need to specify actions.\n\nFrom t=8: I can choose to stay or go up and down, but to minimize actions, staying is fine.\n\nBut in terms of the sequence, it doesn't matter as long as I am at y=0 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, after that, I go up every turn.\n\nSo one possible sequence:\n\nAt t=8: S (stay at y=0 for t=9)\n\nActually, at turn t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t, take a_t, go to y_{t+1}.\n\nFor collision at turn T, I care about y_T at that turn.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nt=8: at y=0, take a8, go to y9.\n\na8 can be S or D to stay at y=0, or U to go to y=1.\n\nBut if I go U, at t=9 I am at y=1.\n\nThen at t=9, I need to go to y=0 for t=10, so a9=D to go to y=0 at t=10.\n\nIf I stay at t=8, a8=S, at t=9 y=0.\n\nThen at t=9, a9=S, at t=10 y=0.\n\nEither way, at t=10 I am at y=0.\n\nThen from there, I go up.\n\nTo have fewer actions, but H is the same.\n\nIn the sequence, I can choose.\n\nPerhaps I can go up at some points to be ready.\n\nBut let's list the actions for the path where I stay at start.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t=8: a_{t_1} = a_8, action S (so y9=0)\n\nTurn t=9: a9 = S (y10=0)\n\nNow at t=10, y=0, I take U to go up.\n\nTurn t=10: a10 = U (y11=1)\n\nTurn t=11: a11 = U (y12=2)\n\nTurn t=12: a12 = U (y13=3)\n\nTurn t=13: a13 = U (y14=4)\n\nTurn t=14: a14 = U (y15=5)\n\nTurn t=15: a15 = U (y16=6)\n\nTurn t=16: a16 = U (y17=7)\n\nTurn t=17: a17 = U (y18=8)\n\nTurn t=18: a18 = U (y19=9)\n\nNow, at which turns am I on freeways:\n\nt=9: y=0, not freeway, safe\n\nt=10: y=0, safe\n\nt=11: y=1, row 1 at t=11: not occupied (only t=10), safe\n\nt=12: y=2, row 2 at t=12: not occupied (only t=10), safe\n\nt=13: y=3, row 3 at t=13: safe\n\nt=14: y=4, row 4 at t=14: safe\n\nt=15: y=5, row 5 at t=15: not occupied (only 12,13), safe\n\nt=16: y=6, row 6 at t=16: safe\n\nt=17: y=7, row 7 always safe\n\nt=18: y=8, row 8 safe\n\nt=19: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nNo collisions.\n\nH=11 actions from t=8 to t=18.\n\nt=8 to t=18 inclusive is 11 turns? t=8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18: that's 11 actions.\n\nReach at t=19.\n\nIn the sequence, I have actions for t=8 to t=18.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nt_1=8.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut after a18, at t=19 y=9.\n\nIs there a shorter sequence?\n\nSuppose I go up at t=8.\n\nt=8: a8=U, so at t=9 y=1\n\nThen t=9: a9=D, to go to y=0 at t=10\n\nThen t=10: y=0, a10=U to y=1 at t=11\n\nThen same as before: a11=U to y=2 at t=12, etc.\n\nBut now at t=11 y=1, same as before.\n\nBut I used an extra move: up and down, whereas in the first I stayed, so the position at t=11 is the same, but I have one more action? No.\n\nIn first sequence: a8=S, a9=S: at t=10 y=0\n\nIn this: a8=U, a9=D: at t=10 y=0 same.\n\nThen from t=10 same actions.\n\nBut in this case, I have actions a8=U, a9=D, which are not necessary, but H is the same, since I still need to go to y=9 from y=0 at t=10.\n\nIn terms of number of actions to reach y=9, it's the same.\n\nBut in this sequence, at t=9 I am at y=1, which is fine.\n\nThen actions: t=8: U, t=9: D, t=10: U, t=11: U, ..., up to t=18: U, same number.\n\nt=18: U to y=9 at t=19.\n\nSame H.\n\nBut I can omit the down move or something? No.\n\nAnother idea: after t=10, when I go up, at t=13 I am at y=3, but I can go to y=4 at t=13? No.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=4 earlier by going faster, but I can't because of the constraint at t=13 to be low.\n\nUnless I don't need to be that low.\n\nAt t=13, I need to be y<=4 or y>=7.\n\nBut y>=7 impossible, so y<=4.\n\nThe highest I can be is y=3 at t=13.\n\nThen from y=3 to y=9, 6 steps, to t=19.\n\nIf I could be at y=4 at t=13, it would be better, but I can't.\n\nHow to be at y=4 at t=13?\n\nFrom t=10 y=0, I need to increase by 4 in 3 steps, impossible.\n\nIf I start from higher at t=10, but I can't.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's check the car on freeway 5 and 6.\n\nFreeway 5 has cars, and we have only one car that covers at t=12 and 13, but others don't, but we considered.\n\nPerhaps I can pass row 5 or 6 at different times.\n\nFor example, at t=11, row 5 is safe.\n\nIf I can be at y=5 at t=11, then I can go up.\n\nBut from t=10 y=0, to t=11, I can only be at y=1.\n\nNo.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's not possible.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow for the sequence, I'll use the first one with staying.\n\nIn the answer, I need to list the actions.\n\nt_1 = 8.\n\nActions from t=8 to t=18 for H=11.\n\nIn the sequence, turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so turns t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nSet t_1 + H-1 = 18, so t_1 + H-1 =8 + H-1=18, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nYes.\n\nNow actions:\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 18, action U, to y=9 at t=19.\n\nBut y=9 is reached, and no need to be on freeway.\n\nNow, I think that's fine.\n\nTo make it shorter, but I can't.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at t=18.\n\nFor example, if at t=17 I am at y=8, then a17=U to y=9 at t=18.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=17.\n\nFrom start, at t=8 y=0.\n\nIf I go up directly, I can be at y=8 at t=16? Let's see.\n\nt=8: y=0\n\na8=U, t=9 y=1\n\na9=U, t=10 y=2 but at t=10 y=2 collision, since row 2 occupied at t=10.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf I stay at t=8 and t=9, at t=10 y=0, then go up, at t=11 y=1, t=12 y=2, t=13 y=3, t=14 y=4, t=15 y=5, t=16 y=6, t=17 y=7, not y=8.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=17, from t=10 y=0, need 8 steps? From t=10 to t=17 is 7 turns.\n\ny from 0 to 8, 8 steps, but 7 actions: from t=10 to t=17, 7 actions, can increase by at most 7, to y=7 at t=17.\n\nThen a17=U to y=8 at t=18, not 9.\n\ny=8 at t=18, then a18=U to y=9 at t=19.\n\nSame as before.\n\nCannot reach y=9 before t=19.\n\nThus minimal H is 11.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nAlso, for freeway 7 and 8, no issue.\n\nIn the car list, freeway 5 and 6 have multiple cars, but we considered the one that covers x=0.\n\nOthers don't, so fine.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on rows 1-4 at turn 10 (when those rows are occupied) and not on rows 5-6 at turns 12 and 13 (when those rows are occupied). Rows 7 and 8 are always safe.\n\n- At turns 8 and 9, staying at \\(y = 0\\) avoids the danger on rows 1-4 at turn 10.\n- From turn 10 to turn 13, moving up to \\(y = 3\\) by turn 13 ensures the player is below row 5 during turns 12 and 13.\n- From turn 14 onwards, moving up continuously reaches \\(y = 9\\) by turn 19 without encountering any occupied rows.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n- Turn 8: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 9.\n- Turn 9: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 10.\n- Turn 10: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 11.\n- Turn 11: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 12.\n- Turn 12: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 13.\n- Turn 13: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 14.\n- Turn 14: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 15.\n- Turn 15: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 16.\n- Turn 16: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 17.\n- Turn 17: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 18.\n- Turn 18: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19.\n\nThis sequence ensures:\n- At turn 10, \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not a freeway).\n- At turns 11-14, rows 1-4 are safe (only occupied at turn 10).\n- At turns 15-16, rows 5-6 are safe (occupied only at turns 12-13).\n- Rows 7-8 are always safe.\n\nThus, no collisions occur, and \\(y = 9\\) is reached in minimal turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 8: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 0) at turn t_1 = 10. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. Each action can be U (up), D (down), or S (stay), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, respectively, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs if at any turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where y_T is between 1 and 8, and at that turn, for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span. The car spans move left or right based on their direction and speed.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions from turn 10 onwards to get to y=9 as quickly as possible without colliding.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. All cars are given at turn t_1=10, and we need to compute their positions at future turns relative to t_1.\n\nFor any turn T > t_1, the time elapsed is Δt = T - t_1 = T - 10.\n\nFor each car, the span changes based on direction and speed.\n\n- Left-moving: span at T is [h - s * Δt, τ - s * Δt]\n\n- Right-moving: span at T is [τ + s * Δt, h + s * Δt]\n\nIn the car state, for each freeway, we have a list of cars with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: \"right\" means moving right, so for right-moving, the head is the right end, I think. Let me confirm the notation.\n\nFrom the update:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nIn the input, for right-moving, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but in the span definition for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], which suggests that for right-moving, τ is the left end and h is the right end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], so h is left, τ is right or something? I need to clarify.\n\nFrom the text:\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\" and it moves left, so h decreases, τ decreases.\n\nBut [h, τ] with h and τ, which is head and tail?\n\nIn the car state table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nBut in the update rule, for left-moving, it uses [h, τ] as the span at t_1, and for right-moving, it uses [τ, h] as span at t_1.\n\nThis is inconsistent in terms of head and tail.\n\nFor example, for freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nDirection is right, so for right-moving, Span(t_1) should be [τ, h] = [-71, -48]? But in the input, it's given as head=-48, tail=-71.\n\nPerhaps \"head\" and \"tail\" are defined based on direction.\n\nIn the update rule, it says for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" so it implies that for right-moving, τ is the left end and h is the right end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], so h is left, τ is right.\n\nBut in the input, for freeway 1, right-moving, head=-48, tail=-71. Since it's right-moving, head should be the right end, so at t_1, the car spans from tail to head, which is from left to right.\n\nFor right-moving car, at t_1, position: left end is tail τ, right end is head h.\n\nSo for freeway 1: tail τ = -71, head h = -48, direction right, speed 24.\n\nSo Span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-71, -48]\n\nThen at time T, Span(T) = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-71 + 24 Δt, -48 + 24 Δt]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor left-moving, if there was one, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] with h left, τ right, so [h, τ] and moves left.\n\nBut in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving except possibly some, but let's see the table.\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24) → right-moving\n\nFreeway 2: (-48, -83, right, 36) → right-moving\n\nFreeway 3: (-48, -83, right, 36) → same as 2\n\nFreeway 4: (-48, -83, right, 36) → same\n\nFreeway 5: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6) → all right-moving\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5? (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: (48,37,right,12) → one car\n\nFreeway 8: (48,37,right,4) → one car\n\nAll cars are right-moving, so no left-moving cars. That simplifies things.\n\nFor all cars, since right-moving, at turn T, for a car with (head h, tail τ, right, s) at t_1, the span at T is:\n\nleft_end = τ + s * (T - 10)\n\nright_end = h + s * (T - 10)\n\nAnd collision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T (between 1 and 8), and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in [left_end, right_end], i.e., left_end <= 0 <= right_end.\n\nAlso, note that when the player moves, at turn T, if they move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, they are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so only the freeway at y_T matters for collision at turn T.\n\nThe player starts at y=0 at turn 10. y=0 is not a freeway, so no collision possible there. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is also not a freeway, so safe.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=0, the player needs to move up at least 9 times, but since they can stay or move down, the minimal H might be more than 9 if there are obstacles.\n\nBut we need to avoid the freeways when cars are at position 0.\n\nSince all actions take one turn, and we need to go from y=0 to y=9, the minimal possible H is 9, if we go up every turn: U,U,U,...,U 9 times.\n\nBut we might collide with cars on the way.\n\nSo we need to check for each freeway and each turn whether at that turn, if the player is on that row, would 0 be covered by a car.\n\nBut the player is on only one row per turn.\n\nSince the player moves step by step, we need to simulate the path.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway k from 1 to 8.\n\nk=1: one car: head h=-48, tail τ=-71, s=24, right\n\nAt turn T, left_end = τ + s Δt = -71 + 24 (T-10)\n\nright_end = h + s Δt = -48 + 24 (T-10)\n\n0 in span if left_end <= 0 <= right_end\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nk=2: (-48, -83, right, 36) so τ=-83, h=-48, s=36\n\nleft_end = -83 + 36 (T-10)\n\nright_end = -48 + 36 (T-10)\n\nk=3: same as k=2? (-48, -83, right, 36) identical to k=2.\n\nk=4: also same, (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nAll k=2,3,4 have the same car? But it's listed separately for each freeway, so I think each freeway has its own cars, even if same parameters.\n\nk=5: three cars: \n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6) so τ=37? Head and tail.\n\nFor right-moving, head is right end, tail is left end.\n\nInput is (head, tail, dir, speed), and for right, span at t_1 is [tail, head].\n\nIn the tuple, it's (head, tail, ...), so for k=5 first car: head=48, tail=37, right, s=6\n\nSo at t_1, span [37, 48]\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,6) so head=12, tail=1, span [1,12] at t_1\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,6) head=-24, tail=-35, span [-35,-24] at t_1\n\nSimilarly for k=6: same as k=5, three cars: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nk=7: one car: (48,37,right,12) head=48, tail=37, s=12, span [37,48] at t_1\n\nk=8: one car: (48,37,right,4) head=48, tail=37, s=4, span [37,48] at t_1\n\nNow, for each freeway, we need to find when position 0 is occupied, meaning for some car on that freeway, 0 in [left_end, right_end] at turn T.\n\nSince the cars move, the times when 0 is covered might be intervals.\n\nFor the player, we care about for each turn T and for each freeway y, whether if the player is on y at T, collision occurs.\n\nBut since the player might not be on all freeways, we only care for the rows the player visits.\n\nTo find the minimal path, we should find a sequence that avoids being on a freeway when 0 is covered for that row at that turn.\n\nSince we want minimal turns, we should try to go up as fast as possible, but wait or move down to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the time intervals when 0 is occupied.\n\nDefine Δt = T - 10, so at turn T, time from start.\n\nFor freeway k=1:\n\nCar: left_end = -71 + 24 Δt\n\nright_end = -48 + 24 Δt\n\n0 in span if -71 + 24 Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 24 Δt\n\nSo -71 + 24 Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 24 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -71 + 24 Δt <= 0 => 24 Δt <= 71 => Δt <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so Δt <= 2 since turns integer, Δt <=2\n\nΔt <= floor(71/24) = 2 since 24*2=48<71, 24*3=72>71, so Δt <=2? Let's solve inequalities.\n\n-71 + 24 Δt <= 0 => 24 Δt <= 71 => Δt <= 71/24 = 2.958, so for integer Δt, Δt <= 2? But at Δt=2, -71 + 48 = -23 <=0, true; at Δt=3, -71+72=1>0, not <=0.\n\nThe condition is left_end <= 0 and 0 <= right_end.\n\nleft_end <= 0: -71 + 24 Δt <= 0 => 24 Δt <= 71 => Δt <= 71/24 ≈2.958, so for Δt = 0,1,2 (since integer)\n\n0 <= right_end: 0 <= -48 + 24 Δt => 48 <= 24 Δt => Δt >= 48/24 = 2\n\nSo 0 <= right_end iff Δt >= 2\n\nAnd left_end <= 0 iff Δt <= 2 (since at Δt=3, left_end= -71+72=1>0)\n\nSo both conditions: Δt >=2 and Δt <=2, so only at Δt=2.\n\nThus for k=1, 0 occupied only at Δt=2, i.e., T=12.\n\nAt T=12, if player on y=1, collision.\n\nFor other Δt, not occupied.\n\nNow k=2: car (-48,-83,right,36) so τ=-83, h=-48, s=36\n\nleft_end = τ + s Δt = -83 + 36 Δt\n\nright_end = h + s Δt = -48 + 36 Δt\n\n0 in span if left_end <= 0 <= right_end\n\nleft_end <=0: -83 +36 Δt <=0 => 36 Δt <=83 => Δt <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so Δt <=2\n\n0 <= right_end: 0 <= -48 +36 Δt => 48 <=36 Δt => Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so Δt >=2 since integer? Δt >= ceil(4/3)=2\n\nSince Δt integer:\n\nleft_end <=0: -83 +36 Δt <=0 => 36 Δt <=83 => Δt <= floor(83/36)=2 since 36*2=72<83, 36*3=108>83\n\nAt Δt=2, -83+72= -11 <=0 true; Δt=3, -83+108=25>0 false.\n\n0 <= right_end: -48 +36 Δt >=0 => 36 Δt >=48 => Δt >= ceil(48/36)= ceil(4/3)=2\n\nAt Δt=2, -48+72=24>=0 true; Δt=1, -48+36=-12<0 false.\n\nSo both only when Δt=2.\n\nThus for k=2, occupied only at T=12 (Δt=2)\n\nSimilarly k=3: same as k=2, occupied only at T=12.\n\nk=4: same, occupied only at T=12.\n\nNow k=5: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6) head=48, tail=37, s=6\n\nAt t_1, span [37,48]\n\nAt T, left_end = 37 + 6 Δt\n\nright_end = 48 + 6 Δt\n\n0 in span? left_end <=0 <= right_end\n\nBut left_end =37 +6 Δt >=37 >0 for all Δt, so 0 cannot be <= left_end since left_end >0, so 0 not in span for this car. Similarly, right_end > left_end >0, so 0 not covered.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,6) head=12, tail=1, s=6\n\nAt t_1 span [1,12]\n\nAt T, left_end =1 +6 Δt\n\nright_end=12 +6 Δt\n\nleft_end >=1>0, so 0 not <= left_end, thus 0 not in span.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,6) head=-24, tail=-35, s=6\n\nAt t_1 span [-35,-24]\n\nAt T, left_end = -35 +6 Δt\n\nright_end = -24 +6 Δt\n\n0 in span if left_end <=0 <= right_end\n\nleft_end <=0: -35 +6 Δt <=0 => 6 Δt <=35 => Δt <= 35/6 ≈5.833, so Δt <=5\n\n0 <= right_end: 0 <= -24 +6 Δt => 24 <=6 Δt => Δt >=4\n\nSo for Δt=4,5\n\nAt Δt=4: left_end = -35 +24= -11 <=0, right_end= -24+24=0, so 0<=0 true, so 0 in span.\n\nAt Δt=5: left_end= -35+30= -5 <=0, right_end= -24+30=6 >=0, so 0 in span.\n\nAt Δt=3: left_end= -35+18= -17 <=0, but right_end= -24+18= -6 <0, so 0 not <= right_end, not in span.\n\nAt Δt=6: left_end= -35+36=1 >0, not <=0.\n\nSo for third car, 0 occupied at Δt=4 and 5, T=14 and 15.\n\nBut there are multiple cars; for k=5, 0 is occupied if any car has 0 in span.\n\nFirst and second cars never cover 0, only third car covers at Δt=4,5.\n\nSo for k=5, occupied at T=14 and 15.\n\nSimilarly for k=6: same cars as k=5, so occupied at T=14 and 15.\n\nNow k=7: one car (48,37,right,12) head=48, tail=37, s=12\n\nAt T, left_end=37 +12 Δt >0 always, so 0 never in span.\n\nk=8: one car (48,37,right,4) head=48, tail=37, s=4\n\nleft_end=37 +4 Δt >0 always, so 0 never in span.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway when 0 is occupied:\n\n- y=1: at T=12\n\n- y=2: at T=12\n\n- y=3: at T=12\n\n- y=4: at T=12\n\n- y=5: at T=14 and T=15\n\n- y=6: at T=14 and T=15\n\n- y=7: never\n\n- y=8: never\n\ny=7 and y=8 are always safe, no cars at 0.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn 10, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 in minimal turns.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up as much as possible, but avoid being on y=1,2,3,4 at T=12, and avoid y=5,6 at T=14 and T=15.\n\nSince we start at y=0 turn 10, and we can move up, down, or stay.\n\nTo minimize turns, we want to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nThe direct way: if we go up every turn, we reach y=9 at turn 19, since from turn 10 to 19: 9 actions to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nTurn 10: y=0\n\nAfter action at turn 10, y_{11} = y_10 + Δy\n\nLet t be the turn index.\n\nAt turn t, we are at position (0, y_t)\n\nWe perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nThen at turn t, we are on row y_t.\n\nCollision at turn t if y_t between 1 and 8 and 0 occupied on that row at turn t.\n\nIn this case, for turn t, if y_t = k, and k has 0 occupied at t.\n\nNow, sequence: at turn t=10, we are at y=0, which is safe.\n\nWe choose a_{10}, which sets y_{11}.\n\nThen at turn t=11, we are at y_{11}, and so on.\n\nWe need to reach y_t =9 for some t, and we stop when we first reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H is the number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nSince we start at y=0 turn 10, after H actions, we are at turn 10+H, position y_{10+H}.\n\nWe want y_{10+H} =9.\n\nH is the number of turns from t_1 to the turn we reach 9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t= t_1 to t= t_1 + H-1, so after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, we have y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, t_1=10, so after H actions, at turn 10+H, y=9.\n\nThe player position changes after each action.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn t=10, position y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{10}, y_{11} = y_{10} + Δy_{10}\n\nThen at turn t=11, position y_{11}, and so on.\n\nAt each turn t, we check for collision based on y_t and the cars at that turn.\n\nWe need y_t =9 for some t, and we want minimal t - 10, so minimal H such that at turn 10+H, y=9.\n\nH is the number of actions.\n\nStart: t=10, y=0\n\nAfter first action (a_{10}), t=11, y_{11}\n\n...\n\nAfter k-th action (a_{10+k-1}), at turn t=10+k, y_{10+k}\n\nWe want y_{10+H} =9 for some H.\n\nH minimal.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, so indices t=10 to 10+H-1.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=0, we need at least 9 up moves, so H >=9.\n\nMinimal possible H=9 if no obstacles: all U, then at turn 19, y=9.\n\nBut with obstacles, we might need more turns if we have to wait or detour.\n\nIn this case, since we can only move vertically, and obstacles are temporal, we might delay or move down to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nNow, the dangerous times:\n\nFor rows y=1,2,3,4: dangerous only at T=12.\n\nThat means at turn t=12, if player is on y=1,2,3, or 4, collision.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5 and y=6, dangerous at t=14 and t=15.\n\ny=7 and y=8 always safe.\n\nNow, let's see the minimal path.\n\nStart at t=10, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nIf we go directly up:\n\nt=10: y=0, safe (not freeway)\n\na_{10}: say U, then y_{11} =1\n\nt=11: y=1, is freeway? y=1 is freeway. At t=11, is 0 occupied on y=1?\n\nFrom earlier, for y=1, only occupied at t=12, not at t=11.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nCheck for each row and turn when occupied.\n\nWe have:\n\n- y=1: occupied only at t=12\n\n- y=2: only at t=12\n\n- y=3: only at t=12\n\n- y=4: only at t=12\n\n- y=5: occupied at t=14 and t=15\n\n- y=6: occupied at t=14 and t=15\n\n- y=7: never\n\n- y=8: never\n\nt=11: no row is occupied at t=11, since for y=1,2,3,4 only at 12, y=5,6 at 14,15.\n\nAt t=11, for y=1: at Δt=1, T=11.\n\nFor y=1, earlier we had only at Δt=2, T=12.\n\nSimilarly, all others not at t=11.\n\nt=11: Δt = T-10 =1\n\nFor y=1: at Δt=1, left_end = -71 +24*1 = -47 <=0? -47 <=0 true, but right_end = -48 +24*1 = -24 <0, so 0 <= right_end false, so not occupied. Similarly, only at Δt=2.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAt t=11, all freeways are safe, since no cars at 0.\n\nSimilarly, t=12: y=1,2,3,4 occupied if player there.\n\nt=13: Δt=3, for y=1: at Δt=3, left_end= -71+72=1>0, not <=0, so not occupied.\n\ny=2: at Δt=3, left_end= -83+36*3= -83+108=25>0, not <=0.\n\ny=3: same\n\ny=4: same\n\ny=5: at Δt=3, T=13, for the car that matters, third car, left_end= -35+18= -17 <=0, right_end= -24+18= -6 <0, so 0 not <= right_end, not occupied.\n\ny=6: same.\n\nt=14: Δt=4, y=5 and y=6 occupied.\n\nt=15: Δt=5, y=5 and y=6 occupied.\n\nt=16: Δt=6, for y=5: at Δt=6, left_end for third car= -35+36=1>0, not occupied; similarly y=6.\n\nOther times safe.\n\nNow, back to direct path:\n\nt=10: y=0, safe\n\na_{10}=U: y_{11}=1\n\nt=11: y=1, freeway, but at t=11, not occupied, safe.\n\na_{11}=U: y_{12}=2\n\nt=12: y=2, now at t=12, y=2 is occupied (since y=2 dangerous at t=12), collision! Not good.\n\nIf we go to y=2 at t=12, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we are on y=1,2,3,4 at t=12, collision.\n\nSo we need to not be on rows 1-4 at turn 12.\n\nPossible ways:\n\n- Be below y=1 at t=12, but y=0 is safe, or above, but above might be possible.\n\nAt t=12, if we are at y=0 or y>=5, but y=5,6 might be dangerous later, but at t=12, y=5 and 6 are safe, since occupied only at t=14,15.\n\nt=12: Δt=2, for y=5: not occupied, as earlier.\n\nSimilarly y=6 not at t=12.\n\nSo at t=12, safe rows: y=0,5,6,7,8,9 (but 9 not reached yet)\n\ny=0,5,6,7,8 are safe at t=12.\n\ny=1,2,3,4 dangerous.\n\nNow, for the direct path, if we go up from t=10.\n\nt=10: y=0\n\nAfter a_{10}, if U, t=11 y=1\n\nAt t=11, y=1, safe, as above.\n\nBut if we go U again, a_{11}=U, t=12 y=2, collision.\n\nSo we need to avoid that.\n\nWe could at t=11, instead of U, do S or D to stay or go down.\n\nBut we are at y=1, if we do S, y_{12}=1, then at t=12 y=1, collision.\n\nIf D, y_{12}=0, then at t=12 y=0, safe, but we are back to start.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo perhaps delay the ascent.\n\nStart at t=10 y=0.\n\nWe can stay at y=0 for some turns.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are always safe, we can go directly to higher rows quickly.\n\nBut we can only move one step per turn.\n\nAnother idea: at t=11, we are at y=1 (if we went up once).\n\nInstead of going to y=2, we could go to y=0 or stay, but staying or down at t=11 leads to collision or back.\n\nAt t=11, if we are at y=1, we can do S, but then y_{12}=1, t=12 collision.\n\nOr D, y_{12}=0, t=12 y=0 safe.\n\nThen we need to go up later.\n\nBut minimal time might be longer.\n\nWe could go up to y=5 or something before t=12.\n\nLet's see possible positions.\n\nAt t=10: y=0\n\nOptions:\n\n- Action U: to y_{11}=1\n\n- Action S: to y_{11}=0\n\n- Action D: to y_{11}=0? y=0, D would go to y= -1, but y must be >=0, so y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=0, D not possible, only U or S.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, U not possible.\n\nSo at t=10, y=0, actions: U or S.\n\nIf S, y_{11}=0, same position.\n\nBut we need to move, so probably not useful except for waiting.\n\nSimilarly, if we go U to y=1 at t=11.\n\nNow at t=11, y=1, actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf U: y_{12}=2, but at t=12 y=2 collision.\n\nIf S: y_{12}=1, at t=12 collision.\n\nIf D: y_{12}=0, at t=12 y=0 safe.\n\nThen from there, we need to go up.\n\nBut we lost one turn.\n\nTo avoid being on low rows at t=12, we could be at y=0 at t=12.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=10: y=0, a_{10}=S, then y_{11}=0, t=11 y=0\n\nThen a_{11}=U, y_{12}=1, but at t=12, if y=1, collision? t=12 y=1 is dangerous.\n\ny=1 at t=12 collision.\n\nIf at t=11 y=0, a_{11}=S, y_{12}=0, t=12 y=0 safe.\n\nThen we can start going up from t=12.\n\nBut delay.\n\nSince we need to be above y=4 at t=12 or at y=0.\n\ny=5 is safe at t=12.\n\nBut can we reach y=5 by t=12?\n\nt=10: y=0\n\nt=11: after action, y_{11}, can be 0 or 1 (if U or S from y=0)\n\nTo reach y=5 by t=12, we need to be at y=5 at turn t=12.\n\nAt turn t=12, position y_{12}.\n\nTo have y_{12}=5, we need to have moved up 5 steps from t=10 to t=12, but only 2 actions: from t=10 to t=11 and t=11 to t=12.\n\nFrom t=10 to t=11: one action, y_{11} = y_{10} + Δy_{10}, so y_{11} <=1 (since max U to 1)\n\nThen from t=11 to t=12: y_{12} = y_{11} + Δy_{11}, so y_{12} <= y_{11} +1 <=2\n\nCannot reach y=5 by t=12. Max y at t=12 is 2, if we go U both times.\n\nSimilarly, min is 0.\n\nSo at t=12, possible y from 0 to 2.\n\ny=0,1,2.\n\ny=0 safe, y=1 and 2 dangerous at t=12.\n\nSo to be safe at t=12, must be at y=0.\n\nThus, we must be at y=0 at turn t=12.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nNow, to be at y=0 at t=12, how?\n\nAt t=10, y=0.\n\nIf we do nothing, a_{10}=S, then y_{11}=0, t=11 y=0\n\nThen at t=11, y=0, we can do a_{11}=S, then y_{12}=0, t=12 y=0 safe.\n\nIf at t=10 we go U to y=1 at t=11, then at t=11 we must go D to y_{12}=0, to be safe at t=12.\n\nEither way, we are at y=0 at t=12.\n\nNow, from t=12 onwards, we need to go to y=9.\n\nBut there are dangers at t=14 and t=15 for y=5 and y=6.\n\nNow, from t=12, y=0.\n\nWe can start going up.\n\nt=12: y=0, safe\n\na_{12}: U to y_{13}=1\n\nt=13: y=1, now at t=13, is y=1 occupied? Earlier, not, only at t=12 for low rows, but t=13 is safe for all, as we saw.\n\nt=13: Δt=3, no row occupied.\n\nSo safe.\n\na_{13}: U to y_{14}=2\n\nt=14: y=2, now at t=14, y=2 is not dangerous? y=2 only dangerous at t=12, not at t=14.\n\nBut at t=14, y=5 and y=6 are dangerous.\n\ny=2 is safe at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, all rows except y=5 and y=6 at t=14 and t=15.\n\nSo at t=14, if we are on y=2, safe, since not 5 or 6.\n\ny=2 is freeway, but no car at 0 at t=14.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn this path: t=12 y=0\n\na_{12}=U: y_{13}=1, t=13 y=1 safe\n\na_{13}=U: y_{14}=2, t=14 y=2 safe\n\nNow a_{14}: U to y_{15}=3, t=15 y=3\n\nt=15: y=3, is it dangerous? Only y=5 and y=6 at t=15, y=3 safe.\n\na_{15}=U to y_{16}=4, t=16 y=4 safe\n\na_{16}=U to y_{17}=5, t=17 y=5\n\nNow at t=17, y=5, is it occupied? y=5 occupied at t=14 and t=15, but t=17 is later.\n\nAt t=17, Δt=7, for y=5: the car that matters, third car, left_end= -35 +6*7= -35+42=7>0, not occupied. Safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can continue up.\n\nBut we need to avoid y=5 and y=6 at t=14 and t=15.\n\nIn this path, at t=14 we are at y=2, not 5 or 6; t=15 at y=3, not 5 or 6, so safe.\n\nThen we can go up to y=9.\n\nBut let's see the turns.\n\nt=12: y=0\n\nt=13: y=1\n\nt=14: y=2\n\nt=15: y=3\n\nt=16: y=4\n\nt=17: y=5\n\nt=18: y=6? a_{17}=U to y_{18}=6\n\nt=18: y=6\n\nAt t=18, y=6: occupied?

From t=10 to t=20, actions at t=10 to 20, 11 actions, to reach at t=21.\n\nBut we started at t=10 y=0, and we were at y=0 until t=12.\n\nIn this sequence, we have delays.\n\nEarlier we must be at y=0 at t=12 to avoid collision.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nSuppose we go up immediately but avoid the low rows at t=12 by being at y=0 at t=12.\n\nMinimal H: we need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom t=12 y=0, it takes at least 9 turns to reach y=9, at t=21.\n\nBut we have two turns before: t=10 and t=11.\n\nAt t=10, we can do something.\n\nIf at t=10 we go U to y=1 at t=11.\n\nThen at t=11, we must go D to y=0 at t=12 to be safe.\n\nSo actions: a_{10}=U, a_{11}=D, then at t=12 y=0.\n\nSame as staying: a_{10}=S, a_{11}=S, t=12 y=0.\n\nIn both cases, we are at t=12 y=0 with two actions, but no progress.\n\nThen from there, as above, to y=9 at t=21.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nSuppose we are at higher y at t=12.\n\nBut earlier, at t=12, max y=2, but y=1 and 2 dangerous, so only y=0 safe.\n\nUnless we can be at y=5, but impossible as max y=2.\n\nSo must be at y=0 at t=12.\n\nThus, the soonest we can reach y=9 is after that.\n\nFrom t=12 y=0, we need 9 up moves to reach y=9.\n\nBut we might go faster, but since we can only move one per turn, minimum 9 turns from y=0 to y=9.\n\nSo from t=12, after 9 actions, at t=21 y=9.\n\nActions from t=12 to t=20, 9 actions.\n\nBut we have turns t=10 and t=11.\n\nIn those, we can only stay or go to y=1 and back, not gaining height.\n\nSo the minimal H is 11 actions: from t=10 to t=20, reach at t=21.\n\nBut we need to avoid the later dangers at y=5 and y=6 at t=14 and t=15.\n\nIn the above path, from t=12 y=0:\n\nt=12: y=0, a=U, y_{13}=1\n\nt=13: y=1, a=U, y_{14}=2\n\nt=14: y=2, a=U, y_{15}=3\n\nt=15: y=3, a=U, y_{16}=4\n\nt=16: y=4, a=U, y_{17}=5\n\nt=17: y=5, a=U, y_{18}=6\n\nt=18: y=6, a=U, y_{19}=7\n\nt=19: y=7, a=U, y_{20}=8\n\nt=20: y=8, a=U, y_{21}=9\n\nAt t=14, y=2, not 5 or 6, safe.\n\nt=15, y=3, not 5 or 6, safe.\n\nt=17, y=5, but t=17 not dangerous, safe.\n\nSimilarly t=18 y=6 safe.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nSuppose we go up faster after t=12.\n\nBut we can only move one per turn, so from y=0 to y=9 takes 9 turns, cannot be faster.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=5 or 6 before t=14 or after t=15 to avoid the danger times.\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=5 before t=14 or after t=15.\n\nBut from t=12 y=0.\n\nt=12: y=0\n\nIf we go up as fast as possible:\n\nt=12: U, y_{13}=1\n\nt=13: U, y_{14}=2\n\nt=14: U, y_{15}=3\n\nt=15: U, y_{16}=4\n\nt=16: U, y_{17}=5\n\nNow at t=17 y=5, which is after t=15, so safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need more up moves.\n\nt=17: y=5, U to y_{18}=6\n\nt=18: y=6, U to y_{19}=7\n\nt=19: y=7, U to y_{20}=8\n\nt=20: y=8, U to y_{21}=9\n\nSame as before, t=21 y=9.\n\nIf at t=14, we are at y=2, but we could go up faster? No.\n\nSuppose we reach y=5 earlier, but from t=12 y=0, earliest to y=5 is t=17: after 5 up moves, y_{17}=5.\n\nt=12: start y=0\n\na_{12} U: t=13 y=1\n\na_{13} U: t=14 y=2\n\na_{14} U: t=15 y=3\n\na_{15} U: t=16 y=4\n\na_{16} U: t=17 y=5\n\nYes, y=5 at t=17.\n\nBut t=14 and t=15 are danger times for y=5, but at t=14 we are at y=2, t=15 at y=3, not on y=5, so ok.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut we still reach y=9 at t=21.\n\nPerhaps we can slow down at higher rows to avoid, but no need, since y=7 and 8 safe.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 and 8 always safe, we can go directly to them, but we have to go through lower rows.\n\nPerhaps we can go up to y=4 or something and wait, but that might not help.\n\nFor example, at t=12 y=0.\n\nInstead of going up immediately, suppose we stay or something, but that delays more.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nSo minimal seems 11 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the sequence including the first two turns.\n\nWe need to be at y=0 at t=12.\n\nHow to get there from t=10.\n\nOption 1: a_{10}=S, then y_{11}=0, t=11 y=0\n\nThen a_{11}=S, y_{12}=0, t=12 y=0\n\nThen from t=12, as above.\n\nActions: t=10: S, t=11: S, t=12: U, t=13: U, ..., up to t=20: U, then at t=21 y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=10 to t=20, 11 actions.\n\nOption 2: a_{10}=U, then y_{11}=1, t=11 y=1\n\nThen a_{11}=D, y_{12}=0, t=12 y=0\n\nThen same as above from t=12.\n\nActions: t=10: U, t=11: D, t=12: U, t=13: U, ..., t=20: U, at t=21 y=9.\n\nStill 11 actions.\n\nIn both cases, we have a \"wasted\" action: either stay at start or up and down.\n\nBut necessary to avoid collision.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we also need to avoid y=5 and y=6 at t=14 and t=15.\n\nIn the above path, at t=14 we are at y=2, t=15 at y=3, both safe, no issue.\n\nAt t=16 y=4, t=17 y=5, but t=17>15, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in the sequence I have, from t=12: U to y13=1, U to y14=2, U to y15=3, U to y16=4, U to y17=5, U to y18=6, U to y19=7, U to y20=8, U to y21=9.\n\nAt t=18 y=6, which is safe since t=18 not dangerous.\n\nBut we can go faster? No.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 earlier by not waiting at start.\n\nBut we must be at y=0 at t=12, so cannot start earlier.\n\nAnother thought: what if we go down at some point? But y=0 is bottom, cannot go below.\n\nSo I think 11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see if we can be on y=5 at t=13 or something, impossible.\n\nPerhaps at t=14 and t=15, if we are not on y=5 or 6, but on other rows, which is fine.\n\nIn our path, we are not on them.\n\nBut to save time, suppose we go to y=4 at t=12? But at t=12, we can only be at y=0,1,2, and y=1,2 dangerous, so only y=0.\n\nNo choice.\n\nThus, minimal H=11.\n\nNow, for the sequence.\n\nWe need to specify actions from t=10 to t=10+H-1, with H=11, so actions at t=10 to t=20.\n\nAnd at t=21, y=9.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nAlso, we need to output the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, we have options for the first two actions.\n\nEither:\n\nSequence A: a10=S, a11=S, then a12=U, a13=U, a14=U, a15=U, a16=U, a17=U, a18=U, a19=U, a20=U\n\nOr sequence B: a10=U, a11=D, then a12=U, ..., a20=U\n\nIn both, from t=12 to t=20 all U.\n\nNow, which one to choose? Both should be fine.\n\nBut perhaps sequence B has a down move, which might be less efficient, but same number of moves.\n\nIn terms of the grid, moving down might not be necessary, but it works.\n\nSince we start at y=0, staying might be simpler.\n\nBut in the output, we need to specify.\n\nNow, about the later part: in the sequence, when we go from y=5 to y=6 at t=17 to t=18, etc., all safe.\n\nBut we need to ensure that at all turns, no collision.\n\nIn this path:\n\nt=10: y=0, safe\n\nt=11: in seq A, y=0 (if a10=S), safe; in seq B, y=1, at t=11, y=1 not occupied, safe.\n\nt=12: y=0, safe\n\nt=13: y=1, safe (not occupied)\n\nt=14: y=2, safe\n\nt=15: y=3, safe\n\nt=16: y=4, safe (y=4 only dangerous at t=12, not here)\n\nt=17: y=5, safe (t=17 not 14 or 15)\n\nt=18: y=6, safe\n\nt=19: y=7, safe\n\nt=20: y=8, safe\n\nt=21: y=9, goal.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=10?\n\nSuppose we reach y=9 at t=20.\n\nThat means at t=20, y=9.\n\nSo we need to be at y=9 at turn 20.\n\nFrom start, at t=10 y=0.\n\nIn 10 actions, we can go up 10 times, but y=9 is max, so if we go up 9 times and one extra move, but since at y=9, U not possible, so we must reach exactly with 9 up moves, but in 10 actions, we might have one stay or down, but that would delay.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn t, we need exactly 9 up moves and possibly some stays or downs, but downs would require extra ups, so more actions.\n\nMinimal actions to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9, all U, reaching at turn 19.\n\nBut with obstacles, we need more.\n\nWith 10 actions, if we have 9 U and one S, we reach at turn 19 with y=9? Actions from t=10 to t=18: 9 actions, all U, y19=9.\n\nBut in this case, we might collide if we are on dangerous spots.\n\nSpecifically, with all U from t=10: a10=U, y11=1, t=11 y=1 safe\n\na11=U, y12=2, t=12 y=2 collision! At t=12 on y=2.\n\nCannot.\n\nIf we start later, but we need to avoid t=12 on low rows.\n\nSuppose we do some other actions.\n\nFor example, at t=10: S, y11=0\n\nt=11: U, y12=1, but t=12 y=1 collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nt=10: U, y11=1\n\nt=11: S, y12=1, t=12 collision.\n\nt=10: U, y11=1\n\nt=11: D, y12=0, t=12 y=0 safe, but then we need to go up from there, but with actions, if we have only 10 actions to reach by t=20.\n\nActions from t=10 to t=19, 10 actions, reach at t=20 y=?\n\nAt t=10: action a10\n\nAfter a10, at t=11 y\n\n...\n\nAfter a19, at t=20 y\n\nWe want y=9 at t=20.\n\nNow, from above: one way is a10=U, a11=D, then at t=12 y=0\n\nThen we need to go to y=9 in the next 8 actions? Actions from t=12 to t=19: 8 actions.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=9, need at least 9 up moves, so in 8 actions, impossible to reach y=9.\n\nMax y with 8 up moves from y=0 is y=8 at turn 20, not 9.\n\nSimilarly, if a10=S, a11=S, t=12 y=0, then a12 to a19: 8 actions, max y=8 at t=20.\n\nCannot reach y=9 with H=10 actions.\n\nWith H=10 actions, we can be at y between 0 and 10, but y=9 max, so to reach y=9 at t=20, we need exactly 9 up moves and possibly other actions, but other actions would mean fewer up moves, so y less than 9.\n\nFor example, if we have 9 U and 1 S, we can reach y=9 at t=19 or t=20, depending on when the S is.\n\nBut with the obstacle, we cannot do all U early.\n\nIf we have the S at the beginning, but still, to avoid t=12 collision, we must not be on y=1-4 at t=12.\n\nSuppose we reach y=9 at t=19 with 9 actions all U from t=10 to t=18.\n\nBut at t=12, if we are on y=2, collision.\n\nIf we start with S or D, but then we miss an up move.\n\nFor example, a10=S, then a11 to a18: 8 U, but from t=11 to t=19, y from 0 to 8? Let's see:\n\nt=10: y=0, a10=S, y11=0\n\nt=11: y=0, a11=U, y12=1, t=12 y=1 collision.\n\na10=U, a11=D, y12=0, then a12=U, ..., a18=U? Actions a12 to a18: 7 actions, all U, from y=0 to y=7 at t=19, not 9.\n\nCannot reach y=9 with fewer than 11 actions in this case.\n\nThus H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow for the sequence, I think either way is fine.\n\nLet me write one sequence.\n\nUse sequence with stay:\n\nTurn t_10: S\n\nTurn t_11: S\n\nTurn t_12: U\n\nTurn t_13: U\n\nTurn t_14: U\n\nTurn t_15: U\n\nTurn t_16: U\n\nTurn t_17: U\n\nTurn t_18: U\n\nTurn t_19: U\n\nTurn t_20: U\n\nThen at t=21, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=10 to t=20.\n\nIn the output, it should be:\n\nTurn t_10: S\n\nTurn t_11: S\n\nTurn t_12: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_20: U\n\nWith the up and down sequence:\n\nTurn t_10: U\n\nTurn t_11: D\n\nThen same U from t_12 to t_20.\n\nBut the down move might seem unnecessary, but it works.\n\nI think the stay sequence is simpler.\n\nIn the stay sequence, at t=11, we are at y=0, which is fine.\n\nNow, in the answer format, we need to box it.\n\nAlso, for the later part, in this sequence, we go through y=5 at t=17 and y=6 at t=18, which are safe, no problem.\n\nBut earlier I thought about y=5 and y=6 at t=14,15, but we are not there at those times.\n\nSo all good.\n\nThus minimal H=11.\n\nNow write the sequence.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on rows \\(y = 1, 2, 3, 4\\) at turn 12 (when these rows are occupied) and not on rows \\(y = 5, 6\\) at turns 14 and 15 (when these rows are occupied). The player stays at \\(y = 0\\) for turns 10 and 11 to avoid the danger at turn 12, then moves up consistently to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 21.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- At turn 10, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\), avoiding any freeway.\n- At turn 11, stay (S) again to remain at \\(y = 0\\), safe and not on a freeway.\n- At turn 12, move up (U) to \\(y = 1\\); at turn 12, \\(y = 1\\) is dangerous, but the move occurs after the collision check, so \\(y = 1\\) is occupied at turn 13, which is safe.\n- From turns 13 to 20, move up (U) each turn to progress toward \\(y = 9\\), avoiding the danger zones at \\(y = 5\\) and \\(y = 6\\) during turns 14 and 15 by being on lower rows (\\(y = 2\\) and \\(y = 3\\)) at those times.\n\nThis sequence ensures:\n- Turn 10: \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not a freeway).\n- Turn 11: \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not a freeway).\n- Turn 12: \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not a freeway); action moves to \\(y = 1\\) for turn 13.\n- Turn 13: \\(y = 1\\) (freeway, but no car at position 0, safe).\n- Turn 14: \\(y = 2\\) (freeway, but no car at position 0, safe; \\(y = 5\\) and \\(y = 6\\) are dangerous but player is not on them).\n- Turn 15: \\(y = 3\\) (freeway, but no car at position 0, safe; \\(y = 5\\) and \\(y = 6\\) dangerous but player not on them).\n- Turn 16: \\(y = 4\\) (freeway, but no car at position 0, safe).\n- Turn 17: \\(y = 5\\) (freeway, but no car at position 0 as danger only at turns 14-15, safe).\n- Turn 18: \\(y = 6\\) (freeway, but no car at position 0 as danger only at turns 14-15, safe).\n- Turn 19: \\(y = 7\\) (freeway, always safe).\n- Turn 20: \\(y = 8\\) (freeway, always safe); action moves to \\(y = 9\\) for turn 21.\n- Turn 21: \\(y = 9\\) (goal reached, safe).\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1 = 10\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 20\\) is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_10: S \\\\\nTurn t_11: S \\\\\nTurn t_12: U \\\\\nTurn t_13: U \\\\\nTurn t_14: U \\\\\nTurn t_15: U \\\\\nTurn t_16: U \\\\\nTurn t_17: U \\\\\nTurn t_18: U \\\\\nTurn t_19: U \\\\\nTurn t_20: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn 12 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars move right or left at constant speeds, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a freeway at a certain turn, I don't collide with any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nFirst, I should figure out where the cars are at each turn. The cars are given at turn t1=12, and they move with constant speed. For right-moving cars, the span increases to the right, and for left-moving, it increases to the left. But in the description, for right-moving, it says span(t1) = [τ, h] and at T, it's [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]. Similarly for left, [h, τ] to [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)].\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] meaning τ is left end, h is right end? That might be confusing. Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for car k on freeway i, at turn t1, head at h, tail at τ. Then for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h]? But that would imply τ < h since it's a span, I assume. Then at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)], so the car moves right.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ], which might imply h < τ? But that could be messy. Probably, for consistency, we should think of the head as the front in the direction of motion.\n\nFor right-moving, head is front, so at t1, position from τ to h, with τ < h, and it moves right, so positions increase.\n\nFor left-moving, head is front, so at t1, from h to τ, but if it's moving left, head should be left if we think of decreasing x, but in the span, it might be better to always have min and max.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I should compute the position of the cars at any turn T relative to t1=12.\n\nAlso, collision occurs if at turn T, when the player is on freeway y_T, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway. Meaning if there's a car covering x=0 at that turn.\n\nAnd importantly, when you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you choose action to go to y_{T+1}, but during turn T, you are on y_T, so you check collision on y_T at turn T.\n\nThen after moving, at T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so you check collision on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so only check the freeway you're on at that turn.\n\nOkay.\n\nNow, player starts at (0,0) at turn 12, so y=0, which is not a freeway, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since no cars there.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), and we start from (0,0).\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no collision there.\n\nBut when we are on freeway y=1 to 8, we need to avoid cars.\n\nNow, the actions: U to move up, D down, S stay. But y is from 0 to 9, so at y=0, if I do D, I stay at 0, I think, since y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y in [0,9], so at y=0, D would still keep at 0, similarly at y=9, U keeps at 9.\n\nNow, to go from y=0 to y=9, I need to cross all freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since I need to go up 9 units, and each U moves up one, but I can stay or move down, but to minimize turns, I probably want to go up as much as possible, but I have to avoid cars, so I might need to wait or go down sometimes.\n\nBut going down might not help, since I need to reach y=9, so I should minimize unnecessary moves.\n\nSince I can only change y by -1,0,1 per turn, the minimal H to go from 0 to 9 is 9 turns if I always go up, but I might have to wait or detour due to cars.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the starting turn? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t1=12, I am at y=0.\n\nAfter one action, at turn t1+1, I go to some y.\n\nThen after H-1 actions? Let's read the sequence.\n\nIt says: sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H, the position is after H actions.\n\nBut the player position is defined at each turn before action? Let's see.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on action a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, before action, position is (0, y_t), then I choose a_t, which determines Δy_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn T when I am on y_T.\n\nFor turn T, I am at position (0, y_T), and if y_T is between 1 and 8, I need that for freeway k=y_T, no car has 0 in its span at that turn T.\n\nThen I choose action to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}, so H actions, and after H actions, I reach y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nAt turn t1, I start at y_{t1} = 0.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, I go to y_{t1 +1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}.\n\nThen after a_{t1+1}, y_{t1+2}, and so on, up to after a_{t1+H-1}, y_{t1+H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nThe number of turns from start to finish: at turn t1, I am at y=0, I take H actions to reach y=9 at turn t1+H.\n\nThe time taken is H turns, including H actions.\n\nMinimal H if no cars is 9, since I need to increase y by 9, each U increases by 1, so at least 9 U actions, but I can have S or D, but that would increase H, so minimal H is 9 with all U.\n\nBut with cars, I might need to insert S or even D to avoid, which increases H.\n\nFirst, I need to see for each freeway and each turn, whether x=0 is occupied by a car on that freeway.\n\nCars are on specific freeways, and for each freeway, there might be multiple cars.\n\nFreeway k has cars, and k from 1 to 8.\n\nIn the table, freeway k, and cars listed with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nBut head and tail, for right-moving, since direction right, head should be the right end, I think.\n\nIn the update rule, for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h], and since it's moving right, τ should be left, h right, so τ < h.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ], and moving left, so h should be left, τ right, so h < τ? That might be inconsistent.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I should define the position at time t.\n\nSet t1 = 12 as reference.\n\nFor any car, at turn T, the span can be computed.\n\nFirst, for a right-moving car: at t1, span is [τ, h] with τ <= h, meaning from x=τ to x=h.\n\nThen at turn T, since speed s, moving right, so each turn it moves s units right.\n\nSo position at T: [τ + s*(T - t1), h + s*(T - t1)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving car: at t1, span is [h, τ], but what is the order? If it's moving left, and span [h, τ], it might be that h and τ are such that it's from min to max.\n\nIn the update, it says: left-moving, span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nNow, if at t1, [h, τ], and after moving left, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if we assume [h, τ] means from smaller to larger, then for left-moving, if h < τ, then [h, τ] is from left to right, but moving left, so left end decreases.\n\nBut in the notation, for left-moving, it says span(t1) = [h, τ], but in the update, it becomes [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], which suggests that both ends decrease, so if h and τ are positions, and it moves left, we need to know which is left.\n\nTo simplify, I think for each car, at t1, the tail and head are given, with head being the front in the direction of motion.\n\nSo for right-moving car: head h is right end, tail τ is left end, so at t1, positions from τ to h, with τ <= h.\n\nAt T, positions from τ + s(T-t1) to h + s(T-t1)\n\nFor left-moving car: head h is front, which is left end since moving left, tail τ is right end, so at t1, positions from h to τ, with h <= τ.\n\nThen at T, moving left, positions from h - s(T-t1) to τ - s(T-t1)\n\nIn the data given, for freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nDirection right, so head h = -48, tail τ = -71? But -48 > -71, so if right-moving, head should be larger, so here h = -48, τ = -71, but -48 > -71, so τ = -71, h = -48, so min is τ = -71, max h = -48, so span from -71 to -48.\n\nThen at T, span from -71 + 24*(T-12) to -48 + 24*(T-12)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-48, -83, right, 36), so τ = -83, h = -48, span from -83 to -48 at t1=12.\n\nAt T, from -83 + 36*(T-12) to -48 + 36*(T-12)\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2, (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nFreeway 4: same, (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nFreeway 5: has three cars: (48, 37, right, 6), (12, 1, right, 6), (-24, -35, right, 6)\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nFor first car: (48,37,right,6), head=48, tail=37, so if right-moving, head should be larger, 48>37, so span from 37 to 48 at t1=12.\n\nAt T, from 37 + 6*(T-12) to 48 + 6*(T-12)\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,6), head=12, tail=1, 12>1, span from 1 to 12 at t1=12.\n\nAt T, from 1 + 6*(T-12) to 12 + 6*(T-12)\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,6), head=-24, tail=-35, -24 > -35, span from -35 to -24 at t1=12.\n\nAt T, from -35 + 6*(T-12) to -24 + 6*(T-12)\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5, three cars: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: (48,37,right,12), one car, head=48, tail=37, span from 37 to 48 at t1=12, at T from 37 + 12*(T-12) to 48 + 12*(T-12)\n\nFreeway 8: (48,37,right,4), head=48, tail=37, span from 37 to 48 at t1=12, at T from 37 + 4*(T-12) to 48 + 4*(T-12)\n\nAll cars are right-moving; no left-moving cars in this case.\n\nNow, I need to find, for each freeway k=1 to 8, and for each turn T, whether x=0 is covered by any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThat is, for a given k and T, if there is a car on freeway k such that 0 is in [left, right] of its span at T.\n\nSince multiple cars, if any car covers 0.\n\nBut for each freeway, I need to check all cars on it.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway the cars and their spans over time.\n\nSince time is discrete, I can compute for each T when 0 is covered.\n\nAlso, the player starts at turn 12, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe path must avoid being on a freeway when 0 is covered for that freeway at that turn.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should go up as fast as possible, but if a freeway is occupied at the time I cross, I need to delay or something.\n\nSince I can stay or move down, but moving down might not help directly, I can wait at y=0 or at safe spots.\n\ny=0 is safe, and y=9 is safe, but freeways in between.\n\nAlso, I can be on a freeway only when it's safe.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway k, the set of turns T where it is safe to be on k, i.e., no car covers x=0.\n\nThat is, for each k, find T such that for all cars on k, 0 not in span at T.\n\nThen, for the player, I need a sequence of y positions, starting from y=0 at turn 12, ending at y=9 at some turn, with y changing by -1,0,1 each turn, and for each turn T, if y_T between 1 and 8, it must be safe at that T.\n\nThen find such sequence with minimal number of turns.\n\nSince y starts at 0, ends at 9, and must go through 1 to 8, the minimal number of steps is at least 9, but with waits, more.\n\nFirst, let's find the safe times for each freeway.\n\nStart with freeway 1: k=1, one car: at t1=12, span [τ, h] = [-71, -48] for right-moving, so left = -71, right = -48.\n\nAt turn T, left position L(T) = -71 + 24*(T-12)\n\nRight position R(T) = -48 + 24*(T-12)\n\n0 is covered if L(T) <= 0 <= R(T)\n\nSo -71 + 24(T-12) <= 0 <= -48 + 24(T-12)\n\nFirst inequality: -71 + 24(T-12) <= 0 => 24(T-12) <= 71 => T-12 <= 71/24 = 2.9583, so T-12 <= 2 since T integer, T <= 14\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 + 24(T-12) => 48 <= 24(T-12) => 2 <= T-12 => T >= 14\n\nSo T >= 14 and T <= 14? T >=14 and T <=14, so only at T=14, 0 is covered.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nL(T) = -71 + 24(T-12)\n\nR(T) = -48 + 24(T-12)\n\n0 in [L,R] iff L <=0 and 0<=R\n\nL <=0: -71 +24(T-12) <=0 => 24(T-12) <=71 => T-12 <= 71/24 = 2.958, so T-12 <= 2, T <= 14\n\n0<=R: 0 <= -48 +24(T-12) => 48 <= 24(T-12) => 24(T-12) >=48 => T-12 >= 2 => T >=14\n\nSo T>=14 and T<=14, so T=14.\n\nThus for freeway 1, unsafe only at T=14. Safe for all other T.\n\nNow freeway 2: k=2, car (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nHead h=-48, tail τ=-83, so left L = τ = -83, right R = h = -48 at T=12.\n\nAt T, L(T) = -83 + 36(T-12)\n\nR(T) = -48 + 36(T-12)\n\n0 covered if L(T) <=0 and 0<=R(T)\n\nL <=0: -83 +36(T-12) <=0 => 36(T-12) <=83 => T-12 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.3055, so T-12 <=2, T<=14\n\n0<=R: 0 <= -48 +36(T-12) => 48 <=36(T-12) => 36(T-12) >=48 => T-12 >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so T-12 >= 2? 48/36=4/3=1.333, so T-12 >= 2 since T integer? T-12 must be at least ceil(1.333)=2? Let's see.\n\n36(T-12) >=48, divide both sides by 12: 3(T-12) >=4, so T-12 >= 4/3 ≈1.333, so since T integer, T-12 >= 2? No.\n\nT-12 must satisfy 3(T-12) >=4, so T-12 >= 2 since 3*1=3<4, 3*2=6>=4, so T-12 >=2, T>=14\n\nSimilarly, L<=0: 36(T-12) <=83, T-12 <= 83/36≈2.305, so T-12 <=2, T<=14\n\nThus T>=14 and T<=14, so only T=14 unsafe for freeway 2.\n\nT=14: L(14) = -83 +36(2) = -83+72= -11 <=0\n\nR(14) = -48 +72=24 >=0, so 0 in [-11,24], yes.\n\nFor other T, not both true.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2, (-48,-83,right,36), so same, unsafe only at T=14.\n\nFreeway 4: same, unsafe only at T=14.\n\nNow freeway 5: k=5, three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6), head=48, tail=37, so at T=12, span [37,48]\n\nAt T, L1(T) = 37 + 6(T-12)\n\nR1(T) = 48 + 6(T-12)\n\n0 covered if L1 <=0 and 0<=R1\n\nBut L1(T) =37 +6(T-12) >=37 >0 for all T, since T>=12, T-12>=0, L1>=37>0, so 0 <= L1 always, so 0 cannot be <= R1 when L1>0, so 0 never covered by this car, since min position is 37 at T=12, increasing.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,6), at T=12, [1,12]\n\nL2(T) =1 +6(T-12)\n\nR2(T) =12 +6(T-12)\n\n0 covered if L2 <=0 and 0<=R2\n\nL2 <=0: 1 +6(T-12) <=0? But 1 + something non-negative, min at T=12, L2=1>0, so L2(T) >=1 >0 for all T, so never L2<=0, thus 0 never covered.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,6), head=-24, tail=-35, so at T=12, span [-35,-24]\n\nL3(T) = -35 +6(T-12)\n\nR3(T) = -24 +6(T-12)\n\n0 covered if L3 <=0 and 0<=R3\n\nL3 <=0: -35 +6(T-12) <=0 => 6(T-12) <=35 => T-12 <= 35/6 ≈5.833, so T-12 <=5, T<=17\n\n0<=R3: 0 <= -24 +6(T-12) => 24 <=6(T-12) => 4 <= T-12 => T>=16\n\nSo for T>=16 and T<=17\n\nT=16: L3(16) = -35 +6(4) = -35+24= -11 <=0\n\nR3(16) = -24 +24=0 <=0? 0 <=0, which is true, since 0<=0 is included? The inequality is 0 <= R3, and R3=0, so yes, 0 <=0 is true.\n\nSimilarly, L3 <=0, -11<=0 true.\n\nT=17: L3(17) = -35 +6(5) = -35+30= -5 <=0\n\nR3(17) = -24 +30=6 >=0, so yes.\n\nT=18: L3= -35+36=1>0, so L3>0, not covered.\n\nSo for third car, 0 covered at T=16 and T=17.\n\nNow for freeway 5, since there are three cars, but first two never cover 0, only third car can, so freeway 5 unsafe at T=16 and T=17.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5, three cars identical, so unsafe at T=16 and T=17.\n\nNow freeway 7: k=7, one car (48,37,right,12)\n\nAt T=12, [37,48]\n\nL(T) =37 +12(T-12)\n\nR(T) =48 +12(T-12)\n\nL min 37>0, so 0 never covered, always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: k=8, one car (48,37,right,4)\n\nL(T) =37 +4(T-12) >=37>0, so always safe.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 always safe.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway, unsafe times:\n\nk=1: unsafe at T=14\n\nk=2: unsafe at T=14\n\nk=3: unsafe at T=14\n\nk=4: unsafe at T=14\n\nk=5: unsafe at T=16,17\n\nk=6: unsafe at T=16,17\n\nk=7: always safe\n\nk=8: always safe\n\nk=1,2,3,4 all unsafe only at T=14.\n\nk=5 and 6 unsafe at T=16 and 17.\n\nk=7 and 8 always safe.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn 12, y=0.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nEach move, I can change y by -1,0,1.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should go up when possible.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on unsafe freeway at unsafe times.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If I am on y=k at turn T, and k is unsafe at T, collision.\n\nNow, y=k for k=1 to 8.\n\nAt turn 12, I am at y=0, which is safe.\n\nI can choose to go to y=1 or stay at 0 or go down, but down to -? y min 0, so at y=0, D or S keep at 0.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, U or S keep at 9.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe unsafe times are only at specific points.\n\nFor example, T=14 is unsafe for y=1,2,3,4.\n\nT=16 and 17 unsafe for y=5 and 6.\n\ny=7 and 8 always safe.\n\nI need to plan the sequence of y positions.\n\nLet me denote the turn and y.\n\nStart: turn 12, y=0.\n\nI want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nIf no cars, I can go up each turn: turn 12 y=0, a=U, turn13 y=1, a=U, ..., up to turn20 y=8, a=U, turn21 y=9.\n\nBut with cars, I need to check for each turn when I am on freeway.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nAt turn 13, y=1, but y=1 is unsafe only at T=14, not at T=13, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 14, y=2? Let's see:\n\nturn 12: y=0 (safe)\n\na=U, turn13: y=1 (freeway 1)\n\nAt T=13, y=1, is it safe? Freeway 1 unsafe only at T=14, not 13, so safe.\n\nThen turn13, a=U, turn14: y=2\n\nAt T=14, y=2, but y=2 is freeway 2, unsafe at T=14! Oh, collision.\n\nSo at turn14, if y=2, since freeway 2 unsafe at T=14.\n\nSimilarly, if I were on y=1,2,3,4 at T=14, all unsafe.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn14 y=2, unsafe.\n\nSo need to avoid being on y=1,2,3,4 at turn 14.\n\nSimilarly, for T=16 and 17, avoid y=5 and 6.\n\nNow, also, at turn 16 and 17, y=5 and 6 unsafe.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nI need to be not on freeways 1-4 at T=14.\n\nSimilarly, not on 5-6 at T=16,17.\n\nSince I start at turn12 y=0, I can delay moving up.\n\nFor example, I can stay at y=0 for some turns.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9 fast.\n\nSimilarly, I can go up to a safe freeway before or after.\n\nNow, let's think about the critical times.\n\nFirst, for T=14, I must not be on y=1,2,3,4.\n\nThat means, at turn 14, I must be either y=0, or y=5,6,7,8, or y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so safe.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 are freeways, but at T=14, y=5 and 6 are safe since unsafe only at 16,17; y=7 and 8 always safe.\n\nSo at turn 14, I can be at y=0, or y=5,6,7,8, or y=9.\n\nSimilarly, for T=16 and 17, I must not be on y=5 or 6.\n\nAt T=16, if I am on y=5 or 6, unsafe; otherwise safe.\n\nSimilarly for T=17.\n\nNow, I start at turn12 y=0.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H might be more than 9.\n\nLet me try to go up as fast as possible but avoid the bad times.\n\nSuppose I stay at y=0 for a few turns.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 until after T=14.\n\nTurn12: y=0\n\nIf I do S, turn13: y=0\n\nAgain S, turn14: y=0\n\nAt turn14, y=0, safe.\n\nThen after that, I can go up.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom turn14 y=0, I can start going up.\n\nBut now I have to deal with T=16 and 17 for y=5 and 6.\n\nSimilarly, if I go up earlier, but avoid T=14 on low freeways.\n\nAnother idea: go up quickly to y=4 or higher before T=14, but y=1,2,3,4 are all unsafe at T=14, so if I am on y=4 at T=14, it is unsafe.\n\nThe only safe positions at T=14 are y=0 or y>=5.\n\ny=5 is freeway 5, which is safe at T=14, since unsafe only at 16,17.\n\nSimilarly y=6 safe at T=14.\n\nSo I need to be at y=0 or y>=5 at turn 14.\n\nSimilarly, for T=16 and 17, I need to not be on y=5 or 6.\n\nNow, from start, turn12 y=0.\n\nI can go up to y=5 before turn 14, but turn 14 is T=14.\n\nLet's see the turns.\n\nTurn 12: I am at y=0.\n\nAfter action, turn 13 y= something.\n\nI need to be at y>=5 by turn 14? Turn 14 is the time when I must not be on y=1,2,3,4.\n\nAt turn 14, position y_14.\n\nIf I can reach y=5 by turn 14, that would be good.\n\nBut from y=0 to y=5, I need at least 5 up moves, which take at least 5 turns.\n\nFrom turn 12 to turn 14, only 2 actions: a12 and a13.\n\nAfter a12, turn13 y= y12 + delta.\n\nAfter a13, turn14 y= y13 + delta.\n\nStart: turn12 y=0\n\nAfter a12, turn13 y = 0 + delta12, which can be 0 or 1 (since at y=0, D and S give 0, U gives 1)\n\nThen after a13, turn14 y = y13 + delta13.\n\ny13 can be 0 or 1.\n\nTo have y14 >=5, since y13 <=1, and delta13 <=1, so y14 <= y13 +1 <=2, which is less than 5. Impossible to reach y=5 by turn14.\n\ny14 <=2 at most.\n\nFor example, if a12=U, turn13 y=1\n\na13=U, turn14 y=2\n\nOr if a12=S, turn13 y=0, a13=U, turn14 y=1\n\na12=D, same as S.\n\nOr a12=U, turn13 y=1, a13=S, turn14 y=1\n\na12=U, turn13 y=1, a13=D, turn14 y=0\n\nSo y14 can be 0,1,2.\n\nAll <=2 <5, so impossible to be at y>=5 at turn14.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is to be at y=0 at turn14.\n\nBecause y=0 is safe, and y>=5 impossible.\n\nSo must be at y=0 at turn14.\n\nNow, at turn14, y=0.\n\nFrom turn12 to turn14, I need to be at y=0 at turn14.\n\nNow, at turn12, y=0.\n\nAfter a12, turn13 y = 0 + delta12\n\nThen after a13, turn14 y = y13 + delta13\n\nI need turn14 y=0.\n\nSo y13 + delta13 =0.\n\ny13 is either 0 or 1.\n\nIf y13=0, then delta13=0 or -1, but at y=0, delta= -1 or 0 keeps y=0.\n\nIf y13=1, then delta13 must be -1 to get to y=0.\n\nSo possible actions:\n\nCase 1: at turn12, a12=S or D, then turn13 y=0\n\nThen at turn13, a13=S or D, turn14 y=0\n\nCase 2: at turn12, a12=U, turn13 y=1\n\nThen at turn13, a13=D, turn14 y=0\n\nIn both cases, I end up at y=0 at turn14.\n\nNow, I need to minimize turns, so I should not waste actions; but here I have to be at y=0 at turn14, so I might as well stay at y=0 for these turns.\n\nFor example, a12=S, a13=S, or a12=D, a13=D, same, or a12=U, a13=D, but that goes to y=1 and back, which takes two actions but ends at same place, no benefit, so better to just stay with S.\n\nSo I can do: turn12: S, turn13: S, then turn14: y=0.\n\nNow, from turn14, I am at y=0, and I need to go to y=9.\n\nNow, I have to avoid being on y=5 or 6 at turn16 and 17.\n\nTurn16 and 17 are critical for y=5 and 6.\n\nNow, at turn14, y=0.\n\nI can start going up.\n\nLet me denote the turn from turn14 onwards.\n\nSet T=14 as a new reference if needed, but keep absolute turns.\n\nTurn14: y=0\n\nI want to reach y=9 asap.\n\nBut need to not be on y=5 at T=16 or T=17, and not on y=6 at T=16 or T=17.\n\nNow, y=7 and 8 always safe, so no problem.\n\nNow, from y=0, I need to cross y=1 to 8.\n\nThe unsafe times are T=16 and 17 for y=5 and y=6.\n\nSo I need to make sure that when I am on y=5, it is not T=16 or 17.\n\nSimilarly for y=6.\n\nNow, since I start from turn14 y=0.\n\nLet me assume I go up as fast as possible from here.\n\nTurn14: at y=0, I can do U to go to y=1 at turn15.\n\nActions:\n\nAt turn T, I choose a_T, which affects y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn14, position y=0.\n\nI choose a14, then y15 = y14 + delta14.\n\nSince y14=0, delta14=U: +1, D:0, S:0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nTo go up fast, I should choose U when possible.\n\nBut need to avoid bad times.\n\nSuppose I do:\n\nTurn14: a14=U, then y15=1\n\nTurn15: a15=U, y16=2\n\nTurn16: a16=U, y17=3\n\nTurn17: a17=U, y18=4\n\nTurn18: a18=U, y19=5\n\nBut at turn19, y=5, and T=19, which is after 17, so safe for y=5, since unsafe only at 16,17.\n\nSimilarly, continue.\n\nBut at turn16, y=2, which is freeway 2, but at T=16, is it safe? Freeway 2 unsafe only at T=14, not at 16, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn17 y=3, freeway 3, safe at T=17, since only unsafe at 14.\n\nNow, at turn18 y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nTurn19 y=5, freeway 5, T=19, not 16 or 17, safe.\n\nThen turn19 a19=U, y20=6\n\ny=6 at T=20, safe, since unsafe only 16,17.\n\nTurn20 a20=U, y21=7\n\nTurn21 a21=U, y22=8\n\nTurn22 a22=U, y23=9\n\nReached y=9 at turn23.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nI started from turn14 at y=0, and reached turn23 at y=9, so 9 turns from turn14, but from turn12 to turn14 I used 2 turns to stay, so total from turn12 to turn23 is 11 turns? Let's list the turns.\n\nTurn12: y=0, we did a12=S (say)\n\nTurn13: y=0 (after a12=S), a13=S\n\nTurn14: y=0 (after a13=S)\n\nNow from turn14: y=0\n\na14=U, turn15: y=1\n\na15=U, turn16: y=2\n\na16=U, turn17: y=3\n\na17=U, turn18: y=4\n\na18=U, turn19: y=5\n\na19=U, turn20: y=6\n\na20=U, turn21: y=7\n\na21=U, turn22: y=8\n\na22=U, turn23: y=9\n\nSo at turn23, y=9.\n\nH is the number of actions from t1 to t1+H-1, to reach at t1+H.\n\nt1=12.\n\nSequence of actions from a12 to a_{12+H-1}, and y_{12+H} =9.\n\nAt turn12, before action, y=0.\n\nAfter a12, y13.\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{12+H-1}, y_{12+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, y23=9, so after a22, y23=9.\n\nSo actions from a12 to a22, that is t=0 to 10, so H=11 actions? t from 0 to H-1, so a12 to a_{12+H-1}, and y_{12+H} =9.\n\nHere y23=9, so 12+H=23, H=11.\n\nActions: a12 to a22.\n\nBut I can reach faster?\n\nFor example, after turn14 y=0, I go up faster, but I can only go one per turn.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=5 or 6 before T=16 or after T=17.\n\nIn the above, I was on y=5 at T=19, which is fine.\n\nBut I was on low freeways at T=16 and T=17, but at T=16 I was on y=2, which is safe, T=17 y=3 safe.\n\nNow, to save time, I need to reach higher earlier.\n\nBut from turn14 y=0, I need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: 9 actions to go up, but I might have to wait for y=5 and 6.\n\nIn this case, I didn't wait, but I was late for y=5 and 6.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=4 quickly, but at T=16 and 17, y=5 and 6 are unsafe, but if I can be above before that.\n\nFrom turn14 y=0.\n\nSuppose I go up as fast as possible:\n\nTurn14: a14=U, y15=1\n\nTurn15: a15=U, y16=2\n\nBut at turn16, if y=2, safe, but now I need to go to y=3, etc.\n\nTurn16: a16=U, y17=3\n\nTurn17: a17=U, y18=4\n\nTurn18: a18=U, y19=5\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut at turn16, y=2, which is fine.\n\nNow, if I want to be at y=5 earlier, but from y=0, to y=5, min 5 turns: turn15 y=1, turn16 y=2, turn17 y=3, turn18 y=4, turn19 y=5.\n\nTurn19 is after T=17, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=5 before T=16, I need y=5 at turn15 or earlier.\n\nBut at turn14 y=0, after a14, y15 <=1, so y15=1 at best, then y16=2 at best, cannot reach y=5 before turn19? From turn14:\n\nAfter a14: y15 <=1\n\nAfter a15: y16 <=2\n\nAfter a16: y17 <=3\n\nAfter a17: y18 <=4\n\nAfter a18: y19 <=5\n\nSo earliest to reach y=5 is turn19.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at turn20, etc.\n\nIn the sequence above, I reached y=9 at turn23.\n\nBut I can go faster through the safe freeways.\n\ny=7 and 8 are always safe, so I can go through them quickly.\n\nBut I have to go through y=5 and 6.\n\nIn the sequence, I am on y=5 at turn19, y=6 at turn20, both after T=17, so safe.\n\nNow, what about T=16 and 17? I need to not be on y=5 or 6 at those turns.\n\nIn this sequence, at T=16, I am on y=2, not 5 or 6.\n\nT=17, y=3, not 5 or 6.\n\nSo fine.\n\nBut can I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I start going up earlier, but I had to stay until turn14.\n\nFrom turn12, I could have gone up to y=1 or something, but at turn14 I must be at y=0, so I cannot be higher.\n\nUnless I go up and then down, but that wastes actions.\n\nFor example: turn12: U, turn13 y=1\n\nThen turn13: D, turn14 y=0\n\nBut this takes two actions to end at y=0, same as doing S,S, but with extra move, so worse.\n\nSo better to just stay at y=0 for turn12 and turn13 actions.\n\nNow, from turn14 y=0, I go up, but perhaps I can skip some levels or something, but no, I have to go through each.\n\nAnother thing: at T=16 and 17, if I am not on y=5 or 6, but I could be on y=7 or 8, but I can't reach that fast.\n\nFor example, to be at y=7 at turn16.\n\nBut from turn14 y=0, after a14: y15<=1\n\na15: y16<=2\n\nCannot reach y=7.\n\nSimilarly, impossible.\n\nSo the sequence above seems necessary.\n\nBut let's see if I can avoid the delay for y=5 and 6 by being there at different times.\n\nFor example, if I go to y=5 before T=16, but I can't, since earliest y=5 is turn19.\n\nTurn19 is T=19>17, so after.\n\nSimilarly, if I could be after T=17, but that's later.\n\nAnother idea: stay at some safe point.\n\nFor example, after reaching y=4, I can stay there until after T=17, but y=4 is safe except at T=14, but T=14 passed.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, which is unsafe only at T=14, so after that, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 unsafe at T=16,17, so before or after safe.\n\nBut to go to y=5, I need to be at y=4 first.\n\nIn the sequence, I reach y=4 at turn18.\n\nThen I go to y=5 at turn19.\n\nBut at turn18 y=4, I could stay, but why? If I stay, I delay reaching y=9.\n\nFor example, turn18: at y=4, if I do S, then turn19 y=4, then a19=U, turn20 y=5, later.\n\nWorse.\n\nSimilarly, at y=5, if I stay, but at T=16,17 I need to avoid, but I am on y=5 at turn19, which is fine.\n\nNo need to stay.\n\nNow, back to the sequence: from turn14 y=0, I go up each turn to y=9 at turn23.\n\nBut y=9 reached at turn23.\n\nTotal actions from turn12: a12 to a22, 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach earlier by going through the freeways differently.\n\nNotice that y=7 and 8 are always safe, so I can go faster through them, but I still need to go through lower ones.\n\nAnother point: at T=16 and 17, y=5 and 6 unsafe, so I need to be not there.\n\nBut if I can be at y=5 before T=16 or after T=17.\n\nSince I cannot before, only after.\n\nSimilarly for y=6.\n\nIn the sequence, I am on y=5 at T=19>17, fine.\n\nBut T=19 is fine.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=5 earlier? No, from turn14 y=0, min turn to y=5 is turn19.\n\nturn14: y=0\n\na14=U, turn15 y=1\n\na15=U, turn16 y=2\n\na16=U, turn17 y=3\n\na17=U, turn18 y=4\n\na18=U, turn19 y=5\n\nYes, turn19.\n\nThen to y=6 turn20, y=7 turn21, y=8 turn22, y=9 turn23.\n\nNow, but at turn20 y=6, T=20>17, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut can I save a turn somewhere?\n\nFor example, if I go to y=1 earlier, but I had to be at y=0 at turn14.\n\nSuppose at turn12, I do something else.\n\nTurn12: y=0, if I do U, turn13 y=1\n\nThen at turn13, I must be at y=0 at turn14, so I need to do D at turn13, turn14 y=0.\n\nBut then I was at y=1 at turn13, which is safe, since freeway 1 unsafe only at T=14.\n\nThen back to y=0 at turn14.\n\nBut compared to staying, I used U and D, same as S and S, no gain.\n\nWorse if I consider actions, but same number.\n\nThen from turn14 same as before.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nPerhaps I can go to higher freeway directly, but no, I have to go step by step.\n\nAnother idea: at turn16 and 17, if I am on y=7 or 8, but I can't reach that fast.\n\nPerhaps I can delay going to y=5 until after T=17.\n\nBut in the sequence, I go at turn19, which is after.\n\nIf I go later, it would be worse.\n\nFor example, suppose I stay at y=4 for a turn.\n\nBut y=4 is safe, but staying delays.\n\nSo not good.\n\nTherefore, the sequence above seems optimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nAlso, for freeway 5 and 6, unsafe at T=16 and 17, but in my sequence, I am not on them at those times.\n\nNow, the player path:\n\nTurn | y | action previous? Let's list the state and actions clearly.\n\nAt turn T, position y_t, then I choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nIn the output, it should be the action at each turn.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t: a_t\n\nFor t from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAnd after H actions, y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, t1=12.\n\nStart: turn12, y=0.\n\nI need to choose a12, a13, ..., up to a_{12+H-1}, and y_{12+H}=9.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nTo be at y=0 at turn14, I can set a12=S, so after a12, turn13 y=0\n\na13=S, turn14 y=0\n\nThen a14=U, turn15 y=1\n\na15=U, turn16 y=2\n\na16=U, turn17 y=3\n\na17=U, turn18 y=4\n\na18=U, turn19 y=5\n\na19=U, turn20 y=6\n\na20=U, turn21 y=7\n\na21=U, turn22 y=8\n\na22=U, turn23 y=9\n\nSo y23=9, so after a22, y23=9.\n\nThus actions from a12 to a22, that is 11 actions: t from 12 to 22.\n\nH=11, since t=0 to H-1 with H=11, t=0 to 10, a12 to a21? Let's index.\n\nt1=12.\n\nSequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo t=0: a_{12}, t=1: a_{13}, ..., t=H-1: a_{12+H-1}\n\nThen y_{12+H} =9.\n\nHere y23=9, so 12+H=23, H=11.\n\nActions: for t=0 to 10: a12 to a22? t=0: a12, t=1: a13, ..., t=10: a22.\n\nt from 0 to H-1=10, so a12 to a22.\n\nAnd y_{23}=9.\n\nIn the sequence, I have a12 to a22.\n\nBut in the actions, for turn12, I put a12=S.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, but in the freeways, at turn16, y=2, freeway 2, which is safe at T=16, since unsafe only at 14.\n\nSimilarly, turn17 y=3, freeway 3, safe.\n\nTurn19 y=5, freeway 5, T=19 not 16 or 17, safe.\n\nEtc.\n\nBut is there a way to reach y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, if I could be on y=5 at turn18, but from above, impossible because from turn14 y=0, min y=5 at turn19.\n\nUnless I start from higher, but I start at y=0 turn14.\n\nAnother thought: at turn12, I am at y=0, but I could go to y=1 at turn13, but then I must be back to y=0 at turn14, so no gain.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=4 quickly and stay, but still.\n\nSuppose I do not stay at turn12 and 13, but go up to y=4 before turn14, but earlier we saw impossible to reach y=4 before turn18? From turn12.\n\nTurn12: y=0\n\na12=U, turn13 y=1\n\na13=U, turn14 y=2\n\nBut at turn14 y=2, which is unsafe! Because freeway 2 unsafe at T=14.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf I do a12=U, turn13 y=1, then at turn13, if I do S, turn14 y=1, but freeway 1 unsafe at T=14, collision.\n\nIf I do D, turn14 y=0, safe, but I was at y=1 at turn13, which is safe, but then at turn14 y=0.\n\nSame as before, but I used U and D instead of S and S, same effect.\n\nThen from turn14 y=0 same as before.\n\nSo no faster.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can avoid the wait for y=5 and 6 by being there at safe times.\n\nIn this case, I am on y=5 at turn19, which is safe.\n\nBut turn19 is late.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=6 before T=16, but impossible.\n\nFor example, to be at y=6 at turn16.\n\nBut from turn14 y=0:\n\na14=U, turn15 y=1\n\na15=U, turn16 y=2, not 6.\n\nCannot.\n\nSo must be after.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is fixed.\n\nNow, but in the output, I need to list the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, I have a12=S, a13=S, but S is stay.\n\nSince at y=0, D also stays, but S is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nAlso, for freeway 5 and 6, at T=16 and 17 unsafe, but I am not there.\n\nIn my sequence, at turn16, y=2, turn17 y=3, both safe.\n\nIs there any other constraint?\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 always safe, no issue.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut perhaps I can go down or something, but that would increase H, so worse.\n\nTherefore, the action sequence should be:\n\nTurn 12: S  (or D, but S is better to denote stay)\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nAfter a22, y23=9.\n\nIn terms of turns, actions from turn12 to turn22.\n\nIn the sequence, turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nH=11, t=0 to 10: turn12 to turn22.\n\nNow, but in the output, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn 12: a_{12}\n\nTurn 13: a_{13}\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 22: a_{22}\n\nWith actions as above.\n\nBut in the action, at turn18: U to y=5, etc.\n\nNow, but I think I missed something.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 5 and 6, there are multiple cars, but we already considered.\n\nAnother thing: the collision is only if on the freeway and 0 covered at that turn.\n\nIn this path, no collision.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 faster by taking advantage of the safe freeways, but I don't see how.\n\nFor example, if I could jump, but I can only change by 1.\n\nSo I think 11 turns is minimal.\n\nBut let's count the number of up moves: from y=0 to y=9, I need 9 up moves, and in this sequence, I have two S at the beginning, and then all U, so 9 U and 2 S, total 11 actions.\n\nThe two S are necessary to wait until turn14.\n\nWithout waiting, I would collide at turn14.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nIn the action sequence, I used S for stay.\n\nBut in the output, it should be clear.\n\nNow, write in the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbers.\n\nt1=12.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nAfter Turn 22 action U, position at turn 23 is y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 16, action U, y=2 to y=3? Let's see:\n\nAt turn 16: position y=2 (after previous actions)\n\nThen a16=U, so y17 = y16 +1 =2+1=3\n\nSimilarly, turn17: y=3, a17=U, y18=4\n\nturn18: y=4, a18=U, y19=5\n\netc.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, I think that's the answer.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the answer format, it only shows the sequence, but H is implied.\n\nIn the box, it should list the actions.\n\nPerhaps I should write it.\n\nBut in the freeway, for k=5, we have cars, and at T=16 and 17, unsafe, but I avoided.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if at some point I might be collided, but no.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, the collision is only at the current turn on the current freeway.\n\nFor example, when I go from y=4 to y=5 at turn18 to turn19, at turn18 I am on y=4, safe, then after move, at turn19 on y=5.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) is 11. This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a freeway when it is unsafe (i.e., when a car covers \\(x = 0\\) on that freeway at that turn).\n\n### Key Points from Analysis:\n- **Unsafe Times for Freeways**:\n  - Freeways 1, 2, 3, and 4 are unsafe only at turn \\(T = 14\\).\n  - Freeways 5 and 6 are unsafe at turns \\(T = 16\\) and \\(T = 17\\).\n  - Freeways 7 and 8 are always safe.\n- **Turn 14 Constraint**: To avoid collision at \\(T = 14\\), the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, as \\(y = 0\\) has no cars) or \\(y \\geq 5\\). However, from turn 12 at \\(y = 0\\), it is impossible to reach \\(y \\geq 5\\) by turn 14 due to the maximum vertical movement of 1 per turn. Thus, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 14.\n- **Achieving \\(y = 0\\) at Turn 14**: From turn 12 (\\(y = 0\\)), the player can stay at \\(y = 0\\) for turns 12 and 13 using \"S\" actions, resulting in \\(y = 0\\) at turn 14.\n- **Path to \\(y = 9\\)**: After turn 14, the player moves up (\"U\") every turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible. The earliest \\(y = 5\\) can be reached is turn 19 (after the unsafe turns 16 and 17), and \\(y = 9\\) is reached at turn 23.\n- **Minimal Turns**: The sequence includes 2 \"S\" actions (to wait at \\(y = 0\\)) and 9 \"U\" actions (to ascend from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 9\\)), totaling 11 actions. Any deviation (e.g., moving up earlier or delaying further) increases \\(H\\) or causes collisions.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{12 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{10}\\) (for \\(H = 11\\)) is as follows. Each action determines the vertical movement for the next turn.\n\n- **Turn 12**: \\(a_{12} = S\\)  \n  (Player stays at \\(y = 0\\); turn 13 position: \\(y = 0\\))\n- **Turn 13**: \\(a_{13} = S\\)  \n  (Player stays at \\(y = 0\\); turn 14 position: \\(y = 0\\) – safe, avoids unsafe freeways 1-4 at \\(T = 14\\))\n- **Turn 14**: \\(a_{14} = U\\)  \n  (Player moves to \\(y = 1\\); turn 15 position: \\(y = 1\\) – freeway 1 safe at \\(T = 15\\))\n- **Turn 15**: \\(a_{15} = U\\)  \n  (Player moves to \\(y = 2\\); turn 16 position: \\(y = 2\\) – freeway 2 safe at \\(T = 16\\))\n- **Turn 16**: \\(a_{16} = U\\)  \n  (Player moves to \\(y = 3\\); turn 17 position: \\(y = 3\\) – freeway 3 safe at \\(T = 17\\))\n- **Turn 17**: \\(a_{17} = U\\)  \n  (Player moves to \\(y = 4\\); turn 18 position: \\(y = 4\\) – freeway 4 safe at \\(T = 18\\))\n- **Turn 18**: \\(a_{18} = U\\)  \n  (Player moves to \\(y = 5\\); turn 19 position: \\(y = 5\\) – freeway 5 safe at \\(T = 19\\) (not 16 or 17))\n- **Turn 19**: \\(a_{19} = U\\)  \n  (Player moves to \\(y = 6\\); turn 20 position: \\(y = 6\\) – freeway 6 safe at \\(T = 20\\) (not 16 or 17))\n- **Turn 20**: \\(a_{20} = U\\)  \n  (Player moves to \\(y = 7\\); turn 21 position: \\(y = 7\\) – freeway 7 always safe)\n- **Turn 21**: \\(a_{21} = U\\)  \n  (Player moves to \\(y = 8\\); turn 22 position: \\(y = 8\\) – freeway 8 always safe)\n- **Turn 22**: \\(a_{22} = U\\)  \n  (Player moves to \\(y = 9\\); turn 23 position: \\(y = 9\\) – goal reached)\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 23 (after 11 actions) with no collisions, as verified against the car positions and unsafe times.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 14, and I start at y=0. I can move up, down, or stay each turn, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each future turn because that determines when it's safe to be on a particular freeway row.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t_1=14, and they move left or right with constant speed. The direction is given: \"right\" means moving to the right, so for right-moving cars, the span increases with time, and for left-moving, it decreases.\n\nThe collision condition is that at turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at that turn. Since the player is always at x=0, we care about whether x=0 is covered by any car on the row I'm on at that turn.\n\nAlso, importantly, when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn. So if I move at turn T, I'm on y_T at turn T, and I move to y_{T+1} at the end of turn T, so I'm on y_{T+1} starting from turn T+1.\n\nThe player update: at turn t, I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAnd collision at turn T depends on y_T, which is the row I'm on during turn T.\n\nIf I choose to move at turn T, I change rows, so for collision at turn T, it's based on y_T, not the new position.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, I'm only on row y_T, so I only care about cars on row y_T at time T.\n\nCars on other rows don't affect me at that turn.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions to get to y=9 quickly.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and it's not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars. The vertical axis is y=0,1,2,...,9, and freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so I can be there safely at any time.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so when I get to y=9, I'm done.\n\nNow, the cars are given for each freeway k from 1 to 8.\n\nLet me list the cars for each row at t=14.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nDirection right, so it's moving right. Head and tail: it says head at -48, tail at -71? That seems backward because usually head is the front.\n\nFor right-moving cars, it says: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving? Let me read carefully.\n\nCar update rules:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, at t_1, span is [τ, h], with τ < h I assume, since it's moving right, so τ is left end, h is right end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h left, τ right? No.\n\nLet's clarify notation.\n\nIt says: for left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\" and then it moves to [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so since it's moving left, decreasing x, so h and τ both decrease.\n\nBut [h, τ] – is h the head or tail?\n\nIn the text: for left-moving: \"head is at h, tail is at τ\" and span is [h, τ], and since it's moving left, head is at left? This is confusing.\n\nPerhaps I should think in terms of the position.\n\nFor a car, the span is the set of x-coordinates it occupies.\n\nAt time t, for a left-moving car, with head at h_t, tail at τ_t, and span [h_t, τ_t], but if it's moving left, and head is the front, then when moving left, head should have smaller x, tail larger x? No.\n\nI think there's inconsistency in notation.\n\nLet me look at the car state given.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nIt says \"cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nSo for freeway 1: head = -48, tail = -71, direction right, speed 24.\n\nNow, for a right-moving car, if it's moving right, the head should be on the right, tail on the left, so head > tail.\n\nHere head = -48, tail = -71, and -48 > -71, so yes, head at -48 (right), tail at -71 (left), so span from τ=-71 to h=-48, so [ -71, -48 ]? But the text says for right-moving, span is given as [τ, h], which would be [-71, -48], so min to max.\n\nIn the update, for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so both increase.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, if head and tail, with head left, tail right, so span [h, τ] with h < τ.\n\nBut in the given, for freeway 5,6,7,8, there are multiple cars or something.\n\nFreeway 1 has one car: head -48, tail -71, right, speed 24.\n\nAt t=14, span is [τ, h] = [-71, -48] for right-moving? From the text: for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h], so [ -71, -48 ].\n\nThen at time T, span is [ -71 + 24*(T-14), -48 + 24*(T-14) ]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision when 0 is in the span at time T for a car on that row.\n\nSince multiple cars per row possible, but for row 1, only one car.\n\nSimilarly, row 2: (-48, -83, right, 36) head -48, tail -83, right, speed 36. So span at t=14: [ -83, -48 ]? [τ, h] = [-83, -48]\n\nThen at T: [ -83 + 36*(T-14), -48 + 36*(T-14) ]\n\nRow 3: same as row 2? (-48, -83, right, 36) same as row 2.\n\nRow 4: same, (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nNow row 5: has three cars: (48, 37, right, 6), (12, 1, right, 6), (-24, -35, right, 6)\n\nAll right-moving, speed 6.\n\nFor first car: head 48, tail 37? Head 48, tail 37, but 48>37, so if right-moving, head at 48 (right), tail at 37 (left), so span [τ, h] = [37, 48] at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, second car: head 12, tail 1, span [1,12]\n\nThird car: head -24, tail -35? Head -24, tail -35, since -24 > -35, so span [ -35, -24 ]\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, row 6: same as row 5: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nRow 7: (48,37,right,12) one car? Head 48, tail 37, right, speed 12. Span [37,48] at t=14.\n\nRow 8: (48,37,right,4) head 48, tail 37, right, speed 4. Span [37,48] at t=14.\n\nNow, I need to find for each row, at what times the point x=0 is covered by a car on that row.\n\nThat is, for each row, find the set of times T where 0 is in some car's span on that row.\n\nThen, for me to be on that row at time T, it must not be one of those times for that row.\n\nI start at y=0 at t=14, and I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 to y=9, so I need to move up through the rows.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1, so to go from y=0 to y=9, I need at least 9 moves, but I can stay or move down, so minimum turns might be more if I have to avoid cars.\n\nBut since I can stay, I might wait sometimes.\n\nBut to minimize H, I want to go as fast as possible.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the starting point? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=14 to t=14+H-1, so after H turns, I am at turn t=14+H-1, and y=9.\n\nAt turn t, I perform action a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t=14, I am at y_14 = 0.\n\nI choose a_14, which determines y_15.\n\nThen at turn t=15, I am at y_15, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, I am at turn t=14+k, position y_{14+k}.\n\nI need y_{14+H-1} = 9? Let's see the index.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}.\n\nThen after H actions, I am at time t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut I need to reach (0,9), which I assume is when y_t = 9 for some t.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), and it says \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nLet's read: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nIn the action sequence, for t from 0 to H-1, actions a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nThen after these actions, at time t_1 + H, the position is y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut the position at turn T is y_T, which is after the action at T-1, I think.\n\nDefine carefully.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, the player is at position (0, y_t).\n\nThen during turn t, they choose action a_t, which determines the movement, so after action, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at the next turn t+1, they are at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nCollision is checked at turn T based on y_T and the cars at that time.\n\nFor the goal, when y_t = 9 for some t, we stop.\n\nThe sequence is for actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and after that, at time t_1 + H, we have y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nBut y_{t_1 + H} is the position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nAnd y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nNow, the number of turns from start to finish: at turn t_1, we are at y=0, we take H actions, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, we are at y=9.\n\nSo we have performed H actions over H turns: from turn t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, and we are done at turn t_1 + H.\n\nThe minimal H such that we can achieve y_{t_1 + H} = 9 with no collisions during the turns t_1 to t_1 + H - 1? Collision during the turns when we are on the freeways.\n\nDuring each turn T from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, we are at y_T, and if y_T between 1 and 8, we must not collide with cars on that row at time T.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H, we are at y=9, which is safe, so no collision check needed or it's fine.\n\nNow, to find min H and the action sequence.\n\nFirst, since I start at y=0, which is safe, and end at y=9, safe, I need to go through rows 1 to 8, but I can skip some or stay, but to go up, I need to increase y.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid the times when cars are at x=0 on the rows I'm on.\n\nSo I need to compute for each row, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when some car covers x=0.\n\nThen for each possible path, I need to ensure that for each turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, it is safe at that time.\n\nSince I move one row at a time, I can think of the times when I can be on each row.\n\nLet me define the unsafe periods for each row.\n\nSet t_rel = T - 14, so time relative to now.\n\nAt t_rel = 0, T=14.\n\nFor each freeway row k, find for each car, the times when 0 is in its span.\n\nThen the row is unsafe if any car on it has 0 in span.\n\nStart with row 1.\n\nRow 1: one car, right-moving, span at T: [ -71 + 24*(T-14), -48 + 24*(T-14) ]\n\nSet Δt = T - 14.\n\nSpan: [ -71 + 24 Δt, -48 + 24 Δt ]\n\n0 is in span if -71 + 24 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 24 Δt\n\nSo solve inequalities:\n\nLeft: -71 + 24 Δt ≤ 0 => 24 Δt ≤ 71 => Δt ≤ 71/24 = 2.9583\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -48 + 24 Δt => 24 Δt ≥ 48 => Δt ≥ 48/24 = 2\n\nSo for Δt from 2 to 2.9583, approximately.\n\nSince time is integer, Δt integer, T integer.\n\nSo Δt >= ceil(48/24) = ceil(2) = 2\n\nΔt <= floor(71/24) = floor(2.9583) = 2? Let's see.\n\n0 <= -48 + 24 Δt => 24 Δt >= 48 => Δt >= 2\n\nAnd -71 + 24 Δt <= 0 => 24 Δt <= 71 => Δt <= 71/24 = 2.9583, so since Δt integer, Δt <= 2? Δt <= floor(2.9583) = 2? But 24*2 = 48, -48 + 48 = 0, so 0 <= 0 is true.\n\nAnd -71 + 48 = -23 <= 0, true.\n\nAt Δt=3: -71 + 72 =1 >0? -71 + 24*3 = -71 + 72 =1, which is >0, so left end 1 >0, so 0 not <= left end? 0 <= 1 is true, but span [left, right], 0 in span if left <=0 and 0<=right? No.\n\n0 in [left, right] if left <= 0 <= right.\n\nAt Δt=2: left = -71 + 48 = -23, right = -48 + 48 =0, so -23 <= 0 <= 0, true.\n\nAt Δt=3: left = -71 + 72 =1, right = -48 + 72 =24, so 1 <= 0 <=24? 0 < 1, so 0 not >= left, so false.\n\nAt Δt=1: left = -71 + 24 = -47, right = -48 + 24 = -24, so -47 <= 0 <= -24? 0 <= -24 false.\n\nSo only at Δt=2, T=16, row 1 is unsafe.\n\nΔt=2, T=14+2=16.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nRow 1 unsafe only at T=16.\n\nNow row 2: car (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nSpan at T: [ -83 + 36 Δt, -48 + 36 Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -83 + 36 Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 36 Δt\n\nLeft: -83 + 36 Δt <= 0 => 36 Δt <= 83 => Δt <= 83/36 ≈ 2.3055\n\nRight: 0 <= -48 + 36 Δt => 36 Δt >= 48 => Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333\n\nSo Δt >= ceil(1.333) = 2? Since integer.\n\nΔt >= 48/36 = 4/3, so since Δt integer, Δt >= 2\n\nΔt <= floor(83/36) = floor(2.3055) = 2\n\nAt Δt=2: left = -83 + 72 = -11, right = -48 + 72 =24, so -11 <=0<=24, true.\n\nAt Δt=1: left = -83 + 36 = -47, right = -48 + 36 = -12, 0 not in [-47,-12]\n\nAt Δt=3: left = -83 + 108 =25, right= -48+108=60, 0 not in [25,60]\n\nSo only at T=16, row 2 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, row 3: same car as row 2, (-48,-83,right,36), so same as row 2, unsafe only at T=16.\n\nRow 4: same, unsafe only at T=16.\n\nNow row 5: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6) span at T: [37 + 6 Δt, 48 + 6 Δt] since right-moving, [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [37 + 6 Δt, 48 + 6 Δt]\n\n0 in span if 37 + 6 Δt <= 0 <= 48 + 6 Δt\n\nBut 37 + 6 Δt >= 37 >0 for Δt >=0, so left end >=37>0, so 0 < left, never <=0, so 0 not in span for this car. Always safe from this car.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,6) span [1 + 6 Δt, 12 + 6 Δt]\n\n0 in span: 1 + 6 Δt <= 0 <= 12 + 6 Δt\n\n1 + 6 Δt <=0? 6 Δt <= -1, impossible since Δt >=0. So never true. This car always has left end >=1>0, so 0 not covered.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,6) head -24, tail -35, so span [ -35 + 6 Δt, -24 + 6 Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -35 + 6 Δt <= 0 <= -24 + 6 Δt\n\nLeft: -35 + 6 Δt <= 0 => 6 Δt <= 35 => Δt <= 35/6 ≈ 5.833\n\nRight: 0 <= -24 + 6 Δt => 6 Δt >= 24 => Δt >= 24/6 =4\n\nSo Δt >=4 and Δt <=5.833, so Δt=4,5\n\nAt Δt=4: left= -35 + 24 = -11, right= -24 + 24=0, so -11<=0<=0 true\n\nAt Δt=5: left= -35 + 30 = -5, right= -24 + 30=6, -5<=0<=6 true\n\nAt Δt=3: left= -35+18= -17, right= -24+18= -6, 0 not in [-17,-6]\n\nAt Δt=6: left= -35+36=1, right= -24+36=12, 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo for row 5, unsafe when Δt=4 or 5, T=18 or 19.\n\nT=14 + Δt, so T=18,19.\n\nNow row 6: same as row 5, cars (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6), so same as row 5, unsafe at T=18,19.\n\nNow row 7: one car (48,37,right,12) span [37 + 12 Δt, 48 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span: 37 + 12 Δt <= 0 <= 48 + 12 Δt, impossible since left end >=37>0. So always safe, no car covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, row 8: (48,37,right,4) span [37 + 4 Δt, 48 + 4 Δt], left end min 37>0, so always safe.\n\nRows 7 and 8 have no car that covers x=0, since all cars are to the right, moving right, left end at least 37 at t=14, and increasing, so x=0 never covered.\n\nSimilarly, row 1 to 4 have unsafe only at T=16, rows 5 and 6 unsafe at T=18,19.\n\nRow 1 to 4 unsafe at T=16, rows 5 and 6 unsafe at T=18 and 19.\n\nRows 7 and 8 always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nNow, I start at y=0, t=14.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nEach turn, I can move up, down, or stay.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on unsafe rows at unsafe times.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn T.\n\nSince I start at t=14, y=0.\n\nAfter k up moves, I can be at y=k, but I might have stays or downs, but to go up, min moves.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=9, I need at least 9 up moves, so min H such that after H actions, I am at y=9, so if I do all up, H=9, I would be at y=9 at t=14+9=23.\n\nBut I might be forced to wait or detour.\n\nNow, the unsafe times: at T=16, rows 1-4 are unsafe, so I should not be on rows 1,2,3,4 at T=16.\n\nAt T=18 and 19, rows 5 and 6 are unsafe, so not on row 5 or 6 at those times.\n\nNow, T=16 is in the future, relative to now t=14.\n\nt=14 is current.\n\nT=15,16,17,... etc.\n\nI need to plan the sequence.\n\nSince rows 7 and 8 are always safe, I can be on them anytime.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nThe critical points are rows 1-4 at t=16, and rows 5-6 at t=18,19.\n\nI need to avoid being on row 1,2,3, or 4 at exactly t=16.\n\nSimilarly, avoid row 5 or 6 at t=18 or t=19.\n\nNow, to go up, I can go directly or delay.\n\nSince I start at t=14, y=0.\n\nAt t=14, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nI choose action: I can go up to y=1, or stay, or down, but down to y=0 not possible since min y=0, or I can stay.\n\nBut to progress, I should go up.\n\nBut let's see the times.\n\nSuppose I go up at each turn if possible.\n\nStart: t=14, y=0\n\nAction a_14: if U, then y_15 =1\n\nThen at t=15, I am at y=1.\n\nt=15: I can choose action.\n\nNow, what about row 1 at t=15? Is it safe?\n\nRow 1 unsafe only at t=16, so at t=15, row 1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, all rows are safe at t=15 except possibly others, but from above, only specific times unsafe.\n\nAt t=15, Δt=1, for row 1: at Δt=1, as before, not unsafe, safe.\n\nSimilarly, other rows safe at t=15.\n\nOnly specific times are critical.\n\nAt t=15, y=1 is safe.\n\nThen I can go up to y=2 at t=16? But at t=16, if I am on row 1,2,3,4, it is unsafe.\n\nIf at t=15 I am at y=1, and I choose action at t=15.\n\nIf I choose U, then y_16 =2, so at t=16, I am at y=2, which is row 2, unsafe at t=16.\n\nSimilarly, if I choose S, y_16=1, row 1 unsafe.\n\nIf I choose D, y_16=0, safe.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nTo avoid being on row 1-4 at t=16, I have a few options:\n\n- Be below row 1 at t=16, i.e., y=0\n\n- Be above row 4 at t=16, i.e., y>=5\n\n- Or not be on row 1-4, but since rows are discrete, y=0 or y>=5.\n\ny=0,1,2,3,4,5,... so at t=16, if y=0, safe; y=5 or above, safe; y=1,2,3,4 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly for other unsafe times.\n\nNow, at t=16, unsafe rows 1-4.\n\nt=16 is in two turns from now.\n\nCurrent t=14.\n\nAt t=14, y=0.\n\nI need to choose actions.\n\nOption 1: stay at y=0 until after t=16, then go up.\n\nBut that might take more time.\n\nFor example, at t=14, stay: a_14=S, then y_15=0\n\nAt t=15, still y=0, safe.\n\nThen at t=15, I can go up: a_15=U, then y_16=1? y_16 = y_15 + Δy_15.\n\nAt t=15, I am at y_15=0, choose a_15=U, then y_16=1.\n\nBut at t=16, y=1, which is unsafe! Row 1 unsafe at t=16.\n\nIf I stay at t=15: a_15=S, y_16=0, safe at t=16.\n\nThen after that, I can go up.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nSimilarly, I have the issue with rows 5-6 at t=18,19.\n\nFirst, let's handle t=16.\n\nTo avoid being on rows 1-4 at t=16, I can:\n\n- Be at y=0 at t=16\n\n- Or be at y>=5 at t=16\n\ny>=5 at t=16 means I have to go up fast from t=14 to t=16.\n\nt=14 to t=16: I have turns t=14 and t=15 to act.\n\nAt t=14, start y=0.\n\nAfter a_14, y_15.\n\nThen after a_15, y_16.\n\ny_16 depends on actions at t=14 and t=15.\n\nEach action can change y by -1,0,+1.\n\nFrom y=0, after two actions, min y=0 (S,S), max y=2 (U,U).\n\nSo y_16 can be from 0 to 2.\n\nCannot reach y=5 in two moves.\n\nMax y_16=2 if I do U,U.\n\nBut y=2 at t=16 is row 2, unsafe.\n\nIf I do S,S, y_16=0, safe.\n\nOr U,D: y_15=1, then a_15=D, y_16=0.\n\nOr S,U: y_15=0, a_15=U, y_16=1, unsafe.\n\nD not possible at y=0.\n\nSo only possibilities for y_16: if I do actions that end with y=0, which are:\n\n- S at t=14, S at t=15: y_16=0\n\n- U at t=14, then at t=15 y=1, D to y=0\n\n- S at t=14, U at t=15: but y_16=1, unsafe\n\n- U at t=14, S at t=15: y_16=1, unsafe\n\nSo only if I end up at y=0 at t=16, I am safe.\n\nThat is, I must be at y=0 at turn t=16.\n\nThus, at t=16, y must be 0.\n\nNow, similarly, for later times.\n\nNow, at t=16, y=0.\n\nThen I can start moving up.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\nAlso, there is the issue at t=18 and t=19 with rows 5 and 6.\n\nRows 5 and 6 unsafe at t=18 and t=19.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on row 5 or 6 at t=18 or t=19.\n\nThat is, at turn t=18, if y=5 or 6, unsafe; at t=19, if y=5 or 6, unsafe.\n\nNow, t=18 and t=19 are later.\n\nFirst, from t=16, y=0.\n\nt=16 is done, safe.\n\nNow at t=16, I am at y=0, choose action for t=16.\n\nI can go up or stay.\n\nIf I go up, y_17=1.\n\nThen at t=17, I am at y=1.\n\nI can go up to y=2, and so on.\n\nI need to be careful around t=18,19.\n\nt=18 is in two turns from t=16? t=16 to t=17 to t=18.\n\nt=16: I am at y=0 after turn? At turn t=16, I am at position y=0 (since we set y_16=0).\n\nThen I choose a_16, which sets y_17.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, let's list the times from t=16 onwards.\n\nt=16: y=0\n\nThen after a_16, y_17\n\nAfter a_17, y_18\n\nAfter a_18, y_19\n\nAfter a_19, y_20, etc.\n\nI need to avoid y=5 or 6 at t=18 and t=19.\n\nThat is, at turn t=18, y_18 should not be 5 or 6.\n\nAt turn t=19, y_19 should not be 5 or 6.\n\nNow, I also need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal path: from y=0, I need to go to y=9, which takes at least 9 up moves.\n\nBut I might need to wait or go slow to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nSince rows 7 and 8 are safe, I can go fast through 1-4 and 5-6 if possible.\n\nBut rows 5-6 unsafe at t=18,19.\n\nNow, let's see the sequence starting from t=16.\n\nAt t=16, y=0.\n\nI can choose to go up or stay.\n\nIf I go up immediately:\n\na_16 = U, then y_17 =1\n\nAt t=17, y=1, I can a_17 = U, y_18=2\n\nBut I need to go to higher y.\n\ny_18=2 at t=18.\n\nt=18, y=2, which is row 2, but row 2 is not unsafe at t=18, only rows 5-6 unsafe at t=18.\n\nAt t=18, unsafe only if on row 5 or 6.\n\nSimilarly at t=19.\n\nSo at t=18, if I am on row 2, it is safe, since row 2 unsafe only at t=16.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn this case, at t=18, y=2, safe.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut I need to avoid rows 5-6 at t=18 and t=19.\n\nCurrently at t=18, y=2.\n\nThen I can go up: a_18=U, y_19=3\n\nAt t=19, y=3, safe.\n\nThen a_19=U, y_20=4, and so on.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9.\n\nLet's compute the y over time.\n\nStart from t=16, y=0\n\nt=16: a_16=U, y_17=1\n\nt=17: a_17=U, y_18=2\n\nt=18: a_18=U, y_19=3\n\nt=19: a_19=U, y_20=4\n\nt=20: a_20=U, y_21=5\n\nt=21: a_21=U, y_22=6\n\nt=22: a_22=U, y_23=7\n\nt=23: a_23=U, y_24=8\n\nt=24: a_24=U, y_25=9\n\nThen at t=25, y=9.\n\nBut H is the number of actions to reach y=9 at time t_1 + H.\n\nt_1=14, we start at t=14, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some time.\n\nIn this sequence, from t=16 to t=25, but we have actions before.\n\nFirst, at t=14 and t=15, we need to be at y=0 at t=16.\n\nAs we decided earlier.\n\nAt t=14: we must do an action that leads to y_16=0.\n\nOptions: a_14=S, then y_15=0\n\nThen a_15=S, y_16=0\n\nOr a_14=U, y_15=1, then a_15=D, y_16=0\n\nBut D at y=1, y_16=0.\n\nBut going down might not be efficient, but it's possible.\n\nTo minimize time, better to stay than go up and down.\n\nBut both take two turns to stay at y=0.\n\na_14=S and a_15=S: after a_14, y_15=0; after a_15, y_16=0.\n\na_14=U, y_15=1; a_15=D, y_16=0.\n\nIn both cases, at t=15, y=0 or y=1, both safe since no issue at t=15.\n\nThen at t=16, y=0.\n\nNow, from above, if I go up directly from t=16, I reach y=9 at t=25.\n\nt=25 is t_1 + 11, since t_1=14, 14+11=25.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=14 to t=24 inclusive? Actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so for H actions, we reach at t_1 + H.\n\nHere, actions from t=14 to t=24, that's 11 actions? t=14 to t=24 is 11 turns? t=14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24: that's 11 actions.\n\nAfter 11 actions, y_{14+11} = y_{25} =9.\n\nBut we can do better?\n\nIn the sequence above, I have to avoid rows 5-6 at t=18 and t=19.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=18, y=2, safe; t=19, y=3, safe.\n\nBut I could go faster.\n\nFor example, from t=16, y=0, I can go up faster? I can only move one step at a time.\n\nBut I can be at higher y earlier to avoid the unsafe times later.\n\nFor rows 5-6, unsafe at t=18 and t=19.\n\nI need that at t=18, y not 5 or 6; at t=19, y not 5 or 6.\n\nSo y could be less than 5, or 7 or above, or I can be on row 5 or 6 at other times.\n\nSince rows 5-6 are safe except t=18 and t=19, I can be on them at other times.\n\nTo minimize time, I might go directly but skip the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, from t=16, y=0.\n\nIf I go up every turn:\n\nt=16: a=U, y_17=1\n\nt=17: a=U, y_18=2\n\nt=18: a=U, y_19=3\n\nt=19: a=U, y_20=4\n\nt=20: a=U, y_21=5\n\nBut at t=21, y=5, but row 5 unsafe only at t=18 and 19, so at t=21, it is safe? t=21, Δt=21-14=7, earlier for row 5, unsafe at Δt=4,5 T=18,19, so at t=21, safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can continue.\n\nBut from above, at t=20, y=4, then a_20=U, y_21=5, safe.\n\nThen a_21=U, y_22=6\n\nt=22, y=6, row 6, unsafe only at t=18,19, so t=22 safe.\n\nThen a_22=U, y_23=7\n\na_23=U, y_24=8\n\na_24=U, y_25=9\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut I reached y=5 at t=21, which is after t=19, so safe.\n\nI could reach y=5 earlier.\n\nt=16: y=0, a=U, y_17=1\n\nt=17: a=U, y_18=2\n\nBut at t=18, I can go up to y=3, as before.\n\nCan I be at y=5 at t=18? t=18 from t=16.\n\nt=16 to t=18: two actions.\n\nFrom y=0, after two up moves: y_17=1, y_18=2, max y=2 at t=18.\n\nCannot be higher.\n\nSimilarly, at t=19, from y=2 at t=18, a_18=U, y_19=3.\n\nStill low.\n\nNow, rows 5-6 unsafe at t=18 and t=19, so since I am below at that time, it's fine, but I go slow.\n\nI could stay at some point to be above when the unsafe time comes.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=7 or above at t=18, then I can avoid the issue.\n\nBut from t=16, y=0, to t=18: two actions, max y=2, cannot.\n\nt=18 is soon.\n\nt=16 to t=18 is turns t=16 and t=17.\n\nActions at t=16 and t=17 determine y_18.\n\ny_18: from y=0 at t=16, after a_16 and a_17.\n\ny_17 = y_16 + Δy_16 = 0 + Δy_16\n\ny_18 = y_17 + Δy_17\n\nSo y_18 between 0 and 2.\n\nCannot be 5 or above.\n\nSimilarly, at t=19, y_19: depends on previous.\n\ny_19 = y_18 + Δy_18\n\nSince y_18 <=2, y_19 <=3, so at t=19, y<=3, which is less than 5, so not on row 5 or 6, so automatically safe at t=18 and t=19 because I am below row 5.\n\nIn this case, since I start from y=0 at t=16, and I go up, I am at y<=3 at t=19, so I am not on rows 5 or 6 at t=18 or t=19, so no problem.\n\nThen I can continue up to y=9.\n\nBut it takes many turns.\n\nTo save time, since I had to stay at y=0 until t=16, I lost time.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9 faster.\n\nAnother idea: go up fast to be above row 4 before t=16.\n\nBut earlier, from t=14 to t=16, I can only reach y=2 at max, which is row 2, unsafe at t=16.\n\nBut row 4 is unsafe at t=16, and y=4 would be unsafe.\n\nBut I cannot reach y=5 at t=16.\n\ny=5 at t=16 requires starting from y=0 at t=14, after two moves, max y=2, impossible.\n\nSo the only safe at t=16 is y=0.\n\nThus, I must be at y=0 at t=16.\n\nNo choice.\n\nSimilarly, for rows 5-6, since I am low at t=18,19, no issue.\n\nBut I can go faster after t=16.\n\nIn the sequence, I go up one by one.\n\nBut rows 7 and 8 are always safe, so I can go through them fast.\n\nBut I have to go through 1-6 first.\n\nSince rows 1-4 are safe except t=16, and I am not on them at t=16, I can be on them at other times.\n\nIn my sequence, I go through them slowly.\n\nFor example, at t=17, I am at y=1, which is row 1, but row 1 unsafe only at t=16, so at t=17, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo go faster, I could have gone up earlier, but I couldn't because of t=16 constraint.\n\nAt t=14 and t=15, I have to stay or go down to be at y=0 at t=16.\n\nSo I waste two turns not going up.\n\nThen from t=16 to t=25 to reach y=9, total from t=14 to t=25, 11 actions to reach at t=25.\n\nBut let's list the sequence properly.\n\nFirst, for t=14 and t=15: to have y_16=0.\n\nI can choose, for example, both stay.\n\na_14 = S, then y_15 = 0 (since y_14=0, S, y_15=0)\n\nThen a_15 = S, y_16 = 0\n\nI could do a_14 = U, y_15=1, then a_15 = D, y_16=0, but that takes the same time and I go down, which is unnecessary, so better to stay.\n\nSo let's do a_14=S, a_15=S.\n\nThen at t=16, y=0.\n\nNow from t=16 onwards:\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nI can go up as fast as possible.\n\na_16 = U, y_17 =1\n\na_17 = U, y_18 =2\n\na_18 = U, y_19 =3\n\na_19 = U, y_20 =4\n\na_20 = U, y_21 =5\n\na_21 = U, y_22 =6\n\na_22 = U, y_23 =7\n\na_23 = U, y_24 =8\n\na_24 = U, y_25 =9\n\nNow, check collisions.\n\nAt each turn, when on freeway, must be safe.\n\nt=16: y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nt=17: y=1, row 1. Is it safe? Row 1 unsafe only at t=16, so at t=17, Δt=3, as before, not unsafe, safe.\n\nt=18: y=2, row 2. Row 2 unsafe only at t=16, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=19: y=3, row 3. Safe.\n\nt=20: y=4, row 4. Safe, since unsafe only at t=16.\n\nt=21: y=5, row 5. Now, row 5 unsafe at t=18 and 19, not at t=21, so safe.\n\nt=22: y=6, row 6, unsafe at t=18,19, not t=22, safe.\n\nt=23: y=7, row 7, always safe.\n\nt=24: y=8, row 8, always safe.\n\nt=25: y=9, goal, safe.\n\nNow, actions from t=14 to t=24, that's t=14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24: 11 actions.\n\nH=11, reach at t=25.\n\nBut can I do with fewer turns?\n\nFor example, if I can reach y=9 earlier.\n\nBut from t=16 y=0, min to y=9 is 9 up moves, so at least t=25.\n\nt=16 to t=25 is 9 actions? Actions at t=16 to t=24, 9 actions, y_25=9.\n\nBut we have actions at t=14 and t=15 as well, which were stay, so total 11 actions.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster after t=16 by not wasting time, but I have to move one by one.\n\nAnother thought: at t=17, I am at y=1, but I could go up multiple times, but I can only move one per turn.\n\nUnless I stay or something, but staying would slow me down.\n\nPerhaps for the rows 5-6, since they are unsafe at t=18,19, but I am below, but if I can be above earlier, but I can't because I start from low.\n\nSuppose at t=14, instead of staying, I go up, but I have to be at y=0 at t=16.\n\nIf I go up at t=14, y_15=1, then at t=15, I must go down to y_16=0.\n\nSo a_14=U, a_15=D, then y_16=0.\n\nThen at t=16, y=0.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut now, at t=15, I was at y=1, which is safe, since no issue.\n\nThen I go down to y=0 at t=16.\n\nThen from t=16, same sequence.\n\nBut going down might not help, and I have the same number of actions.\n\nWith a_14=U and a_15=D, I have two actions to be at y=0 at t=16, same as S,S.\n\nThen 9 up moves from t=16 to t=24, y_25=9.\n\nTotal 11 actions.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach y=9 before t=25.\n\nHow? From t=16 y=0, I need 9 steps to y=9, so cannot before t=25.\n\nt=16: after a_16, y_17=1\n\n...\n\nafter a_24, y_25=9\n\nSo y_25=9.\n\nIf I could start from higher, but I can't.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps I don't need to be at y=0 at t=16; I could be above row 4.\n\nBut as we saw, impossible to be y>=5 at t=16 from start.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps for rows 5-6, I can be on them before or after the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at t=17, I could be on row 5 if possible.\n\nBut from t=16 y=0, at t=17 y<=1, cannot be row 5.\n\nSimilarly, only later.\n\nSo I think 11 is the min.\n\nBut let's confirm the unsafe times for other rows.\n\nRow 7 and 8 always safe, no issue.\n\nIn the sequence, I have no problem.\n\nBut H=11, from t=14 to t=24 actions.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need the action sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=14 and t=15, I have stay.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nTurn t_1 =14.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 14: a_{14} = S\n\nTurn 15: a_{15} = S\n\nThen at t=16: a_{16} = U\n\nt=17: U\n\nt=18: U\n\nt=19: U\n\nt=20: U\n\nt=21: U\n\nt=22: U\n\nt=23: U\n\nt=24: U\n\nThen y_25=9.\n\nBut actions up to t=24, H=11 actions? t from 0 to H-1, t=0 to 10 for H=11? Let's index.\n\nSet t_rel = t - 14.\n\nActions for t_rel from 0 to H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nHere, actions at t_rel=0 (t=14) to t_rel=10 (t=24), H=11, reach at t=14+11=25.\n\nIn the sequence above, actions from t=14 to t=24 inclusive, 11 actions.\n\nBut can I save one turn?\n\nFor example, if I go up at t=15 or something.\n\nBut at t=15, if I go up, y_16=1, but then at t=16, y=1, unsafe.\n\nMust not.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=5 at t=17 or something, but impossible.\n\nAnother thought: the unsafe rows at t=18,19 are 5 and 6, but since I am below, it's fine, but if I could be on row 7 or 8 earlier, but I need to go through.\n\nSuppose at t=14, I do something different.\n\na_14 = U, then y_15=1\n\nAt t=15, instead of down, I could stay or up, but if I stay, y_16=1, unsafe; if up, y_16=2, unsafe.\n\nOnly down to y=0.\n\nNo choice.\n\nSo I think 11 is min.\n\nBut let's see if I can reduce after.\n\nFor example, from t=16 y=0, if I could skip some rows, but no, must move step by step.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster through the safe rows.\n\nRows 1-4 are safe except t=16, but since I am not on them at t=16, I can be on them at other times quickly.\n\nBut I still need to spend one turn per row.\n\nUnless I stay, but staying doesn't help.\n\nSo min 9 moves from y=0 to y=9, plus the two stays at beginning, total 11 actions.\n\nBut the two stays are necessary to avoid t=16.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 with fewer actions if I don't start from y=0, but I do.\n\nAnother idea: since y=9 is safe, I could go directly if possible, but no.\n\nOr, for the rows 5-6, since unsafe at t=18,19, but I could be on them at t=17 or t=20.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=5 at t=17.\n\nBut from t=16 y=0, at t=17 y<=1, impossible.\n\nt=20: y=5 possible, as in sequence.\n\nBut in sequence, at t=20 I am at y=4, then to y=5 at t=21.\n\nI could be at y=5 earlier? No.\n\nPerhaps from t=14, if I go up at t=14, y_15=1, then at t=15 I must go down, y_16=0, same as before.\n\nI think I cannot do better.\n\nBut let's check the car on row 5 and 6.\n\nRow 5 and 6 unsafe at t=18 and t=19 only.\n\nIn my sequence, I am on row 5 at t=21, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I can save one turn by not staying at some point.\n\nFor example, after t=16, I go up, but at some row I can skip by going faster, but no.\n\nSuppose at t=18, I am at y=2, but instead of going up, I could stay, but that slows me down.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to output the actions from t=14 to t=14+H-1=14+10=24? H=11, actions from t=14 to t=14+10=24, yes.\n\nt from 14 to 24 inclusive.\n\nIn the sequence: Turn 14: S, Turn 15: S, Turn 16: U, Turn 17: U, Turn 18: U, Turn 19: U, Turn 20: U, Turn 21: U, Turn 22: U, Turn 23: U, Turn 24: U\n\nBut let's list the y to confirm.\n\nt=14: y=0, action a_14=S, y_15=0\n\nt=15: y=0, action a_15=S, y_16=0\n\nt=16: y=0, action a_16=U, y_17=1\n\nt=17: y=1, action a_17=U, y_18=2\n\nt=18: y=2, action a_18=U, y_19=3\n\nt=19: y=3, action a_19=U, y_20=4\n\nt=20: y=4, action a_20=U, y_21=5\n\nt=21: y=5, action a_21=U, y_22=6\n\nt=22: y=6, action a_22=U, y_23=7\n\nt=23: y=7, action a_23=U, y_24=8\n\nt=24: y=8, action a_24=U, y_25=9\n\nNow, collision checks:\n\nAt each turn T, y_T:\n\nT=14: y=0, not freeway, safe\n\nT=15: y=0, not freeway, safe\n\nT=16: y=0, not freeway, safe\n\nT=17: y=1, row 1, at T=17, Δt=3, row 1 safe, as earlier\n\nT=18: y=2, row 2, at T=18, Δt=4, row 2 unsafe only at t=16, safe\n\nT=19: y=3, row 3, safe\n\nT=20: y=4, row 4, safe\n\nT=21: y=5, row 5, at T=21, Δt=7, row 5 unsafe at t=18,19, not t=21, safe\n\nT=22: y=6, row 6, similar, safe\n\nT=23: y=7, row 7, always safe\n\nT=24: y=8, row 8, always safe\n\nAnd T=25: y=9, goal.\n\nAll safe.\n\nNow, is there a sequence with H=10?\n\nSuppose H=10, then actions from t=14 to t=23, reach y_{24}=9.\n\nBut y_{24} must be 9.\n\nFrom start y=0 at t=14, to y_{24}=9.\n\nThe change: each action changes y by at most +1, so from y_14=0 to y_24=9, I need at least 9 up moves, so with 10 actions, I can have 9 up and one stay or down, but since I need net +9, if I have a down, I need extra up, so min 9 actions, but with 10 actions, I can have 9 up and one stay, or 10 up, etc.\n\nBut to reach y=9 in fewer turns, I need to start going up earlier.\n\nBut at t=14 and t=15, if I go up, I cannot be at y=0 at t=16.\n\nFor example, suppose a_14=U, y_15=1\n\na_15=U, y_16=2\n\nBut at t=16, y=2, unsafe, collision.\n\na_14=U, y_15=1\n\na_15=D, y_16=0, as before.\n\nThen from there, to y_{24}=9.\n\nFrom t=16 y=0, with actions to t=23, 8 actions? Actions t=16 to t=23, 8 actions.\n\ny_24 = y after 8 actions from y_16=0.\n\nMax y_24=8 if all up.\n\nThen y_24=8, not 9.\n\nIf I have 8 actions from t=16 to t=23, y_24 <= y_16 + 8 = 0+8=8 <9.\n\nCannot reach y=9 at t=24 with actions only up to t=23 if starting from y=0 at t=16.\n\nWith H=10 actions: from t=14 to t=23.\n\ny_24 = y after actions from t=14 to t=23.\n\ny_14=0.\n\nAfter 10 actions, y_24.\n\nSince y changes by -1,0,1 each step, y_24 <= y_14 + 10 = 10, but y<=9, so possible.\n\nBut to have y_24=9, net change +9, so I need at least 9 up moves, and the other action can be stay or down, but if down, I need extra up.\n\nMin actions: 9 up and possibly stays or downs, but with 10 actions, I can have 9 up and one stay, or 10 up, etc.\n\nBut in this case, from t=14 to t=23 actions.\n\nAt t=14, if I do U, y_15=1\n\nThen at t=15, I must not have y_16=1 or 2, etc., only y_16=0 safe.\n\nSo if a_15=D, y_16=0\n\nThen from t=16 to t=23, 8 actions to increase y from 0 to 9? Impossible, max to y=8.\n\ny_24 = y_16 + sum Δy from t=16 to t=23 actions.\n\n8 actions, max +8, y_24=8<9.\n\nIf at t=15 I do something else, but if a_15=S, y_16=1, unsafe; if U, y_16=2, unsafe.\n\nSo only a_15=D possible, y_16=0.\n\nThen y_24 <= 8 <9.\n\nIf I do a_14=S, y_15=0\n\nThen a_15=S, y_16=0\n\nThen from t=16 to t=23, 8 actions, y_24 <=8<9.\n\nOr a_14=S, y_15=0, then a_15=U, but y_16=1, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nThus, with H=10, I cannot reach y=9 at t=24, because I must be at y=0 at t=16, so from there, with 8 actions, only to y=8 at t=24.\n\nThen I need one more action to go to y=9 at t=25.\n\nThus H=11 is minimal.\n\nSimilarly, if I try to reach earlier, impossible.\n\nSo min H=11.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I have it.\n\nIn the sequence, I used all up after, but I could have stayed somewhere, but no need.\n\nIn the answer format, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut in the sequence above, I have two S at beginning, then all U.\n\nBut let's write it.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} for t_1=14.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut H=11, actions from t=14 to t=24.\n\nIn the sequence, Turn 14 to Turn 24.\n\nNow, to confirm, y at t=25 is 9.\n\nPerhaps I can start with a_14=U, a_15=D, then same actions from t=16.\n\nBut a_15=D, which is down, but it works, but S,S is simpler.\n\nIn terms of action, both fine.\n\nI think S,S is better.\n\nNow, in the car state, for row 5 and 6, there are multiple cars, but I think I handled the unsafe times correctly.\n\nRow 7 and 8, only one car each, far right, so safe.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n\nSo the sequence is above.\n\nNow for the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 14\\) with the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), the sequence of actions must avoid collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at each turn. The cars' positions and movements are such that:\n\n- Freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3, 4\\) are unsafe only at turn \\(T = 16\\) (relative to \\(t_1 = 14\\), meaning collision occurs if the player is on any of these rows at \\(T = 16\\).\n- Freeways \\(y = 5, 6\\) are unsafe at turns \\(T = 18\\) and \\(T = 19\\).\n- Freeways \\(y = 7, 8\\) are always safe, as no car covers \\(x = 0\\) at any time.\n- Positions \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) are always safe.\n\nTo minimize \\(H\\), the player must reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible while avoiding unsafe states. The analysis shows that:\n- At turn \\(T = 16\\), the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) to avoid collision, as it is impossible to be at \\(y \\geq 5\\) by \\(T = 16\\) from the starting position.\n- This requires actions at turns \\(t = 14\\) and \\(t = 15\\) that result in \\(y_{16} = 0\\), achieved by staying (S) at both turns.\n- After \\(T = 16\\), the player can move up (U) each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) in the fewest actions. The unsafe times for \\(y = 5, 6\\) at \\(T = 18, 19\\) are avoided because the player is below these rows during those turns (at \\(y = 2\\) and \\(y = 3\\), which are safe).\n\nThe minimal sequence involves:\n- 2 stay actions (S) at turns 14 and 15 to ensure \\(y_{16} = 0\\).\n- 9 up actions (U) from turns 16 to 24 to reach \\(y_{25} = 9\\).\n\nThus, \\(H = 11\\) turns (actions from turn 14 to turn 24), with the player reaching (0, 9) at turn 25.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n- Turn 14: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\))\n- Turn 15: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\))\n- Turn 16: U (move to \\(y = 1\\))\n- Turn 17: U (move to \\(y = 2\\))\n- Turn 18: U (move to \\(y = 3\\))\n- Turn 19: U (move to \\(y = 4\\))\n- Turn 20: U (move to \\(y = 5\\))\n- Turn 21: U (move to \\(y = 6\\))\n- Turn 22: U (move to \\(y = 7\\))\n- Turn 23: U (move to \\(y = 8\\))\n- Turn 24: U (move to \\(y = 9\\))\n\nCollision checks confirm safety at all turns:\n- Turns 14, 15, 16: \\(y = 0\\), not a freeway, safe.\n- Turn 17: \\(y = 1\\), row safe at \\(T = 17\\).\n- Turn 18: \\(y = 2\\), row safe at \\(T = 18\\).\n- Turn 19: \\(y = 3\\), row safe at \\(T = 19\\).\n- Turn 20: \\(y = 4\\), row safe at \\(T = 20\\).\n- Turn 21: \\(y = 5\\), row safe at \\(T = 21\\).\n- Turn 22: \\(y = 6\\), row safe at \\(T = 22\\).\n- Turn 23: \\(y = 7\\), always safe.\n- Turn 24: \\(y = 8\\), always safe.\n\nNo sequence with \\(H < 11\\) is possible, as the constraint at \\(T = 16\\) requires two initial stays, and 9 up moves are needed to reach \\(y = 9\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn 16 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9. Cars move left or right at constant speed, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway at a turn where a car on that freeway spans x=0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car positions at any future turn T. The current turn is t₁ = 16. For each car, given its head, tail, direction, and speed, I can find where it is at turn T.\n\nThe car update is given as:\n\n- Left-moving: Span at T is [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says for left-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nBut for left-moving, if it's moving left, the head should be on the right, so decreasing x. Similarly, right-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nThe notation is a bit messy. Let me interpret.\n\nFor left-moving cars, the span at t₁ is given as (h, τ) with h and τ, but it says Span(t₁) = [h, τ] for left-moving? But if it's moving left, and h is head, τ is tail, probably h > τ since moving left.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, Span(t₁) = [τ, h], which might imply τ < h.\n\nI think I need to assume that for any car, the head is the front when moving, so for left-moving, head is right, for right-moving, head is left.\n\nIn the description:\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [h, τ]\" and it moves to [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)], so since it's moving left, h should be greater than τ, I assume, so [h, τ] might be from high to low, but usually we write intervals with min first.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me see the values.\n\nFor example, on freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nDirection right, so this is right-moving car.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t₁) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head.\n\nHere τ = -71, h = -48? -48 is greater than -71, so if moving right, head should be on the right, so at t₁, head is at -48, tail at -71? But -48 > -71, so tail is left, head is right.\n\nThen Span(t₁) = [τ, h] = [-71, -48]? But it says \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving, so [tail, head], which from left to right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [head, tail] with head right, tail left, so decreasing.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24), and direction right, so since right-moving, τ should be tail, h head, so τ = -71, h = -48.\n\nSimilarly, for others.\n\nIn the table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nSo for each car, it's given as (h, τ, d, s), where h is head position, τ is tail position.\n\nThen for movement:\n\nIf d = left, moving left, so at time T, position: head at h - s(T-t₁), tail at τ - s(T-t₁)\n\nSince moving left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, if d = right, moving right, head at h + s(T-t₁), tail at τ + s(T-t₁)\n\nThe span at T is [min(head, tail), max(head, tail)]? No, the span is the interval covered by the car.\n\nIn the collision rule, it says: collision if 0 in Span(T) for car on freeway y_T.\n\nAnd Span(T) is defined as above.\n\nFor example, for a right-moving car, at t₁, Span(t₁) = [τ, h] if τ < h, which is usually the case.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(t₁) = [h, τ] if h > τ, so [τ, h] if we sort, but it's given as [h, τ] with h > τ for left-moving.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's think of the position at T.\n\nFor a car with (h, τ, d, s) at t₁, at turn T:\n\nIf d = left, head_T = h - s(T-t₁), tail_T = τ - s(T-t₁), and since moving left, head_T > tail_T if h > τ, so Span(T) = [tail_T, head_T] = [τ - s(T-t₁), h - s(T-t₁)]\n\nSimilarly, if d = right, head_T = h + s(T-t₁), tail_T = τ + s(T-t₁), and head_T > tail_T if h > τ, so Span(T) = [tail_T, head_T] = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nIn the problem, for left-moving, it says Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)], which since h > τ, h - sΔ < τ - sΔ for Δ>0, so [h - sΔ, τ - sΔ] with h-sΔ < τ-sΔ, so it's from smaller to larger? No.\n\n[h - sΔ, τ - sΔ], and since h > τ, h - sΔ > τ - sΔ? Let's take numbers.\n\nSuppose h=10, τ=5, s=1, Δ=0, Span= [10,5]? But intervals are usually [min,max], so [5,10].\n\nI think there's a inconsistency in notation.\n\nIn the problem:\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [h, τ]\" and \"Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\"\n\nIf at t₁, h=10, τ=5, then Span(t₁) = [10,5], which is from 10 to 5, meaning positions from 5 to 10? But mathematically, [10,5] is empty if we assume min max, but it's meant to be the interval.\n\nI think it's better to think of the span as the set of x-coordinates covered, so for a car, the span is from min to max of head and tail.\n\nBut in the movement, for left-moving, both positions decrease, so the min and max both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, both increase.\n\nSo to find if 0 in Span(T), I need the min and max at T.\n\nFor a car, at t₁, let min_t1 = min(h, τ), max_t1 = max(h, τ)\n\nThen at T, if d=left, min_T = min_t1 - s(T-t₁), max_T = max_t1 - s(T-t₁)\n\nIf d=right, min_T = min_t1 + s(T-t₁), max_T = max_t1 + s(T-t₁)\n\nThen Span(T) = [min_T, max_T], and 0 in Span(T) if min_T <= 0 <= max_T.\n\nIn the problem, for left-moving, it has Span(T) = [h - sΔ, τ - sΔ], which with h and τ, but since for left-moving, h is typically the right end, so if h > τ, then min_t1 = τ, max_t1 = h, so min_T = τ - sΔ, max_T = h - sΔ, so Span(T) = [τ - sΔ, h - sΔ]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, if τ and h, with τ < h, min_t1 = τ, max_t1 = h, min_T = τ + sΔ, max_T = h + sΔ, Span(T) = [τ + sΔ, h + sΔ]\n\nIn the problem, for right-moving, it says Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)], which matches if τ is tail and left, h is head and right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(T) = [h - sΔ, τ - sΔ], which if h is head and right, τ is tail and left, so min is τ, max is h, so [τ - sΔ, h - sΔ], but it's written as [h - sΔ, τ - sΔ] with h - sΔ > τ - sΔ, so it's decreasing order, but for interval inclusion, it doesn't matter as long as we check if 0 is between min and max.\n\nFor collision, we care if 0 is in the interval, so we can define the lower and upper bounds.\n\nI think for practical purposes, I'll compute for each car the position of the ends at time T.\n\nLet Δt = T - t₁ = T - 16\n\nFor each freeway, I need to know when a car on that freeway has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nThe player is on freeway y at turn T, and collides if for that y, there is a car with 0 in Span(T).\n\nBut note that if the player moves to y_{T+1} at turn T, they are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, only at T+1.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in Span(T) but not Span(T+1)\"\n\nSo at turn T, when you choose action, you are on y_T during that turn, so you can collide with cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nThen after moving, at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and can collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn based on your position at that turn.\n\nNow, for each freeway k, I need to find for which turns T, there is a car on k such that 0 is in its span at T.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, but for collision, if any car on that row has 0 in span at T, then it's dangerous.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (h, τ, d, s) = (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nSince right-moving, at T, head_T = h + s*Δt = -48 + 24*Δt\n\ntail_T = τ + s*Δt = -71 + 24*Δt\n\nThen min_T = min(head_T, tail_T) = min(-48 +24Δt, -71 +24Δt) = -71 +24Δt since -71 < -48\n\nmax_T = max(head_T, tail_T) = -48 +24Δt\n\nSo Span(T) = [ -71 +24Δt, -48 +24Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -71 +24Δt <= 0 <= -48 +24Δt\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nd=right, s=36\n\nhead_T = -48 + 36*Δt\n\ntail_T = -83 + 36*Δt\n\nmin_T = min(-48+36Δt, -83+36Δt) = -83 +36Δt\n\nmax_T = -48 +36Δt\n\nSpan = [ -83 +36Δt, -48 +36Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -83 +36Δt <= 0 <= -48 +36Δt\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2: (-48, -83, right, 36) identical to freeway 2? But it's a different freeway, so we consider separately.\n\nFreeway 3 has the same car parameters, but it's on row 3, so we need for row 3.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nFreeway 4 also has the same.\n\nFreeway 5: has three cars: (48, 37, right, 6), (12, 1, right, 6), (-24, -35, right, 6)\n\nAll right-moving, s=6.\n\nFor each, compute span at T.\n\nFirst car: h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=6\n\nhead_T = 48 + 6*Δt\n\ntail_T = 37 + 6*Δt\n\nmin_T = min(48+6Δt, 37+6Δt) = 37 +6Δt\n\nmax_T = 48 +6Δt\n\nSpan = [37+6Δt, 48+6Δt]\n\n0 in span if 37+6Δt <= 0 <= 48+6Δt, but since 37+6Δt >0 for Δt>=0, this is impossible. 37+6Δt >=37>0, so 0 never in span for this car. Similarly, min_T =37+6Δt >=37>0, so always positive, never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12, 1, right, 6)\n\nh=12, τ=1, d=right, s=6\n\nhead_T =12 +6Δt\n\ntail_T =1 +6Δt\n\nmin_T = min(12+6Δt,1+6Δt) =1 +6Δt\n\nmax_T =12 +6Δt\n\nSpan = [1+6Δt, 12+6Δt]\n\n1+6Δt >=1>0, so always positive, 0 not in span.\n\nThird car: (-24, -35, right, 6)\n\nh=-24, τ=-35, d=right, s=6\n\nhead_T = -24 +6Δt\n\ntail_T = -35 +6Δt\n\nmin_T = min(-24+6Δt, -35+6Δt) = -35 +6Δt\n\nmax_T = -24 +6Δt\n\nSpan = [ -35 +6Δt, -24 +6Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -35 +6Δt <= 0 <= -24 +6Δt\n\nNow for freeway 6: same as freeway 5: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nSo same cars, so for row 6, the dangerous car is the third one, with span [ -35 +6Δt, -24 +6Δt ], and 0 in span if -35+6Δt <=0<= -24+6Δt\n\nNow freeway 7: (48,37,right,12) only one car.\n\nh=48, τ=37, d=right, s=12\n\nhead_T=48 +12Δt\n\ntail_T=37 +12Δt\n\nmin_T=37+12Δt >=37>0, max_T=48+12Δt>0, so always positive, never covers 0. So freeway 7 is always safe, no car covers 0.\n\nFreeway 8: (48,37,right,4)\n\nh=48, τ=37, d=right, s=4\n\nhead_T=48 +4Δt\n\ntail_T=37 +4Δt\n\nmin_T=37+4Δt >=37>0, always positive, so never covers 0. Safe.\n\nNow, freeway 1,2,3,4 have cars that can cover 0.\n\nFreeway 1: span [ -71 +24Δt, -48 +24Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -71 +24Δt <= 0 <= -48 +24Δt\n\nWhich is:\n\nFrom -71 +24Δt <= 0 => 24Δt <= 71 => Δt <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so Δt <= 2 since integer turns? Turns are integers, so Δt integer.\n\nT is turn, integer, so Δt = T - 16, integer >=0.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -48 +24Δt => 48 <= 24Δt => 24Δt >=48 => Δt >= 2\n\nSo for freeway 1, 0 in span when 2 <= Δt <= 2\n\nΔt >=2 and Δt <=2.958, so since Δt integer, Δt=2\n\nAt Δt=2, -71 +24*2 = -71 +48 = -23 <=0\n\n-48 +24*2 = -48 +48=0 <=0? 0 <=0 is true, so 0 in span.\n\nAt Δt=2, min_T = -71 +48 = -23, max_T = -48 +48=0, so [ -23, 0], so 0 is included.\n\nAt Δt=1, min_T = -71+24= -47, max_T= -48+24= -24, both negative, 0 not in [-47,-24]\n\nAt Δt=3, min_T= -71+72=1, max_T= -48+72=24, both positive, 0 not in [1,24]\n\nSo only at Δt=2, T=16+2=18, freeway 1 has car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nSpan [ -83 +36Δt, -48 +36Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -83 +36Δt <= 0 <= -48 +36Δt\n\nFirst, -83 +36Δt <=0 => 36Δt <=83 => Δt <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so Δt <=2\n\n0 <= -48 +36Δt => 36Δt >=48 => Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so Δt >=2 since integer? Δt >= ceil(1.333)=2\n\nΔt >= 48/36 = 4/3, so since Δt integer, Δt >= 2\n\nAnd Δt <= 83/36 ≈2.305, so Δt <=2\n\nThus Δt=2\n\nAt Δt=2, min_T= -83 +72= -11 <=0, max_T= -48 +72=24 >=0, so yes.\n\nAt Δt=1, min_T= -83+36= -47, max_T= -48+36= -12, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nAt Δt=3, min_T= -83+108=25, max_T= -48+108=60, both positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 2 dangerous only at T=18.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, (-48,-83,right,36), so same, dangerous only at T=18.\n\nFreeway 4: same, dangerous only at T=18.\n\nNow freeway 5: we have the third car: (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nSpan [ -35 +6Δt, -24 +6Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -35 +6Δt <= 0 <= -24 +6Δt\n\n-35 +6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=35 => Δt <= 35/6 ≈5.833, so Δt <=5\n\n0 <= -24 +6Δt => 6Δt >=24 => Δt >=4\n\nSo for Δt from 4 to 5 inclusive.\n\nAt Δt=4, min_T= -35+24= -11 <=0, max_T= -24+24=0 <=0? 0<=0 true, so 0 in span.\n\nAt Δt=5, min_T= -35+30= -5 <=0, max_T= -24+30=6 >=0, 0 in span.\n\nAt Δt=3, min_T= -35+18= -17, max_T= -24+18= -6, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nAt Δt=6, min_T= -35+36=1, max_T= -24+36=12, both positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 5, dangerous at Δt=4 and 5, T=20 and 21.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as freeway 5, dangerous at T=20 and 21.\n\nFreeway 7: always safe, as we saw.\n\nFreeway 8: always safe.\n\nAlso, the player starts at y=0, which is not a freeway, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there. So at y=0 and y=9, no collision possible.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is safe.\n\nNow, player at turn 16 at (0,0), y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nEach turn, we can move U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, 0, within [0,9].\n\nWe need to avoid being on a freeway y=1 to 8 when that freeway has a car at x=0 at that turn.\n\nFrom above, we have dangerous turns:\n\nFor freeway 1: dangerous at T=18\n\nFreeway 2: T=18\n\nFreeway 3: T=18\n\nFreeway 4: T=18\n\nFreeway 5: dangerous at T=20,21\n\nFreeway 6: T=20,21\n\nFreeway 7: never dangerous\n\nFreeway 8: never dangerous\n\nAlso, at other times, these freeways are safe, but we need to check when we are on them.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn 16, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns might be 9, if we go up every turn: U at each turn, from t=16 to t=24, y=0 to1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 at t=24.\n\nBut we need to check if we collide during this path.\n\nAt turn T, y_T.\n\nT=16: y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nAction at T=16: we choose a_{16}, which determines y_{17}.\n\nThe sequence: at turn t, we are at position, then we choose action, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nStart: turn t1=16, position (0, y_{16}) = (0,0)\n\nAfter action a_{16}, we go to y_{17} = y_{16} + Δy, based on a_{16}.\n\nThen at turn 17, we are at (0, y_{17}), and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T depends on y_T and the cars on row y_T at turn T.\n\nFor the direct path: always U.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 16: at (0,0), safe (not freeway)\n\nAction a_{16}=U, so y_{17} = 0 +1 =1\n\nTurn 17: at (0,1), now freeway 1.\n\nIs freeway 1 dangerous at T=17? T=17, Δt=17-16=1\n\nFor freeway 1, at Δt=1, not dangerous, as we saw earlier, span [-47,-24], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen action a_{17}=U, y_{18}=1+1=2\n\nTurn 18: at (0,2), freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 at T=18: T=18, Δt=2, which is dangerous, as we found.\n\nAt T=18, freeway 2 has car at x=0? Yes, from above.\n\nSo collision.\n\nThus, if we go up at turn 17 to y=2 at turn 18, we collide.\n\nSimilarly, if we are on any of freeway 1,2,3,4 at T=18, we collide.\n\nFreeway 1 also dangerous at T=18, but in this path, at T=18 we are on y=2, which is freeway 2.\n\nBut freeway 2 at T=18 is dangerous.\n\nSo collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on freeways 1,2,3,4 at turn 18.\n\nSince all are dangerous at exactly T=18.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3,4 all dangerous only at T=18.\n\nFreeway 5 and 6 dangerous at T=20 and 21.\n\nNow, to avoid collision, we need to not be on y=1,2,3,4 at T=18.\n\ny=1,2,3,4 correspond to freeways 1,2,3,4.\n\nFreeway k is at y=k, I assume.\n\nFreeway 1 at y=1, etc.\n\nSo at turn T=18, we must not be on y=1,2,3, or 4.\n\nSimilarly, at T=20 and 21, we must not be on y=5 or 6.\n\nNow, we start at turn 16, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: if we go up every turn, we reach y=9 at turn 16+9=25? Let's see.\n\nTurn 16: y=0\n\nAfter a_{16}, y_{17}\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t}, y_{t+1}\n\nTo have y_{t} at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn t1 + H, we have y_{t1 + H}\n\nWe start at turn t1=16, y=0.\n\nAfter H actions, from t=16 to t=16+H-1, we have actions a_{16} to a_{16+H-1}, and we reach y_{16+H} at turn 16+H.\n\nWe want y_{16+H} =9.\n\nSo the number of actions is H, and we reach at turn 16+H.\n\nFor example, to reach in 1 turn: if we do U at t=16, then y_{17}=1, not 9.\n\nMinimal H: since we need to increase y by 9, minimal actions if we always go up, H=9 actions, to go from y=0 to y=9 in 9 steps.\n\ny_{17}=1, y_{18}=2, ..., y_{24}=8, y_{25}=9? Turn 16: y=0\n\nAfter a_{16}=U, y_{17}=1\n\nAfter a_{17}=U, y_{18}=2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{23}=U, y_{24}=8\n\nAfter a_{24}=U, y_{25}=9\n\nSo at turn 25, y=9.\n\nWith 9 actions: from t=16 to t=24 inclusive? Actions from t=16 to t=24, that's 9 actions, to reach y_{25}=9 at turn 25.\n\nBut turn number is when we are at position.\n\nAt turn 16: position (0,0)\n\nAfter action a_{16}, we move to position at turn 17: (0, y_{17})\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{16+H-1}, we move to position at turn 16+H: (0, y_{16+H})\n\nWe want y_{16+H} =9.\n\nWith H actions.\n\nMinimal H is 9 if all U.\n\nBut as we saw, in this path, at turn 18, y=2, which is dangerous.\n\nSo we need to avoid that.\n\nWe could go slower or faster or change direction.\n\nSince freeways 7 and 8 are always safe, and y=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nThe dangerous times are only specific turns.\n\nSpecifically, T=18 is dangerous for y=1,2,3,4\n\nT=20 and 21 dangerous for y=5,6\n\nOther times, all freeways are safe, I think, except for those cars, but we have only these dangers.\n\nFor example, freeway 1 only dangerous at T=18, similarly others.\n\nSo for other turns, no issue.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we should try to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\nSince we start at y=0, turn 16.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe critical point is turn 18, we must not be on y=1,2,3,4.\n\nSo at turn 18, we must be either y=0, or y=5,6,7,8, or y=9.\n\nBut y=5 and 6 are dangerous at T=20,21, but T=18 is different.\n\nAt T=18, y=5 and 6 are safe, since dangerous only at T=20,21.\n\nSimilarly, y=7,8 always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nNow, from turn 16 to turn 18.\n\nTurn 16: y=0\n\nAfter two actions, at turn 18, y_{18}.\n\nPossible actions: we can do U, D, S.\n\ny_{18} depends on a_{16} and a_{17}.\n\ny_{17} = y_{16} + Δy_{16} = 0 + a_{16} effect\n\ny_{18} = y_{17} + Δy_{17} = [0 + Δy_{16}] + Δy_{17}\n\nSince y in [0,9], and we start from 0.\n\nPossible y_{18}:\n\nIf both U: y_{18} = 0+1+1=2\n\nBut y=2 dangerous at T=18.\n\nIf first U, then S: y_{17}=1, y_{18}=1 +0=1, dangerous.\n\nFirst U, then D: y_{17}=1, y_{18}=1-1=0, safe.\n\nFirst S, then U: y_{17}=0+0=0, y_{18}=0+1=1, dangerous.\n\nFirst S, then S: y_{18}=0, safe.\n\nFirst S, then D: y_{17}=0, y_{18}=0-1, but y cannot be negative, y_{18} = max(0, 0-1)=0? The update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=0 and a_t=D, y_{t+1} = max(0, -1) but since it says y_{t+1} in [0,9], and Δy=-1, so y_{t+1} =0 if y_t=0 and D.\n\nSimilarly, if y_t=9 and U, y_{t+1}=9.\n\nSo first S, then D: y_{17}=0 (since S from 0), y_{18}=0 + (-1) =0, since cannot go below.\n\nSimilarly, first D, then anything: y_{17}=0 + (-1)=0, then y_{18} depending on a_{17}.\n\nBut y_{17}=0.\n\nNow, for y_{18}:\n\n- If a_{16}=U, a_{17}=U: y_{18}=2\n\n- a_{16}=U, a_{17}=S: y_{18}=1\n\n- a_{16}=U, a_{17}=D: y_{18}=0\n\n- a_{16}=S, a_{17}=U: y_{18}=1\n\n- a_{16}=S, a_{17}=S: y_{18}=0\n\n- a_{16}=S, a_{17}=D: y_{18}=0\n\n- a_{16}=D, a_{17}=U: y_{17}=0, y_{18}=1\n\n- a_{16}=D, a_{17}=S: y_{18}=0\n\n- a_{16}=D, a_{17}=D: y_{18}=0\n\nSo possible y_{18}: 0,1,2\n\nBut y=1 and 2 are dangerous at T=18, so we must have y_{18}=0 to be safe.\n\nThus, we need to be at y=0 at turn 18.\n\nThe only safe option at T=18 is y=0 or y>=5, but from above, with two actions from y=0, we can only reach y=0,1,2 at turn 18.\n\nWe cannot reach y=5 or higher in two steps from y=0.\n\nMax we can go is to y=2.\n\nBut y=0,1,2 possible, but y=1 and 2 dangerous, so only y=0 is safe at T=18.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y=0 at turn 18.\n\nThat means, from turn 16 to 18, we need to stay at y=0 or go down, but since y=0, we can only stay or go down to 0.\n\nSpecifically, actions: we must have y_{18}=0.\n\nFrom above, options like: a_{16}=U, a_{17}=D: y_{17}=1, y_{18}=0\n\nOr a_{16}=S, a_{17}=S: y_{18}=0\n\nOr a_{16}=S, a_{17}=D: y_{18}=0\n\nOr a_{16}=D, a_{17}=S: y_{18}=0\n\nEtc., as long as y_{18}=0.\n\nNow, at turn 18, we are at y=0, safe.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9 from there.\n\nBut we have to avoid the other dangers: at T=20 and 21, y=5 and 6 are dangerous.\n\nTurn 20 and 21.\n\nNow, from turn 18, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal turns from y=0 to y=9 is 9 turns, but we might need to delay or something.\n\nSince freeways 7 and 8 are always safe, we can be there anytime.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on y=5 or 6 at T=20 or 21.\n\nT=20 is turn 20, T=21 turn 21.\n\nNow, current turn 18, y=0.\n\nWe need to plan the path to y=9.\n\nLet t be the turn.\n\nt=18: y=0\n\nThen actions from t=18 onwards.\n\ny_{t} at turn t.\n\nWe want to set y_{20} and y_{21} not 5 or 6, since dangerous at those turns.\n\nAlso, need to minimize H, the number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nSince we start from turn 18 y=0, we need to reach y=9 at some turn T.\n\nWith K actions, we can reach up to y=K, min K=9.\n\nBut we have constraints at t=20 and t=21.\n\nt=20 and t=21 are relative to turn 18.\n\nTurn 18: Δt=0 from ref, but better to use absolute.\n\nTurn 18: t=18\n\nTurn 19: t=19\n\nTurn 20: t=20\n\nTurn 21: t=21\n\nAt t=20 and t=21, we must not be on y=5 or 6.\n\nNow, from t=18, y=0.\n\nWe can move step by step.\n\nLet y_t be position at turn t.\n\ny_{18} = 0\n\ny_{19} = y_{18} + Δy_{18} = 0 + a_{18} effect\n\nSimilarly.\n\nWe need to avoid y=5 or 6 at t=20 and t=21.\n\nSince we want to go up, we should go up as much as possible, but avoid those positions at those times.\n\nFirst, without constraints, to reach y=9 fastest: from y=0 at t=18, after 9 actions: a_{18} to a_{26}, y_{19}=1, y_{20}=2, ..., y_{27}=9? Let's see:\n\nAfter a_{18}, y_{19} = y_{18} + Δy_{18}\n\nAfter a_{19}, y_{20}\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{26}, y_{27}\n\nSet y_{27} =9.\n\nSo actions from t=18 to t=26, 9 actions, reach at t=27.\n\nBut we can reach earlier? From y=0, to y=9, min 9 steps, since each step increase by at most 1.\n\ny_{19} <=1, y_{20} <=2, ..., y_{27} <=9, and if all U, y_{27}=9.\n\nIf we start at t=18 y=0, after first action a_{18}, y_{19} <=1, after second y_{20}<=2, ..., after ninth action a_{26}, y_{27} <=9, and =9 if all U.\n\nSo minimal turn to reach y=9 is t=27, with 9 actions.\n\nBut we need to consider the constraints at t=20 and t=21.\n\nIn the direct path: if all U from t=18.\n\ny_{18}=0\n\na_{18}=U, y_{19}=1\n\na_{19}=U, y_{20}=2\n\na_{20}=U, y_{21}=3\n\na_{21}=U, y_{22}=4\n\n...\n\ny_{20}=2, y_{21}=3, which are not 5 or 6, so at t=20 and t=21, y=2 and 3, freeways 2 and 3, but at t=20 and t=21, which are not the dangerous times for these rows.\n\nDangerous for row 2 only at t=18, which is past.\n\nSimilarly row 3 only t=18.\n\nSo at t=20, y=2, freeway 2, but at t=20, Δt=20-16=4, for freeway 2, at Δt=4, min_T= -83 +36*4= -83+144=61, max_T= -48+144=96, both >0, so not dangerous. Similarly, all safe.\n\nThen y_{21}=3, similarly safe.\n\ny_{22}=4, freeway 4, at t=22, Δt=6, min_T= -83+216=133>0, safe.\n\nThen continue to y=9 at t=27.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nFrom turn 18 y=0, min reach y=9 at t=27.\n\nBut we started at turn 16, and we have actions from t=16.\n\nIn this case, from t=16 to t=18, we have to be at y=0 at t=18, which takes two actions, but we didn't make progress.\n\nThen from t=18 to t=27, 9 actions to y=9.\n\nTotal from start: at t=16, after actions a_{16} to a_{26}, y_{27}=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=16 to t=26, that's 11 actions? Let's list turns.\n\nTurn t: position at t, after actions up to t-1.\n\nStart: t=16, y=0\n\nAfter a_{16}, position at t=17: y_{17}\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{k}, position at t=k+1\n\nTo have position at t=16+H be (0,9), we need actions a_{16} to a_{16+H-1}, and after a_{16+H-1}, y_{16+H}=9.\n\nH actions.\n\nIn the above, if we go directly from t=16 with all U:\n\ny_{17}=1, y_{18}=2, but y_{18}=2 dangerous, collision.\n\nTo avoid, we need to be at y=0 at t=18.\n\nSo, for example, one way: at t=16, do S or D to stay at y=0 for t=17? Let's specify actions.\n\nOption: at t=16, action a_{16}=S, then y_{17}=0 (since S from 0)\n\nThen at t=17, position (0,0), safe? t=17, y=0 not freeway, safe.\n\nThen action a_{17}=S, then y_{18}=0\n\nNow at t=18, y=0, safe.\n\nThen from here, we can go up.\n\nBut we lost two turns.\n\nNow from t=18 y=0, go up all: a_{18}=U, y_{19}=1\n\na_{19}=U, y_{20}=2\n\na_{20}=U, y_{21}=3\n\na_{21}=U, y_{22}=4\n\na_{22}=U, y_{23}=5\n\na_{23}=U, y_{24}=6\n\na_{24}=U, y_{25}=7\n\na_{25}=U, y_{26}=8\n\na_{26}=U, y_{27}=9\n\nNow, check dangers: at t=20, y=2, which is freeway 2, but at t=20, not dangerous, as before.\n\nt=21, y=3, freeway 3, safe.\n\nt=22, y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nBut at t=23, y=5? y_{23}=5 at turn 23.\n\nTurn 23, is it dangerous for y=5?\n\ny=5, freeway 5, dangerous at t=20 and t=21.\n\nt=23, Δt=23-16=7\n\nFor freeway 5, dangerous only at Δt=4 and 5, t=20 and 21.\n\nAt t=23, Δt=7, min for the car: -35 +6*7= -35+42=7, max=-24+42=18, both >0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y_{24}=6, at t=24, freeway 6, dangerous at t=20,21, t=24 Δt=8, min=-35+48=13>0, safe.\n\nSo all good, reach y=9 at t=27 with 11 actions? Actions from a_{16} to a_{26}, that's 11 actions? t from 16 to 26 inclusive is 11 turns? No.\n\nActions: a_{16}, a_{17}, a_{18}, ..., a_{26}\n\nThat's 11 actions: indices from 16 to 26, number is 26-16+1=11.\n\nBut we reach y_{27}=9 at turn 27.\n\nSince we start at t=16, after 0 actions, at t=16.\n\nAfter 1 action, at t=17.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at t=16+k.\n\nSet y_{16+k} =9, so k=9 if possible, but here k=11.\n\nBut we can reach faster by not staying.\n\nAnother option: at t=16, instead of staying, we go up but then down.\n\nFor example: a_{16}=U, then y_{17}=1\n\nThen at t=17, y=1, which is freeway 1, but at t=17, Δt=1, for freeway 1: span [-47,-24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen action a_{17}=D, then y_{18}=1 + (-1) =0\n\nSo at t=18, y=0, safe.\n\nSame as before, but we moved to y=1 and back, still at y=0 at t=18.\n\nThen same as above to y=9 at t=27.\n\nNo gain.\n\nBut we need to avoid the y=5,6 at t=20,21.\n\nIn the above path, at t=20, y=2, not 5 or 6.\n\nBut can we reach y=9 faster?\n\nFor example, from t=18 y=0, if we go up faster, but we can only go one per turn, so min 9 turns to y=9, from t=18 to t=27.\n\nUnless we start from earlier.\n\nBut at t=16, we are at y=0, and we have to be at y=0 at t=18, so we cannot be higher earlier.\n\nPerhaps we can be at higher y at t=18, but earlier we thought only y=0,1,2 possible, and y=1,2 dangerous.\n\nBut y=0 is the only safe, but what about y=5 or higher? Impossible in two steps from y=0.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 at t=18.\n\nThus, the path must have y=0 at t=18.\n\nThen from there, min to y=9 is 9 steps, to t=27.\n\nBut total actions from start: from t=16 to t=26 for actions, 11 actions to reach at t=27.\n\nBut we have another danger at t=20,21 for y=5,6, but in this path it's fine.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach earlier by not starting from y=0 at t=18.\n\nBut we have to.\n\nAnother idea: at t=18, we can be at y=0, but from there, we can go up, and at t=20 and 21, we need to not be on y=5 or 6.\n\nIn the direct up path, at t=20, y=2, t=21 y=3, both fine.\n\nBut if we go faster? Cannot.\n\nPerhaps we can stay or go down at some point to avoid, but no need.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach y=9 before t=27.\n\nFor example, from t=16, if we go up immediately, but to avoid t=18, we go down or stay at t=17.\n\nBut at t=18, we must be y=0.\n\nSuppose at t=16, a_{16}=U, y_{17}=1\n\nt=17, a_{17}=D, y_{18}=0\n\nThen from t=18 y=0, same as before.\n\nIf we do nothing at t=16 and t=17, stay at y=0.\n\nThen from t=18, go up.\n\nBut at some point, we need to pass y=5 and 6, but avoid at t=20 and 21.\n\nIn the path, when do we reach y=5?\n\nFrom y=0 at t=18, after 5 actions: a_{18}=U, y_{19}=1\n\na_{19}=U, y_{20}=2\n\na_{20}=U, y_{21}=3\n\na_{21}=U, y_{22}=4\n\na_{22}=U, y_{23}=5\n\nSo at t=23, y=5\n\nBut t=23 is after t=21, so not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at t=24, fine.\n\nDangerous times are t=20 and 21 only.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut we reach y=9 at t=27.\n\nPerhaps we can go slower at the beginning to be higher later, but since we have to be low at t=18, we cannot.\n\nAnother thought: at t=18, we must be y=0, but after that, we can go up, and for t=20 and 21, we are at low y, so safe.\n\nBut let's confirm the freeway at t=20 and 21 in the path.\n\nt=20: y=2, freeway 2, at t=20, Δt=4, as before, safe.\n\nt=21: y=3, freeway 3, Δt=5, for freeway 3: car (-48,-83,right,36), at Δt=5, min_T= -83+180=97, max= -48+180=132, both >0, safe.\n\nThen t=22: y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nt=23: y=5, freeway 5, at t=23, Δt=7, as before, min= -35+42=7>0 for the car, safe.\n\nSimilarly all good.\n\nBut H=11 actions to reach at turn 27.\n\nBut is there a way with fewer actions?\n\nFor example, if we can be at higher y at t=18, but we can't, because from y=0 at t=16, in two steps, max y=2, but dangerous.\n\nUnless we go up at t=16 and t=17, but then at t=18 y=2, collision.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 with H=9 actions, but that would require starting from t=16, all U, to y_{25}=9 at t=25.\n\nBut to do that, we need y_{18}=2, which causes collision at t=18.\n\nSo impossible with H=9.\n\nWith H=10 actions: from a_{16} to a_{25}, y_{26}=9.\n\ny_{26}=9 at t=26.\n\nNow, y_{18} must be 0 to avoid collision.\n\nBut if we have y_{18}=0, then to reach y_{26}=9, we need 8 steps up from y=0 at t=18 to y=8 at t=26? Let's see.\n\nFrom t=18 y=0, after actions a_{18} to a_{25}, 8 actions, y_{26} <=8, since each +1, y_{26} <=8, cannot reach 9 in 8 steps from y=0.\n\ny_{19} <=1, ..., y_{26} <=8.\n\nSo to reach y=9, we need at least 9 actions from y=0, so from t=18, earliest at t=27.\n\nThus, with start at t=16, we need at least 11 actions to have y_{27}=9.\n\nBut actions from a_{16} to a_{26}, 11 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 at t=26 with H=10 actions, but from above, if y_{18}=0, impossible.\n\nIf y_{18} not 0, but we must be y=0 or safe, but only y=0 possible and safe.\n\nSo no, minimal H=11.\n\nBut we have to avoid y=5,6 at t=20,21, which in the path is fine.\n\nBut in the above, with y=0 at t=18, then up, at t=20 y=2, t=21 y=3, not 5 or 6.\n\nBut suppose we want to be at higher y later, but we can't avoid the delay.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps at t=16 and t=17, we go up to y=1 or something, but we have to come back to y=0 at t=18.\n\nBut no gain.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=5 or 6 at t=18, but impossible from y=0 in two steps.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nStart: turn t=16, y=0\n\nAction a_{16}: to set y_{17}\n\nWe need y_{18}=0.\n\nOptions: for example, a_{16}=S, then y_{17}=0\n\nThen a_{17}=S, then y_{18}=0\n\nOr a_{16}=U, y_{17}=1; a_{17}=D, y_{18}=0\n\nOr a_{16}=D, y_{17}=0; a_{17}=S, y_{18}=0 etc.\n\nThen from t=18, y=0\n\na_{18}=U, y_{19}=1\n\na_{19}=U, y_{20}=2\n\na_{20}=U, y_{21}=3\n\na_{21}=U, y_{22}=4\n\na_{22}=U, y_{23}=5\n\na_{23}=U, y_{24}=6\n\na_{24}=U, y_{25}=7\n\na_{25}=U, y_{26}=8\n\na_{26}=U, y_{27}=9\n\nNow, at t=23, y=5, freeway 5, but t=23 not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly t=24 y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nBut we have to output the actions from t=16.\n\nIn this, a_{16} and a_{17} need to be set for y_{18}=0.\n\nFor example, let's choose a_{16}=S, a_{17}=S\n\nThen sequence:\n\nTurn 16: a_{16} = S\n\nThen position at t=17: y=0\n\nTurn 17: a_{17} = S\n\nPosition at t=18: y=0\n\nThen turn 18: a_{18} = U\n\nt=19: y=1\n\nturn 19: a_{19} = U\n\nt=20: y=2\n\nturn 20: a_{20} = U\n\nt=21: y=3\n\nturn 21: a_{21} = U\n\nt=22: y=4\n\nturn 22: a_{22} = U\n\nt=23: y=5\n\nturn 23: a_{23} = U\n\nt=24: y=6\n\nturn 24: a_{24} = U\n\nt=25: y=7\n\nturn 25: a_{25} = U\n\nt=26: y=8\n\nturn 26: a_{26} = U\n\nt=27: y=9\n\nReached.\n\nBut H=11 actions, from t=16 to t=26.\n\nThe number of turns: from t=16 to t=26 actions, 11 turns of actions.\n\nBut we reached at t=27.\n\nNow, but we have freeway 7 and 8 safe, but not used.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster through higher freeways later, but no, because we are limited by the speed.\n\nAnother thing: at t=20 and t=21, we need to not be on y=5 or 6, but in this case we are on y=2 and 3, fine.\n\nBut suppose we want to be at y=7 or 8 at t=20, but from t=18 y=0, at t=20, y<=2, impossible.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nThus, this seems minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can have fewer actions by reaching earlier with different path.\n\nFor example, from t=18 y=0, if we do nothing for some turns, but that would make H larger, worse.\n\nOr go down, worse.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid the t=18 constraint by being on safe row at t=18, like y=5, but impossible.\n\ny=5 at t=18: from y=0 at t=16, to y=5 at t=18, need +5 in two steps, impossible, max +2.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have 11 actions.\n\nNow, about the other danger: at t=20 and 21, y=5 and 6 dangerous.\n\nIn our path, at t=20, y=2, not 5 or 6; t=21 y=3, not 5 or 6.\n\nBut suppose in some path we are at y=5 at t=20, it would be dangerous, but we are not.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in our case, we are safe.\n\nNow, but we need to output the action sequence.\n\nIn the sequence above, with a_{16}=S, a_{17}=S, but we could have other choices, like a_{16}=U, a_{17}=D, which also y_{18}=0.\n\nBut with S,S, we stay at y=0 both turns.\n\nWith U then D, we go to y=1 and back.\n\nBut number of actions same.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need minimal H, which is 11.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach with H=10.\n\nSuppose H=10 actions, from a_{16} to a_{25}, y_{26}=9.\n\nNow, y_{26} = y_{16} + sum of Δy from t=16 to t=25 actions.\n\ny_{16}=0, y_{26}=9, so sum of Δy must be +9 over 10 actions.\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, so possible, for example, nine U and one S, or eight U and two S, etc., but y_{26} = sum of 10 Δy, each <=1, so to have sum=9, must have nine U and one something else, say S or D.\n\nBut with one S, y_{26}=9, or with one D, y_{26}=8 if one D, not 9.\n\nIf one D and nine U, but 10 actions: if nine U and one D, sum Δy = +9 -1 = +8, y_{26}=8, not 9.\n\nTo have +9, must have nine U and one S, so sum +9.\n\nNow, we need to avoid collision, especially at t=18.\n\ny_{18} must be 0 to be safe at t=18.\n\nNow, y_{18} = sum of Δy from a_{16} and a_{17}.\n\nSince y_{16}=0, y_{18} = Δy_{16} + Δy_{17}\n\ny_{18} must be 0.\n\nΔy_{16} and Δy_{17} each in {-1,0,1}, y_{18} = Δy_{16} + Δy_{17}\n\nSince y_{17} = Δy_{16}, then y_{18} = y_{17} + Δy_{17} = Δy_{16} + Δy_{17}\n\nSet to 0.\n\nPossible if both S: Δy=0,0\n\nOr U then D: +1, -1\n\nOr D then U: -1, +1 but if D at y=0, y_{17}=0, then U, y_{18}=1, not 0.\n\nCases:\n\nIf a_{16}=D, y_{17}=0 (since y=0)\n\nThen a_{17}, if U, y_{18}=1; if S, y_{18}=0; if D, y_{18}=0\n\nSimilarly, if a_{16}=S, y_{17}=0; then a_{17}: U, y_{18}=1; S, y_{18}=0; D, y_{18}=0\n\nIf a_{16}=U, y_{17}=1; then a_{17}: U, y_{18}=2; S, y_{18}=1; D, y_{18}=0\n\nSo y_{18}=0 only if:\n\n- a_{16}=D or S, and a_{17}=S or D (but not U)\n\nSpecifically, from above:\n\n- If a_{16}=D, then a_{17}=S or D, y_{18}=0\n\n- If a_{16}=S, then a_{17}=S or D, y_{18}=0\n\n- If a_{16}=U, then a_{17}=D, y_{18}=0\n\nNow, with H=10 actions, a_{16} to a_{25}, y_{26}=9.\n\ny_{26} = y_{18} + sum_{t=18 to 25} Δy_t\n\ny_{18}=0, so sum_{t=18}^{25} Δy_t =9\n\nNow, actions from a_{18} to a_{25}, that's 8 actions (t=18 to 25 inclusive? a_{18} to a_{25}, 8 actions).\n\nAfter a_{25}, y_{26}.\n\n8 actions, each Δy <=1, so y_{26} <= 0 + 8*1 =8 <9, impossible to reach y=9.\n\ny_{26} <=8 with 8 actions from y_{18}=0.\n\nThus, cannot reach y=9 at t=26 with y_{18}=0.\n\nIf y_{18} not 0, but must be 0 to avoid collision, and only possible values are 0,1,2, but 1 and 2 dangerous at t=18.\n\nSo if y_{18}=1 or 2, collision, not possible.\n\nTherefore, impossible with H=10.\n\nSimilarly, for H=9, even worse.\n\nThus minimal H is 11.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the path, we can choose different for the first two actions.\n\nFor example, to save action or something, but all same H.\n\nPerhaps we can go up immediately but then down.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nAlso, for the later part, we can go directly up.\n\nBut we need to make sure that at no point we are on dangerous row at dangerous time.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=23, y=5, but t=23 not t=20 or 21, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 5 has multiple cars, but only one can be dangerous at times, but we covered.\n\nPerhaps we can go through row 7 and 8 faster, but no.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nWe need to output actions from t=16 to t=16+H-1.\n\nWith H=11, actions from t=16 to t=26.\n\nSequence: for example,\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nThen at turn 27, y=9.\n\nBut we need to reach (0,9), which is at turn 27.\n\nIn the sequence, last action at turn 26, to reach at turn 27.\n\nNow, but we can have other sequences, like with U and D at start.\n\nBut minimal H is 11.\n\nTo confirm, let's see if we can reach with H=11 but different path.\n\nSuppose at beginning, a_{16}=U, a_{17}=D, then y_{17}=1, y_{18}=0\n\nThen same as before, a_{18} to a_{26} all U, y_{19}=1, ..., y_{27}=9.\n\nSame H.\n\nAt the end, we can have S or something, but no need.\n\nNow, about t=20 and 21: in this, at t=20, y=2, which is fine.\n\nBut is there a way to be at y=5 at t=20? But from y=0 at t=18, at t=20, y<=2, impossible.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nBut in freeway 5 and 6, dangerous at t=20 and 21, which we avoid.\n\nNow, output the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 16 to 26.\n\nBut let's write:\n\nTurn 16: S  (or we can put U, but S is fine)\n\nIn the answer, it should be the actions.\n\nPerhaps we can choose to move at some points to save, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since freeway 7 and 8 are safe, but we reach them later, no issue.\n\nPerhaps we can go down to y=0 at some point, but that would increase H.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow for the sequence.\n\nLet me use a_{16}=S, a_{17}=S for simplicity.\n\nThen:\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nIn the sequence, turn 20: U, position at t=21 is y=3, etc.\n\nTo write in the box.\n\nBut the answer should have actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1=16, H=11, so up to t=16+10=26? t_1 + H -1 =16 +11 -1=26.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, we have two S at start, then all U.\n\nPerhaps we can have only one S, but with U and D.\n\nBut same H.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nNow, but let's confirm the car on freeway 5 at t=20.\n\nIn our path, we are not on y=5 at t=20, but just to be thorough.\n\nAt t=20, Δt=4, freeway 5: the dangerous car is (-24,-35,right,6), at Δt=4, min_T= -35+24= -11, max_T= -24+24=0, so [ -11,0], 0 included, so if on y=5 at t=20, collision.\n\nSimilarly at t=21, Δt=5, min= -35+30= -5, max= -24+30=6, [ -5,6], 0 in.\n\nBut we avoid.\n\nIn our path, at t=20, we are on y=2, which is freeway 2, but at t=20, Δt=4, freeway 2: car (-48,-83,right,36), min_T= -83+144=61, max= -48+144=96, [61,96], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11, with the sequence above.\n\nBut in the sequence, I used S,S at start, but we can use other, but S,S is simple.\n\nTo make it with more movement, but no need.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 16\\) is 11. This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a dangerous freeway at the turns when cars are present at \\(x = 0\\).\n\n- At turn 18, freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3, 4\\) are dangerous due to cars at \\(x = 0\\). The player must be at \\(y = 0\\) (safe) at this turn.\n- At turns 20 and 21, freeways \\(y = 5\\) and \\(y = 6\\) are dangerous due to cars at \\(x = 0\\). The player is at lower \\(y\\) values (2 and 3) at these turns, avoiding collision.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- **Turns 16 and 17**: Stay at \\(y = 0\\) using `S` (stay) actions to avoid being on freeways 1-4 at turn 18.\n- **Turns 18 to 26**: Move up (`U`) each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 27.\n\nThis path ensures:\n- At turn 18 (\\(y = 0\\)), no collision (not a freeway).\n- At turns 20 and 21 (\\(y = 2\\) and \\(y = 3\\)), freeways 2 and 3 are safe because the dangerous time (turn 18) has passed.\n- At turns 23 and 24 (\\(y = 5\\) and \\(y = 6\\)), freeways 5 and 6 are safe because the dangerous turns (20 and 21) have passed.\n\nNo shorter sequence is possible because:\n- To avoid collision at turn 18, \\(y_{18} = 0\\) is required, limiting progress in the first two turns.\n- Reaching \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 0\\) requires at least 9 upward moves, starting from turn 18, leading to turn 27 for arrival.\n\n**Action Sequence**:\n```\nTurn 16: S\nTurn 17: S\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\n```\n\nAfter these actions, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 27.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 16\\text{: } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17\\text{: } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26\\text{: } U }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 18, and the player is at (0,0). The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The movement is only in the y-direction (vertical), and the grid has y from 0 to 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if at that turn the player is on a freeway k (where k is the current y-coordinate) and the x=0 is covered by a car on that freeway at that exact turn.\n\nImportant: when moving from y to y' at turn T, at turn T the player is still on row y, and then at the next turn (T+1) they are on row y'. So at turn T, we only check the freeway corresponding to the current y (before the move).\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1=18. For each freeway k (from 1 to 8), we have a list of cars. Each car is represented by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note that for left-moving cars, the head is the rightmost point and tail the leftmost? But the update rule states:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n- Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note the representation in the table: for example, freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24). Since it's right-moving, the representation (head, tail) is given as (τ, h) or (h, τ)? The update rule for right-moving uses [τ, h] and then moves to [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt]. However, the input gives \"head\" and \"tail\". We must interpret the input in the context of the update rule.\n\nLooking at the update rule for right-moving: the initial span is [τ, h] meaning from τ to h (with τ <= h) and then it moves right. So in the input, the first number is the tail and the second is the head? But the input says \"head\" and \"tail\". Let me check the example:\n\nFor freeway 5: (48, 37, right, 6) -> but 48>37, so if it's [τ, h] then τ=37 and h=48? But the input says head=48 and tail=37? That would be inconsistent because typically head is the front. However, the update rule for right-moving says the car moves right, so the head (front) should be the larger number. So in the input, the first number is the head? But then for a right-moving car, the head is the front and should be the larger number? But in freeway 5: (48,37) -> head=48, tail=37, which makes sense: the car spans from 37 to 48 (so head at 48, tail at 37) and moves right.\n\nBut the update rule for right-moving says: initial span is [τ, h] → meaning from τ to h, and then moves to [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt]. So if we have head=48 and tail=37, then the initial span is [37,48]. Then at time t1=18, the car is at [37,48]. Then at a future time T, it will be [37+6*(T-18), 48+6*(T-18)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, the update rule: [h, τ] → [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt]. If we have a car (head, tail, left, speed), then the head is the front (which for left-moving is the leftmost? Actually, for left-moving the front is the leftmost so the head should be less than the tail? But the input for left-moving cars: none in this problem? Actually, all the cars in this problem are right-moving.\n\nWait, the input for freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24). Here, head=-48, tail=-71. Since it's right-moving, the car spans from tail to head: [-71, -48] (because tail=-71, head=-48). Then at time T, the span is [-71 + 24*(T-18), -48 + 24*(T-18)].\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 has three cars: \n  (48,37,right,6): [37,48] at t1=18, then [37+6*(T-18), 48+6*(T-18)]\n  (12,1,right,6): [1,12] at t1=18, then [1+6*(T-18), 12+6*(T-18)]\n  (-24,-35,right,6): [-35,-24] at t1=18, then [-35+6*(T-18), -24+6*(T-18)]\n\nWe need to avoid being on freeway k at turn T if at that turn the car on freeway k has a span that covers x=0.\n\nNote: The player is always at x=0, so we care only when the car's span at turn T includes 0.\n\nWe start at turn 18 at y=0. The goal is to reach y=9. We can only move one step at a time (or stay). So the minimal number of moves without any obstacles would be 9 moves (all U). But we have to avoid the freeways at the turns when we are on them.\n\nWe are going to simulate the moves from turn 18 onwards. We are at y0=0 at turn 18.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) such that we eventually get to y=9 and we never are on a freeway k (where k in {1,2,...,8}) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway that covers 0 at that turn.\n\nNote: at turn 18, we are at y=0. Since freeways are from y=1 to y=8, we are safe at y=0 and y=9 (the goals) because there are no cars on those rows (freeways 1-8 only). But note: when we are at y=0 or y=9, we don't check for collisions? Actually, the collision rule says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". Since freeway k is defined for k=1..8, when the player is at y=0 or y=9, there is no freeway to check. So we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nHowever, we start at y=0 at turn 18 and we want to end at y=9. We must traverse the freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe are going to compute for each freeway k and for each future turn T (>=18) the set of turns when the freeway k is unsafe (i.e., at least one car on freeway k has a span that includes 0 at turn T).\n\nWe are going to precompute the unsafe intervals for each freeway.\n\nFor a given freeway k and a car on it with (head, tail, direction, speed) at t1=18:\n\nFor a right-moving car: \n   The span at time T: [τ + s*(T-18), h + s*(T-18)]\n   We require that 0 is in [τ + s*(T-18), h + s*(T-18)] \n   => τ + s*(T-18) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-18)\n\n   Solve for T:\n      T_min = ceil( ( -h ) / s + 18 )   ??? Let me do:\n\n      τ + s*(T-18) <= 0  => T <= ( -τ ) / s + 18   [if s>0] but note: τ is negative? \n      Actually, let me rearrange:\n\n      τ + s*(T-18) <= 0  => s*(T-18) <= -τ  => T-18 <= (-τ)/s  => T <= 18 + (-τ)/s\n\n      and \n      0 <= h + s*(T-18) => s*(T-18) >= -h  => T-18 >= (-h)/s  => T >= 18 + (-h)/s\n\n      So the interval for T is: [ 18 + ceil( (-h)/s ), 18 + floor( (-τ)/s ) ]? \n\n      But note: the inequalities are inclusive. So:\n\n        T must satisfy: 18 + ceil( (-h)/s ) <= T <= 18 + floor( (-τ)/s )   ??? \n\n      Actually, we have:\n        T >= 18 + ceil( (-h)/s )   ??? But (-h)/s might not be integer.\n\n      Alternatively, we can write:\n\n        -h <= s*(T-18) <= -τ\n\n      So: \n        (-h)/s <= T-18 <= (-τ)/s\n\n      Therefore, T must be an integer in the interval [18 + ceil( (-h)/s ), 18 + floor( (-τ)/s )]? \n\n      Actually, if we have a real interval [a, b], the integer Ts are from ceil(a) to floor(b). But note: T-18 must be an integer, so:\n\n        T-18 must be an integer k such that: (-h)/s <= k <= (-τ)/s.\n\n      So the integer k is from ceil( (-h)/s ) to floor( (-τ)/s ).\n\n      Therefore, T = 18 + k, for k = ceil( (-h)/s ) to floor( (-τ)/s ).\n\nBut note: the car might wrap around? The problem does not specify boundaries for the cars. The grid is infinite? The cars move indefinitely? So we have to consider that the car might cover 0 at multiple intervals? Actually, no, because the car is a contiguous segment moving at constant speed. So the interval of T for which the car covers 0 is contiguous? Actually, it is a single contiguous interval (if it ever covers 0). But note: the car might cover 0 multiple times? No, because it's moving linearly. However, if the car is long enough and the speed is low, it might cover 0 for a consecutive set of turns.\n\nBut in our case, the car moves at constant speed and the span is contiguous. So the set of T for which 0 is in the span is one contiguous interval.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but we don't have any.\n\nNow, we have multiple cars per freeway. So for a freeway, the unsafe turns are the union of the unsafe intervals of all cars on that freeway.\n\nLet's compute for each freeway the set of unsafe turns T (>=18).\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head=-48, tail=-71, speed=24, right-moving.\n\n   The car spans: [τ, h] = [-71, -48] at T=18.\n\n   We require: -71 + 24*(T-18) <= 0 <= -48 + 24*(T-18)\n\n   => \n      -71 + 24*(T-18) <= 0  => 24*(T-18) <= 71 => T-18 <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958 => T <= 20.958 => T <= 20 (since T integer)\n      and \n      0 <= -48 + 24*(T-18) => 24*(T-18) >= 48 => T-18 >= 2 => T>=20.\n\n   So T must be at least 20 and at most 20? So only T=20.\n\n   Check: at T=20: \n        T-18=2, so the car is at: [-71+24*2, -48+24*2] = [-71+48, -48+48] = [-23, 0]. \n        So 0 is included? Yes, at the right boundary.\n\n   Therefore, freeway 1 is unsafe at T=20.\n\nFreeway 2: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\n   [τ, h] = [-83, -48] at T=18.\n\n   Condition:\n        -83 + 36*(T-18) <= 0 <= -48 + 36*(T-18)\n\n   Solve:\n        First inequality: 36*(T-18) <= 83  => T-18 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.3055 => T<=20.3055 -> T<=20\n        Second: 36*(T-18) >= 48 => T-18>=48/36=4/3≈1.333 => T>=19.333 -> T>=20 (since T integer)\n\n        So T=20.\n\n   Check: at T=20: \n        T-18=2 -> [-83+36*2, -48+36*2] = [-83+72, -48+72] = [-11, 24] -> includes 0.\n\n   So unsafe at T=20.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2: (-48,-83,right,36) -> unsafe at T=20.\n\nFreeway 4: same -> unsafe at T=20.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars.\n\n  Car1: (48,37,right,6) -> [37,48] at T=18.\n        Condition: 37+6*(T-18) <= 0 <= 48+6*(T-18) \n        But 37+6*(T-18) is at least 37 (at T=18) and increases. So 37+... will be positive. So 0 is never covered? \n        Because 37+6*(T-18) >=37>0. So the entire car is to the right of 0. So safe for this car.\n\n  Car2: (12,1,right,6) -> [1,12] at T=18.\n        1+6*(T-18) <= 0 <= 12+6*(T-18)\n        First: 1+6k <=0 -> 6k<=-1 -> k<=-1/6 -> k<=0 -> T-18<=0 -> T<=18.\n        Second: 0<=12+6k -> 6k>=-12 -> k>=-2 -> T-18>=-2 -> T>=16.\n        So for T in [16,18]? But we start at T=18. At T=18: [1,12] -> does not include 0? 0 is not in [1,12]. So safe.\n\n  Car3: (-24,-35,right,6) -> [-35,-24] at T=18.\n        Condition: -35+6*(T-18) <=0<= -24+6*(T-18)\n        First: -35+6k<=0 -> 6k<=35 -> k<=35/6≈5.833 -> T<=18+5=23\n        Second: 0<=-24+6k -> 6k>=24 -> k>=4 -> T>=18+4=22\n        So T in [22,23] (since T integer: 22,23).\n\n        Therefore, freeway 5 is unsafe at T=22 and T=23.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5: three cars with same parameters -> unsafe at T=22 and T=23.\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (48,37,right,12) -> [37,48] at T=18.\n        Condition: 37+12*(T-18) <=0<=48+12*(T-18)\n        Again, 37+12k>=37>0, so no.\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (48,37,right,4) -> [37,48] at T=18.\n        Similarly, 37+4k>=37>0, so safe.\n\nSummary of unsafe freeways:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at T=20\nFreeway 2: unsafe at T=20\nFreeway 3: unsafe at T=20\nFreeway 4: unsafe at T=20\nFreeway 5: unsafe at T=22,23\nFreeway 6: unsafe at T=22,23\nFreeway 7: safe\nFreeway 8: safe\n\nSo we have:\n\nk=1: unsafe at 20\nk=2: unsafe at 20\nk=3: unsafe at 20\nk=4: unsafe at 20\nk=5: unsafe at 22,23\nk=6: unsafe at 22,23\nk=7: always safe\nk=8: always safe\n\nWe start at turn 18 at y=0. We need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up 9 times. But we must avoid being on an unsafe freeway at the unsafe turn.\n\nLet me denote the turn and the y-coordinate:\n\nTurn 18: y=0 (safe)\n\nWe are going to plan the moves. We can use BFS or dynamic programming to find the minimal steps. However, since the grid is small (10 rows) and the time is not too long, we can simulate.\n\nWe want the minimal H. The minimal H without obstacles is 9: we would be at y=9 at turn 27 (because: at turn 18: y0=0, then after 9 moves, at turn 18+9=27, we are at y=9).\n\nBut we have to avoid:\n\n- At turn 20: we must not be on freeway 1,2,3,4 (if we are on any of these at turn 20, we crash).\n\n- At turn 22 and 23: we must not be on freeway 5 or 6.\n\nWe can try to go as fast as possible and see if we can avoid the unsafe turns.\n\nIdea: we can delay or accelerate our movement to avoid being on a freeway at the unsafe turn.\n\nLet me try to go straight up:\n\nTurn 18: at y=0 -> safe.\nTurn 19: move U -> y=1 -> freeway1. Now, turn19: we are at freeway1 at turn19 -> safe? because freeway1 is only unsafe at T=20. So safe at T=19.\nTurn 20: move U -> then at turn20 we are still on freeway1? Actually, at turn20 we are at y=1 (because we start the turn at y=1 and then we move). But at turn20 we are on freeway1 -> unsafe! Crash.\n\nSo we cannot be on freeway1 at turn20.\n\nHow to avoid? We could stay at y=0 for one turn? Or move to y=0 and then wait? But we start at y=0.\n\nOption: at turn18: stay (S) -> then at turn19 we are still at y=0 (safe).\nThen at turn19: move U -> then at turn19 we are at y=0 -> then at turn20 we are at y=1? No: \n\nAt turn18: y=0 -> we do S: so at turn19 we are at y=0.\nAt turn19: we do U -> so at the beginning of turn19 we are at y=0, then we move to y=1 at the end of the turn. But during turn19, we are at y=0 (so we check freeway? but freeway0 doesn't exist -> safe). Then at turn20, we are at y=1 -> and that is unsafe.\n\nSame problem.\n\nAlternatively, we could move up to y=1 at turn18? Then at turn19 we are at y=1. Then at turn19 we could move to y=2? Then at turn20 we are at y=2 -> which is unsafe? Because freeway2 is unsafe at turn20.\n\nSimilarly, if we are at y=3 or y=4 at turn20, we crash.\n\nSo we must avoid being at y=1,2,3,4 at turn20.\n\nWe must be at y>=5 at turn20? or y=0? but we cannot be at y=0 at turn20 and then jump to y>=5? We move one step at a time.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at y=0 at turn20? Then we are safe. But then we have to cover 9 rows from turn20 onwards.\n\nBut we start at turn18 at y=0. How to be at y=0 at turn20? \n\nTurn18: at y0=0 -> we can do S: then at turn19: y=0.\nTurn19: do S: then at turn20: y=0. Safe.\n\nThen we start moving from y=0 at turn20.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The minimal moves from y=0 to y=9 is 9 moves. So we would reach at turn20+9=29.\n\nBut is there a way faster? We have to avoid also freeway5 and6 at turns22 and23.\n\nNow, from turn20: we are at y=0.\n\nWe can try to move up quickly, but we must avoid:\n\nAt turn22 and23: we must not be at freeway5 or6 (i.e., y=5 or6 at turn22 or23).\n\nSo let me plan:\n\nTurn20: at y=0 -> safe (not a freeway)\nTurn21: move U -> y=1 -> safe? freeway1 is only unsafe at turn20, so safe at turn21.\nTurn22: move U -> then at turn22 we are at y=2? Actually: \n   At turn21: we are at y=1. Then we move U to y=2 at the end of turn21? \n   But during turn21 we are at y=1 -> safe? because freeway1 unsafe only at 20? yes.\n\n   Then at turn22: we start at y=2. Then we move U: so during turn22 we are at y=2 -> safe? because freeway2 is unsafe only at 20? yes.\n\n   Then at turn23: we start at y=3 -> then we move U: so during turn23 we are at y=3 -> safe? freeway3 unsafe only at 20? yes.\n\n   Then at turn24: we are at y=4 -> move U: then at turn24 we are at y=4 -> freeway4 unsafe only at 20? safe.\n\n   Then at turn25: we are at y=5 -> move U: at turn25 we are at y=5 -> freeway5: unsafe at 22,23? but turn25 is safe? yes.\n\n   Then we continue: turn26: y=6 -> move U -> safe? freeway6 unsafe at 22,23? safe.\n   turn27: y=7 -> move U -> safe (freeway7 is safe always)\n   turn28: y=8 -> move U -> safe (freeway8 safe)\n   turn29: y=9 -> goal.\n\nBut wait: we are at y=5 at turn25: which is safe. Similarly, y=6 at turn26: safe.\n\nBut is there a problem at turn22 and23? We were at y=1 at turn21, then y=2 at turn22, then y=3 at turn23. So we avoided freeway5 and6 at turns22 and23.\n\nBut what about freeway5 and6 at other times? They are unsafe only at 22 and23. So we are safe.\n\nBut we used 11 moves: from turn18 to turn29? Actually, we started at turn18, then:\n\nTurn18: S (or we did two S at 18 and 19? Actually, we did two S at turn18 and turn19 to be at y=0 at turn20.\n\nThen from turn20 to turn29: 9 moves? That would be 10 turns? \n\nLet me list:\n\nTurn18: at y=0 -> we do S -> turn19: y=0\nTurn19: do S -> turn20: y=0\n\nThen:\nTurn20: U -> turn21: y=1\nTurn21: U -> turn22: y=2\nTurn22: U -> turn23: y=3\nTurn23: U -> turn24: y=4\nTurn24: U -> turn25: y=5\nTurn25: U -> turn26: y=6\nTurn26: U -> turn27: y=7\nTurn27: U -> turn28: y=8\nTurn28: U -> turn29: y=9\n\nSo we reached at turn29. Total turns from 18 to 29: 11 moves? Actually, the moves are from turn18 to turn28 (inclusive) because at each turn we do an action. The sequence of actions: 2 (S at 18 and 19) + 9 (U from 20 to 28) = 11 actions. But the goal is reached at the end of turn28? \n\nAt the start of turn18: y=0.\nAfter action at turn18: we are at the start of turn19? Actually, the update: at the end of the turn we update.\n\nBut the problem says: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, then we end the turn and then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t, and during the turn we are at y_t (so we check for collision at y_t at turn t). Then we move to y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nTherefore, we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn29? \n\nBut the problem says: we want to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nWe start at turn18: we do actions for t=0 to H-1? So the last action is at turn18+H-1, and then at the next turn (turn18+H) we are at y=9? \n\nBut the problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at (0,9). \n\nWait, the update: after action a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1, we get y_{t1+H} = ... and we require that at the beginning of the next turn? \n\nBut note: the player position after the sequence: the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then the new state is at turn t1+H. So we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H? \n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\nLet me read: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\" and the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so the actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter the action at turn t1+H-1, the next state is turn t1+H. But we want to be at (0,9) at the state of turn t1+H-1? \n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nBut note: at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t. Then we take action a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nSo to be at (0,9) at turn T, we must have that at the beginning of turn T, we are at (0,9). \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nTherefore, we want at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 to be at (0,9). \n\nBut note: we start at turn t1 (beginning) at (0,0). Then we take H-1 actions? \n\nActually, the sequence of actions is for t=0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions? \n\nLet me see: \n  The sequence: {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} \n  That means: \n      a_{t1+0} = a_{t1}\n      a_{t1+1}\n      ...\n      a_{t1+H-1}\n\n  So there are H actions: from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\n  After these H actions, we have advanced H turns? \n\n  Specifically, after the action at turn t1, we are at turn t1+1 (state). \n  After the action at turn t1+H-1, we are at turn t1+H (state).\n\n  Therefore, we are at (0,9) at the state of turn t1+H? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\" is ambiguous. \n\nLooking back: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\" and then in the answer format, we list actions from turn t1 to ... until the last action.\n\nBut note: the goal is reached at the turn after the last action? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we are at (0,9) at the next state? \n\nBut the problem states: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + ...\", so after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we compute y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δy. \n\nWe require that at the state of turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9)? Or at the state of turn t1+H we are at (0,9)?\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nBut in the problem statement: \"determine ... to reach (0,9)\", and then in the task: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nYes: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nSo we want at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9? \n\nBut wait: at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t. Then we take action a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1}. \n\nSo to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we must have taken actions that by the beginning of that turn we are at 9.\n\nBut then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? And then we move to y_{t1+H}. \n\nBut the problem doesn't require anything about y_{t1+H}. \n\nSo the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and we are at y=9 at the beginning of that turn? \n\nBut then we take an action (which might move us away) but the problem only requires that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9. \n\nHowever, during the turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9? And then we do an action? \n\nBut note: the collision rule: during turn T, we are at y_T (the freeway we are on) and we check for collision. \n\nSo if we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then during that turn we are at y=9 -> which is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8) -> safe. Then we do an action (which might be U, D, or S) but that action will change the y for the next turn. \n\nBut the problem doesn't say we have to stay at 9. It only says \"reach (0,9)\" meaning we are at 9 at the beginning of that turn? \n\nBut then the sequence of actions is H actions? And we are at 9 at the beginning of the last turn? \n\nThat would mean that we got to 9 by the previous action? \n\nExample: if we start at turn18 at y=0. Then we do U at turn18: then at the beginning of turn19 we are at y=1. \n\nBut we want to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo the minimal H would be 10: because we need to go from 0 to 9 in 9 moves, so we would be at y=9 at the beginning of turn18+9=27? \n\nBut then the sequence of actions would be from turn18 to turn18+9-1 = turn26? \n\nLet me clarify:\n\nWe are at turn t1=18: at the beginning, y=0.\n\nWe take actions at turns: 18,19,...,18+H-1.\n\nAfter the action at turn18, we are at the beginning of turn19 at y1.\n...\nAfter the action at turn18+H-1, we are at the beginning of turn18+H.\n\nWe require that at the beginning of turn18+H-1, we are at y=9? \n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nNote: the state at turn t1+H-1 is the beginning of that turn. \n\nSo we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nHow do we get to y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? \n\nWe start at turn18: y=0.\n\nWe take an action at turn18: then at the beginning of turn19 we are at y1 = 0+Δy0.\n\nWe take an action at turn19: then at the beginning of turn20 we are at y2 = y1+Δy1.\n\n...\n\nWe take an action at turn18+H-2: then at the beginning of turn18+H-1 we are at y_{H-1} = 9.\n\nTherefore, we take H-1 actions? \n\nBut the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1, meaning H actions. \n\nContradiction.\n\nLet me read: the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} -> that's H actions: for t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we are at the next state: turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThis implies that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9. But then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThat action will change the state to turn t1+H: y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δy = 9 + Δy.\n\nBut we don't care about that. \n\nSo the requirement is that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. \n\nTo get there, we need to have taken actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2? \n\nSpecifically, the actions at turn t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2 will determine y_{t1+H-1}. \n\nBut the sequence includes an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nSo we have to specify an action for turn t1+H-1 even though we are already at 9? \n\nThat action might move us away, but that's okay? The problem doesn't say we have to stay. \n\nBut note: during turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9 (the freeway check: safe) and then we do an action. \n\nSo the minimal H: we need to get to 9 as fast as possible. \n\nHow many actions are required to get from y=0 to y=9? At least 9 actions (if we go up every time). \n\nBut then we would be at y=9 at the beginning of turn18+9 = turn27. \n\nTherefore, we must have H-1 >= 9? So H>=10? \n\nBut the sequence of actions has H actions: from turn18 to turn18+H-1. \n\nAnd we require that at the beginning of turn18+H-1 we are at 9. \n\nSo the state at the beginning of turn18+H-1 is 9, which is the result of the previous H-1 actions? \n\nTherefore, we need at least 9 actions (U) to go from 0 to 9. So the earliest turn we can be at 9 is turn18+9 = 27? \n\nBut then the sequence of actions: \n   turns: 18,19,20,...,26 -> that's 9 actions? \n   and then at the beginning of turn27 we are at 9? \n\nBut the last action in the sequence is at turn18+H-1 = 26? Then we require that at the beginning of turn26? we are at 9? \n\nLet me index:\n\nTurn18: beginning -> y=0 -> we do a0 (say U) -> then at beginning of turn19: y=1.\nTurn19: y=1 -> do a1 (U) -> turn20: y=2.\n...\nTurn26: at the beginning: we want y=9. But how? \n\nAfter the action at turn25: we are at the beginning of turn26 at y8. Then we do an action at turn26 (the 9th action) which moves us to y9 at the beginning of turn27. \n\nBut we require to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn26? \n\nWe cannot be at y=9 at the beginning of turn26 with only 8 actions: because 8 actions can only get us to y=8.\n\nTherefore, to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn27, we need 9 actions (from turn18 to turn26). Then the beginning of turn27 is y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: we want at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 = 18+H-1 = 27? \n\nThen 18+H-1=27 => H-1=9 => H=10.\n\nSo we have 10 actions: from turn18 to turn27? But then at the beginning of turn27 we are at y=9, and then we take an action at turn27? But that would be the 10th action. \n\nBut the problem requires that at the beginning of turn27 (which is t1+10-1 = 18+9=27) we are at 9. \n\nHow do we achieve that? \n\nWe must have taken 9 actions (from turn18 to turn26) that get us to y=9 at the beginning of turn27. \n\nThen the 10th action is at turn27? But then we are at the beginning of turn27 at y=9, and then we take an action (the 10th) at turn27. \n\nThe problem requires the sequence to be of length H=10, so we must include an action at turn27. \n\nBut we are already at 9, so we can do S (stay) at turn27. \n\nThen during turn27, we are at y=9 (safe) and then we do S, and then at turn28 we are still at 9? \n\nBut the goal is reached at the beginning of turn27? \n\nThe problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\", and t1+H-1=27. \n\nSo the action at turn27 is allowed and we are at 9 at the beginning of that turn.\n\nBut we also have to avoid collisions during the entire sequence.\n\nIn our earlier plan that used 11 actions (from turn18 to turn28) we reached at turn29. But now we see that the minimal H is 10? \n\nBut in the minimal path without obstacles we can do it in 10 actions: \n\n  Actions at turns 18 to 26: 9 U moves -> then at the beginning of turn27: y=9.\n  Then at turn27: we do S (to complete the 10th action).\n\nBut then we are at turn27: we start at y=9, then we do S, and then we are at y=9 at turn28.\n\nBut the requirement is only that at the beginning of turn27 we are at 9, which we are.\n\nHowever, we must avoid collisions at every turn from 18 to 27.\n\nIn the direct path:\n\nTurn18: at y=0 -> safe.\nAction: U -> then at turn19: y=1.\n\nTurn19: at y=1 -> safe? freeway1: unsafe at T=20? not at T=19 -> safe.\nAction: U -> turn20: y=2.\n\nTurn20: at y=2 -> unsafe! because freeway2 is unsafe at T=20.\n\nSo we cannot do the direct path.\n\nWe must delay or change the path to avoid being on freeways 1-4 at turn20.\n\nWe have to be at y=0, or y>=5 at turn20? \n\nBut to be at y>=5 at turn20 (which is 2 moves from turn18), we can only be at y=2 at most? Because we start at y=0: \n  turn18: U -> turn19: y=1\n  turn19: U -> turn20: y=2\n\nWe cannot be at y=5 at turn20.\n\nTherefore, the only safe option at turn20 is to be at y=0.\n\nSo we must stay at y=0 for the first two turns:\n\nTurn18: S -> turn19: y=0\nTurn19: S -> turn20: y=0\n\nThen we are safe at turn20.\n\nNow, from turn20: y=0, we need to get to y=9 by turn27? (so that at turn27 we are at y=9) with 7 actions? \n\nBut we need 9 moves to go from 0 to 9. \n\nThe actions from turn20 to turn26: 7 actions -> we can only move up 7 times -> y=7 at the beginning of turn27.\n\nThen at turn27: we do an action (the 8th action in this phase, but the 10th overall) -> we move to y=8 at turn28? \n\nBut we are not at y=9 at the beginning of turn27.\n\nSo we cannot reach y=9 by turn27.\n\nTherefore, we must use more than 10 actions.\n\nNext: H=11.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn18+11-1 = turn28.\n\nSo we have 11 actions: from turn18 to turn28.\n\nWe need to go from y=0 to y=9 in 10 moves? Because the state at turn28 is the result of 10 moves? \n\nLet me count:\n\nStart: turn18: y=0.\nAfter 1 move (turn18): turn19: y1.\nAfter 2 moves: turn20: y2.\n...\nAfter k moves: turn18+k: y_k.\n\nWe require y_{10} at turn18+10 = turn28 to be 9.\n\nSo we need 10 moves: from turn18 to turn27 (10 actions) that result in y=9 at turn28.\n\nBut we have 11 actions: the sequence is 11 actions: turn18 to turn28.\n\nBut the last action (at turn28) will affect the state at turn29, which we don't care about.\n\nSo we only care about the state at turn28 (which is the result of the first 10 actions).\n\nTherefore, we need to go from y=0 to y=9 in 10 moves (with 10 U moves? but we can also use D or S).\n\nBut minimal moves is 9 U moves, so we can do 9 U and 1 S, but that would take 10 moves to get to 9.\n\nBut we must avoid the obstacles.\n\nWe have to be at y=0 at turn20 (as before).\n\nThen from turn20 (y=0) to turn28 (y=9) in 8 moves? \n\nBut 8 moves: we can go from 0 to 8? then we need one more move to get to 9 at turn29? \n\nBut we want y=9 at turn28? \n\nAt the beginning of turn28, we are at y? \n\nWe start at turn20: y=0.\nAfter 1 move (turn20): turn21: y1.\n...\nAfter 8 moves (turn27): turn28: y8.\n\nSo we are at y8 at turn28. To be at y=9 at turn28, we need 9 moves? \n\nWe are missing one move.\n\nTherefore, we need 11 moves to get from turn20 to turn29? \n\nBut then we would be at y=9 at turn29, which is the beginning of turn29 = t1+H-1 = 18+H-1.\n\nWe require: 18+H-1 = 29 => H-1=11 => H=12.\n\nBut then the sequence is 12 actions.\n\nAlternatively, we can get to y=9 in 9 moves from turn20, which would be at turn29: \n   turn20: start at 0\n   turn21: 1\n   ...\n   turn29: 9\n\nSo at the beginning of turn29: y=9.\n\nThen we set H such that t1+H-1=29 -> 18+H-1=29 -> H=12.\n\nThen we do 12 actions: from turn18 to turn29.\n\nBut at turn29 we are at y=9 at the beginning, then we do an action (the 12th) at turn29.\n\nNow, is there a way to do it in 11 actions? Then we would require to be at y=9 at turn18+11-1=28.\n\nBut to get from y=0 at turn18 to y=9 at turn28 (beginning) requires 10 moves. \n\nWe have 10 moves (actions at turn18 to turn27) to get to y=9 at turn28.\n\nBut we have to avoid being at freeways 1-4 at turn20 and 5-6 at turn22,23.\n\nAnd we are forced to be at y=0 at turn20.\n\nSo we do:\n\nTurn18: S (or we could do D? but y cannot go below 0, so S) -> turn19: y=0\nTurn19: S -> turn20: y=0\n\nThen from turn20 to turn27: we need to go from y=0 to y=9 in 7 moves? Impossible: 7 moves can only get us to y=7.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 12.\n\nWe do:\n\nTurn18: S -> turn19: y=0\nTurn19: S -> turn20: y=0\nThen we need to go from y=0 to y=9 in 9 moves: \n   turn20: U -> turn21: y=1\n   turn21: U -> turn22: y=2\n   turn22: U -> turn23: y=3\n   turn23: U -> turn24: y=4\n   turn24: U -> turn25: y=5\n   turn25: U -> turn26: y=6\n   turn26: U -> turn27: y=7\n   turn27: U -> turn28: y=8\n   turn28: U -> turn29: y=9\n\nBut at turn22: we are at y=2 -> freeway2: unsafe at T=22? No, freeway2 is only unsafe at T=20. So safe.\nAt turn23: y=3 -> freeway3: unsafe only at T=20 -> safe.\nAt turn25: y=5 -> freeway5: unsafe at T=22,23 -> but turn25 is safe.\nAt turn26: y=6 -> freeway6: unsafe at T=22,23 -> safe.\n\nBut wait: at turn22 and turn23, we are at y=2 and y=3, which are safe.\n\nSo the entire path is safe.\n\nAnd we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn29.\n\nThen we do an action at turn29: we can do S.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn18: S\nTurn19: S\nTurn20: U\nTurn21: U\nTurn22: U\nTurn23: U\nTurn24: U\nTurn25: U\nTurn26: U\nTurn27: U\nTurn28: U\nTurn29: S   (to complete the 12th action)\n\nBut is turn29: we are at y=9 at the beginning, and we do S, then we stay at 9.\n\nBut the problem: the sequence should be for H=12 actions.\n\nBut we only need 10 U moves to get to 9: from turn20 to turn28 (9 moves: because turn20:U -> turn21:1, ... turn28:U -> turn29:9). \n\nIn the above, we did 9 U moves from turn20 to turn28, and then at turn29 we do S.\n\nBut the two S at the beginning and one at the end: total 12 actions.\n\nBut note: we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn29, which is t1+12-1 = 18+11 = 29? t1+H-1=18+12-1=29 -> yes.\n\nSo we have:\n\nTurn18: S\nTurn19: S\nTurn20: U\nTurn21: U\nTurn22: U\nTurn23: U\nTurn24: U\nTurn25: U\nTurn26: U\nTurn27: U\nTurn28: U\nTurn29: S\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 11 actions? We would need to be at y=9 at turn28 (beginning). \n\nThat means we need to go from y=0 at turn18 to y=9 at turn28 in 10 moves.\n\nBut we are forced to be at y=0 at turn20, so we have only 8 moves from turn20 to turn27 to get from 0 to 9: which requires 9 moves -> impossible.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 12.\n\nBut wait: can we use down moves to avoid waiting? For example, go up to y=1 at turn18, then down to y=0 at turn19? \n\nThen at turn20 we are at y=0? \n\nBut at turn18: we start at y=0, then we do U: then at turn19: y=1.\nThen turn19: we do D: then at turn20: y=0.\n\nSo we are at y=0 at turn20. \n\nBut then we have used two moves and we are back at 0. \n\nSame as two S.\n\nNow, from turn20: y=0, we need to get to y=9 by turn28? That requires 8 moves: we can only get to y=8 at turn28.\n\nThen at turn28: we are at y=8, then we do U: then at turn29: y=9 -> which is what we want? \n\nBut we require to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn28? No, we require at the beginning of turn29 (if H=11: then t1+H-1=18+11-1=28? no: 28) -> so we would be at y=8 at turn28? Not 9.\n\nSo we need to do:\n\nTurn20: U -> turn21:1\n...\nTurn27: U -> turn28:8\nThen at turn28: we do U -> then at turn29:9 -> but then we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn29, which would be for H=12: t1+12-1=29.\n\nSo same as before.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 12.\n\nBut is there a faster way? \n\nWhat if we avoid freeway5 and6 by waiting? \n\nFreeway5 and6 are unsafe only at turns22 and23. \n\nWe could be at a safe freeway at those turns.\n\nFor example, we could be at y=7 or y=8 at turn22 and23? \n\nBut to get to y=7 or8 at turn23, we would have to move faster initially.\n\nBut we are constrained by turn20: we must be at y=0 at turn20.\n\nFrom turn20: y=0, we do:\n\nTurn20: U -> turn21:1\nTurn21: U -> turn22:2\nTurn22: U -> turn23:3\n\nBut we are at y=2 at turn22 and y=3 at turn23: safe.\n\nBut if we want to be at y=7 at turn22, we would need to go from 0 to 7 in 2 moves? Impossible.\n\nAlternatively, after turn20, we could move faster? But we can only move one step per turn.\n\nAnother idea: after turn20, we go up as fast as possible, but then we are at freeway5 at turn25? which is safe.\n\nBut we still need 9 moves from turn20 to turn29.\n\nSo we cannot reduce the number of moves.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 12.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn18: S\nTurn19: S\nTurn20: U\nTurn21: U\nTurn22: U\nTurn23: U\nTurn24: U\nTurn25: U\nTurn26: U\nTurn27: U\nTurn28: U\nTurn29: S\n\nBut at turn28: we do U: then at the beginning of turn29 we are at y=9? Yes.\n\nThen at turn29: we do S.\n\nBut note: at turn29, we are at y=9, which is safe.\n\nIs there any collision?\n\nCheck turn20: we are at y=0 -> safe.\nturn21: y=1 -> freeway1: unsafe only at 20 -> safe.\nturn22: y=2 -> freeway2: unsafe only at 20 -> safe.\nturn23: y=3 -> freeway3: unsafe only at 20 -> safe.\nturn24: y=4 -> freeway4: unsafe only at 20 -> safe.\nturn25: y=5 -> freeway5: unsafe at 22,23 -> safe (turn25 is safe).\nturn26: y=6 -> freeway6: unsafe at 22,23 -> safe.\nturn27: y=7 -> freeway7: safe.\nturn28: y=8 -> freeway8: safe.\nturn29: y=9 -> safe.\n\nAll safe.\n\nWe could do without the last S? But the sequence must have H=12 actions, so we need 12 actions.\n\nBut note: we are already at y=9 at turn29 (beginning), so we can do S.\n\nAlternatively, we could do U at turn29? Then we try to go to y=10, but y is only up to 9, so it stays at 9? \n\nThe rule: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and do U, we stay at 9? \n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\", so if we try to go above 9, we stay at 9? \n\nBut the movement rule: \n  if a_t = U: Δy=+1, but then y_{t+1} = min(y_t+1, 9) or clamped? \n\nThe problem doesn't specify clamping, but says \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\". So it must be clamped.\n\nBut the update is: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and then we require y_{t+1} in [0,9]. \n\nSo if y_t=9 and we do U, then y_{t+1} = 10, which is not in [0,9]? \n\nThen it must be adjusted. The problem doesn't specify, but to be safe, we do S at the last step.\n\nWe'll do S.\n\nNow, is there a sequence with H=11? \n\nWe require to be at y=9 at turn18+11-1=28.\n\nTo get to y=9 at turn28, we need to have moved up 9 times in the 10 moves from turn18 to turn27? \n\nBut we are forced to be at y=0 at turn20. \n\nSo the moves:\n\nTurn18: we can do something: let a18 be U or S or D.\n\nIf a18=U: then turn19: y=1.\nThen to be at y=0 at turn20: we must do D at turn19: so turn20: y=0.\n\nThen from turn20: y=0, we have 7 moves (turn20 to turn26) to get to y=9 at turn28? \n\nAt turn20: we start at 0.\nAfter turn20: U -> turn21:1\n...\nAfter 7 U: turn27: y=7 -> then at turn28: we do U: y=8 -> but we need y=9 at turn28.\n\nWe are one short.\n\nIf at turn18 we do D: but we are at y=0, so D -> y=0 at turn19.\nThen turn19: we do S: turn20: y=0.\nThen same as before.\n\nSo we cannot get to y=9 at turn28.\n\nTherefore, H=12 is minimal.\n\nFinal sequence:\n\nTurn18: S\nTurn19: S\nTurn20: U\nTurn21: U\nTurn22: U\nTurn23: U\nTurn24: U\nTurn25: U\nTurn26: U\nTurn27: U\nTurn28: U\nTurn29: S\n\nBut wait: from turn20 to turn28: that's 9 actions (turn20 to turn28 inclusive) which is 9 moves? Then we have the two S at the beginning and one S at the end: total 12.\n\nBut at turn28: we do U: then at turn29: y=9.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn29: y=9.\n\nAnd the last action at turn29: S.\n\nNow, write the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 18: S\nTurn 19: S\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: S\n}\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" for H=12, so t from 0 to 11: \n   t=0: turn18\n   t=1: turn19\n   ...\n   t=11: turn29.\n\nYes.\n\nWe can confirm the y at each turn:\n\nTurn18: start y=0 -> do S -> turn19: y=0\nTurn19: y=0 -> do S -> turn20: y=0\nTurn20: y=0 -> do U -> turn21: y=1\nTurn21: y=1 -> do U -> turn22: y=2\nTurn22: y=2 -> do U -> turn23: y=3\nTurn23: y=3 -> do U -> turn24: y=4\nTurn24: y=4 -> do U -> turn25: y=5\nTurn25: y=5 -> do U -> turn26: y=6\nTurn26: y=6 -> do U -> turn27: y=7\nTurn27: y=7 -> do U -> turn28: y=8\nTurn28: y=8 -> do U -> turn29: y=9\nTurn29: y=9 -> do S -> turn30: y=9 (but we don't care)\n\nAnd at turn29 (the last state we care about for the goal) we are at y=9.\n\nAnd collisions: we checked above.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 18\\) is 12. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) as follows:\n\n- At turn 20, freeways 1, 2, 3, and 4 are unsafe. The player is at \\(y = 0\\) (safe) by performing \"S\" (stay) at turns 18 and 19.\n- At turns 22 and 23, freeways 5 and 6 are unsafe. The player is at \\(y = 2\\) and \\(y = 3\\) respectively, which are safe since these freeways are only unsafe at turn 20.\n- From turn 20 onwards, the player moves up (\"U\") each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) at the beginning of turn 29. The final action at turn 29 is \"S\" to complete the sequence without moving.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 18: S \\\\\nTurn 19: S \\\\\nTurn 20: U \\\\\nTurn 21: U \\\\\nTurn 22: U \\\\\nTurn 23: U \\\\\nTurn 24: U \\\\\nTurn 25: U \\\\\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: U \\\\\nTurn 28: U \\\\\nTurn 29: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 0) at turn t_1 = 22. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y-position by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, with y clamped between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs if at any turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where there's a car whose span includes x=0 at that turn. The span moves based on direction and speed.\n\nImportant note: When moving to a new y-position, you're not on that freeway until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, you're on y at turn T, and on y+1 at turn T+1. You only check for collision on the freeway you're currently on at that turn.\n\nThe car states are given for turn t_1=22. For each car, we have (head, tail, direction, speed). Direction is \"right\" or \"left\", but in the update, left-moving cars have span decreasing, right-moving have span increasing.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t), τ - s(T-t)]\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)]\n\nIn the table, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). I need to interpret head and tail based on direction.\n\nFor a left-moving car, head is the front, which is larger x if moving left, but since it's moving left, head should be the right end, tail left? Let's see the update.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and it moves left, so at T>t_1, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so h and τ both decrease, meaning h is the right end, τ is the left end.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h], and at T>t_1, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so τ is the left end, h is the right end.\n\nIn the input, for each car, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed). But based on direction, head and tail might be different.\n\nLet's look at the data.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, span is [tail, head], so tail is left, head is right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all cars here seem to be right-moving except? Let's check.\n\nAll directions are \"right\" in this case. Look:\n\nFreeway 1: right\n\nFreeway 2: right\n\nFreeway 3: right\n\nFreeway 4: right\n\nFreeway 5: multiple cars, all right\n\nFreeway 6: multiple, all right\n\nFreeway 7: right\n\nFreeway 8: right\n\nNo left-moving cars, all are right-moving.\n\nFor right-moving cars, the span is given as [tail, head] at time t_1, meaning tail is the left end, head is the right end.\n\nIn the input, for each car, it's (head, tail, direction, speed). But for right-moving, head should be the right end, tail left end.\n\nIn freeway 5, for example: (48, 37, right, 6) — head=48, tail=37? But 48 > 37, so if right-moving, tail should be left, head right, so [tail, head] = [37,48], which makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, (-24, -35, right, 6): head=-24, tail=-35, since -24 > -35, so [tail, head] = [-35, -24].\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for collision: at turn T, for freeway y, if player is on y at turn T, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] for right-moving cars, where ΔT = T - t_1.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, span at T is [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nCollision if 0 is in that interval.\n\nNow, player starts at y=0 at t=22.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, I think? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 might be safe, no cars.\n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1, …, 8.\" And player position is from y=0 to y=9.\n\nAlso, when at y=0, you can't go down, similarly at y=9, can't go up, but since we start at y=0 and go to y=9, we need to move up.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=0, minimum moves: since each U increases y by 1, from 0 to 9, we need at least 9 Up moves. But we can also move down or stay, which might be necessary to avoid cars, but that would increase H, so minimal H should be at least 9, but probably more if we have to wait or avoid.\n\nBut since we can only move one step at a time, and we need to go from 0 to 9, the minimal number of turns is at least 9, if we do U every turn. But we might need to stay or move down to avoid collisions, so H could be more than 9.\n\nBut we need the minimal H, so we should try to go up as fast as possible, only deviating if necessary for collision avoidance.\n\nNow, the key is to compute for each freeway, when there is a car such that 0 is in its span at a given turn.\n\nSince the player moves one y per turn, we need to consider the sequence of y positions over time.\n\nLet me denote t_1 = 22 as the starting turn.\n\nPlayer at turn t: y_t, for t >= 22, y_22 = 0.\n\nAction a_t at turn t determines y_{t+1}.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nAt turn t, player is on freeway y_t, and we check if there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at time t.\n\nFor freeway y_t, at time t, if y_t between 1 and 8, and if there is a car on that row with 0 in [τ + s(t - 22), h + s(t - 22)] for that car.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving.\n\nNow, for each freeway, we have the car configurations at t=22.\n\nI need to find when it is safe to be on each freeway at each future turn.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head h=-48, tail τ=-71, direction right, speed s=24\n\nFor right-moving, span at t=22: [τ, h] = [-71, -48]\n\nAt time T, span: [τ + s(T-22), h + s(T-22)] = [-71 + 24(T-22), -48 + 24(T-22)]\n\nCollision if 0 in this interval, so:\n\n-71 + 24(ΔT) <= 0 <= -48 + 24(ΔT)  where ΔT = T - 22\n\nSo, -71 + 24ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 24ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -71 + 24ΔT <= 0 => 24ΔT <= 71 => ΔT <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so ΔT <= 2 since ΔT integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 + 24ΔT => 48 <= 24ΔT => 2 <= ΔT\n\nSo for ΔT=2: both inequalities hold? Let's see.\n\nFor ΔT=2: lower bound: -71 + 24*2 = -71 + 48 = -23\n\nUpper bound: -48 + 48 = 0\n\nSo span: [-23, 0]\n\n0 is included, since upper bound is 0.\n\n[ -23, 0 ], 0 is the upper bound, so yes, 0 is in the span.\n\nSimilarly, for ΔT=1: lower: -71+24= -47, upper: -48+24= -24, span [-47,-24], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=0: at t=22, span [-71,-48], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=3: lower: -71+72=1, upper: -48+72=24, [1,24], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision at ΔT=2, i.e., T=22+2=24.\n\nOnly at T=24, when ΔT=2.\n\nNow, freeway 2: one car: head h=-48, tail τ=-83, direction right, speed s=36\n\nSpan at t=22: [τ, h] = [-83, -48]\n\nAt T: [ -83 + 36(ΔT), -48 + 36(ΔT) ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -83 +36ΔT, -48 +36ΔT ]\n\nSo:\n\n-83 +36ΔT <= 0 <= -48 +36ΔT\n\nFirst: -83 +36ΔT <=0 => 36ΔT <=83 => ΔT <=83/36≈2.305, so ΔT <=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +36ΔT => 48 <=36ΔT => ΔT >= 48/36=4/3≈1.333, so ΔT >=2 since integer.\n\nΔT >=2 and ΔT <=2, so only ΔT=2.\n\nAt ΔT=2: lower: -83 + 72 = -11, upper: -48 +72=24, span [-11,24], 0 included.\n\nΔT=1: lower -83+36= -47, upper -48+36= -12, [-47,-12], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=3: lower -83+108=25, upper -48+108=60, [25,60], no.\n\nSo freeway 2, collision only at T=24.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? Head -48, tail -83, right, speed 36. Identical to freeway 2.\n\nSo collision only at T=24.\n\nFreeway 4: also same, head -48, tail -83, right, speed 36. So same as above, collision only at T=24.\n\nNow freeway 5: has multiple cars.\n\nCars: (48, 37, right, 6), (12, 1, right, 6), (-24, -35, right, 6)\n\nAll speed 6, right-moving.\n\nFor each car, span at T: [τ + 6(ΔT), h + 6(ΔT)]\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, so [37 + 6ΔT, 48 + 6ΔT]\n\nCollision if 0 in [37+6ΔT, 48+6ΔT]\n\nSince 37+6ΔT >0 for all ΔT>=0, as min at ΔT=0 is 37>0, so 0 never in this interval. So first car never at x=0.\n\nSecond car: head=12, tail=1, so [1 + 6ΔT, 12 + 6ΔT]\n\n1+6ΔT >=1 >0, so 0 not in, never collision.\n\nThird car: head=-24, tail=-35, so [ -35 + 6ΔT, -24 + 6ΔT ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -35 +6ΔT, -24 +6ΔT ]\n\nSo:\n\n-35 +6ΔT <= 0 <= -24 +6ΔT\n\nFirst: -35 +6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=35 => ΔT <=35/6≈5.833, so ΔT <=5\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +6ΔT => 24 <=6ΔT => ΔT >=4\n\nSo for ΔT=4,5\n\nΔT=4: lower -35+24= -11, upper -24+24=0, span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔT=5: lower -35+30= -5, upper -24+30=6, [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nΔT=3: lower -35+18= -17, upper -24+18= -6, [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=6: lower -35+36=1, upper -24+36=12, [1,12], no.\n\nSo for freeway 5, collision at ΔT=4 and 5, i.e., T=26 and 27.\n\nNow freeway 6: same cars as freeway 5? (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nIdentical to freeway 5, so collision at T=26 and 27.\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (48,37,right,12)\n\nHead=48, tail=37, speed 12.\n\nSpan at T: [37 + 12ΔT, 48 + 12ΔT]\n\n37+12ΔT >=37>0, so 0 never in, no collision ever for this car. So freeway 7 is always safe? But we need to check if there are other cars, but only one car listed, so probably no collision on freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (48,37,right,4)\n\nHead=48, tail=37, speed 4.\n\nSpan: [37 + 4ΔT, 48 + 4ΔT]\n\nAgain, 37+4ΔT >=37>0, so never includes 0, so no collision on freeway 8.\n\nNow, summarize the dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: collision at T=24\n\n- Freeway 2: collision at T=24\n\n- Freeway 3: collision at T=24 (same as 2)\n\n- Freeway 4: collision at T=24 (same)\n\n- Freeway 5: collision at T=26 and 27\n\n- Freeway 6: collision at T=26 and 27\n\n- Freeway 7: always safe\n\n- Freeway 8: always safe\n\nFreeways 1,2,3,4 all have collision only at T=24.\n\nFreeways 5 and 6 have collision at T=26 and 27.\n\nFreeways 7 and 8 are always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at t=22.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no freeways, so no collision possible there. Only when on y=1 to 8.\n\nThe path: we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince we start at y=0, and end at y=9, with minimum turns, but we might have to avoid being on certain rows at certain times.\n\nThe dangerous times are only at specific turns for specific rows.\n\nSpecifically, at T=24, freeways 1,2,3,4 are dangerous (y=1,2,3,4)\n\nAt T=26 and 27, freeways 5 and 6 are dangerous (y=5,6)\n\nFreeways 7 and 8 are always safe.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a dangerous row at the dangerous time.\n\nLet me denote the turn from t=22 onwards.\n\nAt t=22: y=0, safe, no freeway.\n\nWe choose action a_22, which affects y_23.\n\nSimilarly, at each turn, we choose action to change y.\n\nSince we need to reach y=9, and minimal turns, we should use U as much as possible, but only if it doesn't cause collision.\n\nNow, let's think about the timing.\n\nThe critical points are T=24,26,27.\n\nAlso, since we start at t=22, y=0.\n\nIf we go up immediately:\n\nt=22: y=0, action U, then y_23=1\n\nAt t=23: y=1, which is freeway 1. Now, at t=23, is freeway 1 dangerous? From above, freeway 1 dangerous only at T=24, not at T=23. At T=23, ΔT=1, span for freeway 1: earlier, at ΔT=1, span [-47,-24], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2,3,4 at T=23: ΔT=1, for freeway 2: at ΔT=1, span [-47,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSo at t=23, if we are on y=1, it is safe.\n\nAction at t=23: if we do U, y_24=2\n\nAt t=24: y=2, which is freeway 2. Now at T=24, freeway 2 is dangerous, collision.\n\nIf we do S at t=23, y_24=1, then at t=24, y=1, freeway 1, which is also dangerous at T=24.\n\nIf we do D at t=23, but y=1, down to y=0, but y=0 is safe, but we are going down, not good for reaching 9.\n\nBut at t=24, if we are on y=1 or 2 or 3 or 4, it's dangerous.\n\nSpecifically, freeways 1,2,3,4 all dangerous at T=24.\n\ny=1,2,3,4 correspond to freeways 1,2,3,4.\n\nAt T=24, if player is on y=1,2,3, or 4, collision occurs.\n\nTo avoid, at turn 24, we must not be on y=1,2,3,4.\n\nThat means we must be on y=0, or y=5,6,7,8, or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, we might not be there yet.\n\nSimilarly, at T=26 and 27, freeways 5 and 6 dangerous, so we must not be on y=5 or 6 at turns 26 and 27.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nWe start at t=22, y=0.\n\nAt t=22, we choose action.\n\nIf we do U at t=22, y_23=1.\n\nAt t=23, y=1, safe as established.\n\nNow at t=23, we need to choose action such that at t=24, we are not on y=1,2,3,4.\n\nSince y_23=1, if we do U, y_24=2, which is bad.\n\nIf we do S, y_24=1, bad.\n\nIf we do D, y_24=0, which is safe, but we go down to 0, which means we wasted a move.\n\nThen we have to go up again later.\n\nBut that might increase H.\n\nAt t=23, y=1, we could do nothing and go down, but not efficient.\n\nPerhaps we should not go to y=1 at t=23.\n\nAt t=22, instead of U, we could do S or D, but D to y=-1? No, y min 0, so D not possible from 0, I think.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y in [0,9], so if at 0, D would try to go to -1, but probably clamped to 0, or not allowed? The problem says y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if y_t=0 and a_t=D, y_{t+1}= max(0, -1) =0, I assume. Similarly for y=9 and U.\n\nBut in this case, at y=0, D has no effect, similarly S stays at 0.\n\nSo at t=22, y=0, if we do S, y_23=0, still at start.\n\nBut we need to move up eventually.\n\nTo avoid being on low rows at t=24, we might delay moving up.\n\nFor example, at t=22, we do S, so y_23=0.\n\nThen at t=23, we do U, so y_24=1? y_23=0, a_t=U, y_24=1.\n\nBut at t=24, y=1, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf at t=23 we do S, y_24=0, safe, but still at 0.\n\nThen later.\n\nBut we need to reach 9.\n\nSince at t=24 we must not be on y=1-4, we could be on y=0 or y=5+.\n\nBut to be on y=5+ at t=24, we need to have moved up faster.\n\nFrom t=22, y=0.\n\nAfter one move, at t=23, y=1 if U, or 0 if S.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=23, to be at y=5 at t=24, we need to move up 4 steps in one turn, impossible, since each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nMaximum y at t=24: start t=22 y=0.\n\nt=22 action: if U, y_23=1\n\nt=23 action: if U, y_24=2\n\nSimilarly, if we do U both times, y_24=2.\n\nIf we do S at t=22, y_23=0, then U at t=23, y_24=1.\n\nSo maximum y at t=24 is 2, if we did U at both turns.\n\nBut y=2 is still in 1-4, dangerous at t=24.\n\nWe cannot be at y=5 or higher at t=24, since from y=0, in two moves, max y=2.\n\nTherefore, at t=24, we must be at y=0 to avoid collision.\n\nThe only safe position at t=24 is y=0, since y=5+ is unreachable.\n\ny=0 is safe, as no freeway.\n\nSo we must have y_24 = 0.\n\nNow, y_24 depends on y_23 and action at t=23.\n\ny_24 = y_23 + Δy_{23}\n\nWe need y_24=0.\n\ny_23 can be 0 or 1, as above.\n\nIf y_23=0, then to have y_24=0, we can do S or D, both give y_24=0.\n\nIf y_23=1, then to have y_24=0, we need to do D, so y_24=0.\n\nBut if y_23=1, doing D to go to 0.\n\nNow, from start: at t=22, y=0.\n\nIf we do S at t=22, then y_23=0.\n\nThen at t=23, we can do S or D to have y_24=0.\n\nIf we do U at t=22, y_23=1.\n\nThen at t=23, we must do D to have y_24=0.\n\nIn the first case, we stay at 0, in the second, we go to 1 and back to 0, wasting a move.\n\nTo minimize turns, we should avoid unnecessary moves, so better to stay at 0 by doing S at t=22 and S at t=23, so y_23=0 and y_24=0.\n\nThen at t=24, we are safe at y=0.\n\nNow, after t=24, we need to go up.\n\nBut there are other dangerous times: T=26 and 27 for y=5 and 6.\n\nNow, at t=24, y=0.\n\nWe can start moving up.\n\nt=24: y=0, we can do U, then y_25=1.\n\nNow, at t=25: y=1, which is freeway 1. Is it safe at t=25?\n\nt=25, ΔT = T - t_1 = 25 - 22 = 3\n\nFor freeway 1: at ΔT=3, span [ -71 +24*3, -48 +24*3] = [-71+72, -48+72] = [1,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: at ΔT=3, span [-83+36*3, -48+36*3] = [-83+108, -48+108] = [25,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAll freeways 1-4 safe at t=25, since dangerous only at t=24.\n\nSimilarly, at t=25, freeway 5: ΔT=3, for the dangerous car, third car, at ΔT=3, span [-35+18, -24+18] = [-17,-6], 0 not in, so safe. Similarly freeway 6.\n\nSo at t=25, y=1 is safe.\n\nNow, we can do U at t=25, so y_26=2.\n\nt=25 action U, y_26=2.\n\nNow at t=26: y=2, freeway 2.\n\nBut at t=26, which is T=26, we have danger for freeways 5 and 6 at T=26.\n\nBut y=2 is freeway 2, which is fine, no danger at t=26.\n\nFor freeway 2, dangerous only at t=24, so at t=26, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 is safe.\n\nBut we need to go to higher y.\n\nAt t=26, y=2, we can do U, to y_27=3.\n\nThen at t=27: y=3, freeway 3, which should be safe, since dangerous only at t=24.\n\nBut now, t=27 is dangerous for y=5 and 6.\n\ny=3 is fine.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nIf we keep going up:\n\nt=27: y=3, do U, y_28=4\n\nt=28: y=4, do U, y_29=5\n\nNow at t=29: y=5, which is freeway 5.\n\nBut freeway 5 is dangerous at t=26 and 27, but t=29 is later.\n\nt=29, ΔT=29-22=7\n\nFor freeway 5, dangerous at ΔT=4 and 5, i.e., t=26 and 27.\n\nAt t=29, ΔT=7, for the third car: span [ -35 +6*7, -24 +6*7] = [-35+42, -24+42] = [7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, other cars not dangerous.\n\nSo y=5 at t=29 is safe.\n\nThen continue: t=29, do U, y_30=6\n\nt=30: y=6, freeway 6.\n\nAt t=30, ΔT=8, freeway 6 similar to 5, span for dangerous car: [ -35 +6*8, -24+48] = [-35+48, -24+48] = [13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen U, y_31=7\n\nt=31: y=7, freeway 7, always safe.\n\nU, y_32=8\n\nt=32: y=8, freeway 8, always safe.\n\nU, y_33=9\n\nNow at t=33, y=9, which is the goal, no freeway, safe.\n\nWe reached at turn t=33.\n\nBut is this minimal H?\n\nH is the number of turns from t_1, and we reached at y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt_1=22, we have actions from t=22 to t=32? Let's list the turns.\n\nPlayer position:\n\nt=22: y=0\n\nAfter action a_22, y_23\n\n...\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify actions starting from t_1.\n\nIn this plan:\n\nAt t=22: we need to have y_24=0, so we did S at t=22 and S at t=23? Earlier I said to avoid, we do S at t=22 and S at t=23 to stay at 0.\n\nThen:\n\nt=22: y=0, action S (so y_23=0)\n\nt=23: y=0, action S (so y_24=0)\n\nt=24: y=0, action U (so y_25=1)\n\nt=25: y=1, action U (y_26=2)\n\nt=26: y=2, action U (y_27=3)\n\nt=27: y=3, action U (y_28=4)\n\nt=28: y=4, action U (y_29=5)\n\nt=29: y=5, action U (y_30=6)\n\nt=30: y=6, action U (y_31=7)\n\nt=31: y=7, action U (y_32=8)\n\nt=32: y=8, action U (y_33=9)\n\nAt t=33, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, the turns: actions from t=22 to t=32 inclusive? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from t=22 to t=32, that's 11 actions: t=22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32.\n\nAfter these actions, y at t=33 is 9.\n\ny_{t} at time t.\n\nAt time t, before action, position is y_t, then we choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} is updated.\n\nThe position at turn t is y_t.\n\nWe start at t=22, y_22=0.\n\nAfter H turns, meaning after H actions, we are at turn t_22 + H, position y_{t_22 + H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{t_22 + H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions a_{t_22} to a_{t_22 + H -1}, and after H actions, at turn t_22 + H, y=9.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nIn the above, from t=22 to t=32, we have actions: let's list the action times.\n\nAction at t=22: S, so y_23=0\n\nAction at t=23: S, y_24=0\n\nAction at t=24: U, y_25=1\n\nAction at t=25: U, y_26=2\n\nAction at t=26: U, y_27=3\n\nAction at t=27: U, y_28=4\n\nAction at t=28: U, y_29=5\n\nAction at t=29: U, y_30=6\n\nAction at t=30: U, y_31=7\n\nAction at t=31: U, y_32=8\n\nAction at t=32: U, y_33=9\n\nSo at t=33, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=22 to t=32 inclusive, that's 11 actions: t=22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32.\n\nH=11, since we have actions from t=22 to t=22 +10 =32, so t=22 + t for t=0 to 10, 11 actions.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so H=11.\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nEarlier I assumed we stayed at 0 for t=22 and t=23 to avoid danger at t=24.\n\nBut is there a way to be at higher y at t=24 safely? We saw it's impossible since max y=2 at t=24.\n\ny=0 is the only safe.\n\nBut at t=24, we are at y=0, then we start moving.\n\nBut notice that at t=26 and 27, we need to avoid y=5 and 6.\n\nIn the above sequence, at t=26, we are at y=2, which is fine, and at t=27, y=3, fine.\n\nThen we reach y=5 at t=29, which is after t=27, so safe.\n\nBut can we go faster?\n\nFor example, if we could be at y=5 or 6 before t=26 or after t=27, but since we start late, we are at low y.\n\nSuppose at t=22, we do U, so y_23=1.\n\nThen at t=23, to have y_24=0, we must do D, so y_24=0.\n\nThen same as before, but we did an extra down move, so we are still at y=0 at t=24, but we used an extra turn: actions: t=22 U, t=23 D, then t=24 U, etc., so we have one more action, worse.\n\nFor example: t=22 U, y_23=1\n\nt=23 D, y_24=0\n\nt=24 U, y_25=1\n\nt=25 U, y_26=2\n\n...\n\nThen to reach y=9, it would take more turns, since we went up to 1 and back.\n\nAt t=24 y=0, then U to y=1 at t=25, same as before, but we had an extra pair: U and D at t=22 and 23, so we are at same point but with two actions instead of one? In the first way, to be at y=0 at t=24, with S at t=22 and S at t=23, two actions to stay.\n\nIn this, U at t=22 and D at t=23, also two actions to be at y=0 at t=24, same.\n\nThen from there same.\n\nBut in terms of reaching y=9, it might be the same.\n\nIn the sequence above with S,S, we have actions from t=22 to t=32, 11 actions, reach at t=33.\n\nIf we do U and D, it would be: t=22 U, y_23=1\n\nt=23 D, y_24=0\n\nt=24 U, y_25=1\n\nt=25 U, y_26=2\n\n... same up to t=32 U, y_33=9, but now actions from t=22 to t=32, still 11 actions? t=22,23,24,...,32, same 11 actions.\n\nt=22 to t=32 inclusive is 11 turns: 22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in this case, at t=23 we were at y=1, which was safe, and we moved down to avoid t=24.\n\nBut same number of actions.\n\nNow, can we reach earlier?\n\nSuppose we want to be at y=9 earlier.\n\nMinimal possible: if no cars, we could do U every turn from t=22 to t=30, y at t=23=1, t=24=2, ..., t=31=9, so reach at t=31 with actions from t=22 to t=30, 9 actions.\n\nBut with cars, we have to avoid t=24 on y=1-4.\n\nAt t=24, we must be at y=0, so we cannot be at y=2 at t=24 as in the fast path.\n\nTherefore, we have to spend turns to stay low or something.\n\nAt t=24, only y=0 is safe.\n\nThen from t=24, y=0, to go to y=9, we need 9 Up moves, so from t=24 to t=32, with U each turn, y at t=25=1, t=26=2, ..., t=33=9, so reach at t=33, with actions from t=24 to t=32.\n\nBut we need actions starting from t=22.\n\nFrom t=22 to t=23, we need to get to y_24=0.\n\nWith two turns: we can do S and S, or U and D, both require two actions to be at y=0 at t=24 with no progress.\n\nThen from t=24, 9 actions to reach y=9 at t=33.\n\nTotal actions: 2 (to stay) + 9 (up) = 11, from t=22 to t=32.\n\nThe actions before t=24 are necessary to be safe at t=24.\n\nBut is there a way to be at higher y at t=24? No, as established.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=0 at t=24, but then go up faster, but we are going up as fast as possible.\n\nAnother thing: the danger at t=26 and 27 for y=5 and 6.\n\nIn our path, we are at y=2 at t=26 and y=3 at t=27, which are safe, and we reach y=5 at t=29, which is after t=27, so no issue.\n\nBut suppose we could be at higher y earlier, but we can't because we started late.\n\nFor example, if at t=24 we are at y=0, then we go up, at t=25 y=1, t=26 y=2, etc., as before.\n\nWe could go up faster? No, only one step per turn.\n\nUnless we skip some, but no.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps we can go to y=7 or 8 earlier by not going through lower rows when dangerous, but in this case, since we are delayed, we are at low rows during t=26,27 which are not dangerous for those rows.\n\nBut for y=5 and 6, dangerous at t=26,27, but we are not on them at that time.\n\nIn fact, in our sequence, we are on y=5 at t=29, which is safe.\n\nBut can we be on y=5 before t=26?\n\nFor example, if we were higher earlier.\n\nBut from start, at t=22 y=0, t=23 max y=1, t=24 must be 0, so at t=24 y=0, then t=25 y=1, t=26 y=2, so at t=26 we are at y=2, cannot be at y=5.\n\nSimilarly, impossible to be at y=5 before t=26.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=5 is after t=24.\n\nt=24 y=0, then t=25 y=1, t=26 y=2, t=27 y=3, t=28 y=4, t=29 y=5.\n\nSo y=5 at t=29, after t=27, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=6.\n\nNow, but at t=26 and t=27, we are at y=2 and y=3, which are safe.\n\nIn the sequence, we are going through all rows.\n\nBut freeways 7 and 8 are always safe, but we go through them later.\n\nNow, back to minimal H.\n\nWith H=11, we reach at t=33.\n\nBut perhaps we can save a turn by not staying at 0 both times.\n\nFor example, at t=22, we do S, y_23=0.\n\nAt t=23, instead of S, we do something else? But if we do U at t=23, y_24=1, but then at t=24 y=1, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf we do D at t=23, but y=0, D does nothing, same as S.\n\nSo we must have two actions to be at y=0 at t=24: either S,S or U then D, but U then D has the same effect but with movement, but in terms of position, same, and same number of actions.\n\nIn U then D, we have an action that changes y, but since we end at same, it doesn't help.\n\nSo we need two turns to be at y=0 at t=24.\n\nThen 9 turns to go from y=0 to y=9, starting from t=24 to t=32, y at t=33=9.\n\nTotal 11 actions.\n\nBut the go up takes 9 actions: from y=0 to y=9, 9 steps, 9 actions.\n\nActions: to increase y by 1 each time, from y=0 to y=9, we need 9 U actions.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, so from 0 to 9, exactly 9 U moves, but they can be at different times.\n\nIn time, from start to end, with possible S or D, but to minimize time, we should not have S or D, only U.\n\nBut here, we have to have the two initial actions that are not U.\n\nIn the sequence, we have two S (or one U and one D) at the beginning, then 9 U.\n\nSo 11 actions total.\n\nNow, about the later danger: at t=26 and 27, for y=5 and 6.\n\nIn our path, at t=26, y=2, which is not 5 or 6, safe.\n\nt=27, y=3, not 5 or 6, safe.\n\nThen t=28 y=4, safe.\n\nt=29 y=5, but t=29 > t=27, and freeway 5 dangerous only at t=26 and 27, so at t=29 safe.\n\nSimilarly y=6 at t=30, safe.\n\nNo problem.\n\nBut can we reach y=9 earlier than t=33?\n\nFor example, if we could be at higher y at some point.\n\nBut at t=24, we must be at y=0.\n\nThen t=25 y=1, t=26 y=2, ..., up to t=33 y=9.\n\nThe sequence is fixed in y after t=24.\n\nBefore t=24, we are stuck at y=0.\n\nSo I think 11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nIn the sequence I have:\n\nt=22: S\n\nt=23: S\n\nt=24: U\n\nt=25: U\n\nt=26: U\n\nt=27: U\n\nt=28: U\n\nt=29: U\n\nt=30: U\n\nt=31: U\n\nt=32: U\n\nThen y_33=9.\n\nNow, we need to output for turn t_1=22, actions from t=22 to t=32.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nUp to the last action.\n\nt_1=22.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 22: S\n\nTurn 23: S\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nAfter action at t=32, y_33=9.\n\nIs there a way to have only 10 actions?\n\nSuppose we do only 10 actions, then at turn t_22 +10 =32, y_32 should be 9.\n\nBut from y_22=0, to y_32=9, we need net +9 in y, so exactly 9 Up actions, and possibly some S or D that don't change y.\n\nBut in this case, with the constraint at t=24.\n\nt=24 is turn t_22 +2, since t_22 +0=22, t_22 +1=23, t_22 +2=24.\n\nAt t=24, we need y_24=0.\n\ny_24 depends on actions at t=22 and t=23.\n\ny_23 = y_22 + Δy_22\n\ny_24 = y_23 + Δy_23\n\ny_22=0.\n\nIf we do U at t=22, y_23=1\n\nThen to have y_24=0, must do D at t=23.\n\nIf S at t=22, y_23=0, then to y_24=0, do S or D at t=23.\n\nIn both cases, after two actions, at t=24, y=0.\n\nThen from t=24 to t=32, 8 turns? t=24 to t=32 is 8 actions: t=24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31.\n\nAfter 8 actions from t=24, y at t=32.\n\nStart from y_24=0.\n\nAfter 8 actions, if all U, y_32=8, since 8 increases.\n\ny_24=0, after one U, y_25=1, ..., after k U, y_{24+k} = k.\n\nSo after 8 U, at t=32, y=8.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9, so we need another action at t=32, U, to get y_33=9.\n\nThus, we need 9 actions after t=24 to reach y=9 at t=33.\n\nPlus the two actions before to be safe at t=24, total 11.\n\nIf we could reach y=9 with fewer, but no.\n\nAnother point: at t=26 and 27, we have to avoid y=5 and 6, but in our path, we are below, so no issue.\n\nBut suppose we could be at y=7 or 8 during t=26 or 27, but we can't because we are at y=0 at t=24.\n\nFor example, at t=26, with y_24=0, t=25 y=1, t=26 y=2, cannot be higher.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut in the action sequence, we have 11 actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, all actions except the first two S are U.\n\nBut we can have the first two as S and S, or U and D.\n\nBut since S and S are simpler, no movement.\n\nIn terms of the answer, it should be fine.\n\nNow, but we need to output the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=26, y=2, which is freeway 2, and t=26, is it safe?\n\nt=26, ΔT=26-22=4\n\nFreeway 2: at ΔT=4, span [ -83 +36*4, -48 +36*4] = [-83+144, -48+144] = [61,96], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSimilarly, at t=27, y=3, freeway 3, ΔT=5, span [-83+180, -48+180]=[97,132], no.\n\nNow, but freeway 5 and 6 dangerous at t=26, but we are not on them.\n\nIn the sequence, when we are on y=5 at t=29, ΔT=7, as before, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo the sequence should work.\n\nBut is there a shorter path by using D somewhere? Probably not, since D would decrease y, requiring more U later, increasing H.\n\nFor example, if we go down at some point, we need to come back, so net more actions.\n\nSo minimal is to go directly up after t=24.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=11.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to write the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, we have two S at start, then 9 U.\n\nBut in the output, for turn t_1=22.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 22: S\n\nTurn 23: S\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write in the format.\n\nThe answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 22: S\nTurn 23: S\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\n}\n\nBut is this correct?\n\nAt t=32, we do U, and y_33=9.\n\nH=11 turns of actions.\n\nThe sequence is from t=22 to t=32.\n\nIn the player position, at turn t, before action.\n\nAfter last action at t=32, position at t=33 is (0,9).\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we can start moving up earlier but avoid the collision differently, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother thought: at t=24, we must not be on y=1-4, but if we are on y=5 or higher, but impossible.\n\nOr, we could be moving to a different row, but at the turn, we are on the row before moving.\n\nFor example, at turn t, we are on y_t, then we choose action to go to y_{t+1}.\n\nThe collision is based on y_t at turn t.\n\nSo at t=24, y_24 must be 0 or 5+, but 5+ impossible, so must be 0.\n\nNo other way.\n\nTherefore, this should be minimal.\n\nSo the action sequence as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 22\\) is 11. This sequence avoids all collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a dangerous freeway at the critical turns when collisions occur.\n\n- At turn \\(T = 24\\) (i.e., \\(\\Delta T = T - t_1 = 2\\)), freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3, 4\\) are dangerous due to cars spanning \\(x=0\\). To avoid collision, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 24, as higher positions are unreachable by this turn.\n- At turns \\(T = 26\\) and \\(T = 27\\) (\\(\\Delta T = 4\\) and \\(5\\)), freeways \\(y = 5\\) and \\(6\\) are dangerous. The sequence ensures the player is below these freeways at these turns (\\(y = 2\\) at \\(T = 26\\) and \\(y = 3\\) at \\(T = 27\\)), avoiding collision.\n- Freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(8\\) are always safe, as no cars span \\(x=0\\) at any turn.\n\nThe sequence begins with two \"S\" (stay) actions at turns 22 and 23 to remain at \\(y = 0\\) and avoid the danger at turn 24. From turn 24 onwards, the player moves up (\"U\") every turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) in the minimal steps, with no collisions occurring.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n- Turn 22: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\))\n- Turn 23: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\))\n- Turn 24: U (move to \\(y = 1\\))\n- Turn 25: U (move to \\(y = 2\\))\n- Turn 26: U (move to \\(y = 3\\))\n- Turn 27: U (move to \\(y = 4\\))\n- Turn 28: U (move to \\(y = 5\\))\n- Turn 29: U (move to \\(y = 6\\))\n- Turn 30: U (move to \\(y = 7\\))\n- Turn 31: U (move to \\(y = 8\\))\n- Turn 32: U (move to \\(y = 9\\))\n\nAfter the action at turn 32, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 33.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 22: S \\\\\nTurn 23: S \\\\\nTurn 24: U \\\\\nTurn 25: U \\\\\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: U \\\\\nTurn 28: U \\\\\nTurn 29: U \\\\\nTurn 30: U \\\\\nTurn 31: U \\\\\nTurn 32: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 24, and the player is at (0,0). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe grid has freeways from y=1 to y=8. We start at y0 = 0 and want to get to y=9.\n\nPlayer movement:\n  U: y <- y+1 (unless already at 9)\n  D: y <- y-1 (unless already at 0)\n  S: stay at same y\n\nCollision condition: at turn T, if the player is at y_T (which is the row we are on at turn T) and if for any car on that freeway (row) the car's span at turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate where the player is), then collision.\n\nNote: when we move (U or D) at turn T, we are on the new row only at turn T+1. So at turn T, we are still on the old row. Therefore, when we take an action at turn T, we move to the new row at the next turn (T+1). This means:\n\n- At turn T, we are on row y_T.\n- We choose an action a_T (U, D, S) that will determine y_{T+1} = y_T + delta, but note that during the entire turn T we are at y_T.\n\nThus, the collision check at turn T is only for the row y_T and the car spans on that row at turn T.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1=24.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway (row) and for each car on that row, the span at any future turn T (>=24). Then, we plan a path of actions (U, D, S) that moves from y=0 to y=9 without ever being on a row (at a turn) that has a car whose span at that turn includes 0.\n\nImportant: We start at turn 24 at y=0. We are not on any freeway (since freeways are y=1..8) so at turn 24 we are safe. Then we take actions for turns 24, 25, ... until we get to y=9.\n\nGoal: minimal H (number of turns) and the sequence of actions.\n\nLet me write down the car information for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n  This car is right-moving. At turn 24, the head is at -48 and tail at -71? But note the representation: for right-moving, the head is the rightmost and tail the leftmost? Actually, the problem says:\n    Right-moving: [tau, h] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n  Here the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). So for right-moving, head should be greater than tail? But here head=-48, tail=-71, and -48 > -71? Yes. So:\n    At turn 24: [tau, h] = [-71, -48]? But the problem says: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h] for right-moving\" and then the update.\n\n  Actually, the input says: \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\".\n  And for right-moving: the car is moving right, so the head is the front (rightmost) and tail is the rear (leftmost). Therefore, at time t1=24, the car is from tau to h (with tau < h). So the span is [tau, h] = [-71, -48]? But note: the problem writes the span as [tau, h] for right-moving? But then the update: \n      Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n  So for freeway 1 at time T, the car is at:\n      left = -71 + 24*(T-24)\n      right = -48 + 24*(T-24)\n\n  We care when 0 is in [left, right]. But note: since the car is moving right, and starting at negative positions, it will eventually cross 0.\n\n  We can compute the times when the car covers 0:\n\n      -71 + 24*(T-24) <= 0 <= -48 + 24*(T-24)\n\n  Solve:\n      Lower bound: -71 + 24*(T-24) <= 0  => 24*(T-24) <= 71 => T-24 <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958 => T <= 26.958 -> T<=26 (if integer) -> T=24,25,26? But we start at T=24.\n\n      At T=24: left = -71, right = -48 -> 0 not in [-71,-48] (since both negative).\n\n      T=25: left = -71+24= -47, right=-48+24=-24 -> 0 not in [-47,-24] (negative)\n\n      T=26: left = -71+48= -23, right=-48+48=0 -> then 0 is included? [ -23, 0 ] -> yes, 0 is the right endpoint.\n\n      T=27: left = -71+72=1, right=-48+72=24 -> 0 not in [1,24]\n\n  So on freeway 1, the car is present at x=0 at T=26.\n\n  Therefore, at turn T=26, if the player is on freeway 1 (y=1), then collision.\n\nFreeway 2: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n  Similarly, at turn 24: [tau, h] = [-83, -48]\n  Update: left = -83 + 36*(T-24), right = -48 + 36*(T-24)\n\n  Check for 0 in [left, right]:\n      -83 + 36*(T-24) <= 0 <= -48 + 36*(T-24)\n\n  Solve left inequality: 36*(T-24) <= 83 -> T-24 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305 -> T<=26.305 -> T=24,25,26\n  Solve right inequality: 0 <= -48+36*(T-24) -> 48 <= 36*(T-24) -> T-24>=48/36≈1.333 -> T>=25.333 -> T>=26\n\n  So T=26: \n      left = -83 + 36*2 = -83+72=-11\n      right = -48+72=24\n      So 0 is in [-11,24] -> present at T=26.\n\n  T=25: left=-83+36= -47, right=-48+36=-12 -> 0 not in [-47,-12]\n  T=24: left=-83, right=-48 -> 0 not in between.\n\n  Therefore, freeway 2 has a car at 0 at T=26.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-48, -83, right, 36) -> same as freeway 2: so at T=26, car present.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 2 and 3? (-48, -83, right, 36) -> same, so T=26 present.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: \n  (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\n  We must check each car.\n\n  First car: (h=48, tau=37, right, s=6) -> at turn 24: [37,48]? \n      But wait: the representation is (head, tail) and for right-moving, head is the right end? So the car is from tail=37 to head=48. \n      Update: left = 37 + 6*(T-24), right=48+6*(T-24)\n\n      We want 0 in [37+6*(T-24), 48+6*(T-24)]? \n      Since 37 and 48 are positive and the car is moving right, the car is always at positive x. So 0 will never be in the span.\n\n  Second car: (12,1,right,6): \n      left = 1+6*(T-24), right=12+6*(T-24)\n      Both positive and increasing -> never covers 0.\n\n  Third car: (-24,-35,right,6): \n      left = -35+6*(T-24), right=-24+6*(T-24)\n      Check when 0 is in [left, right]:\n          -35+6*(T-24) <= 0 <= -24+6*(T-24)\n\n      Left: -35+6*(T-24)<=0 -> 6*(T-24)<=35 -> T-24<=35/6≈5.833 -> T<=29.833 -> T=24..29\n      Right: 0<=-24+6*(T-24) -> 24<=6*(T-24) -> T-24>=4 -> T>=28\n\n      So T=28,29.\n\n      At T=28: left=-35+6*4=-35+24=-11, right=-24+24=0 -> 0 is the right endpoint -> included.\n      At T=29: left=-35+30=-5, right=-24+30=6 -> 0 is in [-5,6] -> included.\n\n  Therefore, freeway 5 has a car at 0 at T=28 and T=29.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5? \n  (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6) -> same as freeway 5. So at T=28,29, freeway 6 is blocked.\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (48,37,right,12)\n  left=37+12*(T-24), right=48+12*(T-24) -> always positive -> never blocks 0.\n\nFreeway 8: (48,37,right,4)\n  left=37+4*(T-24), right=48+4*(T-24) -> always positive -> never blocks 0.\n\nSummary of dangerous positions (freeway, turn):\n\n- Freeway 1: turn 26\n- Freeway 2: turn 26\n- Freeway 3: turn 26\n- Freeway 4: turn 26\n- Freeway 5: turns 28,29\n- Freeway 6: turns 28,29\n\nNote: freeways 7 and 8 are always safe.\n\nWe start at turn 24 at y=0. We are safe at turn 24 because y=0 is not a freeway.\n\nWe want to get to y=9. The minimal number of moves? Without any obstacles, we could do 9 moves: U repeated 9 times. But we have to avoid the dangerous freeways at dangerous turns.\n\nThe path will be a sequence of moves (U, D, S) that change the y-coordinate. We can also stay or even move down to avoid being on a dangerous row at a dangerous turn.\n\nWe need to plan for turns 24,25,26,... until we reach y=9.\n\nLet me denote the state at turn t (>=24) as (t, y). We start at (24,0). We want to reach (t,9) for some t.\n\nConstraints: \n  - At each turn t, if y(t) is in [1,8] (i.e., a freeway), then we must not have a car on that freeway at turn t that covers 0.\n\nWe can move: U (y increases by 1, unless at 9), D (y decreases by 1, unless at 0), S (stay).\n\nWe are to minimize the number of turns H (so the total turns from turn24 to turn24+H-1, meaning we take H-1 actions? Actually, the sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, and we end at turn t1+H-1 at y=9.\n\nBut note: we start at turn24, so after 0 moves we are at (24,0). Then we take an action at turn24 to move to the next state at turn25. So the state at turn t is after the action of turn t-1? Actually, the state at turn t is the result of the action at turn t-1? \n\nBut the problem says: \n  Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, where Delta y_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose a_t, and then at turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, we start at turn24 at y24=0. Then we choose a24, which will determine y25.\n\nWe are to output the actions for turns t1, t1+1, ... until the last action that leads us to y=9.\n\nWe must avoid being on a dangerous (y,t) for y in [1,8] and t>=24.\n\nWe can model this as a graph. We have states (t, y) for t>=24 and y in [0,9]. The goal is to get to any t with y=9.\n\nThe edges: from (t,y) we can go to (t+1, y') where:\n  if a_t = U: y' = min(9, y+1)\n  if a_t = D: y' = max(0, y-1)\n  if a_t = S: y' = y\n\nBut we cannot go to (t+1, y') if at turn t+1, if y' is in [1,8] and the freeway y' is dangerous at turn t+1? \n\nWait: note the collision condition: at turn T, we are on row y_T. The collision occurs if at turn T, for the row y_T (if it is a freeway) and there is a car on that freeway at turn T that covers 0.\n\nTherefore, the state at turn T is (T, y_T). We must check: if y_T is in [1,8], then we must not have a car on freeway y_T at turn T that covers 0.\n\nBut note: at the start we are at turn24 at y=0 -> safe because y=0 is not a freeway.\n\nIn the next turn (turn25), we are at y25 -> if y25 is in [1,8], then we check the car on that freeway at turn25.\n\nSo when we are at state (t, y), we have already taken the action at turn t-1? Actually, we are at turn t and we are about to take action a_t? \n\nBut the problem says: we are given the state at turn t1 (24). Then we choose an action a_{t1} (for turn24). Then we move to turn25.\n\nTherefore, when we are at state (t, y), we are at the beginning of turn t, and we choose an action a_t. Then we move to state (t+1, y_{t+1}), and at turn t we are on row y_t (which is safe by the previous step? but we must check the current state? Actually, the problem says collision occurs at turn T if when we are at row y_T at turn T and if that row is a freeway and a car covers 0.\n\nSo when we are at (t, y) we must check: if y is in [1,8] then we must check that at turn t, the freeway y does not have a car covering 0. But note: we are already at that state? \n\nHowever, the problem states: we are given the current state at turn24: (0,0) and it is safe. Then we choose an action for turn24. The next state at turn25: we will be at y25, and then at turn25 we must be safe (if y25 is in [1,8] then check the cars at turn25).\n\nTherefore, the state (t,y) must be safe: meaning if y is in [1,8], then at turn t there is no car on freeway y that covers 0.\n\nSo we can only be in state (t,y) if it is safe (or if y=0 or y=9, which are safe by definition? note y=9 is the goal and not a freeway? but the problem says freeways are y=1..8. So y=0 and y=9 are safe because no cars there).\n\nBut note: the goal is to be at (t,9) for some t. Then we stop. So when we first reach (t,9) we are done.\n\nWe must avoid states (t,y) for y in [1,8] that are dangerous at turn t.\n\nNow, let's list the dangerous (t,y) pairs:\n\nWe have:\n\nFreeway 1: dangerous at t=26 -> so (26,1) is dangerous.\nFreeway 2: dangerous at t=26 -> (26,2) dangerous.\nFreeway 3: dangerous at t=26 -> (26,3) dangerous.\nFreeway 4: dangerous at t=26 -> (26,4) dangerous.\nFreeway 5: dangerous at t=28,29 -> so (28,5) and (29,5) dangerous.\nFreeway 6: dangerous at t=28,29 -> (28,6) and (29,6) dangerous.\n\nAll other (t,y) for y in [1,8] are safe? \n\nBut note: freeway 1: we only computed t=26. What about other turns? \n  For freeway1: the car is only at x=0 at t=26? \n      t=25: we computed [-47,-24] -> safe.\n      t=27: [1,24] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2,3,4: only t=26 is dangerous.\n\nFreeway5,6: only t=28,29.\n\nFreeway7 and 8: always safe.\n\nSo the dangerous states are:\n  (26,1), (26,2), (26,3), (26,4)\n  (28,5), (29,5), (28,6), (29,6)\n\nWe want to go from (24,0) to (t,9) for the smallest possible t (minimal H, meaning minimal number of turns, so minimal t-24+1? Actually, H is the number of turns in the sequence, which is the number of actions. Since we take one action per turn, and we start at turn24, after k actions we are at turn24+k. We require that at turn24+k we are at y=9.\n\nSo we want to minimize k such that we can be at (24+k, 9).\n\nThe minimal k without obstacles: k=9 (because we need to go from 0 to 9: 9 moves up). Then we would be at turn24+9 = 33? But note: at turn24 we are at y0=0. Then:\n  turn24: action U -> turn25: y=1\n  turn25: U -> turn26: y=2\n  turn26: U -> turn27: y=3\n  turn27: U -> turn28: y=4\n  turn28: U -> turn29: y=5\n  turn29: U -> turn30: y=6\n  turn30: U -> turn31: y=7\n  turn31: U -> turn32: y=8\n  turn32: U -> turn33: y=9\n\nBut check the dangerous states: \n  At turn26: we are at y=2 -> which is dangerous (freeway2 at turn26) -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot take the direct path.\n\nWe need to avoid being at y=2 at turn26. We could:\n  - Delay the move at some turns (by staying) so that we are not at y=2 at turn26.\n  - Or move down temporarily? but that might cost more turns.\n\nWe are to minimize the total turns. So we want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nWe can try to skip the dangerous row at the dangerous turn by waiting or by going faster/slower.\n\nSince the dangerous events are at turn26 (for y=1,2,3,4) and at turn28,29 (for y=5,6), we might want to be above y=4 by turn26? or below? \n\nAlternatively, we can slow down so that we are still at y=0 at turn26? but then we have to make up the moves.\n\nLet me try to plan:\n\nWe start at (24,0). We must avoid (26,1), (26,2), (26,3), (26,4). \n\nOne idea: stay at y=0 until the dangerous turn26 has passed? Then we start moving up.\n\nBut if we stay at y=0 for 2 turns (turn24: S, turn25: S) then at turn26 we are still at y=0. Then we start moving up at turn26: \n  turn26: U -> turn27: y=1\n  turn27: U -> turn28: y=2\n  turn28: U -> turn29: y=3\n  turn29: U -> turn30: y=4\n  turn30: U -> turn31: y=5 -> but at turn31: freeway5 is dangerous only at 28,29? so turn31 is safe for y=5? \n  However, we also have to avoid (28,5) and (29,5): so at turn28 we are at y=2 (safe) and turn29 we are at y=3 (safe). Then turn30: y=4 (freeway4: safe because dangerous only at turn26). Then turn31: y=5 -> freeway5: but dangerous at 28,29 -> turn31 is safe. Then we continue:\n  turn31: U -> turn32: y=6 -> freeway6: dangerous at 28,29 -> safe at turn32.\n  turn32: U -> turn33: y=7\n  turn33: U -> turn34: y=8\n  turn34: U -> turn35: y=9.\n\nTotal turns: from turn24 to turn34: 11 actions? Actually, we have:\n\n  Turn24: S\n  Turn25: S\n  Turn26: U\n  Turn27: U\n  Turn28: U\n  Turn29: U\n  Turn30: U\n  Turn31: U\n  Turn32: U\n  Turn33: U\n  Turn34: U -> then at turn35 we are at y=9? \n\nBut we are at y=9 at turn35. So the last action is at turn34. The sequence of actions is for turns 24 to 34 (11 actions) and we end at turn34+1? No: \n\nActually, the state after each action:\n\n  Start: turn24, y=0 -> safe (not freeway)\n  Action24: S -> turn25: y=0\n  Action25: S -> turn26: y=0\n  Action26: U -> turn27: y=1 -> freeway1: at turn27, is freeway1 dangerous? Only at turn26 -> safe.\n  Action27: U -> turn28: y=2 -> freeway2: dangerous at turn26 -> safe at turn28.\n  Action28: U -> turn29: y=3 -> freeway3: dangerous at turn26 -> safe at turn29.\n  Action29: U -> turn30: y=4 -> freeway4: dangerous at turn26 -> safe at turn30.\n  Action30: U -> turn31: y=5 -> freeway5: dangerous at turn28,29 -> safe at turn31.\n  Action31: U -> turn32: y=6 -> freeway6: dangerous at turn28,29 -> safe at turn32.\n  Action32: U -> turn33: y=7 -> safe (freeway7: always safe)\n  Action33: U -> turn34: y=8 -> freeway8: always safe\n  Action34: U -> turn35: y=9 -> goal.\n\nBut we reached y=9 at turn35. So the sequence has 11 actions (turns24 to34) and H=11? But the problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. So H=11.\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nAlternative: instead of waiting two turns, we might wait only one turn? \n\nTry: \n  Turn24: S -> turn25: y=0\n  Turn25: U -> turn26: y=1 -> but at turn26, freeway1 is dangerous! -> collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nTurn24: U -> turn25: y=1 (freeway1: at turn25, freeway1: we computed: [-47,-24] -> safe? because 0 is not in [-47,-24]? indeed, so safe)\n  Then turn25: we are at y=1. Then at turn25 we can choose an action.\n\nNow, at turn26 we must avoid being at y=1,2,3,4.\n\nSo at turn25: if we move U -> then turn26: y=2 -> dangerous (freeway2 at turn26: collision).\n\nIf we move S at turn25: then turn26: y=1 -> dangerous (freeway1 at turn26: collision).\n\nIf we move D at turn25: then turn26: y=0 -> safe (not freeway).\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  Turn24: U -> turn25: y=1 (safe at turn25)\n  Turn25: D -> turn26: y=0 (safe at turn26: not freeway)\n\nBut then we are back at y=0 at turn26. Then we have to go up again. How many turns? \n\nAfter turn26, we are at y=0. Then we can go up:\n\n  Turn26: U -> turn27: y=1 (freeway1: at turn27: safe? freeway1 at turn27: we computed: [ -23+24? wait no, for freeway1: \n      At turn27: left = -71+24*(27-24)= -71+24*3=-71+72=1, right=-48+72=24 -> so 0 not in [1,24] -> safe)\n  Then we can continue U.\n\nBut now we have to avoid the later dangers at turn28,29 for y=5,6.\n\nWe are at turn27: y=1.\n\nThen we can go up:\n\n  Turn27: U -> turn28: y=2 -> safe (freeway2 at turn28: we computed for freeway2: at turn28: left = -83+36*(4)= -83+144=61, right=-48+144=96 -> safe because positive and 0 not in [61,96])\n  Turn28: U -> turn29: y=3 -> safe (freeway3: similarly at turn29: left = -83+36*5 = -83+180=97 -> safe? Actually, we don't have the exact computation for freeway3 at turn29? But from the update: it's moving right and at turn26 it was at [-11,24] and then at turn29: left = -83+36*(29-24)= -83+36*5= -83+180=97, so [97, 132] -> safe.\n\n  Turn29: U -> turn30: y=4 -> safe (freeway4: similarly, at turn30: left=-83+36*6=-83+216=133 -> safe)\n\n  Turn30: U -> turn31: y=5 -> freeway5: dangerous at turn28,29 -> safe at turn31.\n  Turn31: U -> turn32: y=6 -> freeway6: safe at turn32.\n  Turn32: U -> turn33: y=7\n  Turn33: U -> turn34: y=8\n  Turn34: U -> turn35: y=9\n\nTotal actions: from turn24 to turn34: 11 actions? \n\nSequence:\n  Turn24: U\n  Turn25: D\n  Turn26: U\n  Turn27: U\n  Turn28: U\n  Turn29: U\n  Turn30: U\n  Turn31: U\n  Turn32: U\n  Turn33: U\n  Turn34: U\n\nBut we end at turn35: y=9. So H=11.\n\nSame as the previous plan.\n\nBut we might do better. How about going up as fast as possible and then wait above the dangerous rows? \n\nWe want to be above y=4 by turn26. \n\nAt turn24: start at y=0.\nTurn24: U -> turn25: y=1\nTurn25: U -> turn26: we want to be at least y=5? but we can only move one step per turn. So at turn26 we can be at y=2? which is dangerous. \n\nBut if we do two moves up by turn25: y=2? \n\nTurn24: U -> turn25: y=1 (safe at turn25: freeway1 at turn25: [-47,-24] -> safe)\nTurn25: U -> turn26: y=2 -> but freeway2 at turn26: dangerous -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=2 at turn26.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to be at y=5 at turn26? but that requires 5 moves in 2 turns? impossible.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeways 1-4 at turn26. Therefore, at turn26 we must be either at y=0 or y>=5? But y>=5: we start at y0=0, and in two moves we can only get to y=2. So we cannot be at y>=5 at turn26.\n\nTherefore, the only safe option at turn26 is to be at y=0.\n\nWhich means we must go down to y=0 at turn26. \n\nWe can do:\n\nOption1: \n  Turn24: S -> stay at y=0 at turn25\n  Turn25: S -> stay at y=0 at turn26\n\nOption2:\n  Turn24: U -> y=1 at turn25 (safe) \n  Turn25: D -> y=0 at turn26\n\nBoth lead to being at y=0 at turn26. \n\nThen we have to go up from y=0 at turn26 to y=9. That takes at least 9 moves. So total turns: from turn24 to turn26 we used 2 turns, then 9 moves: total 11 actions? and we end at turn24+11-1 = turn34? Actually:\n\nIn option1:\n  Turn24: S -> turn25:0\n  Turn25: S -> turn26:0\n  Then from turn26 to turn34: 8 turns? because from turn26 to turn34 is 8 turns? and we need to go from 0 to 9: 9 moves? so we end at turn35? \n\nBut we take one action per turn. We are at turn26: then we take an action at turn26, then turn27, ... until turn26+8 = turn34: that's 9 actions? Then we end at turn35: y=9. So total actions: 2 (for the first two) + 9 = 11.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut wait: we might be able to go faster by not waiting the entire time? \n\nWe have another danger at turn28,29 for y=5,6. \n\nIn the path from y=0 at turn26 to y=9, we will be at:\n  turn27: y=1\n  turn28: y=2\n  turn29: y=3\n  turn30: y=4\n  turn31: y=5 -> safe (freeway5 dangerous only at 28,29)\n  turn32: y=6 -> safe\n  turn33: y=7\n  turn34: y=8\n  turn35: y=9\n\nSo no problem with the later dangers.\n\nBut can we get to y=9 earlier than turn35? \n\nWe are starting at turn26 at y=0. The minimal time to go from 0 to 9 is 9 moves -> 9 actions, so we end at turn26+9 = turn35.\n\nSo the total number of turns from start is 35-24+1? Actually, we are counting the actions: we take 11 actions: at turns24,25,...,34 -> 11 actions, and we end at turn35.\n\nIs there a way to do 10 actions? Then we would end at turn34. But if we start at turn24, then 10 actions: turns24 to33, and then at turn34 we would be at y=9? \n\nBut to get from 0 to 9 in 10 moves? We must make 9 moves up and 1 move that is not up? But that would not get us to 9. Actually, we must make at least 9 moves up. So the minimal number of moves is 9. But we have to spend 2 moves at the beginning to avoid the danger at turn26. So total moves: 11.\n\nBut wait, we might avoid the danger at turn26 without spending two moves? \n\nWe have two options: either two stays (S,S) or (U,D). Both use two moves. \n\nIs there a way to use only one move? \n\nSuppose we do:\n  Turn24: U -> turn25: y=1 (safe at turn25)\n  Then we cannot avoid turn26 without a move. If we do nothing at turn25: S -> then turn26: y=1 (dangerous). If we do U -> turn26: y=2 (dangerous). If we do D -> then turn26: y=0 (safe). So we must do D at turn25. So we use two moves: U and D.\n\nSimilarly, if we do nothing at turn24: S -> turn25: y=0. Then at turn25: if we do nothing: turn26: y=0 (safe). But then we have to start moving. So again two moves.\n\nTherefore, we must spend at least two moves to avoid the danger at turn26.\n\nThen the minimal number of moves is 9 (to go up) + 2 (to avoid the danger) = 11.\n\nBut note: we are at y=0 at turn26. Then we start moving up. We have to avoid the dangers at turn28,29 for y=5,6? But in the natural progression we are at y=2 at turn28 and y=3 at turn29 -> which are safe. Then we continue.\n\nBut what if we try to go faster? \n\nFrom y=0 at turn26: \n  We can do: \n      turn26: U -> turn27: y=1\n      turn27: U -> turn28: y=2\n      turn28: U -> turn29: y=3\n      turn29: U -> turn30: y=4\n      turn30: U -> turn31: y=5\n      turn31: U -> turn32: y=6\n      turn32: U -> turn33: y=7\n      turn33: U -> turn34: y=8\n      turn34: U -> turn35: y=9\n\nBut we can try to do double moves? We cannot: we can only move one step at a time.\n\nAlternatively, we might wait at a safe row to avoid the later dangers? but the later dangers are at y=5,6 at turn28,29. And we are at y=2 at turn28 and y=3 at turn29 -> safe. So no need.\n\nBut what if we move faster? We can't.\n\nSo 11 moves is minimal.\n\nBut let me check if we can do 10 moves? \n\nWe need to be at y=9 by turn24+10-1 = turn33? \n\nSo we need to be at y=9 at turn33.\n\nThat means we must get from y=0 at turn24 to y=9 at turn33: 9 moves in 9 turns? So we must move U every turn. Then:\n\n  Turn24: U -> turn25:1\n  Turn25: U -> turn26:2 -> but at turn26: y=2 -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot do that.\n\nAlternatively, we skip the collision by moving down at turn25: but then we are at y=0 at turn26, and then we need 9 moves to get to 9: so from turn26 to turn34: 9 moves? then we are at turn34: y=9? but we need to be at turn33: y=9? \n\nIf we do:\n\n  Turn24: U -> turn25:1\n  Turn25: D -> turn26:0\n  Then from turn26 to turn33: 8 moves: we can only get to y=8 at turn33? \n      turn26: U ->1\n      turn27: U->2\n      turn28: U->3\n      turn29: U->4\n      turn30: U->5\n      turn31: U->6\n      turn32: U->7\n      turn33: U->8 -> then at turn33 we are at y=8, not 9.\n\nSo we need one more move to get to 9: turn34: U ->9. So total 11 moves.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=11.\n\nNow, we have two plans:\n\nPlan A (waiting at 0):\n  Turn24: S\n  Turn25: S\n  Turn26: U\n  Turn27: U\n  Turn28: U\n  Turn29: U\n  Turn30: U\n  Turn31: U\n  Turn32: U\n  Turn33: U\n  Turn34: U\n\nPlan B (up then down):\n  Turn24: U\n  Turn25: D\n  Turn26: U\n  Turn27: U\n  Turn28: U\n  Turn29: U\n  Turn30: U\n  Turn31: U\n  Turn32: U\n  Turn33: U\n  Turn34: U\n\nBut note: in Plan B, at turn25 we go to y=1 (safe) and then at turn25 we go down to y=0 at turn26 (safe). Then the rest is the same.\n\nWhich one to choose? Both are minimal. But the problem does not specify a tie-breaker. We can choose either.\n\nHowever, let me verify Plan B in detail:\n\nTurn24: a24 = U -> then at turn25: y=1 -> freeway1: we check at turn25: the car on freeway1 at turn25: \n      left = -71 + 24*(25-24) = -71+24 = -47\n      right = -48+24 = -24\n      0 is not in [-47,-24] -> safe.\n\nTurn25: a25 = D -> then at turn26: y=0 -> safe (not freeway)\n\nTurn26: a26 = U -> then at turn27: y=1 -> freeway1 at turn27: \n      left = -71+24*(27-24)= -71+72=1\n      right = -48+72=24\n      0 not in [1,24] -> safe.\n\nTurn27: U -> turn28: y=2 -> freeway2 at turn28: \n      left = -83+36*(28-24)= -83+144=61\n      right = -48+144=96\n      safe.\n\nTurn28: U -> turn29: y=3 -> freeway3 at turn29:\n      left = -83+36*(29-24)= -83+180=97\n      right = -48+180=132\n      safe.\n\nTurn29: U -> turn30: y=4 -> freeway4 at turn30:\n      left = -83+36*(30-24)= -83+216=133\n      right = -48+216=168\n      safe.\n\nTurn30: U -> turn31: y=5 -> freeway5 at turn31: \n      The car that was dangerous at turn28,29: \n          third car: (-24,-35,right,6): at turn31: \n             left = -35+6*(31-24)= -35+42=7\n             right = -24+42=18\n          so 0 not in [7,18] -> safe.\n      The other cars are at positive and increasing -> safe.\n\nTurn31: U -> turn32: y=6 -> freeway6 at turn32: \n      Similarly, the dangerous car: left=-35+6*(32-24)= -35+48=13, right=-24+48=24 -> safe.\n\nTurn32: U -> turn33: y=7 -> freeway7: safe (always)\nTurn33: U -> turn34: y=8 -> freeway8: safe\nTurn34: U -> turn35: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo Plan B works.\n\nSimilarly, Plan A also works.\n\nBut note: in Plan A, we do two S at the beginning. Then at turn26 we start going up. Then:\n\nTurn26: U -> turn27: y=1 (safe as above)\nTurn27: U -> turn28: y=2 (safe as above)\n... same as Plan B from turn27 onward.\n\nBut we have one extra move? Actually, in Plan A we have:\n\n  Turn24: S -> turn25:0\n  Turn25: S -> turn26:0\n  Turn26: U -> turn27:1\n  ...\n  Turn34: U -> turn35:9\n\nSo same 11 moves.\n\nWe can output either. I'll choose Plan B because it starts with an up move which might be more natural.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and both are 11. So either is acceptable.\n\nHowever, let me see if we can avoid the later dangers by going faster? But we are already going as fast as possible after turn26.\n\nAlternatively, we might try to be at y=5 at turn27? That would require 5 moves from turn24 to turn27: 3 actions? impossible because we have to avoid turn26.\n\nBut we have to spend two moves to avoid turn26. Then we have 9 moves to go up.\n\nSo I think 11 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence for Plan B:\n\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: D\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\n\nBut note: the problem says the current turn is t1=24, and we output actions for turns: t1, t1+1, ... until the last one.\n\nSo we output 11 actions.\n\nBut wait: the last action (turn34) leads to y=9 at turn35. So we have reached the goal at turn35, and we stop. The sequence is from turn24 to turn34.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: D\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\n}\n\nBut let me double-check the turn numbering and the y progression:\n\nTurn24: start at (24,0) -> safe (not freeway)\n  a24 = U -> then at turn25: y = 0+1 = 1\n\nTurn25: at (25,1) -> safe (freeway1: [-47,-24] -> safe)\n  a25 = D -> then at turn26: y=1-1=0\n\nTurn26: at (26,0) -> safe (not freeway)\n  a26 = U -> turn27: y=1\n\nTurn27: at (27,1) -> freeway1: [1,24] -> safe (0 not in [1,24])\n  a27 = U -> turn28: y=2\n\nTurn28: at (28,2) -> freeway2: [61,96] -> safe\n  a28 = U -> turn29: y=3\n\nTurn29: at (29,3) -> freeway3: [97,132] -> safe\n  a29 = U -> turn30: y=4\n\nTurn30: at (30,4) -> freeway4: [133,168] -> safe\n  a30 = U -> turn31: y=5\n\nTurn31: at (31,5) -> freeway5: check the cars:\n  car1: (48,37,right,6) -> [37+6*(31-24)=37+42=79, 48+42=90] -> safe\n  car2: (12,1,right,6) -> [1+42=43, 12+42=54] -> safe\n  car3: (-24,-35,right,6) -> [-35+42=7, -24+42=18] -> 0 not in [7,18] -> safe\n  so safe.\n\nTurn32: a31=U -> turn32: y=6\n  at (32,6): freeway6: similarly, the dangerous car: [-35+6*(32-24)= -35+48=13, -24+48=24] -> 0 not in [13,24] -> safe.\n\nTurn33: a32=U -> turn33: y=7 -> freeway7: safe (car at [37+12*(33-24)=37+108=145, 48+108=156] -> safe)\n\nTurn34: a33=U -> turn34: y=8 -> freeway8: [37+4*(34-24)=37+40=77, 48+40=88] -> safe.\n\nThen a34=U -> turn35: y=9 -> goal.\n\nPerfect.\n\nBut note: at turn34 we output the last action. Then we have reached y=9 at turn35.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the sequence above.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning for t=0 to H-1, so H=11.\n\nSo we output 11 actions.\n\nI think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 24\\) is 11, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe dangerous states (collisions) are:\n- Freeway 1 at turn 26: car spans \\([-23, 0]\\) (covers \\(x=0\\)).\n- Freeway 2 at turn 26: car spans \\([-11, 24]\\) (covers \\(x=0\\)).\n- Freeway 3 at turn 26: car spans \\([-11, 24]\\) (covers \\(x=0\\)).\n- Freeway 4 at turn 26: car spans \\([-11, 24]\\) (covers \\(x=0\\)).\n- Freeway 5 at turns 28 and 29: one car spans \\([-11, 0]\\) at turn 28 and \\([-5, 6]\\) at turn 29 (covers \\(x=0\\)).\n- Freeway 6 at turns 28 and 29: one car spans \\([-11, 0]\\) at turn 28 and \\([-5, 6]\\) at turn 29 (covers \\(x=0\\)).\n\nThe sequence of actions avoids these states:\n- At turn 24, moving up to \\(y=1\\) is safe (freeway 1 car at turn 24 spans \\([-71, -48]\\), not covering \\(x=0\\)).\n- At turn 25, moving down to \\(y=0\\) avoids being on freeways 1-4 at turn 26 (dangerous).\n- From turn 26 onward, moving up consecutively reaches \\(y=9\\) by turn 35:\n  - At turn 27, \\(y=1\\) is safe (freeway 1 car spans \\([1, 24]\\), not covering \\(x=0\\)).\n  - At turn 28, \\(y=2\\) is safe (freeway 2 car spans \\([61, 96]\\), not covering \\(x=0\\)).\n  - At turn 29, \\(y=3\\) is safe (freeway 3 car spans \\([97, 132]\\), not covering \\(x=0\\)).\n  - At turn 30, \\(y=4\\) is safe (freeway 4 car spans \\([133, 168]\\), not covering \\(x=0\\)).\n  - At turn 31, \\(y=5\\) is safe (freeway 5 cars: \\([79, 90]\\), \\([43, 54]\\), \\([7, 18]\\), none cover \\(x=0\\)).\n  - At turn 32, \\(y=6\\) is safe (freeway 6 cars: \\([79, 90]\\), \\([43, 54]\\), \\([13, 24]\\), none cover \\(x=0\\)).\n  - At turn 33, \\(y=7\\) is safe (freeway 7 car spans \\([145, 156]\\), not covering \\(x=0\\)).\n  - At turn 34, \\(y=8\\) is safe (freeway 8 car spans \\([77, 88]\\), not covering \\(x=0\\)).\n- After the action at turn 34, the player reaches \\(y=9\\) at turn 35.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in minimal turns (\\(H = 11\\)).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 24: U \\\\\nTurn 25: D \\\\\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: U \\\\\nTurn 28: U \\\\\nTurn 29: U \\\\\nTurn 30: U \\\\\nTurn 31: U \\\\\nTurn 32: U \\\\\nTurn 33: U \\\\\nTurn 34: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,0) at turn t1=26 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y_T and at that turn, for a car on that freeway, 0 is within the car's span. The span moves based on the car's direction and speed.\n\nThe note says that if you move to a different y at turn T, you're not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, you're on y_T, and if you move, at turn T+1 you're on y_{T+1}, but during turn T, you're only on y_T for collision purposes.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states at turn t1=26.\n\nFor each freeway k from 1 to 8, there are cars with head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nI need to find for each turn after t1, where the cars are and if they would cause a collision if the player is on that row.\n\nSince the player starts at y=0, and needs to go to y=9, they probably need to move up through each row.\n\nBut there might be times when it's safe to stay or even move down to avoid collisions.\n\nThe goal is to minimize H, the number of turns, so I should try to move up as much as possible, but only when it's safe.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements.\n\nThe car span at time T > t1 is given by:\n\nFor left-moving: span(T) = [h - s(T - t1), τ - s(T - t1)]? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut for left-moving, if it's moving left, the head should decrease, so if h is the head, for left-moving, decreasing x, so head at smaller x.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nThe notation is a bit messy. Let me interpret.\n\nFor a car, at time t1, we have head h and tail τ.\n\nFor direction:\n\n- If direction is left, then span is [h, τ] with h and τ such that it moves left, so h decreases.\n\nIn the left-moving case: Span(t1) = [h, τ], and since it moves left, Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], where ΔT = T - t1.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h], which might mean τ is the left end, h is the right end, since it moves right, so [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (0, -23, right, 24)\n\nDirection right, so Span(t1) should be [τ, h] = [-23, 0] I think, but it says (head, tail), so for right-moving, head might be the front.\n\nLet's clarify the notation.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nThen for update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the right-moving case, Span(t1) is given as [τ, h], so τ is the tail (left end), h is the head (right end).\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h head, τ tail.\n\nIn freeway 1: (0, -23, right, 24), so since direction right, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-23, 0]\n\nAt time T, Span(T) = [ -23 + 24*(T-26), 0 + 24*(T-26) ] = [ -23 + 24ΔT, 24ΔT ] where ΔT = T - t1 = T - 26.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T at that turn, and 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway.\n\n0 is the x-position where the player is, since player is at (0, y), so we care about x=0.\n\nFor each freeway and each turn, I need to check if at that turn, for that freeway, there is a car whose span contains 0.\n\nIf the player is on that freeway at that turn, collision happens.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nThe player can be on y from 0 to 9, but freeways are y=1 to 8, I think y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is the starting point, no cars mentioned, similarly y=9 is the target, probably no cars.\n\nThe freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe rows.\n\nCollision only on y=1 to 8.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at turn t1=26.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1.\n\nMinimum H: since from 0 to 9, at least 9 moves up, but we might need to wait or move down to avoid, so H could be more than 9.\n\nBut we should aim for as few turns as possible.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway k=1 to 8, the cars and their spans over time.\n\nSet t1=26, so ΔT = T - 26.\n\nFor each k, and for each car on k, the span as a function of T.\n\nThen for each T, for each k, if there is a car with 0 in span, then that row k is dangerous at turn T.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nThen, for the player, at each turn, depending on position, we can choose action to go up, down, or stay.\n\nBut we need to plan a sequence from turn 26 onwards.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each freeway the times when it is dangerous, i.e., when some car has 0 in its span.\n\nStart with freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (head h=0, tail τ=-23, direction right, speed s=24)\n\nSince direction right, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-23, 0]\n\nAt time T, Span(T) = [ -23 + 24*(T-26), 0 + 24*(T-26) ] = [ -23 + 24ΔT, 24ΔT ] where ΔT = T-26\n\n0 is in span if -23 + 24ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 24ΔT\n\nSince the span is [left, right], so 0 >= left and 0 <= right.\n\nSo -23 + 24ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 24ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -23 + 24ΔT ≤ 0 => 24ΔT ≤ 23 => ΔT ≤ 23/24\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ 24ΔT => ΔT ≥ 0\n\nSince ΔT = T-26, T integer, ΔT integer? Turns are discrete, I assume T integer.\n\nIn the game, turns are discrete, so T integer, ΔT integer from 0 up.\n\nSo ΔT ≥ 0 and ΔT ≤ floor(23/24) = 0 since 23/24 <1.\n\nΔT ≤ 23/24, and ΔT integer, so ΔT <= 0\n\nAnd ΔT >=0\n\nSo only ΔT=0\n\nThat is T=26\n\nAt T=26, ΔT=0, Span = [-23,0], so 0 is in [-23,0], yes, since 0 is the right endpoint.\n\nNow, for T>26, ΔT>=1, Span = [-23 +24ΔT, 24ΔT]\n\nFor ΔT=1, [-23+24, 24] = [1,24], 0 not in [1,24]\n\nFor ΔT>1, left is larger, so 0 not in span.\n\nSo freeway 1 is dangerous only at T=26.\n\nBut at T=26, player is at y=0, not on freeway 1, so no collision for player on freeway 1.\n\nPlayer is on freeway only if y between 1 and 8.\n\nAt T=26, player is at y=0, so not on any freeway, so no collision possible at T=26.\n\nFor freeway 1, only dangerous at T=26, but since player not there, irrelevant.\n\nNow freeway 2: (24, -11, right, 36)\n\nDirection right, so Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-11, 24]\n\nAt T, Span(T) = [ -11 + 36ΔT, 24 + 36ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 36ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 24 + 36ΔT\n\nFirst: -11 + 36ΔT ≤ 0 => 36ΔT ≤ 11 => ΔT ≤ 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so ΔT=0 since integer\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 24 + 36ΔT, always true for ΔT>=0\n\nBut ΔT=0: Span = [-11,24], 0 in [-11,24]? -11 <=0<=24, yes.\n\nFor ΔT=1: [ -11+36, 24+36] = [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for higher, worse.\n\nSo only at T=26, dangerous, but player not on freeway 2 at T=26.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2, (24, -11, right, 36), so identical to freeway 2, dangerous only at T=26.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (24, -11, right, 36), same as above.\n\nNow freeway 5: multiple cars: (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nThree cars, all right-moving.\n\nFor each, direction right, so Span(t1) = [τ, h]\n\nFirst car: (h=60, τ=49? Head and tail, but for right, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [49,60]? But τ should be tail, which is left end.\n\nIn the tuple it's (head, tail), so for right-moving, head is right end, tail is left end.\n\nSo first car: tail τ=49, head h=60? But it says (60,49,right,6), so head=60, tail=49? But if moving right, tail should be left, head right, so if head=60, tail=49, then since 49<60, span is [49,60].\n\nSimilarly, second car: (24,13,right,6), head=24, tail=13, span [13,24]\n\nThird car: (-12,-23,right,6), head=-12, tail=-23, span [-23,-12]? -23 < -12, so [-23,-12]\n\nNow at time T, for each car, Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] with s=6\n\nFirst car: [49 + 6ΔT, 60 + 6ΔT]\n\nSecond: [13 + 6ΔT, 24 + 6ΔT]\n\nThird: [-23 + 6ΔT, -12 + 6ΔT]\n\n0 in span for a car if left <=0<=right.\n\nFor freeway 5, dangerous if 0 in any of these spans.\n\nFirst car: 49 + 6ΔT <= 0 <= 60 + 6ΔT\n\n49 + 6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <= -49, impossible since ΔT>=0, left side >=49>0, so never <=0. Thus 0 cannot be <= left, so not in span.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 60+6ΔT always true, but since left >0, 0 not in [left,right].\n\nSecond car: [13 +6ΔT, 24+6ΔT], left >=13>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nThird car: [-23 +6ΔT, -12 +6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -23 +6ΔT <=0 <= -12 +6ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -23 +6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=23 => ΔT <= 23/6 ≈ 3.833, so ΔT <=3\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -12 +6ΔT => 12 <=6ΔT => ΔT >=2\n\nSo ΔT >=2 and ΔT <=3\n\nThus for ΔT=2,3\n\nΔT=2: T=26+2=28\n\nΔT=3: T=29\n\nNow for ΔT=2: span = [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0]? -23+12=-11, -12+12=0, so [-11,0], 0 is included.\n\nFor ΔT=3: [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6], 0 in [-5,6].\n\nNow, for other cars on freeway 5, no, so freeway 5 dangerous when third car has 0 in span, at T=28 and T=29.\n\nT=28: ΔT=2, T=28\n\nT=29: ΔT=3\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5, cars (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6), identical, so dangerous at T=28 and T=29.\n\nNow freeway 7: (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nDirection right, so Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt T, Span(T) = [ -59 + 12ΔT, -48 + 12ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -59 +12ΔT <=0 <= -48 +12ΔT\n\nFirst: -59 +12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=59 => ΔT <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so ΔT <=4\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +12ΔT => 48 <=12ΔT => ΔT >=4\n\nSo ΔT >=4 and ΔT <=4, so only ΔT=4\n\nT=26+4=30\n\nAt T=30, span = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0], 0 included.\n\nNow freeway 8: (56,45,right,4)\n\nDirection right, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [45,56]\n\nAt T, Span(T) = [45 + 4ΔT, 56 + 4ΔT]\n\n0 in span? Left =45+4ΔT >=45>0, so 0 not in span, always safe.\n\nSummary of dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: dangerous only at T=26 (but player not there)\n\n- Freeway 2: dangerous only at T=26\n\n- Freeway 3: dangerous only at T=26\n\n- Freeway 4: dangerous only at T=26\n\n- Freeway 5: dangerous at T=28 and T=29\n\n- Freeway 6: dangerous at T=28 and T=29\n\n- Freeway 7: dangerous at T=30\n\n- Freeway 8: always safe\n\nNow, for the player, we start at turn t1=26, y=0.\n\nAt each turn, we choose action U, D, or S, changing y accordingly.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince we want min turns, we should move up when possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on a dangerous freeway at dangerous times.\n\nThat is, for each row y, if we are on row y at turn T, and y is dangerous at T, collision.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are always safe, no cars.\n\nNow, let's list for each row y=1 to 8, when it is dangerous.\n\nFrom above:\n\ny=1: dangerous only at T=26\n\ny=2: dangerous only at T=26\n\ny=3: dangerous only at T=26\n\ny=4: dangerous only at T=26\n\ny=5: dangerous at T=28 and T=29\n\ny=6: dangerous at T=28 and T=29\n\ny=7: dangerous at T=30\n\ny=8: never dangerous\n\nSince T=26 is past, and we start at T=26, y=0.\n\nAt T=26, we are at y=0, safe.\n\nNow, actions from T=26 onwards.\n\nWe need to consider turns starting from T=26.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position y_T, we choose action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy based on action.\n\nCollision at turn T depends on y_T and the state at T.\n\nIf we are on y_T between 1 and 8, and y_T is dangerous at T, then collision.\n\nOtherwise, no.\n\nNow, let's find a path with minimal steps.\n\nStart at T=26, y=0.\n\nWe can choose to go up or stay. Staying at y=0 doesn't help, since we need to go to y=9, so probably go up to y=1 at some point.\n\nSimilarly, moving down might be needed to avoid, but let's see.\n\nFirst, since rows 1-4 are dangerous only at T=26, which is now past, so for T>26, rows 1-4 are safe, because no dangerous times after T=26.\n\ny=1 dangerous only at T=26, so for T=27,28,... it is safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=2,3,4.\n\ny=5 dangerous at T=28 and 29, so at T=28 and 29, if on y=5, collision.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 dangerous at T=28 and 29.\n\ny=7 dangerous at T=30.\n\ny=8 always safe.\n\ny=9 always safe.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nMinimum steps: 9 moves up, but we might need to wait or detour.\n\nSince rows 1-4 are safe for all T>26, we can move up through them quickly.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 is always safe.\n\ny=5 and y=6 are dangerous at T=28 and 29, so we should avoid being on y=5 or y=6 at turns 28 and 29.\n\ny=7 is dangerous only at T=30, so avoid on y=7 at T=30.\n\nNow, let's plan the sequence.\n\nStart at T=26, y=0.\n\nWe need to choose action at T=26.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf we do U, we go to y=1 at T=27? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T, after action, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt the beginning of turn T, player is at position y_T.\n\nThen we choose action a_T.\n\nThen y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy based on a_T.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T based on y_T and the cars at T.\n\nIn this case, at T=26, y_26 = 0, which is safe.\n\nNow, we choose a_26.\n\nIf we choose S, then y_27 = 0, still at y=0.\n\nIf U, y_27 = 1.\n\nIf D, y_27 = -1? But y must be in [0,9], so if y_t=0, D would make y_{t+1} = -1, but not allowed, so probably cannot go below 0. Similarly, above 9.\n\nIn the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if at boundary, cannot move beyond.\n\nSo at y=0, cannot move down, so a_t cannot be D if y_t=0.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, cannot move up.\n\nBut now at y=0, possible actions: U or S.\n\nSimilarly, later.\n\nNow, to minimize turns, we should move up as soon as possible.\n\nBut need to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nFirst, let's list the dangerous turns: T=28,29 for y=5 and y=6; T=30 for y=7.\n\nWe need to not be on y=5 or y=6 at T=28 and T=29.\n\nNot on y=7 at T=30.\n\nNow, from start, T=26, y=0.\n\nSuppose we move up immediately.\n\nAt T=26: choose U, then y_27 = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nAt T=27, we are at y=1.\n\nNow, y=1 is safe at T=27, since only dangerous at T=26.\n\nWe can choose action at T=27.\n\nIf U, go to y=2 at T=28.\n\ny=2 is safe at T=28, since only dangerous at T=26.\n\nSimilarly, we can keep moving up.\n\nBut we need to consider when we reach higher rows.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 26 (T=26): y=0, safe. Action U, so y_27 =1.\n\nTurn 27 (T=27): y=1, safe. Action U, y_28=2.\n\nTurn 28 (T=28): y=2, safe. Action U, y_29=3.\n\nTurn 29 (T=29): y=3, safe. Action U, y_30=4.\n\nTurn 30 (T=30): y=4, safe. Action U, y_31=5.\n\nNow at T=31, y=5.\n\ny=5 is dangerous only at T=28 and 29, which are past, so at T=31, y=5 is safe.\n\nThen we can go up.\n\nAction U, y_32=6.\n\nT=32, y=6, safe, since dangerous only at 28,29.\n\nU, y_33=7.\n\nT=33, y=7.\n\ny=7 dangerous only at T=30, which is past, so safe.\n\nU, y_34=8.\n\nT=34, y=8, always safe.\n\nU, y_35=9.\n\nT=35, y=9, reached.\n\nSo in this sequence, from T=26 to T=35, that's 10 turns? Let's count the turns.\n\nStart at T=26, y=0.\n\nAfter action at T=26, y_27=1 at T=27.\n\n...\n\nAfter action at T=34, y_35=9 at T=35.\n\nWe reach y=9 at T=35.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=26 to t=34, that's 9 actions, H=9 turns? But we start at t1=26, and actions from t=26 to t=26+H-1, I think.\n\nThe sequence is {a_t for t=t1 to t1+H-1}, and after H actions, we reach at turn t1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, we take action a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nWe want y_{t_final} =9 for some turn.\n\nThe position after H actions should be at turn t1 + H.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn t1, position is given.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t1 + k, position is y_{t1 + k}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9 for some H.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=t1 to t=t1 + H -1, so H actions, and after that, at turn t1 + H, position is y_{t1 + H}.\n\nSet t1=26.\n\nStart: turn 26, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_26, y_27 set.\n\nWe want y_{26 + H} =9.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 26+H, y=9.\n\nThe actions are a_{26} to a_{26+H-1}, total H actions.\n\nIn my earlier sequence:\n\nAt T=26, action U, y_27=1\n\nT=27, action U, y_28=2\n\nT=28, action U, y_29=3\n\nT=29, action U, y_30=4\n\nT=30, action U, y_31=5\n\nT=31, action U, y_32=6\n\nT=32, action U, y_33=7\n\nT=33, action U, y_34=8\n\nT=34, action U, y_35=9\n\nSo at turn 35, y=9.\n\nActions from t=26 to t=34, that's 9 actions: t=26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34.\n\nH=9, and y_{26+9} = y_{35} =9.\n\nNow, is this safe? Let's check each turn.\n\nT=26: y=0, safe (not on freeway)\n\nT=27: y=1, is it dangerous? y=1 dangerous only at T=26, so at T=27 safe.\n\nT=28: y=2, dangerous only at T=26, safe.\n\nT=29: y=3, dangerous only at T=26, safe.\n\nT=30: y=4, dangerous only at T=26, safe.\n\nT=31: y=5, dangerous at T=28,29, not 31, safe.\n\nT=32: y=6, dangerous at 28,29, not 32, safe.\n\nT=33: y=7, dangerous at T=30, not 33, safe.\n\nT=34: y=8, always safe.\n\nT=35: y=9, safe.\n\nAll safe. And H=9.\n\nBut can we do better? H=9 is the minimum possible since we need 9 steps up from y=0 to y=9.\n\nWith no down or stay, we use exactly 9 moves up to go from 0 to 9 in 9 turns.\n\nIn this case, it seems possible.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=5 and y=6 dangerous at T=28,29, but in this sequence, at T=28, y=2, not 5 or 6; T=29, y=3, not 5 or 6; T=30, y=4, not 7.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut let me double-check if at any point we are on dangerous row at wrong time.\n\nT=30: y=4, and y=7 dangerous at T=30, but we are on y=4, not y=7, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut in freeway 7, dangerous at T=30, but we are not on y=7 at T=30, we are on y=4.\n\nSo this sequence should work with H=9.\n\nBut the problem is to output the actions from t1 onwards.\n\nt1=26.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nThen at turn 35, y=9.\n\nBut turn 35 is after action at 34.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify actions for turns t=26 to t=26+H-1.\n\nHere H=9, actions from t=26 to t=34.\n\nBut is there a way with H=8? That would require going from y=0 to y=9 in 8 actions, which means we need to move up faster, but we can only move one step at a time, so impossible to reach in fewer than 9 turns from y=0.\n\nSince each U increases y by 1, and we start at 0, end at 9, we need at least 9 U actions, and no S or D, so min H is 9.\n\nAnd we achieved it with all U, and no collisions in this case.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 7 at T=30.\n\nFreeway 7: dangerous at T=30.\n\nIn our sequence, at T=30, we are at y=4, so not on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nPerhaps we can start later, but that would increase H, not decrease.\n\nMaybe move down to avoid, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: at T=26, if we stay, but that would delay, so worse.\n\nSo this seems optimal.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 5 and 6, dangerous at T=28 and 29.\n\nIn sequence, at T=28, y=2; T=29, y=3, both safe.\n\nAnd we pass y=5 at T=31, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let me list the dangerous periods again.\n\ny=5 dangerous at T=28 and T=29 only.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=5 at T=31, which is after, safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=6 at T=32.\n\ny=7 at T=33, dangerous at T=30, but T=33>30, safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 9, with all U actions.\n\nNow, output the sequence.\n\nt1=26.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\n}\n\nBut let me make sure about the turn numbering.\n\nThe sequence is for turns starting from t1=26.\n\nIn the action, at turn t, we specify a_t.\n\nAfter a_26, y_27=1, etc., up to after a_34, y_35=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", which is a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}.\n\nHere t1=26, H=9, so actions from a_26 to a_{26+8} = a_{34}.\n\nAnd t from 0 to H-1=8, so a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to 8, which is a_26 to a_34.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd we reach y_{t1 + H} = y_{35} =9.\n\nPerfect.\n\nBut is there any issue at T=30?\n\nAt T=30, y=4, and freeway 7 is dangerous, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly, no.\n\nPerhaps I should check if moving to a row at a certain time.\n\nAnother thing: the note about moving to different y.\n\nBut in this case, we are moving up each turn, so at each turn, we are on a single y, and move to next.\n\nNo issue with the collision rule.\n\nFor example, at turn T, we are on y_T, we take action, move to y_{T+1}, but during turn T, we are on y_T for collision.\n\nIn this sequence, all fine.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nBut the car on freeway 5 and 6 at T=28 and 29, but we are not there.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster? No.\n\nOr slower, but that increases H.\n\nSo minimal H=9.\n\nBut let me see if we can reach earlier, but from y=0 to y=9, min 9 turns.\n\nUnless we start from higher, but we start at 0.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U from turn 26 to 34.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 26\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player must move from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 9\\), requiring at least 9 upward moves (U actions) since each U increases \\(y\\) by 1.\n- Collision occurs only if the player is on a freeway row \\(y\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y \\leq 8\\)) at a turn when that row is dangerous (i.e., a car's span contains x=0 at that turn).\n- Based on the car states at \\(t_1 = 26\\):\n  - Freeways 1-4 are dangerous only at turn 26 (but player is not on these rows at turn 26).\n  - Freeway 5 is dangerous at turns 28 and 29.\n  - Freeway 6 is dangerous at turns 28 and 29.\n  - Freeway 7 is dangerous at turn 30.\n  - Freeway 8 is always safe.\n- Rows \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) are always safe (no cars).\n\n### Path to Minimize Turns:\n- The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 9, achieved by moving up (U) every turn from turn 26 to turn 34.\n- Sequence:\n  - At turn 26: Start at \\(y = 0\\), take action U → \\(y = 1\\) at turn 27.\n  - At turn 27: \\(y = 1\\) (safe, as row 1 dangerous only at turn 26), take action U → \\(y = 2\\) at turn 28.\n  - At turn 28: \\(y = 2\\) (safe, as row 2 dangerous only at turn 26), take action U → \\(y = 3\\) at turn 29.\n  - At turn 29: \\(y = 3\\) (safe, as row 3 dangerous only at turn 26), take action U → \\(y = 4\\) at turn 30.\n  - At turn 30: \\(y = 4\\) (safe, as row 4 dangerous only at turn 26), take action U → \\(y = 5\\) at turn 31.\n  - At turn 31: \\(y = 5\\) (safe, as row 5 dangerous only at turns 28 and 29), take action U → \\(y = 6\\) at turn 32.\n  - At turn 32: \\(y = 6\\) (safe, as row 6 dangerous only at turns 28 and 29), take action U → \\(y = 7\\) at turn 33.\n  - At turn 33: \\(y = 7\\) (safe, as row 7 dangerous only at turn 30), take action U → \\(y = 8\\) at turn 34.\n  - At turn 34: \\(y = 8\\) (always safe), take action U → \\(y = 9\\) at turn 35.\n- At turn 35, \\(y = 9\\) is reached, and \\(H = 9\\) turns (actions from turn 26 to turn 34).\n\n### Verification:\n- No collision occurs:\n  - Turns 26-30: Player is on rows 0-4, which are safe except row 4 at turn 26 (but player is not on row 4 at turn 26).\n  - Turns 28-29: Player is on rows 2-3 (safe), avoiding rows 5-6 which are dangerous.\n  - Turn 30: Player is on row 4 (safe), avoiding row 7 which is dangerous.\n  - Turns 31-34: Player is on rows 5-8, all safe as dangerous times have passed.\n\nThus, the minimal sequence is all U actions from turn 26 to turn 34.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: U \\\\\nTurn 28: U \\\\\nTurn 29: U \\\\\nTurn 30: U \\\\\nTurn 31: U \\\\\nTurn 32: U \\\\\nTurn 33: U \\\\\nTurn 34: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 27, and the player is at (0,1). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical position y is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that same turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that the car's span at turn T includes the x-coordinate 0.\n\nImportant: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on y_T at turn T (so we check the car on freeway y_T at turn T) and then moves to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nWe are given the state of cars at turn t1=27 for each freeway (k=1 to 8). For each car, we are given (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the representation for left-moving and right-moving:\n\n- For right-moving: the car is given as (head, tail) meaning the head is the front (rightmost) and tail is the rear (leftmost). The span at turn t1 is [tau, head] (from tail to head). Then at turn T (>=t1), the span becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)].\n\n- For left-moving: the car is given as (head, tail) and the span at t1 is [h, tau] (but note the update: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]). However, looking at the provided cars, all are right-moving? Actually, in the given data, all cars are labeled as \"right\". So we only have right-moving cars.\n\nBut wait: the representation for left-moving in the problem uses the same (head, tail) but then the update is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. However, in the given data, all cars are specified as \"right\". So we don't have any left-moving cars.\n\nSo for every car in the table, we use the right-moving update: \n   Span(T) = [tail + s*(T-27), head + s*(T-27)]\n\nWe note that the player starts at (0,1) at turn 27. We need to get to (0,9). The minimal moves without any obstacles would be 8 moves up (U). However, we must avoid collisions on the freeways we are on at each turn.\n\nWe are going to simulate the movement and check for collisions on the freeway we are on at each turn.\n\nWe are to output the sequence of actions from turn 27 onwards until we reach 9.\n\nPlan:\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) over the state (turn_offset, y) where turn_offset = t - 27 (so starting at 0). We start at (0,1) and we want to reach y=9 at any turn (minimizing the total turns).\n\nBut note: the turn index matters because the car positions change with time.\n\nState: (t, y) where t is the absolute turn (starting at 27) and y in [0,9]. However, since the car movements are linear in time, we can compute the car spans at any turn.\n\nWe'll simulate turn by turn. We are only concerned with the freeways we are on at each turn.\n\nConstraints: \n- The player must be at y in [0,9]. If we try to go down from 0, we stay at 0. Similarly, going up from 9 stays at 9.\n\nWe are to minimize H (the number of turns from the start turn 27 until the turn when we first reach 9). So we want the minimal H.\n\nWe'll do BFS over the state (time_offset, y) but note that the absolute time is important for car positions. Let time_offset = t - 27 (so t = 27 + time_offset). We start at time_offset=0, y=1.\n\nWe'll consider actions U, D, S. Then:\n\nNext state: time_offset+1, y' = y + dy (clamped to [0,9])\n\nBut we must check: at the current absolute turn t = 27 + time_offset, we are on freeway y (if y is between 1 and 8). If we are on freeway y (and y in {1,...,8}), then we check if there is any car on freeway y at turn t such that 0 is in the car's span at turn t.\n\nNote: if y is 0 or 9, then we are not on any freeway (since freeways are y=1 to 8) so no collision.\n\nSo for a state (time_offset, y) at absolute turn t = 27 + time_offset, we are safe if:\n   - y == 0 or y == 9, OR\n   - y in [1,8] and for every car on freeway y (at turn t) the span does not include 0.\n\nBut note: a freeway may have multiple cars. We have to check all cars on that freeway.\n\nHow to compute the car spans for freeway k at turn t (absolute turn)?\n\nFrom the given state at t1=27, for each car on freeway k:\n\n   For a car (head, tail, direction, speed) with direction='right', the span at turn t (>=27) is:\n        [ tail + s*(t-27), head + s*(t-27) ]\n\nWe then check if 0 is in the interval [A, B] for any car? But note: the span is a continuous interval. So we check if A <= 0 <= B.\n\nImportant: the car representation for right-moving: originally at t1=27, the span is [tail, head]. Then at time t, it becomes [tail + s*(t-27), head + s*(t-27)].\n\nWe are given the cars for each freeway.\n\nLet me write down the car configurations for each freeway at turn 27:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=24, tail=1, right, speed=24)\n   Span at t: [1 + 24*(t-27), 24 + 24*(t-27)]\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (60,25,right,36) -> [25+36*(t-27), 60+36*(t-27)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2: [25+36*(t-27), 60+36*(t-27)]\n\nFreeway 4: same as 2: [25+36*(t-27), 60+36*(t-27)]\n\nFreeway 5: three cars:\n   car1: (-48,-59,right,6) -> [-59+6*(t-27), -48+6*(t-27)]\n   car2: (30,19,right,6) -> [19+6*(t-27), 30+6*(t-27)]\n   car3: (-6,-17,right,6) -> [-17+6*(t-27), -6+6*(t-27)]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5: three cars with the same parameters.\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (-36,-47,right,12) -> [-47+12*(t-27), -36+12*(t-27)]\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (60,49,right,4) -> [49+4*(t-27), 60+4*(t-27)]\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway y at turn t if for any car on that freeway at turn t, the span includes 0.\n\nNow, we want to find the minimal H and a sequence of actions.\n\nWe'll use BFS (or Dijkstra, but all steps cost 1) over (time_offset, y). The time_offset can increase without bound? But we are looking for the minimal path to y=9.\n\nWe note that we can only move one step per turn, so the minimal H is at least 8 (to go from 1 to 9). However, we might have to wait (use S) to avoid collisions.\n\nWe'll generate states (time_offset, y) and check if we can be at that state without collision at that turn.\n\nBut note: at the state (time_offset, y), we are at turn t = 27 + time_offset, and we are at position (0,y). We must check the freeway y at that turn for collision.\n\nHowever, the path to that state: we don't need to know the entire path until we find the goal. We want to record the action sequence.\n\nWe can do:\n\n   Let dist[time_offset][y] = the minimal number of steps to reach (time_offset, y) [but we don't care about the number of steps per se, we care about the total turns and we are minimizing H]. Alternatively, we can break when we first reach y=9.\n\nBut note: we are minimizing H (the total turns from 27 to the arrival turn). So we want the earliest turn when we can be at y=9.\n\nWe'll do BFS by increasing time_offset.\n\nWe start at (0,1). We then consider the next actions (U, D, S) and the next state (1, y') where y' = min(9, max(0, 1 + dy)).\n\nBut we must check the state at the current turn (which is 27) for the starting state: we are at (0,1) at turn 27. Is that safe?\n\nCheck freeway 1 at turn 27: \n   Freeway 1: [1+24*(0), 24+24*(0)] = [1,24] -> 0 is not in [1,24] -> safe.\n\nSo (0,1) is safe.\n\nThen we consider next actions:\n\n   U: then next y = 2 (at turn 28) -> we will be at (0,2) at turn 28? \n        But note: at turn 27, we are at y=1. Then we take action U at turn 27, so at turn 28 we are at y=2.\n\n        However, we must check the state at turn 27: we were at y=1 and we were safe? We already did: at turn 27, we are safe.\n\n        But what about during the move? The problem says: at turn T, we are on freeway y_T. So at turn 27, we are on y=1 and we check freeway1 at turn27: safe.\n\n        Then at turn 28, we are on y=2. Then we check freeway2 at turn28.\n\n   Similarly, D: would lead to y=0 at turn28 -> safe (since freeway0 doesn't exist, and we are on y=0 which is safe).\n   S: leads to y=1 at turn28.\n\nSo we generate states for time_offset=1: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2).\n\nBut we must check each state at the absolute turn (27+time_offset) for collision.\n\nFor state (1,0): at turn 28, y=0 -> safe.\nFor state (1,1): at turn 28, we are at y=1 -> check freeway1 at turn28:\n      freeway1: [1 + 24*(28-27) = 1+24=25, 24+24=48] -> [25,48] -> 0 not in [25,48] -> safe.\nFor state (1,2): at turn28, y=2 -> check freeway2 at turn28:\n      freeway2: [25+36*(1)=61, 60+36=96] -> [61,96] -> 0 not in [61,96] -> safe.\n\nSo all three states are safe.\n\nWe continue until we reach (time_offset, 9) for some time_offset.\n\nWe record the parent of each state (time_offset, y) to rebuild the path.\n\nBut note: we are to output the actions from turn27 to the turn when we are at 9 (at the beginning of that turn? or at the end?).\n\nActually, the player position at turn t is (0, y_t). We are to set actions for turns: t1, t1+1, ... until the turn when we have y_{t1+H-1}=9. The number of actions is H.\n\nSo the sequence of actions is for t=t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1+H and we have y_{t1+H} = 9? But note: we start at turn t1 with position given. Then we do an action at turn t1 to get to y_{t1+1}. Then at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}. Then we do an action at turn t1+1 to get to y_{t1+2}, and so on.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H. That means that after H actions, the position is (0,9). So the last action (the H-th action) is taken at turn t1+H-1, and that action leads to y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nTherefore, when we are at state (time_offset, y) = (H, 9) then we have taken H actions (from time_offset0 to time_offsetH) and the last action was taken at turn 27+H-1 to get to 9 at turn 27+H.\n\nBut note: we start at time_offset0 (turn27) at y=1. We have not taken any action yet. Then we take an action at turn27 to go to the next state at time_offset1 (turn28). So the state at time_offset0 is the start.\n\nWe are to output the actions taken at turn27, turn28, ... until the action that gets us to 9.\n\nTherefore, when we reach a state (time_offset, 9) for the first time? Actually, we might reach 9 earlier and then leave? But we only need to be at 9 at the end. So we can stop when we first reach a state (time_offset, 9) that is safe? But note: we are at 9 at turn t = 27+time_offset, and we are safe because 9 is not a freeway. So we can stop.\n\nBut note: we might have a state (time_offset, 9) that we can reach, but we are interested in the minimal time_offset such that we can get to 9.\n\nSo we do BFS by time_offset (which is the number of actions taken) and we break when we first reach y=9.\n\nSteps:\n\n   Let Q be a queue, storing (time_offset, y, path) \n        where path is the sequence of actions taken so far (from turn27 to turn27+time_offset-1) or we can store parent pointers.\n\n   We start: time_offset=0, y=1, path=[].\n\n   We mark visited states: (time_offset, y). But note: we might reach the same y at a later time_offset and it might be necessary? Actually, if we reach the same y at a larger time_offset, we don't need to consider because we are doing BFS by time_offset (which is the number of steps). But we might have a cycle? However, we are minimizing the total turns. So if we have a state (y, time_offset) and we have a way to reach (y) at a smaller time_offset, we skip the larger one.\n\n   However, it is possible that a state (y, time_offset) might be reached by multiple paths with the same time_offset? Then we only need to consider it once per time_offset.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        visited[time_offset][y] = True\n\n   We start by setting visited[0][1]=True.\n\n   Then we dequeue states in increasing time_offset.\n\n   For a state (t_off, y), if y==9, we output the path (which has length t_off) and break.\n\n   Otherwise, for each action a in [U, D, S]:\n        next_y = y + dy (clamped to 0 and 9)\n        next_t_off = t_off + 1\n        absolute_turn = 27 + next_t_off   -> because at the next state we are at turn 27+next_t_off, and we are at y=next_y.\n\n        But note: the collision check for the next state is at the absolute turn 27+next_t_off and at freeway next_y (if next_y in [1,8]).\n\n        However, wait: the next state is the state after taking the action at the current turn. The current state is at time_offset=t_off (absolute turn = 27+t_off) and we are about to take an action. After taking the action, we are at the next state at time_offset=t_off+1 (absolute turn 27+t_off+1) and position next_y.\n\n        So for the next state (next_t_off, next_y), we check collision at absolute turn = 27+t_off+1 and freeway=next_y.\n\n        If next_y is 0 or 9: safe.\n        If next_y in [1,8]: we compute the car spans for freeway=next_y at absolute turn T = 27+t_off+1.\n\n        If there is no car on that freeway that has a span containing 0, then it's safe.\n\n        If safe, and if we haven't visited (next_t_off, next_y) yet, we enqueue.\n\n   We do BFS in increasing next_t_off.\n\nBut note: the state space in y is only 10, and time_offset can be large? But we are going to the minimal H, which is at least 8. And we can set a bound? But the problem doesn't specify, but we can set a reasonable bound. Since the cars move and eventually might leave the 0 point, we can try until we find a solution.\n\nBut note: we are minimizing the number of turns, so we are going to break at the minimal H.\n\nHowever, we must consider that we might have to wait for several turns. The cars are moving at constant speeds. We can compute for each freeway the times when 0 is covered.\n\nBut let's do BFS until we find the goal.\n\nBut note: we might get stuck? But we can set a large bound on time_offset, say up to 100? But we don't know.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the safe intervals for each freeway? That might be more efficient.\n\nBut for simplicity, we'll code BFS and hope that the minimal H is not too large.\n\nGiven that the minimal H is 8, we can try until H=8,9,10,... until we find one.\n\nBut let me compute the car positions at a few turns to see if we can avoid by going straight up.\n\nWe want to go from y=1 to y=9. We can try the direct path: 8 consecutive Ups.\n\nBut we have to check at each turn t (from 27 to 34) the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nAt turn27: we start at y=1 -> safe (as above).\n\nAt turn28: we are at y=2 -> freeway2: [25+36*(1)=61, 60+36=96] -> safe.\n\nAt turn29: y=3 -> freeway3: same as freeway2: [25+36*(2)=25+72=97, 60+72=132] -> safe.\n\nAt turn30: y=4 -> freeway4: same: [25+36*3=25+108=133, 60+108=168] -> safe.\n\nAt turn31: y=5 -> freeway5: we have three cars at turn31 (t-27=4):\n\n   car1: [-59+6*4 = -59+24 = -35, -48+24=-24] -> [-35,-24] -> 0 not in.\n   car2: [19+24=43, 30+24=54] -> safe.\n   car3: [-17+24=7, -6+24=18] -> [7,18] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nAt turn32: y=6 -> freeway6: same as freeway5 at turn32 (t-27=5):\n\n   car1: [-59+30=-29, -48+30=-18] -> safe.\n   car2: [19+30=49,30+30=60] -> safe.\n   car3: [-17+30=13, -6+30=24] -> safe.\n\nAt turn33: y=7 -> freeway7: [ -47+12*(33-27)= -47+12*6=-47+72=25, -36+72=36] -> [25,36] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nAt turn34: y=8 -> freeway8: [49+4*(34-27)=49+4*7=49+28=77, 60+28=88] -> safe.\n\nAt turn35: we would be at y=9 -> safe.\n\nBut note: we have taken 8 actions (from turn27 to turn34) to get to y=9 at turn35? Let's recount:\n\n   Start at turn27: y=1.\n   Action at turn27: U -> at turn28: y=2.\n   Action at turn28: U -> at turn29: y=3.\n   ... \n   Action at turn34: U -> at turn35: y=9.\n\nSo we need 8 actions. The sequence is 8 consecutive U.\n\nBut we must check at each intermediate freeway we are on at the turn we are there.\n\nWe checked above: at each turn from 27 to 34, we are at y= (turn-27+1) at turn (27+i) for i from 0 to 7? \n\nActually:\n\n   turn27: at y=1 -> safe.\n   turn28: at y=2 -> safe.\n   turn29: at y=3 -> safe.\n   turn30: at y=4 -> safe.\n   turn31: at y=5 -> safe.\n   turn32: at y=6 -> safe.\n   turn33: at y=7 -> safe.\n   turn34: at y=8 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn35, we are at y=9 and we are done.\n\nSo the sequence is 8 Ups.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"at turn T, the player is at (0, y_T)\". And we start at turn27 at y=1. Then we take 8 actions: at turn27,28,...,34. Then at turn35, we are at y=9.\n\nBut the last action (the 8th) is taken at turn34 and it leads to y=9 at turn35. So we have H=8.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of actions is:\n\n   Turn 27: U\n   Turn 28: U\n   Turn 29: U\n   Turn 30: U\n   Turn 31: U\n   Turn 32: U\n   Turn 33: U\n   Turn 34: U\n\nBut we must verify the freeway at the turn we are on. We did that for each freeway at the turn when we are at that freeway.\n\nHowever, we did not check if we are at freeway8 at turn34: \n   freeway8 at turn34: [49+4*(34-27)=49+28=77, 60+28=88] -> 0 not in [77,88] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7 at turn33: [ -47+12*(33-27)= -47+72=25, -36+72=36] -> safe.\n\nBut wait: at turn34, we are at y=8. So we check freeway8 at turn34: yes, as above.\n\nBut note: at turn35, we are at y=9 and we don't check because we are at the goal and y=9 is safe.\n\nSo the minimal H is 8.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway5 at turn31: \n   turn31: t-27=4\n   car3: [-17+6*4 = -17+24=7, -6+24=18] -> [7,18] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6 at turn32: \n   car3: [-17+6*5 = -17+30=13, -6+30=24] -> safe.\n\nBut what about freeway5 at turn30? We don't go there? We are at y=4 at turn30, then at turn31 we are at y=5. So we are at freeway5 at turn31, not turn30.\n\nSo it seems safe.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". So at turn T, we are only on y_T. Therefore, we only check the freeway of the current y at the current turn.\n\nTherefore, the direct path is safe.\n\nBut let me check freeway5 at turn31: \n   The three cars:\n        car1: [-59+24=-35, -48+24=-24] -> safe.\n        car2: [19+24=43,30+24=54] -> safe.\n        car3: [-17+24=7, -6+24=18] -> 0 not in [7,18] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6 at turn32: \n        car1: [-59+6*5=-59+30=-29, -48+30=-18] -> safe.\n        car2: [19+30=49,30+30=60] -> safe.\n        car3: [-17+30=13, -6+30=24] -> safe.\n\nAnd freeway7 at turn33: \n        [ -47 + 12*(33-27)= -47+72=25, -36+72=36] -> safe.\n\nfreeway8 at turn34: [49+4*7=77, 60+28=88] -> safe.\n\nTherefore, we can go straight up.\n\nSo the answer is 8 consecutive U actions.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". H is the number of actions. We have 8 actions.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\n\nBut note: at turn35 we are at y=9. So we stop.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning from t=0 to t=H-1. Here H=8, so t from 0 to 7: \n   a_{27+0} = U\n   a_{27+1} = U\n   ...\n   a_{27+7} = U\n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\n}\n\nBut let me check if there is a shorter path? We start at 1 and need to go to 9: 8 steps up is minimal. So no shorter path.\n\nTherefore, this is the answer.\n\nHowever, what if we go up twice and then down? That would be longer. So minimal H is 8.\n\nBut we must ensure that we are not caught by a car at any step. We did check.\n\nBut wait: freeway1 at turn27: safe. But if we had stayed at y=1 for an extra turn? Then at turn28: freeway1 at turn28: [1+24=25,24+24=48] -> safe. But we don't need to.\n\nSo we output the above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach the position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn 27 is 8. The sequence of actions consists of moving up (U) at each turn from turn 27 to turn 34.\n\n### Verification of Collision Avoidance:\n- **Turn 27**: Position \\((0, 1)\\).

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 30, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: y same). The vertical position is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway k (which is the y-coordinate at turn T) and at that turn, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nImportant: When moving from y to y' at turn T, note that at the moment of the move (turn T) the player is still on row y (the starting row) and then moves to row y'. So at turn T, the player is on row y (the starting row) for collision purposes. Only at the next turn (if we move) we are on the new row.\n\nTherefore, when we take an action at turn T (which is applied at the end of turn T to update position for turn T+1), the player's position during turn T is still (0, y_T). Then after the action, at turn T+1, the player is at (0, y_{T+1}).\n\nSo, for collision at turn T: we are on freeway y_T, and we check if any car on freeway y_T at turn T has a span that includes 0.\n\nThe car update rules: \n- Left-moving: the car moves to the left (negative x direction) with speed s. So at time T, the span is [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]? But note: the description says for left-moving: originally at t1, the head is at h and tail at τ? But the description says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] -> Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\". However, note that in the right-moving case, they write [τ, h] for the initial? Actually, the table uses (head, tail, direction, speed). But note the representation:\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24). But if it's right-moving, then the head should be the front? So in the right-moving case, the head is at a higher x than the tail? But here: head=-48, tail=-71? That would mean the head is at -48 and the tail at -71, so the car extends from -71 to -48? But then direction right: that would mean the car is moving to the right? Then at time t1=30, the car is at positions from -71 to -48? And moving right at 24 units per turn.\n\nBut note: the update for right-moving: \n  Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo for freeway 1 at t1=30: \n  initial τ = -71, h = -48, s=24, direction right.\nAt time T (relative to t1, so T - t1 turns have passed), the span becomes:\n  [ -71 + 24*(T-30), -48 + 24*(T-30) ]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving we would use the other formula, but all the cars in the given state are right-moving.\n\nNow, the collision condition at turn T: we are on freeway k (which is the player's y at turn T) and we check if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nWe start at turn t1=30 at position (0,0). We are about to take an action at turn 30 to go to turn 31.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) to go from y=0 to y=9, avoiding collisions on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nSince we start at y=0 and need to get to y=9, we must go upward. Going downward from 0 is not allowed (y remains 0). So we will mostly go up.\n\nThe challenge is to time the moves so that when we are on a freeway row (y from 1 to 8) at a particular turn, there is no car on that row that has a span covering 0 at that exact turn.\n\nWe are allowed to wait (S) to avoid a collision.\n\nWe are to minimize the number of turns H.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t = 30, 31, 32, ... until we reach y=9.\n\nWe are at turn 30: y=0. We are not on a freeway (since freeways are y=1..8) so no collision at turn 30.\n\nWe must take actions until we are at y=9 at some turn.\n\nNote: when we are at y=9, we are not on any freeway (freeways are 1..8) so no collision check at y=9.\n\nSo the problem reduces to safely traversing rows 1 to 8.\n\nWe can simulate the car positions for each freeway at each future turn.\n\nFirst, let's compute the car positions at any turn T (>=30) for each freeway.\n\nFor a car on freeway k at turn T, we need to check if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nNote: some freeways have multiple cars. For example, freeway 5 has three cars.\n\nWe'll compute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, the span at turn T.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=-48, tail=-71, right, 24)\n  Span at T: [ -71 + 24*(T-30), -48 + 24*(T-30) ]\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (head=-48, tail=-83, right, 36)\n  Span at T: [ -83 + 36*(T-30), -48 + 36*(T-30) ]\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2? (head=-48, tail=-83, right, 36) -> same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same as 2 and 3? (head=-48, tail=-83, right, 36) -> same.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: \n  car1: (48, 37, right, 6) -> span at T: [37 + 6*(T-30), 48 + 6*(T-30)]\n  car2: (12, 1, right, 6) -> [1 + 6*(T-30), 12 + 6*(T-30)]\n  car3: (-24, -35, right, 6) -> [-35 + 6*(T-30), -24 + 6*(T-30)]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5? \n  (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6) -> same as freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (48,37,right,12) -> [37+12*(T-30), 48+12*(T-30)]\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (48,37,right,4) -> [37+4*(T-30), 48+4*(T-30)]\n\nNow, we are at turn 30: y=0. We are safe.\n\nWe are going to simulate the moves. We want to get to y=9 as fast as possible, but we must avoid collisions on rows 1 to 8.\n\nWe can only move one row per turn (or stay). So the minimal number of turns to go from 0 to 9 is 9 (if we move up every turn). But we might have to wait sometimes.\n\nSo H at least 9.\n\nWe need to check for each row and each turn if we can be on that row without collision.\n\nBut note: we control when we are on each row by when we move up. We can also move down to avoid a collision? But moving down from row 1 would go back to row 0, which is safe. But that would increase the number of turns. We want minimal turns, so we should avoid going down unless necessary? Actually, we can also stay on a row to wait.\n\nLet me try to simulate the minimal path: always move up unless there is a collision at the next row at the next turn? But note: when we are at row y at turn T, and we decide to move up at turn T, then at turn T+1 we will be at row y+1. But at turn T+1, we are on row y+1, so we check collision for row y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nHowever, we must also consider that if we stay at a row, we are vulnerable to collision at that row for multiple turns.\n\nSo we need to check the safety of each row at each turn.\n\nWe are going to plan the sequence of moves.\n\nWe start at turn 30 at y=0.\n\nWe are going to consider the next moves. We can do:\n\nOption 1: Move up at turn 30 -> then at turn 31 we are at y=1. Then we must check row 1 at turn 31.\n\nOption 2: Stay at turn 30 -> then at turn 31 we are still at y=0. Then we can move later.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so we prefer to move up.\n\nCheck row 1 at turn 31:\n\nFreeway 1 at turn 31: \n  T=31, T-30=1\n  Span: [ -71 + 24*1, -48 + 24*1 ] = [-47, -24] -> does not include 0? -47 to -24 is negative, so 0 is not in the interval. So safe.\n\nSo at turn 31 we can be at y=1.\n\nThen at turn 31, we can choose to move up to y=2 at turn 32.\n\nCheck row 2 at turn 32:\n\nFreeway 2 at turn 32: T-30=2\n  Span: [ -83 + 36*2, -48 + 36*2 ] = [ -83+72, -48+72 ] = [-11, 24] -> this interval includes 0? Yes, because -11 <= 0 <=24. So we would collide at turn 32 on row 2.\n\nTherefore, we cannot move up from row 1 at turn 31 to row 2 at turn 32 because at turn 32 we would be on row 2 and collide.\n\nSo we must avoid being on row 2 at turn 32.\n\nWhat can we do?\n\nOption A: At turn 31, instead of moving up, we stay at row 1. Then at turn 32 we are still at row 1.\n\nBut we must check row 1 at turn 32:\n\nFreeway 1 at turn 32: T-30=2\n  Span: [ -71+24*2, -48+24*2 ] = [ -71+48, -48+48 ] = [-23,0] -> includes 0? Yes, because -23<=0<=0. So we would collide at turn 32 on row 1.\n\nTherefore, we cannot stay at row 1 at turn 31 either? Because if we stay, then at turn 32 we are still at row 1 and collide.\n\nSo at turn 31, we are at row 1. We cannot move up (because then at turn32 row2 has collision) and we cannot stay (because row1 at turn32 has collision). Then we must move down? But moving down from row1 at turn31: then at turn32 we go back to row0.\n\nBut row0 is safe (no freeway). So that is acceptable.\n\nBut then we are back at row0 at turn32, and we have to start over? That will take more turns.\n\nAlternatively, we could have not moved up at turn30? Maybe we should have stayed at turn30 to avoid being at row1 at turn31? But then when?\n\nLet me check row1 at other turns.\n\nWe need to know when row1 is safe. For freeway1:\n\nThe car on row1: span at T: [ -71 + 24*(T-30), -48 + 24*(T-30) ]\n\nWe require that 0 is not in [A, B] where A = -71+24*(T-30) and B = -48+24*(T-30). Since the car moves to the right, the interval is moving to the right.\n\nThe condition for collision: A <= 0 <= B.\n\nSolve for T:\n\n-71 + 24*(T-30) <= 0  => 24*(T-30) <= 71 => T-30 <= 71/24 = 2.9583 => T <= 32.9583 -> T<=32 (since integer)\n\nand\n\n-48 + 24*(T-30) >= 0 => 24*(T-30) >= 48 => T-30 >= 2 => T>=32.\n\nSo the only T when row1 is unsafe is T=32? Because for T=32: \n  A = -71+24*2 = -71+48 = -23 <=0\n  B = -48+48=0>=0 -> so 0 is included.\n\nFor T=31: \n  A = -71+24= -47, B=-24 -> 0 not included (safe)\nFor T=33: \n  A = -71+24*3 = -71+72=1, B=-48+72=24 -> 0 not in [1,24] (safe)\n\nSo row1 is unsafe only at T=32.\n\nSimilarly, for row2:\n\nFreeway2: [ -83 + 36*(T-30), -48 + 36*(T-30) ]\n\nCollision: \n  -83 + 36*(T-30) <= 0 and -48 + 36*(T-30) >=0\n\nFirst: -83 +36k <=0 => 36k<=83 => k<=83/36≈2.305 => k<=2\nSecond: -48+36k>=0 => k>=48/36=4/3≈1.333 => k>=2 (since k integer, k>=2)\n\nSo for k=2: T-30=2 -> T=32 -> collision.\n\nFor k=1: T=31 -> \n  A = -83+36=-47, B=-48+36=-12 -> 0 not included? (both negative) -> safe\nFor k=3: T=33 -> \n  A = -83+108=25, B=-48+108=60 -> 0 not in [25,60] -> safe\n\nSo row2 is unsafe only at T=32.\n\nSimilarly, row3 and row4: same car? (same parameters as row2) so they are unsafe only at T=32 as well? \n\nBut wait: freeway3 and 4 have the same car parameters: head=-48, tail=-83, right,36. So they have the same span at each T. So row3 and row4 are unsafe at T=32? But note: we are only on one row at a time. However, if we are on row3 at T=32, then we check freeway3 at T=32 -> unsafe. Similarly for row4.\n\nBut we are going to go through each row one by one.\n\nSo the problem is that at T=32, rows 1,2,3,4 are all unsafe? \n\nBut we cannot be on multiple rows at the same time. However, if we are at row1 at T=32, we collide. Similarly, if we are at row2,3,4 at T=32, we collide.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on rows 1,2,3,4 at turn32.\n\nNow, what about the other rows?\n\nWe also need to check rows 5,6,7,8.\n\nFreeway5: three cars. We need to check when each car covers 0.\n\nCar1: [37+6k, 48+6k] where k=T-30.\n  Collision: 37+6k <=0<=48+6k -> but 37+6k>=37>0 for k>=0? So never covers 0? Because the car is at x>=37 (which is positive) and moving right. So 0 is never in [37+6k,48+6k] for any k>=0.\n\nCar2: [1+6k,12+6k]\n  Collision: 1+6k<=0<=12+6k -> but 1+6k>=1>0 for k>=0? So never covers 0.\n\nCar3: [-35+6k, -24+6k]\n  Collision: -35+6k<=0<=-24+6k\n  First: -35+6k<=0 => 6k<=35 => k<=35/6≈5.833 -> k<=5\n  Second: 0<=-24+6k => 6k>=24 => k>=4\n  So k=4,5 -> T=30+4=34, 35.\n\nAt T=34: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> includes 0? -11<=0<=0 -> yes.\nAt T=35: [-35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6] -> includes 0? yes.\n\nBut note: freeway5 has three cars. Only car3 causes a collision at T=34 and 35.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6: same as freeway5 -> unsafe at T=34 and 35.\n\nFreeway7: one car: [37+12k,48+12k] -> same as freeway5 car1: always positive, so never covers 0.\n\nFreeway8: [37+4k,48+4k] -> same: always positive, never covers 0.\n\nSo summary of unsafe turns per row:\n\nRow1: unsafe at T=32\nRow2: unsafe at T=32\nRow3: unsafe at T=32\nRow4: unsafe at T=32\nRow5: unsafe at T=34,35\nRow6: unsafe at T=34,35\nRow7: safe at all times (because car never covers 0)\nRow8: safe at all times\n\nWe start at T=30 at y=0.\n\nWe want to go from y=0 to y=9. The minimal path would be:\n\nT30: at y0 -> action: U -> then T31: y1\nT31: at y1 -> action: U -> then T32: y2 -> but at T32, y2 is unsafe -> collision.\n\nSo we must avoid being on rows 1 to 4 at T=32 and rows 5 and 6 at T=34 and T=35.\n\nWe can try to adjust the timing.\n\nWe have to pass row1, then row2, then row3, then row4, then row5, row6, row7, row8, and then row9.\n\nWe can wait at some rows to avoid the unsafe turns.\n\nSince rows 7 and 8 are always safe, we don't have to worry about them.\n\nThe problem is rows 1-4 at T=32 and rows 5-6 at T=34,35.\n\nWe must not be on row1,2,3,4 at T=32. So we can be on these rows at other turns.\n\nSimilarly, we must not be on row5 or 6 at T=34 and T=35.\n\nWe can try to be on row1 at T=31 (safe) and then wait at row1 until after T=32? But row1 is unsafe at T=32, but safe at T=31 and T=33.\n\nSo at T=31: we are at row1 (safe). Then at T=31, we cannot move up (because then at T32 we would be at row2 which is unsafe) and we cannot stay (because at T32 we would be at row1 which is unsafe). So we must move down at T31 to row0 at T32.\n\nThen at T32, we are at row0 (safe). Then at T32, we can move up again to row1 at T33? \n\nBut row1 at T33: safe (as we saw).\n\nThen we can proceed.\n\nSimilarly, we need to avoid row2,3,4 at T=32. But we are going to be at row1 at T33, then row2 at T34? But row2 is safe at T34? \n\nRow2: unsafe only at T=32. At T=33: \n  Freeway2: [ -83+36*3, -48+36*3] = [ -83+108, -48+108] = [25,60] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, row3 and row4: same -> safe at T>=33 and T!=32.\n\nSo if we can be at row1 at T33, then row2 at T34, row3 at T35, row4 at T36, etc.\n\nBut we also have to avoid row5 and row6 at T34 and T35.\n\nRow5: unsafe at T34 and T35. So we cannot be on row5 at T34 or T35.\n\nSimilarly for row6.\n\nSo when we get to row5, we must be at a turn that is not 34 or 35.\n\nSimilarly for row6.\n\nLet's plan the turns:\n\nWe start:\nT30: y0 -> we can do U to get to y1 at T31 (safe) or we can wait at y0.\n\nBut to minimize time, we do U at T30.\n\nT30: action U -> then T31: y1 (safe)\n\nAt T31: we are at y1. We must avoid being at y1 at T32 (unsafe) so we cannot stay. We also cannot go to y2 at T32 (which is unsafe). So we must go down to y0 at T32.\n\nT31: action D -> then T32: y0 (safe)\n\nNow at T32: we are at y0. We can move up to y1 at T33.\n\nT32: action U -> then T33: y1 (safe, because row1 at T33 is safe)\n\nNow at T33: we are at y1. We can move up to y2 at T34.\n\nBut row2 at T34: we computed above: safe (span [25,60] for freeway2 at T34) -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, row3 and row4: safe at T34? \n\nRow3 at T34: freeway3: same as freeway2: [ -83+36*(34-30)= -83+36*4= -83+144=61, and -48+144=96] -> [61,96] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, row4: safe.\n\nBut note: we are going to move from y1 to y2 at T33: then at T34 we are at y2.\n\nBut what about row5? We are not at row5 yet.\n\nNow at T33: action U -> then T34: y2.\n\nBut we also have to worry about row5 and row6 at T34 and T35.\n\nWe are at y2 at T34. We can continue to move up.\n\nT34: action U -> then T35: y3.\n\nT35: action U -> then T36: y4.\n\nT36: action U -> then T37: y5.\n\nBut now at T37: we are at y5. Is y5 safe at T37? \n\nRow5: unsafe at T34 and T35, but T37 is after that. So we need to check:\n\nFreeway5 at T37: k=T37-30=7\n  car3: [-35+6*7, -24+6*7] = [-35+42, -24+42] = [7,18] -> does not include 0 -> safe.\n\nBut we also have to check the other cars? We already know they are always safe.\n\nSo row5 at T37: safe.\n\nBut wait: we are going to be at row5 at T37. But we need to check row5 at T37: safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can move to row6 at T38.\n\nRow6 at T38: same as row5 at T38? Freeway6 is identical to freeway5. So at T38: k=8\n  car3: [-35+6*8, -24+48] = [-35+48, -24+48] = [13,24] -> safe.\n\nThen row7 and row8: always safe.\n\nSo the plan:\n\nT30: U -> T31: y1\nT31: D -> T32: y0\nT32: U -> T33: y1\nT33: U -> T34: y2\nT34: U -> T35: y3\nT35: U -> T36: y4\nT36: U -> T37: y5\nT37: U -> T38: y6\nT38: U -> T39: y7\nT39: U -> T40: y8\nT40: U -> T41: y9 -> done.\n\nBut we reached y9 at turn41? That is H=41-30+1? Actually, from turn30 to turn41, we took 11 actions? \n\nWait, the sequence: \n  Turn30: action (first action at t1=30) -> then we have turns from 30 to 40? \n\nWe start at turn30: y0.\nAfter action at turn30: we are at turn31 at y1.\n...\nAfter action at turn40: we are at turn41 at y9.\n\nSo we have 11 actions: from turn30 to turn40 (inclusive), and then at turn41 we are at y9.\n\nBut we can check if we can do better.\n\nNotice that we spent two extra turns (T31: D and T32: U) to avoid the unsafe T32.\n\nBut we can also avoid by waiting at y0 until after T32? \n\nAlternative plan:\n\nAt turn30: we can stay at y0 until after T32? \n\nBut we are at y0 at turn30: safe.\n\nAt turn30: if we stay, then turn31: y0 (safe)\n\nAt turn31: we can stay again? Then turn32: y0 (safe)\n\nNow at turn32: we are at y0. Then we can start moving up.\n\nBut we must avoid row1 at T32? We are not on row1 at T32 (we are at y0) so safe.\n\nAt turn32: action U -> turn33: y1 (safe, because row1 at T33 is safe)\n\nThen we can move up each turn.\n\nBut we have to avoid row5 and row6 at T34 and T35.\n\nSo:\n\nT30: S -> T31: y0\nT31: S -> T32: y0\nT32: U -> T33: y1\nT33: U -> T34: y2\nT34: U -> T35: y3\nT35: U -> T36: y4\nT36: U -> T37: y5\n\nBut at T37: y5 is safe (as above)\n\nThen continue to y6 at T38: safe (row6 at T38: safe as above)\n\nThen to y7 at T39, y8 at T40, y9 at T41.\n\nSame as before: 11 actions.\n\nBut note: in the first plan we did 11 actions, and this also 11 actions.\n\nBut we can try to be at row1 at T31, then go down to y0 at T32, then up to y1 at T33, then we proceed. That was 11 actions.\n\nBut can we avoid the two extra turns?\n\nWe need to get from y0 to y9. The minimal without obstacles is 9 moves (each U). But we have to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nThe unsafe times are T32 for rows1-4 and T34,35 for rows5-6.\n\nWe have to pass rows1-4 at turns that are not 32, and rows5-6 at turns that are not 34 or 35.\n\nWe can try to go faster through the lower rows.\n\nFor example, if we can be at row1 at T31 (safe), then we skip row2,3,4 at T32? But we can only move one row per turn.\n\nBut we can be at row1 at T31, then at T32 we must be at row0, row1, or row2? But row1 and row2 are unsafe at T32. So we must go to row0 at T32.\n\nThen at T33 we go to row1, then at T34 we go to row2 (safe at T34), then at T35 we go to row3 (safe at T35? row3 at T35: freeway3: [ -83+36*(35-30)= -83+36*5= -83+180=97, and -48+180=132] -> safe). Then at T36 we go to row4 (safe). Then at T37 we go to row5.\n\nBut row5 at T37: safe (as above). Then row6 at T38: safe.\n\nSo same as before: 11 actions.\n\nBut note: we are at row4 at T36. Then we go to row5 at T37, row6 at T38, row7 at T39, row8 at T40, row9 at T41.\n\nWe can try to get to row5 after T35? But we are already at row5 at T37 which is after T35.\n\nAlternatively, can we get to row5 earlier? \n\nWe were at row4 at T36. But if we try to be at row4 earlier, we have to go through row1 earlier. But we cannot be at row1 at T32.\n\nWe started at T30 at y0. The earliest we can be at row1 is T31. Then at T32 we go down to y0. Then at T33 we are at y1. Then at T34 at y2, T35 at y3, T36 at y4, T37 at y5. \n\nSo we cannot get to y5 earlier than T37.\n\nBut note: if we stay at y0 for two turns (T30 and T31: both S) then we start at T32: go to y1 at T33, then y2 at T34, y3 at T35, y4 at T36, y5 at T37. Same as above.\n\nBut what if we stay only one extra turn? \n\nFor example:\n\nT30: U -> T31: y1 (safe)\nT31: D -> T32: y0 (safe) -> we avoided row1 and row2 at T32.\nT32: U -> T33: y1 (safe)\nT33: U -> T34: y2 (safe)\nT34: U -> T35: y3 (safe)\nT35: U -> T36: y4 (safe)\nT36: U -> T37: y5 (safe)\n\nThen same as before: from T30 to T36: 7 actions, and then we still have to go to y9: \nT37: U -> y6 at T38\nT38: U -> y7 at T39\nT39: U -> y8 at T40\nT40: U -> y9 at T41\n\nTotal 11 actions.\n\nBut can we avoid the extra two turns? \n\nNotice that the unsafe row5 at T34 and T35: we are at row5 at T37, which is safe. But what if we could be at row5 at T33? \n\nHow? To be at row5 at T33, we would have to start at y0 at T30, then do 5 ups: T30:U (T31:y1), T31:U (T32:y2) -> but T32:y2 is unsafe. So we cannot.\n\nAlternatively, if we go up faster? But we can only move one per turn.\n\nSo minimal H is 11? \n\nBut let me see if we can do 10.\n\nWe need to be at y9 at turn40? So we start at turn30, then 10 actions: turn30 to turn39, then at turn40 we are at y9.\n\nThat means we have to go from y0 to y9 in 10 moves. That is possible if we move up 9 times and one extra move (but we have to avoid). The extra move would be a stay or a down? But we cannot move down because we are going upward.\n\nWe have to have 9 upward moves. But we may have to have some non-up moves? \n\nIn our plan we have 9 upward moves and one down move and one extra up to compensate? Actually, we have 10 upward moves? Let me count:\n\nIn the first plan:\nT30: U (up)\nT31: D (down)\nT32: U (up)\nT33: U\nT34: U\nT35: U\nT36: U\nT37: U\nT38: U\nT39: U\nT40: U -> to get to y9 at T41? \n\nWe started at y0 (T30). Then:\n\nT31: y1 (after T30:U)\nT32: y0 (after T31:D)\nT33: y1 (after T32:U)\nT34: y2 (after T33:U)\nT35: y3 (after T34:U)\nT36: y4 (after T35:U)\nT37: y5 (after T36:U)\nT38: y6 (after T37:U)\nT39: y7 (after T38:U)\nT40: y8 (after T39:U)\nT41: y9 (after T40:U)\n\nWe did 11 actions: 10 U and 1 D? But the net upward is 9. \n\nBut we have 11 actions to get to y9 at T41.\n\nTo get to y9 at T40, we must be at y8 at T39.\n\nBut in our sequence, we are at y8 at T40? \n\nWe can rearrange? \n\nWe need to be at y9 at T40? That means at T39 we are at y8 and we do U at T39.\n\nBut we have to be at y8 at T39.\n\nHow to get to y8 faster?\n\nThe earliest we can be at row1 is T31. Then we have to go through rows 2 to 8. That takes 7 more moves? So at T31+7 = T38 we can be at y8. Then at T39 we do U to y9 at T40.\n\nSo we can be at y8 at T38? \n\nBut we have the unsafe turns.\n\nWe have to avoid rows1-4 at T32 and rows5-6 at T34,35.\n\nSo:\n\nT30: U -> T31: y1 (safe)\nNow at T31: we cannot be at row2 at T32 (unsafe) and we cannot be at row1 at T32 (unsafe). So we must go down to y0 at T32.\n\nThen T32: we are at y0. Then we do U at T32: T33: y1 (safe)\n\nThen we need to get to y8 by T38? \n\nFrom T33: y1, then:\n\nT33: U -> T34: y2 (safe? row2 at T34: safe)\nT34: U -> T35: y3 (safe? row3 at T35: safe? freeway3 at T35: [ -83+36*5, -48+36*5] = [-83+180=97, -48+180=132] -> safe)\nT35: U -> T36: y4 (safe? row4 at T36: same as above? [ -83+36*6, -48+36*6] = [-83+216=133, -48+216=168] -> safe)\nT36: U -> T37: y5 -> but row5 at T37: we know safe? \n   freeway5 at T37: k=7 -> car3: [ -35+42, -24+42] = [7,18] -> safe.\nT37: U -> T38: y6 -> row6 at T38: same as above? k=8 -> [ -35+48, -24+48] = [13,24] -> safe.\nT38: U -> T39: y7 (row7: safe always)\nT39: U -> T40: y8? Then we are at y8 at T40? But we need to be at y8 at T39? \n\nWe are at T38: y6. Then we do U: T39: y7. Then we need another U to get to y8 at T40? \n\nBut we are at y7 at T39. Then at T39 we do U: then at T40 we are at y8? But we wanted to be at y8 at T39? \n\nWe are behind: we are at y6 at T38, then y7 at T39, then y8 at T40, then y9 at T41.\n\nBut we want to be at y8 at T39.\n\nHow can we get to y8 at T39? \n\nWe must be at y7 at T38, then do U at T38 to be at y8 at T39.\n\nSo we need to be at y7 at T38.\n\nCurrently, we are at y6 at T38? \n\nWe need to accelerate? But we can only move one per turn.\n\nSo we are at y1 at T33, then we need 6 moves to get to y7 at T39? \n\nT33: y1\nT34: y2\nT35: y3\nT36: y4\nT37: y5\nT38: y6 -> then we are at y6 at T38, not y7.\n\nSo we are one behind.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y8 at T39.\n\nSo the minimal is 11 actions.\n\nBut wait, we have an extra down and up. Can we avoid that?\n\nAnother idea: instead of going down at T31, can we go up to row2 at T31? But at T31 we are at row1. Then at T31 we do U: then at T32 we would be at row2 -> unsafe.\n\nOr stay at row1 at T31: then at T32 we are at row1 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must leave row1 at T31? But we can only go to row0 (down) or row2 (up) or stay. But up and stay are unsafe at T32, so only down.\n\nSo we have to do down at T31.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nBut we can try to avoid the down by waiting at y0 until after T32? Then we start moving at T32.\n\nBut then:\n\nT30: S -> T31: y0\nT31: S -> T32: y0\nT32: U -> T33: y1 (safe)\nT33: U -> T34: y2 (safe)\nT34: U -> T35: y3 (safe)\nT35: U -> T36: y4 (safe)\nT36: U -> T37: y5 (safe)\nT37: U -> T38: y6 (safe)\nT38: U -> T39: y7\nT39: U -> T40: y8\nT40: U -> T41: y9\n\nSame 11 actions.\n\nBut note: in this plan, we did two stays at the beginning and then 9 ups? But then we have 11 actions: two S and nine U? But we end at y9 at T41.\n\nBut we started at y0. Two S: still y0. Then nine U: from y0 to y9? Yes, but we have to do the moves sequentially.\n\nT30: S -> T31: y0\nT31: S -> T32: y0\nT32: U -> T33: y1\nT33: U -> T34: y2\n...\nT40: U -> T41: y9\n\nSo we did 11 actions: two S and nine U? But the two S are at the beginning. The net effect: we moved from y0 to y9 in 9 upward moves, but we took 11 turns because we waited two turns.\n\nBut we avoided the down move. However, the total number of actions is still 11.\n\nNow, can we do it in 10? \n\nWe need to reach y9 at T40.\n\nSo we must be at y9 at T40. Then we must be at y8 at T39 (and do U at T39).\n\nHow to be at y8 at T39? \n\nWe must be at y0 at T30. \n\nThe earliest we can be at y1 is T31 (if we do U at T30).\n\nThen y2 at T32? But row2 at T32 is unsafe -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at y2 at T32.\n\nIf we do U at T30: T31: y1 -> then at T31 we do U: T32: y2 -> unsafe.\n\nIf we do U at T30: T31: y1 -> then at T31 we do S: T32: y1 -> unsafe.\n\nIf we do U at T30: T31: y1 -> then at T31 we do D: T32: y0 -> safe, but then we are at y0 at T32. Then we do U at T32: T33: y1. Then we can do U at T33: T34: y2, etc. But then we are at y1 at T33, y2 at T34, y3 at T35, y4 at T36, y5 at T37, y6 at T38, y7 at T39, then we do U at T39: T40: y8? But we need to be at y8 at T39? \n\nWe are at y7 at T39. Then at T39 we do U: then at T40 we are at y8? But we need to be at y8 at T39 to do U to y9 at T40? \n\nSo we are at y8 at T40? Then we do U at T40: T41: y9.\n\nSo we cannot get to y9 at T40.\n\nIf we try to be faster: but we cannot skip moves.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, we have two possible sequences:\n\nSequence A (with down move):\n  T30: U\n  T31: D\n  T32: U\n  T33: U\n  T34: U\n  T35: U\n  T36: U\n  T37: U\n  T38: U\n  T39: U\n  T40: U\n\nThis gets us to:\n  T31: y1\n  T32: y0\n  T33: y1\n  T34: y2\n  T35: y3\n  T36: y4\n  T37: y5\n  T38: y6\n  T39: y7\n  T40: y8\n  T41: y9\n\nBut we are done at T41? But the action at T40: U gets us to y9 at T41. So we have 11 actions.\n\nSequence B (with two stays at start):\n  T30: S\n  T31: S\n  T32: U\n  T33: U\n  T34: U\n  T35: U\n  T36: U\n  T37: U\n  T38: U\n  T39: U\n  T40: U\n\nThis gets us:\n  T31: y0\n  T32: y0\n  T33: y1\n  T34: y2\n  T35: y3\n  T36: y4\n  T37: y5\n  T38: y6\n  T39: y7\n  T40: y8\n  T41: y9\n\nSame.\n\nBut note: we have to output the actions for turns starting at t1=30 for H turns.\n\nH is the number of actions? And after H actions, we are at y9.\n\nIn both sequences, after 11 actions we are at y9.\n\nBut we can check if we can do 10 actions? \n\nSuppose we try to go through row5 and row6 at a safe time without the extra down. \n\nBut we have to avoid row1 at T32. \n\nAlternatively, we can go from y0 to y1 at T31 (safe), then at T31 we do nothing? But we cannot because row1 is unsafe at T32. \n\nOr, we can go up to row2 at T31? But we can only go to row1 at T31.\n\nAnother idea: can we go down from y0? But we are at y0, down would stay at y0. So same as stay.\n\nSo I think 11 is minimal.\n\nBut let me check if we can be at row5 at T36? Then we don't have to wait? \n\nIn the sequence without the down move (the two stays at start), we are at row5 at T37. But if we can be at row5 at T36, then we can save one turn.\n\nHow to be at row5 at T36? \n\nWe need to be at y0 at T30. Then:\n\nT30: U -> T31: y1\nT31: ? -> to avoid row1 at T32, we must go to y0 at T32 (D) -> then T32: y0\nT32: U -> T33: y1\nT33: U -> T34: y2\nT34: U -> T35: y3\nT35: U -> T36: y4 -> but we want y5 at T36? \n\nWe are at y4 at T36. \n\nTo get to y5 at T36, we would have to be at y4 at T35 and then do U at T35. \n\nBut at T35: if we are at y4, then we do U: T36: y5.\n\nSo we need to be at y4 at T35.\n\nHow? \n\nT30: U (T31: y1)\nT31: D (T32: y0) -> lost\nT32: U (T33: y1)\nT33: U (T34: y2)\nT34: U (T35: y3) -> we are at y3 at T35, not y4.\n\nSo we are at y3 at T35.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y4 at T35.\n\nSo the earliest we can be at y4 is T36? \n\nIn the sequence: \n  T30: U (T31: y1)\n  T31: D (T32: y0)\n  T32: U (T33: y1)\n  T33: U (T34: y2)\n  T34: U (T35: y3)\n  T35: U (T36: y4)\n\nThen at T36: we are at y4. Then we can do U at T36: T37: y5.\n\nSame as before.\n\nTherefore, we must have 11 actions.\n\nNow, which sequence to choose? Both are valid.\n\nBut note: in the sequence with the down move, we are at y0 at T32. Then we go up. But we have to check row1 at T33: safe.\n\nIn the sequence with two stays, we are at y0 until T32, then we go up to y1 at T33: safe.\n\nBut we also have to avoid row5 and row6 at T34,35: we are not on row5 or 6 until T37 and T38, which are safe.\n\nSo both are safe.\n\nWe can choose either. Let me choose the first one (with the down move) because it starts immediately.\n\nBut let me verify the entire sequence for collisions.\n\nSequence A:\n\nTurn30: action U -> then at turn31: y1. Check row1 at turn31: \n  Freeway1: [ -71+24*1, -48+24*1] = [-47,-24] -> no 0 -> safe.\n\nTurn31: action D -> then at turn32: y0. (safe, not a freeway)\n\nTurn32: action U -> then at turn33: y1. Check row1 at turn33: \n  Freeway1: [ -71+24*3, -48+24*3] = [-71+72=1, -48+72=24] -> [1,24] -> no 0 -> safe.\n\nTurn33: action U -> turn34: y2. Check row2 at turn34:\n  Freeway2: [ -83+36*4, -48+36*4] = [-83+144=61, -48+144=96] -> no 0 -> safe.\n\nTurn34: action U -> turn35: y3. Check row3 at turn35:\n  Freeway3: same as freeway2: [61,96] -> safe.\n\nTurn35: action U -> turn36: y4. Check row4 at turn36:\n  Freeway4: same -> [ -83+36*6, -48+36*6] = [-83+216=133, -48+216=168] -> safe.\n\nTurn36: action U -> turn37: y5. Check row5 at turn37:\n  Freeway5: \n    car1: [37+6*7,48+6*7] = [37+42,48+42] = [79,90] -> safe.\n    car2: [1+6*7,12+6*7] = [43,54] -> safe.\n    car3: [-35+6*7, -24+6*7] = [7,18] -> safe. (0 not included)\n\nTurn37: action U -> turn38: y6. Check row6 at turn38:\n  Same as freeway5: \n    car3: [-35+6*8, -24+6*8] = [13,24] -> safe.\n\nTurn38: action U -> turn39: y7. Check row7 at turn39:\n  Freeway7: [37+12*9,48+12*9] = [37+108,48+108] = [145,156] -> safe.\n\nTurn39: action U -> turn40: y8. Check row8 at turn40:\n  Freeway8: [37+4*10,48+4*10] = [37+40,48+40] = [77,88] -> safe.\n\nTurn40: action U -> turn41: y9. (safe, not a freeway)\n\nSo no collisions.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions from turn30 to turn40 (11 actions):\n\nTurn30: U\nTurn31: D\nTurn32: U\nTurn33: U\nTurn34: U\nTurn35: U\nTurn36: U\nTurn37: U\nTurn38: U\nTurn39: U\nTurn40: U\n\nBut we reached y9 at turn41, which is after the last action at turn40.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" such that after H actions we are at (0,9).\n\nHere H=11, and we start at t1=30, so actions at t=30,31,...,40 (which is 11 actions).\n\nSo we output:\n\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: D\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\n\nBut note: the answer format should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 30: a_{30}\nTurn 31: a_{31}\n...\n}\n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: D\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\n}\n\nBut wait: we have 11 actions. Is there a shorter sequence? We argued not.\n\nBut note: we could have a sequence that goes to row7 or row8 earlier? But we have to go through the rows in order.\n\nAnother idea: at turn31, we are at y1. Instead of going down, can we go up to y2 at turn32? But we know row2 at turn32 is unsafe. So no.\n\nOr, can we go down to y0 and then at turn32 we go up to y1, but then at turn33 we go up to y2, which is safe. Then we are at y2 at turn33. Then we can move up faster? \n\nBut we are still at y2 at turn33, same as in the sequence above we were at y2 at turn34? Actually, in the above sequence we are at y2 at turn34. If we can be at y2 at turn33, then we can be ahead by one.\n\nBut how?\n\nWe are at turn31: y1.\n\nWe do D at turn31: turn32: y0.\n\nThen turn32: U: turn33: y1.\n\nThen we cannot be at y2 at turn33? Because at turn33 we are at y1. To be at y2 at turn33, we would have to have been at y1 at turn32 and then do U at turn32. But at turn32 we were at y0.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nTherefore, we must stick to 11 actions.\n\nSo the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 30\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by moving down at turn 31 to avoid the unsafe conditions at turn 32 for rows 1 to 4, and proceeds upward safely, avoiding rows 5 and 6 at turns 34 and 35.\n\n### Verification:\n- **Turn 30 (start at \\(y = 0\\)):** Move up → \\(y = 1\\) at turn 31.  \n  Row 1 at turn 31: Car span \\([-47, -24]\\) (0 not included) → safe.\n- **Turn 31:** Move down → \\(y = 0\\) at turn 32.  \n  Not on a freeway → safe.\n- **Turn 32:** Move up → \\(y = 1\\) at turn 33.  \n  Row 1 at turn 33: Car span \\([1, 24]\\) (0 not included) → safe.\n- **Turn 33:** Move up → \\(y = 2\\) at turn 34.  \n  Row 2 at turn 34: Car span \\([61, 96]\\) (0 not included) → safe.\n- **Turn 34:** Move up → \\(y = 3\\) at turn 35.  \n  Row 3 at turn 35: Car span \\([61, 96]\\) (0 not included) → safe.\n- **Turn 35:** Move up → \\(y = 4\\) at turn 36.  \n  Row 4 at turn 36: Car span \\([133, 168]\\) (0 not included) → safe.\n- **Turn 36:** Move up → \\(y = 5\\) at turn 37.  \n  Row 5 at turn 37:  \n  - Car 1: \\([79, 90]\\) → safe.  \n  - Car 2: \\([43, 54]\\) → safe.  \n  - Car 3: \\([7, 18]\\) (0 not included) → safe.\n- **Turn 37:** Move up → \\(y = 6\\) at turn 38.  \n  Row 6 at turn 38: Car 3 \\([13, 24]\\) (0 not included) → safe.\n- **Turn 38:** Move up → \\(y = 7\\) at turn 39.  \n  Row 7 at turn 39: Car span \\([145, 156]\\) (0 not included) → safe.\n- **Turn 39:** Move up → \\(y = 8\\) at turn 40.  \n  Row 8 at turn 40: Car span \\([77, 88]\\) (0 not included) → safe.\n- **Turn 40:** Move up → \\(y = 9\\) at turn 41.  \n  Not on a freeway → safe and goal reached.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 30: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 31: \\text{ } D \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 32: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 33: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 34: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 35: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 36: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 37: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 38: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 39: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 40: \\text{ } U\n}",

Actually the problem states:\n    Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n    Right-moving: [τ, h] → [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note the representation in the table:\n  For freeway 1: (0, -23, right, 24) -> so for right-moving: the tail is -23 and head is 0? Actually the problem says for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] meaning τ is the leftmost (tail) and h is the rightmost (head). So at t1, the car is from -23 to 0? But note: the representation in the table is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). This is confusing.\n\nLooking at the problem: \n  For freeway 1: (0, -23, right, 24)\n\nBut for a right-moving car, the problem says the span at t1 is [τ, h] = [tail, head]. However, the table lists (head, tail, ...). So in this case: head=0, tail=-23, meaning the car extends from tail=-23 to head=0? Then the span is [-23,0]? But the problem says for right-moving: [τ, h] and then the update is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSo for freeway 1: \n  It's a right-moving car with τ = -23, h = 0, speed=24.\n\nTherefore, at turn T (>=32), the car's span is:\n  [ -23 + 24*(T-32), 0 + 24*(T-32) ]\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car, the table would give (head, tail, left, speed) and then the span at t1 is [h, τ] and then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: in the table, all cars in this instance are right-moving.\n\nNow, the collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (where k is between 1 and 8) then we must check every car on freeway k at turn T: does the car's span at T include 0?\n\nSo we need to compute for each freeway and each car on that freeway, the span at any turn T.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and a sequence of actions.\n\nThe player starts at y=0 at turn 32. We can only move to y=0,1, or stay at 0 on the first move? Actually, from y0=0, we can:\n  U -> y=1 at turn 33 (but note: at turn 32, we are at y=0; then we take an action at turn32 to move to y1 at turn33).\n  But note: the problem says the sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. So at time t1 (32) we take action a_{32}, then at t1+1 (33) we take a_{33}, etc.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1+H, and the position is y_{t1+H}. We require that at the last turn (t1+H-1) we are at (0,9). Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? Let me check:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\" meaning that after H actions, we have moved from (0,0) at turn32 to (0,9) at turn32+H.\n\nBut note: the position at turn t1 (32) is (0,0). Then:\n  After action a32 (at turn32) we get to position (0, y33) at turn33? Actually, the update is:\n      y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n  So at turn32, we are at y32=0. We choose a32, which gives Δy32, then y33 = 0 + Δy32.\n\nTherefore, the position at the end of turn32 (i.e., at the beginning of turn33) is (0, y33). But the collision condition is per turn: at turn T, we are at row y_T (which is the row we arrived at the beginning of the turn? Actually, the problem states:\n\n  \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd note: the player update says that at turn T, the player is at (0, y_T). Then we choose an action a_T that will update the position to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nSo during turn T, the player is on row y_T. Therefore, we must avoid collisions on row y_T at turn T.\n\nImportant: We are at row 0 at turn32. Since row0 is not a freeway (freeways are y=1..8), there are no cars on row0. So we are safe at turn32.\n\nOur goal: we must be at row9 at some turn. But note: row9 is the goal and also not a freeway (freeways only 1-8), so we don't check collisions on row9? Actually, the problem says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". So if we are on row9, we are safe.\n\nTherefore, we need to get to row9. The minimal number of moves? The vertical distance is 9. But we can move at most 1 per turn? So at least 9 moves? But we can also move down? But we start at 0 and want to go to 9, so we must go up. However, we might have to wait (by staying or even moving down) to avoid cars.\n\nBut note: we are at row0 at turn32. Then at turn33 we can be at row0 (if S), row1 (if U), or row0 (if D? but row0 is the minimum so D would leave us at 0? because y_{t+1} = max(0, min(9, y_t + Δy_t))? Actually the problem says y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9] and the update is as given. So D from 0: 0-1=-1 -> clamped to 0? But the problem doesn't explicitly say clamping, but it says \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\". So we assume that if we try to go below 0, we stay at 0.\n\nSimilarly, above 9: we stay at 9.\n\nTherefore, from 0, D and S both keep us at 0. U moves to 1.\n\nWe need to get to 9. The minimal H would be 9 if we can go straight up without stopping. But we must check the cars on freeways 1 to 8 at the times we are there.\n\nWe are going to simulate turns starting at turn32 (current) and then turn33,34,... until we reach 9.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway row (1-8) at a turn when there is a car on that row that covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nLet's compute for each freeway and each car the times at which the car covers x=0.\n\nBut note: the cars are moving continuously (in discrete steps per turn). We can compute the span at any turn T (>=32) for each car.\n\nWe'll denote T0 = 32.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car: right-moving, τ=-23, h=0, s=24.\n  At turn T: span = [ -23 + 24*(T-32), 0 + 24*(T-32) ]\n  We require 0 in [ -23 + 24*(T-32), 24*(T-32) ]\n  => -23 + 24*(T-32) <= 0 <= 24*(T-32)\n  => 24*(T-32) >= 0  [always true for T>=32] and \n     -23 + 24*(T-32) <= 0  => 24*(T-32) <= 23 => T-32 <= 23/24 < 1 => T-32 <= 0 => T<=32.\n\n  So at T=32: the car spans [-23,0] -> includes 0? \n      at T=32: [ -23 + 0, 0 + 0] = [-23,0] -> 0 is included? yes, because it's the right endpoint? \n      But note: the span is [τ, h] for right-moving? and at T=32: [ -23, 0 ] -> this is a closed interval? \n      The problem doesn't specify, but we assume inclusive? So 0 is included.\n\n  However, we are at turn32 at row0 (not freeway1). Then at turn33: \n      T=33: [ -23+24*1, 0+24*1] = [1, 24] -> 0 is not in [1,24]. \n  So at T=32: the car is on freeway1 and covers 0, but we are not on freeway1 at turn32 (we are on row0). So we don't care.\n\n  Therefore, freeway1 is safe for T>=33? Actually, at T=33: [1,24] -> doesn't include 0. Then at T=34: [25,48] -> no. So freeway1 is safe for T>32.\n\nBut wait: the car moves to the right. So after T=32, the car has moved past 0. So freeway1 is safe for any T>32.\n\nFreeway2: two cars? Actually, the table says for freeway2: (24, -11, right, 36) -> but there's only one entry? The table says \"Cars\" and then one tuple? Similarly for freeway3 and 4.\n\nFreeway2: one car: head=24, tail=-11, direction=right, speed=36.\n  So τ = -11, h = 24, s=36.\n  At T: span = [ -11 + 36*(T-32), 24 + 36*(T-32) ]\n  Check if 0 is in the interval: \n      -11 + 36*(T-32) <= 0 <= 24 + 36*(T-32)\n  The left inequality: 36*(T-32) <= 11 -> T-32 <= 11/36 < 1 -> T<=32 (since T integer) -> only T=32? \n  But at T=32: [ -11, 24] -> 0 is included? yes.\n\n  So freeway2 at T=32: car present at 0. But we are not on freeway2 at T=32. For T>32, the car moves right: \n      T=33: [ -11+36, 24+36] = [25,60] -> doesn't include 0.\n      T=34: [25+36, 60+36] = [61,96] -> no.\n\n  So freeway2 is safe for T>32.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3 and 4: same as freeway2? \n  freeway3: (24, -11, right, 36) -> same as freeway2: safe for T>32.\n  freeway4: (24, -11, right, 36) -> same.\n\nFreeway5: three cars: \n  (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nLet's check each:\n\nCar1: head=60, tail=49, right, speed=6 -> τ=49, h=60? \n  But wait: the representation is (head, tail) and for right-moving the span is [tail, head]? \n  So at t1=32: [49,60] -> then at T: [49+6*(T-32), 60+6*(T-32)]\n  Check 0: \n      49+6*(T-32) <= 0 <= 60+6*(T-32)\n      The left: 49+6*(T-32) <=0 -> 6*(T-32) <= -49 -> T-32 <= -49/6 ≈ -8.16 -> T <= 32-8.16 -> T<=23.8 -> never for T>=32.\n  So this car never covers 0.\n\nCar2: (24,13,right,6): τ=13, h=24 -> [13,24] at T=32.\n  At T: [13+6*(T-32), 24+6*(T-32)]\n  Check 0: \n      13+6*(T-32) <=0 -> 6*(T-32) <= -13 -> T-32 <= -13/6 ≈ -2.16 -> T<=29.8 -> never for T>=32.\n  So safe.\n\nCar3: (-12,-23,right,6): τ=-23, h=-12 -> at T=32: [-23,-12]\n  At T: [-23+6*(T-32), -12+6*(T-32)]\n  Check 0: \n      -23+6*(T-32) <=0<=-12+6*(T-32)\n      Right inequality: 0<=-12+6*(T-32) -> 6*(T-32)>=12 -> T-32>=2 -> T>=34.\n      Left inequality: -23+6*(T-32)<=0 -> 6*(T-32)<=23 -> T-32<=23/6≈3.83 -> T<=35.83 -> so T=34,35.\n\n  So at T=34: \n      span = [-23+6*2, -12+6*2] = [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> includes 0? yes, because 0 is the right endpoint? \n      Actually: the interval is [-11,0] -> 0 is included.\n\n  T=35: [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6] -> includes 0.\n\n  T=36: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> doesn't include 0.\n\n  So freeway5 is dangerous at T=34 and T=35.\n\nFreeway6: same cars as freeway5? \n  The table: (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6) -> same as freeway5? \n  So freeway6 is dangerous at T=34 and T=35.\n\nFreeway7: (-48,-59,right,12): τ=-59, h=-48 -> at T=32: [-59,-48]\n  At T: [-59+12*(T-32), -48+12*(T-32)]\n  Check 0: \n      -59+12*(T-32) <=0<=-48+12*(T-32)\n      Right: 0<=-48+12*(T-32) -> 12*(T-32)>=48 -> T-32>=4 -> T>=36.\n      Left: -59+12*(T-32)<=0 -> 12*(T-32)<=59 -> T-32<=59/12≈4.916 -> T<=36.916 -> so T=36.\n\n  T=36: [-59+12*4, -48+12*4] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> includes 0? yes.\n\n  T=37: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> no.\n\n  So freeway7 is dangerous at T=36.\n\nFreeway8: (56,45,right,4): τ=45, h=56 -> at T=32: [45,56]\n  At T: [45+4*(T-32), 56+4*(T-32)]\n  Check 0: \n      45+4*(T-32) <=0 -> 4*(T-32)<=-45 -> T-32<=-45/4≈-11.25 -> never.\n  So safe.\n\nSummary of dangerous freeways at which turns:\n\nFreeway1: safe for T>=33? Actually, we saw at T=32 it was dangerous but we are not on row1 at T=32. So for T>=33, safe.\n\nFreeway2,3,4: safe for T>=33.\n\nFreeway5: dangerous at T=34,35.\nFreeway6: dangerous at T=34,35.\nFreeway7: dangerous at T=36.\nFreeway8: safe.\n\nWe now plan the moves:\n\nWe start at turn32 at row0 (safe). We want to get to row9.\n\nWe can move at most 1 per turn. So the minimal H is 9 (if we go straight up without stopping). But we must avoid dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\nOur path: we will be at row1 at turn33, row2 at turn34, ... row8 at turn40, row9 at turn41? \n\nWait: \n  turn32: row0 (start)\n  turn33: row1 (if we choose U at turn32)\n  turn34: row2\n  turn35: row3\n  turn36: row4\n  turn37: row5\n  turn38: row6\n  turn39: row7\n  turn40: row8\n  turn41: row9 -> then we stop? because at turn41 we are at row9.\n\nBut note: we require that at the last action we have reached row9. The sequence of actions: we take H actions. After H actions, we are at row9 at turn32+H.\n\nWe are at turn32: we take an action at turn32, then at turn33 we are at row (0 + action). Then at turn33 we take action a33, and so on until we are at row9.\n\nWe require that at each turn T from 32 to 32+H-1, we are safe: meaning if we are at row y_T (at turn T) and y_T is between 1 and 8, then the freeway y_T must not have a car at x=0 at turn T.\n\nBut note: at the last turn (turn32+H-1) we are at row9, which is safe.\n\nSo in the straight up plan:\n\n  Turn32: U -> at turn33: row1 -> check row1 at turn33: safe? (freeway1: safe for T>=33 -> yes)\n  Turn33: U -> at turn34: row2 -> freeway2: safe for T>=33 -> yes (since T=34>=33, safe)\n  Turn34: U -> at turn35: row3 -> freeway3: safe (T=35>=33 -> safe)\n  Turn35: U -> at turn36: row4 -> freeway4: safe (T=36>=33 -> safe)\n  Turn36: U -> at turn37: row5 -> freeway5: dangerous at T=34,35 -> but T=37 is safe? yes, because at T=37 the car on freeway5 is at [ -23+6*(37-32), -12+6*(37-32) ] = [ -23+30, -12+30] = [7,18] -> doesn't include 0. So safe.\n  Turn37: U -> at turn38: row6 -> freeway6: similarly, at T=38: the car that was dangerous at 34,35: [ -23+6*(38-32), -12+6*6] = [ -23+36, -12+36] = [13,24] -> safe.\n  Turn38: U -> at turn39: row7 -> freeway7: dangerous at T=36? but T=39: \n        freeway7 car: [-59+12*(39-32), -48+12*7] = [-59+84, -48+84] = [25,36] -> safe.\n  Turn39: U -> at turn40: row8 -> freeway8: safe (always)\n  Turn40: U -> at turn41: row9 -> safe.\n\nSo the straight up plan: \n  Actions: U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U (9 actions) and we reach row9 at turn41.\n\nBut wait: we have to check each turn we are on the freeway:\n\n  We are on row1 at turn33: freeway1 is safe? yes.\n  row2 at turn34: freeway2 safe? yes (for T>=33, safe).\n  row3 at turn35: freeway3 safe? yes.\n  row4 at turn36: freeway4 safe? yes.\n  row5 at turn37: freeway5: at T=37 -> safe? we computed [7,18] -> yes.\n  row6 at turn38: freeway6: [13,24] -> safe.\n  row7 at turn39: freeway7: [25,36] -> safe.\n  row8 at turn40: freeway8: safe.\n\nSo it seems we can go straight up without stopping.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway5 and 6 at T=34 and 35? We are not on freeway5 or 6 at those turns? \n  At T=34: we are on row2 -> freeway2 -> safe.\n  At T=35: we are on row3 -> freeway3 -> safe.\n\nSo we are avoiding the dangerous times on freeway5 and 6 by not being there at T=34 and 35.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7 at T=36: we are on row4 at T=36 -> freeway4 -> safe, and row7 at T=39 -> freeway7 is safe then.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9.\n\nBut let me double-check the freeway5 and 6: \n  freeway5: dangerous at T=34,35 -> but we are at row5 at T=37 -> safe.\n\nSo the plan:\n\nTurn32: U -> goes to row1 at turn33.\nTurn33: U -> row2 at turn34.\nTurn34: U -> row3 at turn35.\nTurn35: U -> row4 at turn36.\nTurn36: U -> row5 at turn37.\nTurn37: U -> row6 at turn38.\nTurn38: U -> row7 at turn39.\nTurn39: U -> row8 at turn40.\nTurn40: U -> row9 at turn41.\n\nBut note: at turn40 we are at row8. Then we take U and at turn41 we are at row9. Then we stop? The problem says: we need to be at row9 at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThe sequence of actions: we take H actions. The actions are from t1 (32) to t1+H-1 (32+H-1). Then the turn at which we are at row9 is at the end of the last action, i.e., turn32+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\" meaning that after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at (0,9) at the beginning of the next turn? Actually:\n\n  We start turn32 at row0.\n  Action a32 (at turn32) -> then at turn33 we are at row1? Actually, the position update: \n      y_{33} = y_{32} + Δy_{32}\n\n  So after the first action (at turn32), we are at row (0 + Δy32) at the beginning of turn33.\n\n  Similarly, after the last action (at turn32+H-1), we are at row9 at the beginning of turn32+H.\n\n  But the problem requires that we are at (0,9) at the turn after the last action? Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at the end of the sequence. \n\n  The problem: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... to reach (0,9)\" and then the answer format lists actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... until the last action.\n\n  We are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn32+H. So the last action is taken at turn32+H-1, and that action moves us to row9 at turn32+H.\n\n  Therefore, we have taken H actions and we are at row9 at turn32+H.\n\n  The minimal H is 9? because we need 9 moves upward.\n\nBut note: we start at row0. We need to get to row9: that's 9 steps up. So 9 actions.\n\nHowever, we must check that we are safe at every intermediate turn.\n\nWe are safe at:\n  turn32: row0 -> safe.\n  turn33: row1 -> safe (freeway1: T=33 -> [ -23+24, 0+24] = [1,24] -> no 0 -> safe)\n  turn34: row2 -> freeway2: T=34 -> [ -11+36*(34-32)= -11+72=61, 24+72=96] -> [61,96] -> no 0 -> safe.\n  turn35: row3 -> freeway3: same as freeway2? [ -11+36*3 = -11+108=97, 24+108=132] -> safe.\n  turn36: row4 -> freeway4: same -> safe.\n  turn37: row5 -> freeway5: we computed [7,18] -> safe.\n  turn38: row6 -> freeway6: [13,24] -> safe.\n  turn39: row7 -> freeway7: T=39: we computed [25,36] -> safe.\n  turn40: row8 -> freeway8: safe.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 9 actions: all U.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". What is H? The number of turns? Actually, the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence is for t=0 to H-1. So H is the number of actions.\n\nWe have H=9.\n\nOutput:\n\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\n\nBut note: the last action is at turn40 (which is t1+8) because t1=32, so t1+0=32, t1+1=33, ... t1+8=40. Then we have 9 actions.\n\nBut the problem says: sequence {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} with H=9, so t from 0 to 8.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 32: a_{32} = U\nTurn 33: a_{33} = U\n...\nTurn 40: a_{40} = U\n\nBut wait: at turn40, we take U and then at turn41 we are at row9. So the sequence ends at turn40.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\n}\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in less? 9 is the minimum because we have to cover 9 rows. So it's minimal.\n\nHowever, what if we try to go faster? We can't: we can only move at most 1 per turn.\n\nAlternatively, we might have to wait? But in this case, we don't need to.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway5 and 6? They are dangerous at T=34,35. In the straight up plan, we are at row5 at T=37 (which is safe) and row6 at T=38 (safe). And we are never at row5 or 6 at T=34,35. So it's safe.\n\nTherefore, the above plan is valid and minimal.\n\nNote: The problem states that the player can also choose D or S.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 33, and the player is at (0,1). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nImportant: The collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) and at that turn T, the x-coordinate 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nNote: When the player moves, they are considered to be on the freeway of their current y at the beginning of the turn. Then they choose an action (U, D, S) and move to the next y at the next turn.\n\nSpecifically, at turn T:\n- The player is at y_T (which is the row we are on at the start of turn T).\n- Then we choose an action. If we choose U, then at turn T+1 we will be at y_T+1. Similarly for D and S.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, we are on freeway y_T. We check if at turn T, any car on freeway y_T has a span that includes 0.\n\nBut note: if we move to a new row at the next turn, we are not on that new row until the next turn. So at turn T, we are only on row y_T.\n\nWe start at turn 33 at y=1.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. Note that the grid has y from 0 to 9. The freeways are from y=1 to y=8. The goal is (0,9). Since the goal is at y=9, which is above the freeways, we don't have to worry about cars at y=9.\n\nHowever, note that we start at y=1 and we need to go through rows 2,3,...,8 to get to 9.\n\nWe must avoid the cars on rows 1 to 8 at the exact turn when we are on that row.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1=33. For future turns, we can compute the car positions using the update rules.\n\nLet me denote:\n- For a car on a freeway k (which is the row number) at turn t1=33: \n   - If it's right-moving: the span at turn T (T>=33) is [tau + s*(T-33), h + s*(T-33)]\n   - If it's left-moving: [h - s*(T-33), tau - s*(T-33)]\n\nBut note: the given cars are for each freeway. We have:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h=24, tau=1, d=right, s=24) -> right-moving, so at turn T: [1 + 24*(T-33), 24 + 24*(T-33)]\n\nFreeway 2: (h=60, tau=25, d=right, s=36) -> [25 + 36*(T-33), 60 + 36*(T-33)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? Actually, the table says for freeway 3: same as freeway 2? But let me check:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n| 1 | (24,1,right,24) |\n| 2 | (60,25,right,36) |\n| 3 | (60,25,right,36) |   -> same as freeway 2?\n| 4 | (60,25,right,36) |   -> same?\n| 5 | three cars: (-48,-59,right,6), (30,19,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6)\n| 6 | same three cars as freeway 5?\n| 7 | (-36,-47,right,12)\n| 8 | (60,49,right,4)\n\nWait, freeway 5 and 6 have three cars each? And freeway 1,2,3,4,7,8 have one each? But freeways 2,3,4 have the same car? Actually, no, they are independent. Each freeway has its own set of cars.\n\nSo for freeway 5: three cars: \ncar1: (-48, -59, right, 6) -> because right-moving: [tau + s*(T-33), h + s*(T-33)] = [-59+6*(T-33), -48+6*(T-33)]\ncar2: (30,19,right,6) -> [19+6*(T-33), 30+6*(T-33)]\ncar3: (-6,-17,right,6) -> [-17+6*(T-33), -6+6*(T-33)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6: same three cars? Actually, the table says the same for freeway 6. So same three cars on freeway 6? But note: the freeway is different, so we have to consider each freeway independently.\n\nSo for freeway 5: we have three cars, and we must avoid if 0 is in any of the three spans at the turn when we are on freeway 5.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn 33 at y=1. So at turn 33, we are on freeway 1. We must check if at turn 33, freeway 1 has a car that covers x=0.\n\nFor freeway 1 at turn 33 (T=33): \n  [1 + 24*(0), 24 + 24*(0)] = [1,24] -> 0 is not in [1,24]. So safe.\n\nBut note: the car is moving right. The head is 24, tail is 1? Actually, the representation: for a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost? But the update rule for right-moving: \n  initial span: [tau, h] -> so at T=33: [1,24] (since tau=1, h=24). Then at T, it becomes [1 + 24*(T-33), 24 + 24*(T-33)].\n\nSo at T=33: [1,24] -> 0 is not in [1,24]. So safe.\n\nNow, we are at y=1 at turn 33. We can choose an action: U (to go to y=2 at turn 34), D (to go to y=0 at turn 34), or S (stay at y=1 at turn 34).\n\nBut note: the goal is at y=9. We are at y=1. We need to go up. So going down to y=0 is not helpful. However, we might have to wait sometimes? But we want minimal turns.\n\nThe minimal number of moves: we need to go from y=1 to y=9, which is 8 steps upward. But we might have to wait (by using S or even D) to avoid cars? So the minimal H might be more than 8.\n\nWe are going to simulate the next turns and check for collisions.\n\nWe need to plan a path: a sequence of actions (each U, D, S) that moves from y=1 to y=9 without being hit by a car on the freeway we are on at each turn.\n\nWe are at turn 33: y=1.\n\nWe are going to consider turns starting at 33 and then 34, 35, ... until we reach y=9.\n\nWe have to compute for each freeway k and for each turn T (>=33) the set of x-coordinates that are occupied by cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nBut we are only concerned when we are on that freeway at that turn.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway (1 to 8) and for the turns we might be there, whether the car spans include 0.\n\nBut note: the player can only change row by one per turn (or stay). So we can do a BFS over states: (turn, y) and we want to minimize the number of turns.\n\nThe state: (turn, y). The turn starts at 33 and we go to 34, 35, ... until we get to y=9.\n\nBut note: the turn index increases, and the car positions change over time.\n\nWe can compute the car positions for each freeway at a given turn T.\n\nWe'll define a function is_safe(y, T): returns True if at turn T, when the player is on row y, then there is no car on row y that covers x=0.\n\nNote: if y=0 or y=9, there are no cars (freeways are 1-8). So they are always safe.\n\nBut note: at the start of the turn, if we are at y=0, we are safe. Similarly, at y=9, we are safe.\n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9) at the last turn. So when we are at y=9, we are done.\n\nNow, let's compute the car spans for each freeway at a given turn T.\n\nFreeway 1: one car (right-moving): [1 + 24*(T-33), 24 + 24*(T-33)]\nWe need 0 in [A, B]? Then A <= 0 <= B.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet me compute for freeway 1: \n   A1 = 1 + 24*(T-33)\n   B1 = 24 + 24*(T-33) = 24*(T-32)   [because 24 + 24*(T-33) = 24*(1 + T-33) = 24*(T-32)]\n\nBut we can leave in terms of (T-33).\n\nWe have to avoid 0 being in [A1, B1]. So we avoid when:\n   A1 <= 0 <= B1.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nLet me write for each freeway the intervals for a given T:\n\nFreeway 1 (k=1):\n   car1: [1+24*(T-33), 24+24*(T-33)]\n\nFreeway 2 (k=2):\n   car1: [25+36*(T-33), 60+36*(T-33)]\n\nFreeway 3 (k=3): same as freeway 2? \n   car1: [25+36*(T-33), 60+36*(T-33)]\n\nFreeway 4 (k=4): same.\n\nFreeway 5 (k=5): three cars:\n   car1: [-59+6*(T-33), -48+6*(T-33)]\n   car2: [19+6*(T-33), 30+6*(T-33)]\n   car3: [-17+6*(T-33), -6+6*(T-33)]\n\nFreeway 6 (k=6): same three cars as freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 7 (k=7):\n   car1: [-47+12*(T-33), -36+12*(T-33)]   # because right-moving: [tau, h] = [-47, -36]? \n   But wait: the input for freeway 7: (-36, -47, right, 12). \n   How to interpret? The head is -36, tail is -47? And direction right. \n   For right-moving: the update is [tau + s*(T-33), h + s*(T-33)]? \n   But note the representation: the initial span at t1 is [tau, h]? \n   However, the problem says: for a right-moving car, the initial span is [tau, h] and then becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\n   So here, tau = -47, h = -36? \n   Then at T: [ -47 + 12*(T-33), -36 + 12*(T-33) ]\n\nFreeway 8 (k=8):\n   (60,49,right,4) -> [49+4*(T-33), 60+4*(T-33)]\n\nNow, we can check for a given (y, T) whether it is safe.\n\nBut note: the player's path: we start at (turn=33, y=1). We can choose actions: U, D, S.\n\nWe want to reach (turn=?, y=9) as quickly as possible.\n\nWe can do a BFS in terms of (turn, y). The turn starts at 33 and increases. The y from 0 to 9.\n\nWe'll let the state be (t, y) and we try to see if we can get to y=9 without being in an unsafe state at any turn.\n\nWe start at (33,1) and we know that at turn 33, freeway 1 is safe (as computed above: [1,24] at T=33, 0 not in [1,24]).\n\nThen we consider next actions: U, D, S.\n\nBut note: if we go D, we go to y=0 at turn 34. Then from y=0 we can only go U (to y=1) or S (stay at y=0). We don't want to go down because we need to go to 9. So we avoid going to y=0 if possible.\n\nWe want the minimal H. So we prefer going up as much as possible.\n\nBut we might have to wait or even go down to avoid a car.\n\nWe'll do a BFS (with turn as time) and we'll mark the minimal turn at which we reach each state (t,y). Since we want minimal H, we can use Dijkstra? But the cost per step is 1, so BFS by time.\n\nWe'll simulate turn by turn.\n\nWe'll keep a queue: each element is (t, y) meaning at turn t we are at row y.\n\nWe start at (33,1).\n\nThen for each state, we consider the next actions: U, D, S -> leading to y_next = y+1, y-1, y (clamped to [0,9]).\n\nBut note: at the next turn, we are at the new y. And at the current turn, we are at the current y and we must check that the current y is safe at turn t.\n\nBut wait: the collision is checked at the turn we are on the freeway. So at state (t,y), we must check that at turn t, if y is between 1 and 8, then it is safe (i.e., no car on row y at turn t covers 0). If y=0 or y=9, then no check.\n\nThen, from (t,y), we choose an action that determines y_next. Then at turn t+1, we will be at y_next.\n\nBut note: the action is taken at turn t, and the move happens at the end of the turn? The update: at turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t. Then we are on row y_t for the entire turn t. Then we move to y_{t+1} at the beginning of turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, at state (t, y_t), we must check that at turn t, row y_t is safe (if y_t in [1,8]). Then we choose an action, which gives y_{t+1} (which must be in [0,9]). Then we go to (t+1, y_{t+1}).\n\nWe start at (33,1): check freeway 1 at turn 33: safe? yes.\n\nThen we can choose:\n  U: then at turn 34, we are at y=2.\n  D: then at turn 34, we are at y=0.\n  S: then at turn 34, we are at y=1.\n\nBut we want to go to 9, so we prefer U. But we have to check the safety at the next states.\n\nWe'll simulate until we get to y=9.\n\nWe'll keep a visited set: we don't need to visit the same (t,y) again because the turn is increasing and we are going forward. But note: we might go down and then up? So we might revisit the same y at a later turn. But we are doing BFS by time, so we will not visit the same (t,y) twice. We can mark (t,y) as visited.\n\nWe are interested in the minimal H. H is the number of turns from the start turn (t1=33) until the turn when we are at y=9.\n\nSo we start at turn 33, and we want to get to y=9 at some turn T. Then H = T - 33 + 1? \n\nWait: the sequence of actions: we take actions at turn t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. Then at the end of the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nSo the turn when we are at y=9 is t1+H-1.\n\nTherefore, we are looking for the smallest H such that at turn t = 33 + H - 1, we are at y=9.\n\nIn the BFS, we are tracking the state (t, y). We start at (33,1). Then we do steps until we get to a state (t,9). Then H = t - 33 + 1? \n\nBut note: at the start turn (33) we are at y=1. Then after H-1 actions (so after H-1 turns) we are at turn 33+H-1 and at y=9.\n\nSo the minimal H is the minimal number of steps to reach y=9 from y=1.\n\nWe'll simulate.\n\nWe'll do a BFS:\n\nLet dist[t][y] = minimal steps taken to reach (t,y) from (33,1). But we can do without a big array because the turns might be large? But note: we can compute the car positions and we know that we want minimal H, so we can break when we reach y=9.\n\nWe'll use a queue: (t, y, actions) but we care about the path. Alternatively, we can store the parent pointers.\n\nBut the problem asks for the sequence of actions.\n\nWe'll store for each state (t,y) the previous state and the action taken.\n\nWe start at (33,1) with no action.\n\nThen we expand to next states.\n\nWe'll do:\n\nqueue = deque([ (33, 1, []) ])   # (turn, y, path_so_far: list of actions from start to this state)\n\nBut the path_so_far would be the actions taken from turn 33 to turn t-1? Actually, at state (t,y), the path_so_far is the sequence of actions for turns 33 to t-1? \n\nBut we start at turn 33: we haven't taken any action yet. Then at turn 33, we choose an action that will determine the next state at turn 34.\n\nSo at state (33,1): we are at the start. Then we choose an action for turn 33, which will lead to state (34, y_next).\n\nSo we can store:\n\nWe start: (t=33, y=1, path=[])\n\nThen we generate next states for t=34:\n\n  action U: y_next = min(9, 1+1)=2 -> state (34,2, [U])\n  action D: y_next = max(0, 1-1)=0 -> state (34,0, [D])\n  action S: y_next = 1 -> state (34,1, [S])\n\nThen from each of these, we check safety at the current state (t,y) for the state we are leaving? But note: the safety check is for the state we are in at the beginning of the turn. So at (33,1): we must check freeway 1 at turn 33: which is safe.\n\nThen when we are at (34,2): we must check at turn 34, freeway 2? But note: at the beginning of turn 34, we are at y=2. So we check freeway 2 at turn 34.\n\nSimilarly, at (34,0): we are at y=0 -> safe.\nat (34,1): we check freeway 1 at turn 34.\n\nSo we must check the safety at (t, y) when we are at that state.\n\nWe do:\n\nwhile queue:\n   pop state (t, y, path)\n   if y==9: then we have the path and H = len(path) (because we have taken len(path) actions, and we are at turn t = 33 + len(path), and we are at y=9 at that turn).\n\nBut note: at the start we are at turn 33, then we take an action at turn 33 -> leads to turn 34. So after k actions, we are at turn 33+k.\n\nTherefore, if we have a path of k actions, then we are at turn 33+k and at y=9.\n\nSo when we are at state (t,y) and y==9, then H = k = t - 33, but note: we started at turn 33 and we have taken k actions, so we are at turn 33+k. Therefore, k = t - 33.\n\nBut then H = k? Actually, the problem says: the sequence of actions is from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}. So if we have k actions, then H = k? And the last action is taken at turn t1+k-1 = 33+k-1, and then at the next turn (33+k) we are at y=9.\n\nBut in our state (t,y) we are at the beginning of turn t. So if we are at (t,9), then we have already reached the goal at the beginning of turn t. We do not need to take an action at turn t? \n\nHowever, note the problem: we are to determine the minimal number of turns H and the sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1 such that we reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nBut in our model: at the beginning of turn t, we are at position (0, y). Then we choose an action a_t. Then at the beginning of turn t+1, we are at the next y.\n\nTherefore, we are at (0, y) at the beginning of turn t.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn T. Then we don't take an action at turn T? But the problem says: we take actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1, and then at the end of the last action we are at (0,9). \n\nSo the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then at the beginning of turn t1+H, we are at (0,9). But the problem says we reach at turn t1+H-1? \n\nLet me check: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nBut in our model: \n  turn t1: we are at y0 (here 1). Then we take action a_t1 -> then at turn t1+1, we are at y1.\n  ... \n  at turn t1+H-1: we take the last action a_{t1+H-1}. Then at turn t1+H, we are at y_{H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says: we reach at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThis is a discrepancy.\n\nLooking back: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}. Then it says \"to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nBut in our model, after taking the last action a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1, we are at the next turn (t1+H) at y=9.\n\nSo the problem must mean: at the end of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). But in our model, the position at the end of the turn is the same as at the beginning of the next turn? \n\nThe problem states: Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo at the end of turn t, we have computed y_{t+1}. Therefore, after taking action a_t at turn t, we are at y_{t+1} at the end of turn t.\n\nTherefore, at the end of turn t, we are at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at the end of turn t1+H-1.\n\nThat means: at the end of turn t1+H-1, we have y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut note: at the beginning of turn t1, we are at y_{t1}=1. Then we take action a_{t1} -> at the end of turn t1, we are at y_{t1+1}.\n\nSo to have y_{t1+H} = 9, we take actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. Then at the end of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nTherefore, in our state representation, we are at the beginning of the turn. So we start at (t1, y_{t1}=1). Then we take an action a_{t1} and then we are at the beginning of turn t1+1 at y_{t1+1}. \n\nWe want to be at y_{t1+H} = 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H? \n\nBut note: at the beginning of turn t1+H, we are at y_{t1+H}=9, and then we don't take an action? But the problem requires that we take H actions? \n\nActually, the problem says: we take actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and then at the end of the last action (which is at turn t1+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nBut at the end of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H}=9. And then at the beginning of turn t1+H, we are at y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nSo if we are at the beginning of turn t1+H and y=9, that means we achieved the goal at the end of turn t1+H-1.\n\nTherefore, in our BFS, we are looking for the state (t,9) where t = t1 + H. But we want H minimal. Since we start at t1, we are looking for the minimal t such that we are at (t,9) and we have a path from (t1,1) to (t,9) that is safe.\n\nThe number of actions is H = t - t1.\n\nBut note: we take one action per turn from t1 to t-1, so H actions? Actually, from turn t1 to turn t-1: that's t - t1 turns? So H = t - t1.\n\nThen the sequence of actions is for turns: t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1 = t-1.\n\nSo when we find a state (t,9), then H = t - t1.\n\nWe want minimal H, so minimal t.\n\nTherefore, we can do a BFS (by time) and the first time we reach (t,9) we break.\n\nNow, we need to compute for each state (t,y) we visit, whether it is safe.\n\nWe'll write a helper function safe(y, t) that returns True if at turn t, row y is safe (i.e., if y is 0 or 9, safe; if y in [1,8], then check that no car on freeway y at turn t has a span that contains 0).\n\nWe'll compute for each freeway the car spans at turn t.\n\nBut note: the cars on a freeway are given at t1=33. So we can compute for any t>=33.\n\nWe'll code the safe function:\n\ndef safe(y, t):\n    if y == 0 or y == 9:\n        return True\n    # for freeway y, get the cars\n    if y == 1:\n        # car: [1+24*(t-33), 24+24*(t-33)]\n        A = 1 + 24*(t-33)\n        B = 24 + 24*(t-33)\n        if A <= 0 <= B:\n            return False\n        else:\n            return True\n    elif y == 2 or y == 3 or y == 4:\n        # same for 2,3,4: [25+36*(t-33), 60+36*(t-33)]\n        A = 25 + 36*(t-33)\n        B = 60 + 36*(t-33)\n        if A <= 0 <= B:\n            return False\n        else:\n            return True\n    elif y == 5 or y == 6:\n        # three cars\n        # car1: [-59+6*(t-33), -48+6*(t-33)]\n        A1 = -59 + 6*(t-33)\n        B1 = -48 + 6*(t-33)\n        if A1 <= 0 <= B1:\n            return False\n        # car2: [19+6*(t-33), 30+6*(t-33)]\n        A2 = 19 + 6*(t-33)\n        B2 = 30 + 6*(t-33)\n        if A2 <= 0 <= B2:\n            return False\n        # car3: [-17+6*(t-33), -6+6*(t-33)]\n        A3 = -17 + 6*(t-33)\n        B3 = -6 + 6*(t-33)\n        if A3 <= 0 <= B3:\n            return False\n        return True\n    elif y == 7:\n        # car: [-47+12*(t-33), -36+12*(t-33)]\n        A = -47 + 12*(t-33)\n        B = -36 + 12*(t-33)\n        if A <= 0 <= B:\n            return False\n        else:\n            return True\n    elif y == 8:\n        # [49+4*(t-33), 60+4*(t-33)]\n        A = 49 + 4*(t-33)\n        B = 60 + 4*(t-33)\n        if A <= 0 <= B:\n            return False\n        else:\n            return True\n\nNow, we do BFS:\n\nfrom collections import deque\n\nstart_turn = 33\nstart_y = 1\n\n# We'll use a queue: (t, y, path) \n# We want to minimize t, so we do BFS by increasing t.\n\n# We mark visited states: (t,y) to avoid duplicates? But we might come to the same y at a later t? But we are doing BFS by t, so we will get to a state at the minimal t. However, if we go down and then up, we might come to the same y at a higher t. We don't want to revisit the same (t,y) twice, but we can have different t? \n\n# We can have multiple paths to (t,y). We want the minimal t? Actually, we are doing BFS in increasing t, so the first time we reach (t,9) we have the minimal t.\n\n# However, we might come to (t,y) by multiple paths, but we only need one path? And we want the minimal t.\n\n# But note: we might come to the same (t,y) by different paths?

We already checked that the current state (t,y) is safe. Then we generate the next state. The next state (t+1, next_y) will be checked when we pop it.\n\nBut the safety check for (t+1, next_y) is done when we pop it.\n\nNow, we run the BFS and we hope we find a path.\n\nBut note: the cars move and the freeways become unsafe at some times. We might have to wait.\n\nWe'll run and see.\n\nWe start at (33,1): safe -> as we computed.\n\nThen we expand to:\n\n  U: (34,2, ['U'])\n  D: (34,0, ['D'])\n  S: (34,1, ['S'])\n\nThen we check (34,2): we check freeway 2 at turn 34.\n\nFor freeway 2: \n   A = 25 + 36*(34-33) = 25+36 = 61\n   B = 60+36 = 96\n   0 in [61,96]? No -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, (34,0): safe (y=0)\n(34,1): freeway1 at turn 34: \n   A = 1+24*(1)=25\n   B = 24+24=48\n   0 not in [25,48] -> safe.\n\nThen from (34,2): we can go to:\n   U: (35,3, ['U','U'])\n   D: (35,1, ['U','D'])\n   S: (35,2, ['U','S'])\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nWe'll run until we get to y=9.\n\nBut note: we want minimal H, so minimal t. We are doing BFS by time, so the first time we get to y=9 we have minimal t.\n\nWe might get to y=9 at different t, and we break at the first.\n\nBut is there a path in 8 moves? We start at y=1, we need to go to y=9: that's 8 steps up. So we need at least 8 actions (all U). But we might have to wait sometimes? So H>=8.\n\nLet me check if we can do 8 consecutive U.\n\nWe start at (33,1). Then:\n\nturn 33: at y=1 -> safe.\n  action U -> to y=2 at turn34.\n\nturn34: at y=2 -> safe? freeway2 at turn34: [25+36=61, 60+36=96] -> safe.\n  action U -> to y=3 at turn35.\n\nturn35: at y=3 -> freeway3 at turn35: \n   A = 25+36*(35-33)=25+36*2=25+72=97\n   B = 60+72=132 -> safe.\n  action U -> to y=4 at turn36.\n\nturn36: at y=4 -> freeway4 at turn36:\n   A=25+36*(36-33)=25+36*3=25+108=133\n   B=60+108=168 -> safe.\n  action U -> to y=5 at turn37.\n\nturn37: at y=5 -> freeway5 at turn37: we check the three cars.\n\n   car1: [-59+6*(37-33)= -59+6*4=-59+24=-35, -48+24=-24] -> [-35,-24] -> 0 not in this.\n   car2: [19+24=43, 30+24=54] -> safe.\n   car3: [-17+24=7, -6+24=18] -> 0 not in [7,18] -> safe.\n\nSo safe? Actually, car3: [7,18] -> 0 not in there. So safe.\n\n  action U -> to y=6 at turn38.\n\nturn38: at y=6 -> freeway6 at turn38: same as freeway5 at turn37? \n   Actually, same car definitions? \n   car1: [-59+6*(38-33)= -59+6*5=-59+30=-29, -48+30=-18] -> safe.\n   car2: [19+30=49,30+30=60] -> safe.\n   car3: [-17+30=13, -6+30=24] -> safe.\n\n  action U -> to y=7 at turn39.\n\nturn39: at y=7 -> freeway7 at turn39:\n   A = -47+12*(39-33)= -47+12*6=-47+72=25\n   B = -36+72=36\n   So [25,36] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n  action U -> to y=8 at turn40.\n\nturn40: at y=8 -> freeway8 at turn40:\n   A = 49+4*(40-33)=49+4*7=49+28=77\n   B = 60+28=88 -> safe.\n\n  action U -> to y=9 at turn41.\n\nAt turn41, we are at y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo we have taken 8 actions: from turn33 to turn40: 8 actions.\n\nThe path: U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U\n\nBut wait: at turn33: we start at y=1, then we take U -> at turn34 we are at y=2.\n...\nat turn40: we are at y=8, take U -> at turn41 we are at y=9.\n\nSo the actions: \n  turn33: U\n  turn34: U\n  turn35: U\n  turn36: U\n  turn37: U\n  turn38: U\n  turn39: U\n  turn40: U\n\nThen at the end of turn40, we are at y=9? \n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9) at the end of turn t1+H-1 = 33+H-1.\n\nWe have H=8, so 33+8-1=40. So at the end of turn40, we are at y=9. Correct.\n\nBut we must check: during the entire path, we were safe at each turn?\n\nWe already checked:\n\nturn33: y=1: safe.\nturn34: y=2: safe.\nturn35: y=3: safe.\nturn36: y=4: safe.\nturn37: y=5: safe.\nturn38: y=6: safe.\nturn39: y=7: safe.\nturn40: y=8: safe.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 8, and the sequence is 8 U's.\n\nBut wait: is there a car on freeway5 at turn37 that we missed? \n\nAt turn37, freeway5: \n   car1: [-35, -24] -> no\n   car2: [43,54] -> no\n   car3: [7,18] -> no\n\nBut what about freeway5 at turn37: the car3: [7,18] -> that is positive, so 0 is not in there.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6 at turn38: same as freeway5 at turn37? Actually, no: at turn38, freeway6:\n\n   car1: [-59+6*(38-33)= -59+30=-29, -48+30=-18] -> [-29,-18] -> 0 not in.\n   car2: [19+30=49, 30+30=60] -> [49,60] -> no.\n   car3: [-17+30=13, -6+30=24] -> [13,24] -> no.\n\nSo safe.\n\nBut note: the problem says for freeway5 and 6: the same set of cars? But they are on different freeways. So we computed for freeway5 at turn37 and freeway6 at turn38 independently.\n\nSo the path is safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 8 U's.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=8.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\n\nBut wait, the last action is at turn40 (which is t1+7) and we have H=8, so the actions are from t1 to t1+7.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in less? We cannot because we need 8 steps up. So 8 is minimal.\n\nBut what if we go faster? We can only move one step at a time.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{33} = U\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{34} = U\n...\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\", and t1=33.\n\nBut the answer format: we write the turns as:\n\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\n...\nTurn 40: U\n\nBut the problem says: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and then \"Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\" etc.\n\nSo we write:\n\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\n\nBut wait, the last turn is t1+H-1 = 33+8-1=40, so we write up to Turn40.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence for t=0 to H-1, meaning we write H lines.\n\nSo 8 lines.\n\nBut note: the problem says: a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0: a_{33} = U\nt=1: a_{34} = U\n...\nt=7: a_{40} = U\n\nSo we write:\n\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\n...\nTurn 40: U\n\nBut the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and then \"Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\" ... until \"Turn t_1+H-1: a_{t_1+H-1}\".\n\nSo we write:\n\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\n\nBut wait, the last turn we write is Turn40? But the action at turn40 is the last one.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the boxed, we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\n}\n\nBut let me double-check freeway5 at turn37: \n   turn37: t-33 = 4\n   car3 on freeway5: [-17+6*4, -6+6*4] = [-17+24, -6+24] = [7,18] -> 0 not in.\n\nBut wait, what about car1? [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24] -> no.\n\ncar2: [19+24,30+24] = [43,54] -> no.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6 at turn38: \n   car1: [-59+6*5, -48+6*5] = [-59+30, -48+30] = [-29,-18] -> no.\n   car2: [19+30,30+30] = [49,60] -> no.\n   car3: [-17+30, -6+30] = [13,24] -> no.\n\nSo safe.\n\nBut what about freeway7 at turn39: \n   t-33=6\n   [-47+12*6, -36+12*6] = [-47+72, -36+72] = [25,36] -> 0 not in.\n\nfreeway8 at turn40: \n   [49+4*7, 60+4*7] = [49+28,60+28] = [77,88] -> safe.\n\nSo the path is safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 8 U's.\n\nBut the problem says: the initial position is (0,1) at turn33, and we are to avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. We did.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and we are at turn33, so we write \"Turn 33: U\", etc.\n\nBut the problem says the current turn is t1, and we write the actions for turns starting at t1.\n\nSo it's correct.\n\nHowever, what if we missed a car? \n\nOne more: freeway1 at turn33: [1,24] -> safe.\nfreeway2 at turn34: [25+36,60+36]=[61,96] -> safe.\nfreeway3 at turn35: [25+72,60+72]=[97,132] -> safe.\nfreeway4 at turn36: [25+108,60+108]=[133,168] -> safe.\n\nAll safe.\n\nSo we are confident.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach the position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 33\\) is 8. The sequence of actions consists of moving upward (U) at every turn from turn 33 to turn 40. This path avoids all collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) as verified by checking the car spans at each relevant turn:\n\n- **Turn 33 (y=1)**: Car on freeway 1 has span \\([1, 24]\\); 0 not in span → safe.\n- **Turn 34 (y=2)**: Car on freeway 2 has span \\([61, 96]\\); 0 not in span → safe.\n- **Turn 35 (y=3)**: Car on freeway 3 has span \\([97, 132]\\); 0 not in span → safe.\n- **Turn 36 (y=4)**: Car on freeway 4 has span \\([133, 168]\\); 0 not in span → safe.\n- **Turn 37 (y=5)**: Cars on freeway 5 have spans \\([-35, -24]\\), \\([43, 54]\\), \\([7, 18]\\); 0 not in any span → safe.\n- **Turn 38 (y=6)**: Cars on freeway 6 have spans \\([-29, -18]\\), \\([49, 60]\\), \\([13, 24]\\); 0 not in any span → safe.\n- **Turn 39 (y=7)**: Car on freeway 7 has span \\([25, 36]\\); 0 not in span → safe.\n- **Turn 40 (y=8)**: Car on freeway 8 has span \\([77, 88]\\); 0 not in span → safe.\n\nThe actions are as follows:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 33: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 34: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 35: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 36: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 37: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 38: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 39: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 40: & U \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 38, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The movement is only in the vertical direction (y-axis from 0 to 9). The collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8), then we check if there is a car on that freeway such that the car's span at turn T includes the x-coordinate 0 (since the player is at (0,y)).\n\nImportant note: when the player moves, at turn T, the action taken at T determines the position at T+1. Specifically, at the moment of turn T, the player is at y_T. Then, when the player chooses an action, they will be at y_{T+1} at the beginning of the next turn. Therefore, at turn T, the player is present on freeway y_T. If they move to a new freeway at turn T (by U or D), then at turn T they are still on the old freeway, and at turn T+1 they will be on the new one.\n\nThus, to avoid collision, we require that at every turn T from t1 (38) until the turn before reaching 9, the player's current freeway y_T must not have a car that covers x=0 at that exact turn T.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting at turn t1 (38) until the turn when we first reach y=9. Note that at the turn when we are at 9, we don't need to check freeway 9 because there are no cars above freeway 8 (and freeway 9 is not a freeway with cars; the cars are only on freeways 1 to 8). Also note that the starting position is (0,0) and we are at turn 38, so at turn 38 we are at y=0 (which is safe because cars are on freeways 1-8). We need to get to (0,9).\n\nWe must compute the positions of the cars at any future turn T (>=38) for each freeway.\n\nLet me denote:\n- For a car: (head, tail, direction, speed)\nBut note: for left-moving, the head is the rightmost? Actually, the update rule:\n- Left-moving: at turn t1, the car span is [h, τ] (so h is the right end, τ is the left end? because when moving left, the head (leading part) is at h and it moves left). But the update rule says:\n  - Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  This implies that at T, the car is from (τ - s*(T-t1)) to (h - s*(T-t1))? But note: if the car is moving left, then the entire car shifts left by s*(T-t1). So if at t1 the car spans [h, τ] (with h>τ? because typically we write [min, max])? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. This implies that h and τ are the positions at time t1, and then they both decrease. So the car is from τ to h (with τ <= h) and then moves left? That would be inconsistent because if the car moves left, the head (which is the front) should be the leftmost? \n\nWait, the problem states:\n- Left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" → becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\nBut note that if the car is moving left, then the head (which is the front) is the leftmost? Actually, the problem says for left-moving the head is at h and the tail at τ. But then the update: h becomes h - s*(T-t1) and τ becomes τ - s*(T-t1). This means that the entire segment shifts left. So the head (which was at h) is now at h - s*(T-t1). \n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: \n  Span(t1) = [τ, h] → becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\nSo the car moves right: the head (which is the front) was at h and becomes h + s*(T-t1).\n\nTherefore, the representation for a car at time t1 is:\n- For a left-moving car: the car occupies the interval [min(h,τ), max(h,τ)]? But wait, the problem writes [h, τ] for left-moving. However, if the car is moving left, then the head (front) is the leftmost? Actually, no: when moving left, the head (the front) is the one that is to the left? \n\nBut the update rule for left-moving: [h, τ] becomes [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt]. This implies that the car is moving left. However, the order in the interval [h, τ] might not necessarily be increasing. Actually, the problem does not specify that h>τ or τ>h. But note the example: for left-moving, the head is at h and the tail at τ. Typically, the head is the front. So if the car is moving left, then the head should be the leftmost? Then we would have h < τ? But then the interval [h, τ] would be from h to τ (which is increasing). However, the update rule: subtracting s*dt from both, so the entire car moves left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: [τ, h] becomes [τ+s*dt, h+s*dt]. And the head is at h (the front) which is the rightmost? Then we have τ < h? Then [τ, h] is increasing.\n\nSo we can assume:\n- For left-moving: h is the head (leftmost) and τ is the tail (rightmost), so the car spans [h, τ] (with h <= τ). Then moving left, the new head is h - s*dt and the new tail is τ - s*dt, so the new span is [h-s*dt, τ-s*dt] (which is still increasing? because subtracting the same amount doesn't change the order). But wait: if h <= τ, then h-s*dt <= τ-s*dt, so the interval remains [h-s*dt, τ-s*dt].\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: [τ, h] with τ<=h, then becomes [τ+s*dt, h+s*dt].\n\nBut looking at the data:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24) -> but if it's right-moving, then the representation should be [τ, h] with τ<=h? But here head=-48, tail=-71 -> so τ=-71, h=-48? Then the car spans [-71, -48]? Then at time t1=38, the car is from -71 to -48? But then moving right, the update: at time T, the car spans [-71 + 24*(T-38), -48 + 24*(T-38)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving? But we don't have any left-moving in the given data? The directions are all \"right\". So all cars are right-moving.\n\nTherefore, for each car, given as (head, tail, direction, speed) and direction is right, we have:\n  initial span at t1=38: [tail, head] -> [τ, h] = [tail, head] (so tail is the left end, head is the right end). Then at time T (>=38), the car spans: [τ + s*(T-38), head + s*(T-38)].\n\nBut wait: the data for freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24). \n  Is head=-48 and tail=-71? Then the car spans from tail to head: -71 to -48? That is a length of 23? And moving right at speed 24 per turn? That seems odd because the car is 23 units long and moves 24 per turn? But mathematically, that's what we have.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: three cars: \n  (48,37,right,6) -> wait: head=48, tail=37? Then the car spans [37,48] at t1=38? Then moving right at speed 6 per turn.\n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1)=[τ, h]\" and then becomes [τ+s*(T-t1), h+s*(T-t1)]. So the representation in the table: the first number is head, the second is tail? But the representation in the table is: (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nSo for freeway 5: first car: head=48, tail=37 -> so at t1=38, the car spans [37,48]. Then at time T, it spans [37+6*(T-38), 48+6*(T-38)].\n\nBut wait: 37>48? No, 37<48. So the car is from 37 to 48.\n\nSimilarly, the second car: (12,1,right,6): from 1 to 12.\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,6): from -35 to -24.\n\nNow, the collision condition: at a turn T, if the player is on freeway k (for k in {1,...,8}), then we check if there is a car on freeway k such that the car's span at T includes 0. That is, if for a car [a,b] (with a<=b) we have a <= 0 <= b.\n\nSo we need to compute, for each freeway k and for each car on k, the interval [a_T, b_T] = [τ + s*(T-38), head + s*(T-38)] and check if 0 is in [a_T, b_T].\n\nWe are to find a sequence of actions (U, D, S) that moves the player from y=0 at turn 38 to y=9 as quickly as possible, avoiding any collision on freeways 1-8.\n\nSince we start at y=0 (which is safe) and we need to get to y=9, we must move upward. The minimal number of moves would be 9 moves of \"U\", but we have to avoid the freeways at the turns when we are on them.\n\nThe player must pass through freeways 1 to 8. However, we can also move down? But moving down from 0 is not possible (since y>=0). So from 0 we can only go to 0 (S) or to 1 (U). Similarly, at 9 we stop.\n\nBut note: we can also stay and wait. So we might have to wait at a safe freeway (like 0 or 9) until a freeway becomes safe.\n\nHowever, we start at 0 and must end at 9. We cannot stay at 0 forever because we have to get to 9. Similarly, we can use freeway 0 as a safe haven because there are no cars at y=0.\n\nBut the problem: at turn T, we are on freeway y_T. We only check freeway y_T at that turn. So if we are at y=0, we are safe (because no cars on freeway 0). Similarly, when we reach y=9, we are done and we don't check freeway 9 (since there are no cars).\n\nSo we can plan:\n\nWe have to be on freeways 1 to 8 at some turns. We can choose the timing by staying at a safe y (0 or 9) or by moving up and down to adjust the timing.\n\nBut note: we can also stay on a freeway that is safe at that turn? However, freeways 1-8 have cars moving, so they might become safe at certain times.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway k and for each turn T>=38, whether the freeway k is safe at turn T (i.e., no car on freeway k at turn T covers x=0).\n\nWe are going to compute the safety of each freeway at each turn. Since the cars move continuously (in integer steps per turn), and the positions are linear functions of T, we can compute the intervals of T when freeway k is safe.\n\nBut note: for each car, the condition for collision on freeway k at turn T is: \n  There exists a car on freeway k such that: \n      a_T <= 0 <= b_T\n  <=> τ + s*(T-38) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-38)\n\nBut note: the car is defined by (head, tail, direction, speed) and direction is right for all, so we have:\n  [a_T, b_T] = [tail + s*(T-38), head + s*(T-38)]\n\nSo the condition for a car to cover 0 at turn T is:\n  tail + s*(T-38) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-38)\n\nBut note: because tail <= head (as we understood from the representation), we can solve:\n\n  tail + s*(T-38) <= 0   and   head + s*(T-38) >= 0\n\nSo:\n  T >= 38 + ceil( (-tail) / s )   ??? Actually, we have:\n\n  tail + s*(T-38) <= 0   =>   s*(T-38) <= -tail   =>   T-38 <= (-tail)/s   =>   T <= 38 + (-tail)/s   ??? Wait: if tail is negative, then -tail is positive.\n\nBut actually, we have:\n\n  tail + s*(T-38) <= 0   =>   T-38 <= (-tail)/s   =>   T <= 38 + (-tail)/s   [if s>0]\n\nSimilarly, the other inequality:\n\n  head + s*(T-38) >= 0   =>   s*(T-38) >= -head   =>   T-38 >= (-head)/s   =>   T >= 38 + ceil( (-head)/s )? Actually, we are in integers? T is integer, so we can use inequalities.\n\nBut note: the condition is for a fixed T (integer). We can compute for each car the interval of T (if any) for which the car covers 0.\n\nHowever, we have multiple cars per freeway (like freeway 5 has 3 cars). So freeway k is unsafe at turn T if at least one car on k covers 0 at T.\n\nWe are going to precompute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each turn T (starting from 38) whether it is safe.\n\nBut note: T can be large? We are to minimize H (the number of turns). The minimal H is 9 (if we go straight up). But we might have to wait. So we need to check for T from 38 to, say, 38+100? But let's see the car speeds and positions.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars:\n\nFreeway 1: (head=-48, tail=-71, s=24, right)\n  Condition: \n    tail + s*(T-38) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-38)\n    => -71 + 24*(T-38) <= 0 <= -48 + 24*(T-38)\n\n  Solve:\n    -71 + 24*(T-38) <= 0  => 24*(T-38) <= 71  => T-38 <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958 => T <= 40 (since T integer)\n    and \n    -48 + 24*(T-38) >=0 => 24*(T-38) >=48 => T-38>=2 => T>=40.\n\n  So both conditions: T>=40 and T<=40? So only at T=40? \n    At T=40: \n        tail + s*(40-38) = -71 + 24*2 = -71+48 = -23 <=0\n        head + s*(40-38) = -48+48 = 0 <=0? -> but 0 is included? yes: [a,b] = [-23,0] -> 0 is the right end.\n    So at T=40, the car covers 0.\n\n  Therefore, freeway 1 is unsafe only at T=40? \n\nFreeway 2: (head=-48, tail=-83, s=36, right)\n  Condition:\n    -83 + 36*(T-38) <= 0 <= -48 + 36*(T-38)\n  Solve:\n    -83 + 36*(T-38) <=0 => 36*(T-38)<=83 => T-38<=83/36≈2.305 => T<=40\n    -48+36*(T-38)>=0 => 36*(T-38)>=48 => T-38>=48/36=1.333 => T>=40 (since T integer, T>=40? actually, 39: 36*(1)=36 -> -48+36=-12<0 -> so T>=40: 36*2=72 -> -48+72=24>=0)\n  So T must be >=40 and <=40 -> T=40.\n\n  At T=40: \n      tail: -83+36*2 = -83+72 = -11 <=0\n      head: -48+72=24>=0 -> so 0 is in [-11,24] -> unsafe.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway2? (head=-48, tail=-83, s=36) -> so also unsafe only at T=40.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway2 -> unsafe at T=40.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars.\n\n  Car1: (head=48, tail=37, s=6)\n      Condition: 37+6*(T-38) <=0<=48+6*(T-38)\n      But 37+6*(T-38) is at least 37 (when T=38) and increasing, so 37>0 -> the first inequality fails for any T>=38. So this car never covers 0.\n\n  Car2: (head=12, tail=1, s=6)\n      Condition: 1+6*(T-38) <=0<=12+6*(T-38)\n      The first inequality: 1+6*(T-38) <=0 -> 6*(T-38) <=-1 -> which is impossible because T>=38 -> nonnegative. So never covers 0.\n\n  Car3: (head=-24, tail=-35, s=6)\n      Condition: -35+6*(T-38)<=0<=-24+6*(T-38)\n      First: -35+6*(T-38)<=0 -> 6*(T-38)<=35 -> T-38<=35/6≈5.833 -> T<=43\n      Second: -24+6*(T-38)>=0 -> 6*(T-38)>=24 -> T-38>=4 -> T>=42\n      So T in [42,43] (both inclusive).\n\n      At T=42: \n          tail: -35+6*4 = -35+24 = -11 <=0\n          head: -24+24=0 -> 0 is included? [a,b]=[-11,0] -> 0 is included? yes (at the right end).\n      At T=43:\n          tail: -35+6*5 = -35+30 = -5 <=0\n          head: -24+30=6>=0 -> 0 is in [-5,6] -> yes.\n\n  So freeway5 is unsafe at T=42 and 43.\n\nFreeway6: same as freeway5? \n  Cars: (48,37,6), (12,1,6), (-24,-35,6) -> same as freeway5? \n  Then unsafe at T=42 and 43.\n\nFreeway7: (head=48, tail=37, s=12) \n  Condition: 37+12*(T-38) <=0<=48+12*(T-38)\n  Again, 37+12*(T-38)>=37>0 -> never unsafe.\n\nFreeway8: (head=48, tail=37, s=4)\n  Similarly: 37+4*(T-38)>=37>0 -> never unsafe.\n\nSo summary of unsafe freeways and turns:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at T=40\nFreeway 2: unsafe at T=40\nFreeway 3: unsafe at T=40\nFreeway 4: unsafe at T=40\nFreeway 5: unsafe at T=42,43\nFreeway 6: unsafe at T=42,43\nFreeway 7: always safe\nFreeway 8: always safe\n\nNow, we have to traverse from y=0 (at turn38) to y=9. We can do:\n\nAt turn38: we are at y=0 (safe). We can choose:\n  S: stay at 0 -> then at turn39: still at 0 (safe)\n  U: move to 1 at turn39? But at turn38: we are at 0, then we move to 1 at turn39? So at turn39 we are at y=1.\n\nBut note: at turn T, the freeway we are on is y_T. So at turn38: y=0 -> safe.\nAt turn39: if we moved up at turn38, then y39=1 -> so we are on freeway1 at turn39 -> which is safe? because freeway1 is only unsafe at T=40. So safe at T=39.\n\nSimilarly, we can plan:\n\nWe want to avoid being on freeways 1-4 at T=40, and freeways 5-6 at T=42,43.\n\nThe minimal path: we have to go from 0 to 9. The minimal number of moves is 9 moves (if we go up every turn). Then we would be:\n\nTurn38: y=0 -> safe\nTurn39: y=1 -> safe? because freeway1 unsafe only at T=40 -> so at T=39, freeway1 is safe.\nTurn40: y=2 -> but at turn40, if we are on freeway2 -> unsafe! because freeway2 is unsafe at T=40.\n\nSo we cannot be on freeway2 at turn40.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot be on freeway1,2,3,4 at turn40.\n\nBut note: if we go up at turn38 and turn39, then at turn39 we are at y=1, and at turn40 we are at y=2 (if we go up again). So we are on freeway2 at turn40 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeways 1,2,3,4 at turn40.\n\nHow? We can either:\n  Option1: Be at a freeway that is safe at turn40: that is freeways 0,5,6,7,8,9? But note at turn40 we are at y40. We can be at y=0? Then we didn't move. Or we can be at y>=5? But we start at 0 and we are moving up: by turn40 (which is 2 turns after start) we can be at y=0,1, or 2? So we cannot be at y>=5.\n\nAlternatively, we can delay our movement: \n  Stay at 0 for one or more turns.\n\nBut we also have to avoid freeways 5 and 6 at turns 42 and 43.\n\nLet me denote the state: at turn T, we are at y.\n\nWe are to find a sequence of actions (U, D, S) from T=38 to T=... until we reach y=9.\n\nWe can do BFS? Since the grid is small (y from 0 to 9) and time we are concerned about is limited (because the unsafe events are at T=40,42,43 and then after that all freeways are safe). So we can simulate from T=38 until we get to 9.\n\nWe note that beyond T=43, all freeways are safe (because only freeways5 and6 are unsafe at 42,43; and freeways1-4 only at 40). So after T=43, we can go up freely.\n\nBut we might be able to get to 9 before T=43? But we start at 0 at T=38. The minimal steps: 9 moves of U, so we would be at 9 at T=47? \n\nWait: \n  T=38: y=0\n  T=39: U -> y=1\n  T=40: U -> y=2 -> unsafe? because at T=40 we are at freeway2 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must avoid that.\n\nWe can do:\n\nAt T=38: S -> stay at 0. Then T=39: at 0.\nAt T=39: U -> then at T=40: we are at y=1 -> freeway1 at T=40 -> unsafe! (freeway1 is unsafe at T=40)\n\nAlternatively, at T=38: U -> to 1 at T=39.\nAt T=39: S -> stay at 1 -> then T=40: at 1 -> freeway1 -> unsafe.\n\nAt T=38: U -> to 1 at T=39.\nAt T=39: D -> to 0 at T=40 -> then at T=40: at freeway0 -> safe.\n\nThen at T=40: we are at 0. Then we can start moving up.\n\nBut we also have to avoid freeways5 and6 at T=42 and T=43.\n\nNow, from T=40 (at y=0) we want to go up.\n\nIf we go up as fast as possible:\n\n  T=40: y=0 -> safe (freeway0)\n  T=41: U -> y=1 -> freeway1: safe? because freeway1 unsafe only at T=40 -> so at T=41, freeway1 is safe.\n  T=42: U -> y=2 -> freeway2: safe? because freeway2 unsafe only at T=40 -> safe at T=42.\n  T=43: U -> y=3 -> freeway3: safe? because freeway3 unsafe only at T=40 -> safe.\n  T=44: U -> y=4 -> freeway4: safe? same reason.\n  T=45: U -> y=5 -> freeway5: at T=45: safe? because freeway5 unsafe at 42,43 -> safe at 45.\n  T=46: U -> y=6 -> freeway6: unsafe? at T=46: freeway6 is safe? because unsafe at 42,43 -> so safe at 46.\n  T=47: U -> y=7 -> freeway7: safe (always)\n  T=48: U -> y=8 -> freeway8: safe (always)\n  T=49: U -> y=9 -> done.\n\nSo total turns: from T=38 to T=49 -> 12 turns? But we started at T=38 and we did 12 actions? Actually, the number of actions H: we start at T=38 and do actions at T=38,39,...,48 (11 actions) to get to y=9 at T=49? \n\nBut note: at T=38: we start at 0. Then we do an action at T=38: we did U? Then at T=39: we are at 1. Then we did D at T=39: so at T=40: at 0. Then from T=40 to T=49: we do 9 U's? \n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n  T=38: start at 0, action: U -> then at T=39: y=1.\n  T=39: action: D -> then at T=40: y=0.\n  Then we do 9 U's: \n      T=40: U -> T=41: y=1\n      T=41: U -> T=42: y=2\n      T=42: U -> T=43: y=3\n      T=43: U -> T=44: y=4\n      T=44: U -> T=45: y=5\n      T=45: U -> T=46: y=6\n      T=46: U -> T=47: y=7\n      T=47: U -> T=48: y=8\n      T=48: U -> T=49: y=9.\n\nSo we did actions at T=38,39,40,...,48 (11 actions) and reached y=9 at T=49.\n\nBut we want the minimal H? H is the number of turns? The problem says: minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions. And the sequence is from t1 (38) to t1+H-1? So that the last action is at t1+H-1 and then at the next turn (t1+H) we are at 9? \n\nBut note: the state at the beginning of turn t1 (38) is y=0. Then we do an action at t1, then at the beginning of turn t1+1 we are at the new y. And so on.\n\nWe are done when at the beginning of turn T we are at y=9? Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at the turn when we do the last action? \n\nBut the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" such that after these H actions, we are at (0,9). \n\nSo at the beginning of turn t1+H, we are at y=9.\n\nIn the above plan: at the beginning of turn49 (which is t1+H = 38+H) we are at y=9. So 38+H=49 -> H=11.\n\nBut can we do with fewer?\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid the unsafe events by timing differently.\n\nNote: we have to avoid freeways 1-4 at T=40. We can be at freeway0 at T=40. Then we can proceed.\n\nBut what if we go up faster? \n\nWe must be at freeway0 at T=40. How?\n\nAt T=38: we start at 0. We can:\n  Option1: Stay at 0 for two turns? \n      T=38: S -> T=39: 0\n      T=39: S -> T=40: 0 -> safe.\n  Then from T=40: we start moving up.\n\n  Then:\n      T=40: U -> T=41:1\n      T=41: U -> T=42:2 -> but at T=42, we are on freeway2? safe? yes, because unsafe only at T=40.\n      T=42: U -> T=43:3 -> safe? \n      But then at T=43: we are at 3 -> freeway3: safe? yes. \n      Then we continue to 4,5,6,7,8,9: \n          T=43: U->4\n          T=44: U->5 -> freeway5 at T=44: safe? because unsafe at 42,43 -> so safe at 44.\n          T=45: U->6 -> freeway6 at T=45: safe? yes.\n          T=46: U->7\n          T=47: U->8\n          T=48: U->9 -> so at T=48: we do the last U, then at T=49: we are at 9? \n          But wait: at T=48: we are at 8, then we do U and then at T=49: we are at 9. So we need to do an action at T=48 to get to 9 at T=49.\n\n      The sequence: \n          T=38: S\n          T=39: S\n          T=40: U\n          T=41: U\n          T=42: U\n          T=43: U\n          T=44: U\n          T=45: U\n          T=46: U\n          T=47: U -> now at T=48: we are at 8? \n          Then we need one more: T=48: U -> so at T=49: we are at 9.\n\n      Total actions: 11 actions (from T=38 to T=48) -> H=11.\n\n  This is the same as the previous.\n\nBut wait: we started at T=38 at 0. After 11 actions, we are at 9 at T=49.\n\nAlternatively, can we be at freeway5 at T=42 or 43? We must avoid that. But if we go faster, we might be at freeway5 earlier? \n\nWe must avoid freeway5 at T=42 and 43. So we can be at freeway5 at T=44 or later.\n\nSimilarly for freeway6.\n\nNow, the minimal time? The minimal H is 9? but we cannot do 9 because we have to avoid T=40.\n\nWhat if we do:\n\n  T=38: U -> T=39:1\n  T=39: D -> T=40:0 (safe)   [so we avoided the unsafe freeways at T=40]\n  Then from T=40: we go up as fast as possible: \n        T=40: U -> T=41:1\n        T=41: U -> T=42:2\n        T=42: U -> T=43:3\n        T=43: U -> T=44:4\n        T=44: U -> T=45:5   -> freeway5 at T=45: safe\n        T=45: U -> T=46:6   -> freeway6 at T=46: safe\n        T=46: U -> T=47:7\n        T=47: U -> T=48:8\n        T=48: U -> T=49:9\n\n  That's 11 actions.\n\nBut what if we go faster at the beginning? \n\nAlternatively, we can go up two times and then down? but that doesn't help.\n\nOr we can wait at freeway0 for one turn, then go up, but then we are at freeway1 at T=40? which is unsafe.\n\nSo the only safe option at T=40 is to be at freeway0.\n\nNow, can we get to freeway0 at T=40 without using two moves (like U then D)? \n\nWe start at freeway0 at T=38. We can do:\n  T=38: S -> then T=39:0\n  T=39: S -> then T=40:0\n\nBut that also uses two moves.\n\nSo we must spend at least two moves to be at 0 at T=40? \n\nBut note: we don't have to be at 0 at T=40 if we can be at a safe freeway? The safe freeways at T=40 are only 0? because 5,6,7,8 are safe at T=40? but we cannot get to them by T=40 from 0: we would need 5 moves? which is impossible.\n\nSo we must be at 0 at T=40.\n\nTherefore, we must do two moves that leave us at 0 at T=40. The options:\n  (S, S): stay at 38: S, then at 39: S -> at 40:0.\n  (U, D): at 38:U -> 39:1, then 39:D -> 40:0.\n\nBoth use two moves.\n\nThen we need 9 moves to go from 0 to 9: total 11 moves.\n\nBut wait, what if we go down? But we are at 0, we cannot go down.\n\nSo the minimal H is 11.\n\nBut can we avoid the unsafe freeways 5 and 6 at T=42,43 by being at a different freeway? \n\nIn the above plan, at T=42 we are at freeway2 (safe) and at T=43 we are at freeway3 (safe). Then we get to freeway5 at T=45 (safe) and freeway6 at T=46 (safe). \n\nBut what if we go faster? \n\nSuppose we do:\n\n  T=38: S -> T=39:0\n  T=39: S -> T=40:0\n  Then we go up as fast as possible: \n        T=40: U -> 1\n        T=41: U -> 2\n        T=42: U -> 3   [freeway3: safe at T=42? yes, because unsafe only at T=40]\n        T=43: U -> 4   [freeway4: safe? yes]\n        T=44: U -> 5   [freeway5: at T=44 -> safe? because unsafe at 42,43 -> safe at 44? yes]\n        T=45: U -> 6   [freeway6: safe? yes, because unsafe at 42,43 -> safe at 45? actually 45>43 -> safe]\n        T=46: U -> 7\n        T=47: U -> 8\n        T=48: U -> 9   [so at T=49: at 9]\n\n  That's 10 actions? Let me count the actions:\n\n      T=38: S\n      T=39: S\n      T=40: U\n      T=41: U\n      T=42: U\n      T=43: U\n      T=44: U\n      T=45: U\n      T=46: U\n      T=47: U\n      T=48: U   -> 11 actions? because from T=38 to T=48: 11 actions.\n\n  But wait: T=38: action1, T=39: action2, ... T=48: action11? \n\n  Actually, the actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. So H is the number of actions. And we have 11 actions.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  T=38: U -> T=39:1\n  T=39: D -> T=40:0\n  Then:\n      T=40: U ->1\n      T=41: U ->2\n      T=42: U ->3\n      T=43: U ->4\n      T=44: U ->5   [freeway5 at T=44: safe? yes]\n      T=45: U ->6   [freeway6 at T=45: safe? yes]\n      T=46: U ->7\n      T=47: U ->8\n      T=48: U ->9   [so at T=49:9]\n\n  That's 10 actions? \n      Actions at: 38,39,40,...,48 -> 11 actions.\n\n  Same as above.\n\nBut note: in the first two moves we did U and D, and then 9 U's: total 11.\n\nCan we do 10 actions? Then we would be at 9 at T=48? \n\nTo be at 9 at T=48: we must have started at 0 at T=38 and moved 9 steps up. That requires 9 moves of U. But we also have to avoid the unsafe events.\n\nWe would be:\n  T=38: U -> T=39:1\n  T=39: U -> T=40:2 -> unsafe! (freeway2 at T=40)\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nWhat if we do:\n\n  T=38: S -> T=39:0\n  T=39: U -> T=40:1 -> unsafe! (freeway1 at T=40)\n\nNot good.\n\n  T=38: U -> T=39:1\n  T=39: S -> T=40:1 -> unsafe (freeway1 at T=40)\n\nNot good.\n\n  T=38: U -> T=39:1\n  T=39: U -> T=40:2 -> unsafe (freeway2 at T=40)\n\nNot good.\n\nSo we must be at 0 at T=40. Then we need at least 9 more moves to get to 9? \n\nBut wait: from T=40 at 0, we do 9 moves: \n  T=40: U ->1\n  T=41: U ->2\n  ...\n  T=48: U ->9 -> then at T=49: we are at 9.\n\nSo 9 moves from T=40 to T=48. But then we did two moves before (at T=38 and 39) to get to 0 at T=40? So total 11 moves.\n\nBut what if we do 10 moves? Then we would be at 9 at T=48? How? \n\nWe must be at 0 at T=40. Then we need 9 moves to get to 9: the last move at T=48? Then we are at 9 at T=49. \n\nSo we cannot be at 9 at T=48? \n\nUnless we are already at 9 at the beginning of T=48? \n\nTo be at 9 at the beginning of T=48: we must have been at 8 at T=47 and then done U at T=47. \n\nTo be at 8 at T=47: we must have been at 0 at T=40 and then done 8 moves? \n\nThen we would be at 8 at T=48? \n\nWait: \n  T=40: at 0 -> after 0 moves: still at 0 at T=40 (beginning)\n  Then:\n      T=40: U -> at T=41:1\n      T=41: U -> at T=42:2\n      T=42: U -> at T=43:3\n      T=43: U -> at T=44:4\n      T=44: U -> at T=45:5\n      T=45: U -> at T=46:6\n      T=46: U -> at T=47:7\n      T=47: U -> at T=48:8 -> then we need one more to get to 9.\n\nSo we are at 8 at T=48? Then we do U at T=48 to get to 9 at T=49.\n\nSo we cannot avoid 11 moves.\n\nBut wait: what if we go up faster by not staying at 0? \n\nWe cannot avoid the unsafe event at T=40 without being at 0 at T=40.\n\nSo the minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, we have two sequences:\n\nSequence1: \n  T=38: S\n  T=39: S\n  T=40: U\n  T=41: U\n  T=42: U\n  T=43: U\n  T=44: U\n  T=45: U\n  T=46: U\n  T=47: U\n  T=48: U\n\nSequence2:\n  T=38: U\n  T=39: D\n  T=40: U\n  T=41: U\n  T=42: U\n  T=43: U\n  T=44: U\n  T=45: U\n  T=46: U\n  T=47: U\n  T=48: U\n\nBoth are 11 actions.\n\nBut the problem asks for the minimal number of turns H. Both have H=11.\n\nWe can choose either.\n\nBut note: in sequence2, we did U then D: that might be less efficient? But same number.\n\nWe can also mix: but we have to be at 0 at T=40.\n\nAnother sequence: \n  T=38: S\n  T=39: D -> but we are at 0, so D does nothing? then at T=40:0. \n  But that's the same as S then S? \n\nBut D at 0 stays at 0. So that's valid.\n\nSo any sequence that has at T=40: y=0 and then goes up without stopping? \n\nBut we have to avoid freeways5 and6 at T=42,43. In the above sequences, we are at freeway2 at T=42 and freeway3 at T=43 -> safe.\n\nBut what if we go slower? \n\nFor example, after T=40, we do:\n\n  T=40: S -> then we are still at 0 at T=41? then we start going up. But that would take more than 11 moves.\n\nSo we want minimal H=11.\n\nNow, we must output one sequence.\n\nI'll choose the first one: \n  T=38: S\n  T=39: S\n  T=40: U\n  T=41: U\n  T=42: U\n  T=43: U\n  T=44: U\n  T=45: U\n  T=46: U\n  T=47: U\n  T=48: U\n\nBut wait: at T=42: we are at y=2 -> freeway2: safe? yes, because unsafe only at T=40.\nAt T=43: we are at y=3 -> freeway3: safe? yes.\n\nAt T=44: y=4 -> freeway4: safe? yes.\nAt T=45: y=5 -> freeway5: safe? because unsafe at T=42,43 -> so at T=45: safe? \n  For freeway5: we have a car that is unsafe at T=42 and 43. At T=45: \n      car3: [tail+s*(45-38), head+s*(45-38)] = [-35+6*7, -24+6*7] = [-35+42, -24+42] = [7,18] -> does not cover 0 -> safe? \n  But wait, the freeway5 has three cars: \n      car1: [37+6*7, 48+6*7] = [37+42,48+42] = [79,90] -> safe\n      car2: [1+42,12+42] = [43,54] -> safe\n      car3: [7,18] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6: same.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 38: S\nTurn 39: S\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\n\nBut note: at the beginning of turn49, we are at 9.\n\nSo we have 11 actions.\n\nBut the problem says: the minimal number of turns H. And we have H=11.\n\nBut wait: is there a sequence that takes only 10 actions? \n\nSuppose we do:\n\n  T=38: U -> 1\n  T=39: D -> 0\n  T=40: U -> 1\n  T=41: U -> 2\n  T=42: U -> 3\n  T=43: U -> 4\n  T=44: U -> 5\n  T=45: U -> 6\n  T=46: U -> 7\n  T=47: U -> 8\n  T=48: U -> 9   [so at T=49:9]\n\nBut that's 11 actions.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  T=38: U ->1\n  T=39: D ->0\n  Then we have 9 moves: \n        T=40: U ->1\n        T=41: U ->2\n        T=42: U ->3\n        T=43: U ->4\n        T=44: U ->5\n        T=45: U ->6\n        T=46: U ->7\n        T=47: U ->8\n        T=48: U ->9   -> 10 actions? \n\nBut wait: we did actions at T=38,39,40,...,48 -> 11 actions? (38,39,40,...,48 is 11 numbers: 38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48 -> 11)\n\nSo no.\n\nBut what if we can reach 9 at T=48? Then we would do the last action at T=47? \n\nTo be at 9 at T=48: we must have been at 8 at T=47 and done U at T=47.\n\nTo be at 8 at T=47: we must have been at 0 at T=40 and then done 8 moves: \n  T=40: at 0 -> then 8 moves: \n        T=40: U->1\n        T=41: U->2\n        T=42: U->3\n        T=43: U->4\n        T=44: U->5\n        T=45: U->6\n        T=46: U->7\n        T=47: U->8 -> then at T=47 we do U to get to 9 at T=48? But that would be the 8th move from T=40 to T=47? Then we are at 8 at T=47? Then we do U at T=47 to get to 9 at T=48.\n\nSo we need 8 moves from T=40 to T=47: that's 8 moves. Then we did two moves at T=38 and 39: total 10 moves.\n\nHow? \n  T=38: action1 (must be one that leads to 0 at T=40) \n  T=39: action2 \n  Then T=40: at 0.\n  Then T=40: action3 (U) -> T=41:1\n  T=41: action4 (U) -> T=42:2\n  T=42: action5 (U) -> T=43:3\n  T=43: action6 (U) -> T=44:4\n  T=44: action7 (U) -> T=45:5\n  T=45: action8 (U) -> T=46:6\n  T=46: action9 (U) -> T=47:7\n  T=47: action10 (U) -> T=48:8? -> then we are not at 9.\n\nWe need one more: T=48: U -> then T=49:9 -> then 11 actions.\n\nWait, I see: to go from 0 to 8 we need 8 moves? and then one more to 9: total 9 moves. So from T=40 to T=48: we do 9 moves? \n\n  T=40: U ->1 (at T=41)\n  T=41: U ->2 (T=42)\n  T=42: U ->3 (T=43)\n  T=43: U ->4 (T=44)\n  T=44: U ->5 (T=45)\n  T=45: U ->6 (T=46)\n  T=46: U ->7 (T=47)\n  T=47: U ->8 (T=48)\n  T=48: U ->9 (T=49)\n\nThat's 9 moves (actions at T=40 to T=48) -> 9 actions. Then we had two actions at T=38 and 39: total 11.\n\nAlternatively, if we do:\n\n  T=38: U -> T=39:1\n  T=39: D -> T=40:0\n  Then T=40: U -> T=41:1\n  T=41: U -> T=42:2\n  T=42: U -> T=43:3\n  T=43: U -> T=44:4\n  T=44: U -> T=45:5\n  T=45: U -> T=46:6\n  T=46: U -> T=47:7\n  T=47: U -> T=48:8\n  T=48: U -> T=49:9\n\nThat's 11 actions.\n\nSo we cannot do with 10.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nWe'll output the sequence:\n\nTurn 38: S\nTurn 39: S\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\n\nBut note: at T=48 we do U and then at T=49 we are at 9. So we stop.\n\nBut the problem: we need to reach (0,9). We do that at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThe problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" such that after these actions, we are at (0,9). \n\nSo after the last action (at T=48), we are at (0,9)? \n\nBut note: the action at T=48 moves us from y_{48} to y_{49}. If we do U at T=48 and we were at 8 at the beginning of T=48, then at the beginning of T=49 we are at 9.\n\nSo we are at 9 at T=49, which is after the last action (which was at T=48).\n\nSo that is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if we could be at 9 at T=48 (without an action at T=48), then we wouldn't need the last U. But we start at 0 at T=38, so we need actions to move up.\n\nTherefore, the sequence above is valid.\n\nBut let me verify the safety at each step:\n\n  T=38: y=0 -> safe (freeway0: no cars)\n  T=39: y=0 -> safe\n  T=40: y=1 -> freeway1: unsafe? but wait: we did U at T=39? \n\nWait, in the sequence:\n\n  At T=38: we do S -> so at T=39: y=0 (because we stayed at 0).\n  At T=39: we do S -> so at T=40: y=0? \n\nI made a mistake! \n\nIn the sequence I wrote:\n\n  T=38: S -> then at T=39: still at 0.\n  T=39: S -> then at T=40: still at 0.\n\nThen at T=40: we do U -> so at T=41: we move to 1.\n\nSo the positions by turn:\n\n  T=38: y=0\n  T=39: y=0\n  T=40: y=0   (because we did S at T=39, so we are at 0 at the beginning of T=40, then we do U at T=40 -> then at T=41: we are at 1)\n\nSo at T=40: we are at 0 -> safe.\n\nAt T=41: we are at 1 -> freeway1: safe? because unsafe only at T=40 -> so safe at T=41.\n\nAt T=42: we are at 2 -> freeway2: safe? because unsafe only at T=40 -> safe.\n\nAt T=43: we are at 3 -> freeway3: safe.\n\nAt T=44: we are at 4 -> freeway4: safe.\n\nAt T=45: we are at 5 -> freeway5: safe? because unsafe at T=42,43 -> safe at T=45.\n\nAt T=46: we are at 6 -> freeway6: safe? yes.\n\nAt T=47: we are at 7 -> freeway7: safe.\n\nAt T=48: we are at 8 -> freeway8: safe.\n\nAt T=49: we are at 9 -> done.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nBut in the sequence of actions, we have:\n\n  Turn 38: S\n  Turn 39: S\n  Turn 40: U\n  Turn 41: U\n  Turn 42: U\n  Turn 43: U\n  Turn 44: U\n  Turn 45: U\n  Turn 46: U\n  Turn 47: U\n  Turn 48: U\n\nAnd we stop at T=48 because then at T=49 we are at 9.\n\nSo the answer.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=11 (the number of actions is 11, and the next turn we are at 9).\n\nSo we output the sequence.\n\nBut the problem says \"Answer Format\": \n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nSo for t1=38:\n\n  Turn 38: S\n  Turn 39: S\n  Turn 40: U\n  ...\n  Turn 48: U\n\nThat's 11 lines.\n\nBut note: the last action is at t1+H-1 = 38+11-1 = 48.\n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 38: S\nTurn 39: S\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\n}\n\nBut wait: in the sequence above, we are at y=8 at the beginning of turn48. Then we do U at turn48 to get to 9 at turn49. But the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at the turn after the last action? \n\nYes: after the action at turn48, we are at (0,9) at the next turn (turn49). But the problem says \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\". So it's acceptable.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\" we do the last action, and then we are at (0,9) at the next turn? \n\nYes.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider if we can stop earlier? \n\nBut we must be at 9. We are at 8 at turn48 (beginning), then we do U and then we are at 9 at turn49. So we need that last U.\n\nTherefore, the above sequence is correct.\n\nBut let me check the other sequence (with U then D) to see if it is also safe:\n\n  T=38: U -> so at T=39:1\n  T=39: D -> so at T=40:0 -> safe (freeway0)\n  Then:\n      T=40: U -> at T=41:1 -> freeway1: safe (only unsafe at T=40)\n      T=41: U -> T=42:2 -> safe\n      T=42: U -> T=43:3 -> safe\n      T=43: U -> T=44:4 -> safe\n      T=44: U -> T=45:5 -> freeway5: safe? at T=45: yes.\n      T=45: U -> T=46:6 -> freeway6: safe? at T=46: yes.\n      T=46: U -> T=47:7 -> safe\n      T=47: U -> T=48:8 -> safe\n      T=48: U -> T=49:9 -> done.\n\nSo that is also safe.\n\nBut both are acceptable. We can choose either.\n\nI think the problem does not require minimal H beyond the minimal number (which is 11). So we can choose the first one.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and both have H=11.\n\nSo we output the first one.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 38: S\nTurn 39: S\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\n}\n\nBut wait: in the sequence above, we did two S at the beginning. But what if we do U then D? \n\nThe problem does not prefer one over the other. So both are minimal.\n\nBut to be safe, we can output the one that we are sure about.\n\nHowever, I think both are correct.\n\nBut the problem does not specify which one to choose. So we can choose any.\n\nI'll stick with the one above.\n\nBut note: the player starts at (0,0) and we are to go to (0,9). The sequence we output must avoid collisions. We have verified.\n\nSo we write the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 38\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a freeway when it is unsafe.\n\n- Freeways 1 to 4 are unsafe only at turn 40 (due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\)).\n- Freeways 5 and 6 are unsafe at turns 42 and 43 (due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\)).\n- Freeways 7 and 8 are always safe.\n\nThe sequence starts at turn 38 and ends at turn 48 (11 actions). After the last action (turn 48), the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 49.\n\nThe actions are chosen to:\n- Stay at \\(y = 0\\) (safe) for turns 38 and 39 to avoid being on freeways 1–4 at turn 40.\n- Move upward from turn 40 to 48, ensuring:\n  - At turn 40, \\(y = 0\\) (safe).\n  - At turn 41, \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1 safe, as unsafe only at turn 40).\n  - At turn 42, \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2 safe, as unsafe only at turn 40).\n  - At turn 43, \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3 safe, as unsafe only at turn 40).\n  - At turn 44, \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4 safe, as unsafe only at turn 40).\n  - At turn 45, \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5 safe, as unsafe only at turns 42–43).\n  - At turn 46, \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6 safe, as unsafe only at turns 42–43).\n  - At turn 47, \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7 always safe).\n  - At turn 48, \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8 always safe), and moving up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 49.\n\nThe sequence is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 38: \\text{ S}\n\\text{Turn } 39: \\text{ S}\n\\text{Turn } 40: \\text{ U}\n\\text{Turn } 41: \\text{ U}\n\\text{Turn } 42: \\text{ U}\n\\text{Turn } 43: \\text{ U}\n\\text{Turn } 44: \\text{ U}\n\\text{Turn } 45: \\text{ U}\n\\text{Turn } 46: \\text{ U}\n\\text{Turn } 47: \\text{ U}\n\\text{Turn } 48: \\text{ U}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 40, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T at that turn and the car's span at turn T covers the x-coordinate 0 (which is the player's x).\n\nNote: The player moves in the y-direction only (vertical), and the cars move horizontally on their fixed freeway (y-level). The player's x is always 0.\n\nThe update for the player:\n  U: y += 1\n  D: y -= 1\n  S: y stays\n\nConstraints: y must be in [0,9]. So we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nCar update:\n  For a car on freeway i (which is at y=i) at any turn T (from the initial state at turn t1=40):\n    If it's left-moving (d='left'): \n        At turn T, the car's head h and tail tau move left (decreasing x).\n        Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]   [note: since head is the front, and if left-moving, then head is at the left? But the problem states for left-moving: initial span [h, tau] becomes [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. So if initially h > tau (because the car extends from tau to h, and if moving left, then the front is at the left) then after moving, the front becomes h - s*dt and the back becomes tau - s*dt.\n\n  However, note the representation for right-moving cars: \n        Initially: [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]\n\nBut in the given data, the cars are all given as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n  For a right-moving car, the head is the front (rightmost) and tail is the back (leftmost). So initially at t1=40, the car is from -71 to -48? But note the representation for right-moving says: [tau, h] -> meaning that the car spans from tail to head? Actually, the problem states for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\". So in the data, the first number is head? But the representation for right-moving uses [tau, h]. \n\nLooking at the problem statement for right-moving:\n  Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo for freeway1: \n  head = -48, tail = -71, direction = right, speed=24.\n  Then the initial span at t1=40 is [tail, head] = [-71, -48]. \n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, the initial span would be [head, tail] (but note: if the car is moving left, the head is the leftmost? Actually the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1)=[h, tau]\". \n\nBut in the given data, we don't have any left-moving cars. All cars in the given data are right-moving.\n\nSo all cars are right-moving. Therefore, for each car on freeway i at time T (relative to t1=40, so dt = T-40), the span is:\n  [tail + s*(T-40), head + s*(T-40)]\n\nCollision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y = i (for i in 1..8) and the car's span at T covers 0, then collision.\n\nImportant note: when the player moves from y to y' at turn T, note that at turn T the player is still on y (and then moves to y' for the next turn). So at turn T, the player is on the freeway of the current y (the one before the move). \n\nSpecifically: \n  At turn T, the player is at y_T. Then we choose an action a_T that will set y_{T+1} = y_T + delta.\n  Therefore, at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T. And we must avoid the cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nBut note: if we are moving to a freeway at the same turn we are not on it until the next turn? Actually, the problem states: \n  \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nSo at turn T, we are only on freeway y_T.\n\nThus, we only check the cars on freeway y_T at turn T for collision.\n\nGoal: Start at (0,0) at turn 40, and we want to be at (0,9) at some turn T (and we are minimizing the number of turns H = T - 40 + 1? Actually, we are doing actions for t from t1 to t1+H-1, so that the position at turn t1+H is (0,9). But note: the sequence of actions is for t = t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, and after H actions we are at turn t1+H. We require that at turn t1+H-1? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning:\n   t=0: a_{t1} -> leads to turn t1+1: y_{t1+1}\n   t=1: a_{t1+1} -> leads to turn t1+2: y_{t1+2}\n   ...\n   t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1} -> leads to turn t1+H: y_{t1+H}\n\nWe require y_{t1+H} = 9? But note: we start at turn t1 at position (0,0). After the first action (at t1) we are at turn t1+1 at position (0, y_{t1+1}).\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? Actually, the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nLet me read: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd note: the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so we have H actions. The state after H actions is at turn t1+H. However, the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nWait, the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nBut our actions are applied at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. The position at the end of the sequence (after the last action) is y_{t1+H}. However, the problem says we require y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\nLet me check the indices:\n\nAt turn t1 (current turn): we are at (0, y_{t1}) = (0,0).\nThen we take action a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}.\n\nSo the position at turn t1 is given as (0,0). We are to compute actions for t1, t1+1, ... until we are at (0,9) at some turn.\n\nBut the problem states: \"reach (0,9)\" and then says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nTherefore, after H actions (which are taken at turns t1 to t1+H-1), we are at turn t1+H, but we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9? \n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me parse the sequence:\n\nTurn t1: we are at y_{t1}=0. Then we choose a_{t1}. Then at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1} = 0 + delta(a_{t1}).\n\nWe want to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1? Then we only need H-1 actions? \n\nBut the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1 (so H actions) and the state at the end of the sequence (after H actions) is at turn t1+H. \n\nHowever, the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nSo the requirement is that at the turn just before the last action? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we have H turns (from t1 to t1+H-1) and we are at 9 at the last turn we act? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and the sequence of actions is for t from t1 to t1+H-1. And we require that at turn t1+H-1 (the turn at which we are after the last action) we are at 9? \n\nWait, after the last action (taken at turn t1+H-1), we are at turn t1+H? Then the state at turn t1+H is the result of the last action. But the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nI think there is an indexing issue. \n\nLooking back: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning:\n\n   t=0: a_{t1} -> applied at turn t1, resulting in state at turn t1+1.\n   t=1: a_{t1+1} -> applied at turn t1+1, resulting in state at turn t1+2.\n   ...\n   t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1} -> applied at turn t1+H-1, resulting in state at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: we require y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nThis would be the state at turn t1+H-1, which is the state after the action taken at turn t1+H-2? \n\nSo if we do H actions, then the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state after the (H-1)-th action? \n\nBut note: at the beginning (turn t1) we are at state 0. Then:\n\n   Turn t1: state = 0, then we apply a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1, we have state = y_{t1+1}.\n   We want y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1. How many actions? \n\nThe actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? Because the last action that affects the state at turn t1+H-1 is taken at turn t1+H-2. \n\nBut the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1, meaning we have H actions. So the actions are taken at t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. Then the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state after the action taken at turn t1+H-2? \n\nActually, the state at turn t1 is given. Then:\n\n   Action at turn t1: leads to state at turn t1+1.\n   ...\n   Action at turn t1+k: leads to state at turn t1+k+1.\n\nSo the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state after the action taken at turn t1+H-2? Then what is the last action? The last action we take is at turn t1+H-1, which leads to state at turn t1+H. But we don't care about that state? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we require the state at turn t1+H (after H actions) to be 9? But the problem explicitly says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nI think we must follow the problem: we require at turn t1+H-1 the player is at 9. \n\nTherefore, the state at turn t1+H-1 is 9. How many actions? \n\nThe actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. But note:\n\n   At turn t1: we take action a_{t1} -> this action moves us from state at turn t1 to state at turn t1+1.\n   At turn t1+1: we take action a_{t1+1} -> moves to state at turn t1+2.\n   ...\n   At turn t1+H-2: we take action a_{t1+H-2} -> moves to state at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo to get to state 9 at turn t1+H-1, we need to take H-1 actions? But the sequence is of length H (from t=0 to H-1). \n\nAlternatively, the problem might index the state at turn t1 as the 0-th state, and then after k actions we are at turn t1+k. Then we require at step H-1 (meaning at turn t1+H-1) we are at 9. Then we have taken H-1 actions? But the sequence is from t=0 to H-1 -> that would be H actions.\n\nI think there is a discrepancy.\n\nBut note the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and we require the position at turn t1+H-1 to be 9.\n\nThe actions are taken at the turns: \n   a_{t1} is taken at turn t1 (to go from state at t1 to state at t1+1)\n   a_{t1+1} at turn t1+1 (to go to state at t1+2)\n   ...\n   a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1 (to go to state at t1+H)\n\nBut we require the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9. That state is the result of the action taken at turn t1+H-2. So the last action that matters is a_{t1+H-2}. However, the sequence includes one extra action? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might require that we are at 9 at the moment we take the last action? But then we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action at that turn? That action would then move us away? \n\nThis is not matching.\n\nI think the intended meaning is: we start at turn t1 at position (0,0). Then we take actions for H turns (so H actions) and then at the next turn (turn t1+H) we are at (0,9). But the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd the answer format: \n   Turn t1: a_{t1}\n   Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n   ...\n   Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAnd we require that after the sequence, we are at (0,9). But the last action is at turn t1+H-1, which produces the state at turn t1+H. Therefore, we require y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThis is a critical point.\n\nLooking at the problem statement: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". So we require the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9, not at turn t1+H.\n\nTherefore, we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action at that turn? But that action would change the state to 8, 9, or 10 (but 10 is invalid, so 8 or 9). But we don't require to stay at 9? We only require to reach 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut the goal is to reach (0,9). So being at 9 at turn t1+H-1 is the goal. Then we don't need to do anything else? However, the sequence includes an action at turn t1+H-1? But if we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, then we are already at the goal. But the action at that turn might move us away? \n\nThe problem does not say we have to stay at 9. It only says to reach (0,9). So if we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, we have reached. The action at turn t1+H-1 might be arbitrary? But we must avoid collision at turn t1+H-1? \n\nAt turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. And we are going to take an action? But we don't care about the state after that? However, we must avoid collision at the turn we are at 9? \n\nBut note: collision is checked at every turn we are on a freeway (1..8). Since 9 is the top, and there are no cars on freeway 9 (because freeways are 1 to 8), then at y=9 there are no cars. So at turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9 -> no collision possible. Then we can do any action? But the action we do at turn t1+H-1 might move us to 8, 9, or 10 (invalid) but we are at 9 at the beginning of the turn (so we are safe) and then we move. But the problem only requires to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1. \n\nSo we can do:\n\n   ... \n   at turn t1+H-2: we move to 9 (so at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9) and then at turn t1+H-1 we do, say, S (to stay) or U (but U would try to go to 10, which is invalid -> so we can't do U) or D to 8. \n\nBut if we do D, then at turn t1+H we are at 8. But we don't care about after? The requirement is only at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. \n\nHowever, the problem says \"reach (0,9)\". So we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1. Then we have reached. The action at that turn is part of the sequence, but it doesn't affect the goal. \n\nBut note: we are required to output a sequence of H actions. And the last action is at turn t1+H-1. So we must output an action for turn t1+H-1. But at that turn we are at 9. Then we can do S (stay) or D (go down to 8). But if we do D, then we leave 9. But we have already been at 9. \n\nHowever, the problem does not require to stay. So we can do S or D. But we must avoid collision at turn t1+H-1: and at y=9 there is no car, so we are safe. Then we can choose any valid action? But note: if we choose U, we try to go to 10, which is invalid -> so we cannot choose U. So we can choose S or D.\n\nBut why would we choose D? That would make us leave the goal. But the goal is already achieved at that turn. \n\nTo minimize H, we want to get to 9 as soon as possible. And then we can do S at the last turn. \n\nBut note: the sequence must be of H actions, and we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1. Then the last action (at turn t1+H-1) can be S. Then we stay at 9. \n\nAlternatively, we could have arrived at 9 earlier? \n\nBut the problem says: minimal H. So we want the smallest H such that we can be at 9 at turn t1+H-1. \n\nTherefore, we are looking for the minimal H for which there exists a sequence of H actions (starting at turn t1, and the actions are taken at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1) such that the state at turn t1+H-1 is 9 (and we avoid collisions at every turn from t1 to t1+H-1).\n\nAnd at the last turn (t1+H-1) we are at 9, so we are safe (no cars at y=9). Then we can choose the last action as S (to stay) and then we are still at 9 at turn t1+H (but that is not required).\n\nSo the problem reduces to: starting at y=0 at turn 40, we want to be at y=9 at turn 40+H-1, and we avoid collisions at every turn from 40 to 40+H-1.\n\nThe minimal H is the minimal number of turns (from turn 40) such that we can be at 9 at turn 40+H-1.\n\nSince we start at 0 and need to go to 9, we need at least 9 moves upward (each U moves +1). But we can also move down and then up? But that would take more moves. The minimal moves without any cars would be 9 consecutive U moves: then we would be at 9 at turn 40+9 = 49? \n\nBut then at turn 49 we are at 9? So we require H-1 = 9 -> H=10? \n\nBut let me count:\n\n   Turn 40: start at 0.\n   Action at 40: U -> turn41: 1\n   Action at41: U -> turn42: 2\n   ...\n   Action at48: U -> turn49: 9\n\nSo at turn49 (which is 40+9) we are at 9. Then we require y_{40+H-1}=9 -> 40+H-1=49 -> H=10.\n\nBut we have taken 9 actions? Then the sequence has 10 actions? \n\nWait: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1 -> that's H actions. In the above, we have actions from turn40 to turn48 (9 actions) and then we are at 9 at turn49. So we have H-1 = 9? Then H=10. Then the sequence must have 10 actions. But we only took 9? \n\nThen we need to add one more action at turn49: and we can do S (stay). Then:\n\n   Turn40: U\n   Turn41: U\n   ...\n   Turn48: U\n   Turn49: S\n\nThen we are at 9 at turn49? But note: the state at turn49 is the result of the action at turn48. Then we take an action at turn49 (S) and then at turn50 we are still at 9. But we require to be at 9 at turn40+H-1. With H=10, 40+H-1=49. So at turn49 we are at 9? But at turn49 we are at 9 because of the action at turn48 (U). Then we take an action at turn49 (S) but that doesn't change the state at turn49? \n\nActually, the state at turn49 is set by the action at turn48. Then at turn49 we are at 9. Then we take an action (S) and that sets the state at turn50 to 9. But we don't care about turn50.\n\nBut the requirement is the state at turn49 (40+10-1=49) must be 9. And it is. So this works.\n\nBut we must avoid cars at every turn from 40 to 49.\n\nAt turn40: we are at y=0 -> no car check (since cars are on freeways 1..8). Then at turn41: we are at y=1 -> we must check freeway1 at turn41. Similarly, turn42: y=2 -> check freeway2, and so on until turn48: we are at y=8 -> check freeway8, and turn49: we are at y=9 -> no car.\n\nSo we need to check freeways 1 to 8 at turns 41 to 48.\n\nNow, we have the car configurations at turn40. Then we can compute the car positions at any turn T (>=40) for each freeway.\n\nBut note: there are multiple cars on some freeways (freeway5 and 6 have 3 cars each, freeway7 and 8 have one car).\n\nWe must avoid: at turn T, if we are at freeway i, then none of the cars on freeway i at turn T should have a span that covers 0.\n\nLet me compute the car positions at the required turns.\n\nFirst, for a car (head, tail, direction, speed) that is right-moving, at time T (>=40):\n   dt = T - 40\n   The car's head at T = head + s * dt\n   The car's tail at T = tail + s * dt\n   The span is [tail + s*dt, head + s*dt]\n\nWe need 0 not in [tail+s*dt, head+s*dt] for every car on the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway and each turn from 41 to 48.\n\nWe are planning to go straight up: \n   Turn41: y=1 -> freeway1\n   Turn42: y=2 -> freeway2\n   Turn43: y=3 -> freeway3\n   Turn44: y=4 -> freeway4\n   Turn45: y=5 -> freeway5\n   Turn46: y=6 -> freeway6\n   Turn47: y=7 -> freeway7\n   Turn48: y=8 -> freeway8\n\nWe need to check at each of these turns if there is a car on the corresponding freeway that covers 0.\n\nFreeway1: one car: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n   At turn T: \n        tail_T = -71 + 24*(T-40)\n        head_T = -48 + 24*(T-40)\n\n   We are at freeway1 at turn41: T=41 -> dt=1\n        tail_41 = -71 + 24*1 = -47\n        head_41 = -48 + 24*1 = -24\n        Span = [-47, -24] -> does not include 0? (since both negative) -> safe.\n\nFreeway2: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n   T=42: dt=2\n        tail_42 = -83 + 36*2 = -83 + 72 = -11\n        head_42 = -48 + 72 = 24\n        Span = [-11, 24] -> includes 0? yes, because -11 <= 0 <=24.\n\nSo at turn42, if we are on freeway2, we would collide.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at freeway2 at turn42? \n\nBut our plan was to be at freeway2 at turn42. Therefore, the straight up plan fails at turn42.\n\nWe must avoid that collision. How?\n\nWe have a few options:\n  1. Delay our arrival at freeway2 until the car has passed.\n  2. Skip freeway2 at turn42 by not being there? But we have to pass through freeway2 at some point.\n\nWe can try to wait at freeway1 for a few turns? Or go down and then up? \n\nBut we want minimal H.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to speed up: if we can get to freeway2 earlier? But we start at turn40 at 0. Then at turn41 we are at 1, and turn42 we are at 2. We cannot get to 2 earlier.\n\nOr we can try to go faster? But we can only move one step per turn. So we cannot jump.\n\nSo we must avoid being at freeway2 at turn42.\n\nHow about we stay at freeway1 for one extra turn? \n\nPlan:\n   Turn40: start at 0 -> we can only go up to 1? Or stay? Or down? But down to -1 is invalid. So we must go up or stay.\n\n   Option: \n        Turn40: S (stay at 0) -> then at turn41 we are still at 0? But then we are not on freeway1 at turn41? \n        But then at turn41: we are at 0 -> no car. Then at turn41: we can go up to 1.\n\n        Then at turn42: we go up to 2.\n\n        But then at turn42 we are at 2 -> freeway2: and we have the same problem? The car at freeway2 at turn42: still the same as above? \n\n        Because the car moves with time: at turn42, the car on freeway2: \n            dt = 42-40 = 2 -> same as above: [-11,24] -> still covers 0.\n\n        So staying at 0 for one turn doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, we can stay at freeway1 for two turns? \n\n        Turn40: U -> to 1 (turn41: at freeway1)\n        Turn41: S -> stay at 1 (turn42: at freeway1 again? but then we are not at freeway2 at turn42? Then we avoid the collision at turn42? \n\n        Then at turn42: we are at freeway1. We need to check freeway1 at turn42: \n            Freeway1: T=42, dt=2\n            tail_42 = -71 + 24*2 = -71+48 = -23\n            head_42 = -48 + 48 = 0\n            Span = [-23,0] -> includes 0? yes. So we collide at turn42 if we are at freeway1.\n\n        So that doesn't work.\n\nWe could go up to 1 at turn41, then at turn42 we go down to 0? But then we are at freeway0? (which is not a freeway with cars) but then we have to go up again.\n\nBut at turn42: we go down to 0 -> then we are at 0 at turn43? Then we avoid freeway2 at turn42. Then at turn43, we can go up to 1? Then at turn44, up to 2? \n\nBut then at turn44 we are at freeway2: \n        T=44, dt=4\n        Freeway2: tail_44 = -83 + 36*4 = -83 + 144 = 61\n                 head_44 = -48 + 144 = 96\n        Span = [61,96] -> does not include 0 -> safe.\n\nThen we can proceed? \n\nBut we have added 2 extra turns: \n   Original: \n        turn41:1, turn42:2 -> then we collide at 42.\n   New:\n        turn41:1, turn42:0 (by going down: action D at turn42), turn43:1, turn44:2.\n\n   Then at turn44 we are at freeway2 and safe.\n\nBut then we are behind: we are at 2 at turn44 instead of turn42. Then we need to go to 9: we need 7 more U moves -> 7 turns. So total turns: \n        turn40:0 -> turn41:1 -> turn42:0 -> turn43:1 -> turn44:2 -> ... then at turn44+7 = turn51:9.\n\nSo we are at 9 at turn51? Then we require H such that 40+H-1=51 -> H=12.\n\nBut we must check the rest of the freeways? Because we are delayed.\n\nAlternatively, we might find a better detour.\n\nBut let's check the entire path:\n\n   Turn40: start at 0 -> action: U -> turn41:1\n   Turn41: at freeway1 -> we must check: \n        T=41, freeway1: [-71+24, -48+24] = [-47,-24] -> safe.\n\n   Turn41: action: D? -> then at turn42: 0 -> safe (no car at y=0)\n\n   Turn42: action: U -> turn43:1 -> freeway1 at turn43: \n        dt=43-40=3\n        freeway1: tail=-71+24*3=-71+72=1, head=-48+72=24 -> span [1,24] -> does not include 0? safe.\n\n   Turn43: action: U -> turn44:2 -> freeway2 at turn44: \n        dt=4: freeway2: tail=-83+36*4= -83+144=61, head=-48+144=96 -> [61,96] -> safe.\n\n   Then we continue upward:\n\n        Turn44: U -> turn45:3 -> freeway3: car (-48,-83,right,36) -> \n             T=45, dt=5: tail=-83+36*5=-83+180=97, head=-48+180=132 -> safe.\n\n        Turn45: U -> turn46:4 -> freeway4: car (-48,-83,right,36)\n             T=46, dt=6: tail=-83+36*6=-83+216=133, head=-48+216=168 -> safe.\n\n        Turn46: U -> turn47:5 -> freeway5: has 3 cars: \n             (48,37,right,6): note: this car is given as (head, tail) = (48,37) -> right-moving: so span at T=47: dt=7\n                 tail=37+6*7=37+42=79, head=48+42=90 -> [79,90] -> safe (0 not in [79,90])\n             (12,1,right,6): tail=1+42=43, head=12+42=54 -> [43,54] -> safe.\n             (-24,-35,right,6): tail=-35+42=7, head=-24+42=18 -> [7,18] -> includes 0? no -> safe.\n\n        Turn47: U -> turn48:6 -> freeway6: same cars as freeway5? \n             (48,37,right,6): dt=8: tail=37+48=85, head=48+48=96 -> safe.\n             (12,1,right,6): tail=1+48=49, head=12+48=60 -> safe.\n             (-24,-35,right,6): tail=-35+48=13, head=-24+48=24 -> safe.\n\n        Turn48: U -> turn49:7 -> freeway7: one car (48,37,right,12)\n             dt=9: tail=37+12*9=37+108=145, head=48+108=156 -> safe.\n\n        Turn49: U -> turn50:8 -> freeway8: one car (48,37,right,4)\n             dt=10: tail=37+4*10=77, head=48+40=88 -> safe.\n\n        Turn50: U -> turn51:9 -> goal.\n\nBut wait, we are at 9 at turn51? Then we require y_{40+H-1}=9 -> 40+H-1=51 -> H=12.\n\nBut we have taken 11 actions? Then we need to output 12 actions? \n\nThe sequence: \n   Turn40: U\n   Turn41: D\n   Turn42: U\n   Turn43: U\n   Turn44: U\n   Turn45: U\n   Turn46: U\n   Turn47: U\n   Turn48: U\n   Turn49: U\n   Turn50: U   -> this gets us to 9 at turn51.\n\nBut we are at 9 at turn51 -> we require to be at 9 at turn40+H-1. So 40+H-1=51 -> H=12. Then we must have 12 actions. We have 11 so far? Then we need one more at turn51: and we can do S.\n\nSo:\n\n   Turn40: U\n   Turn41: D\n   Turn42: U\n   Turn43: U\n   Turn44: U\n   Turn45: U\n   Turn46: U\n   Turn47: U\n   Turn48: U\n   Turn49: U\n   Turn50: U\n   Turn51: S\n\nBut then we are at 9 at turn51 (due to the U at turn50) and then we do S at turn51 to stay at 9 at turn52? But we require at turn51 we are at 9? We are at 9 at turn51 because of the previous U. Then we do S at turn51 (which is the last action) and then at turn52 we are still at 9. But we only care about turn51 (40+12-1=51) being at 9. So it's achieved.\n\nBut note: the action at turn51 (S) is taken at turn51, and we are at 9 at that turn (so safe). \n\nBut is there a shorter path? \n\nWe tried the straight path: it failed at turn42. Then we did a detour (down at turn41) that cost 2 extra turns. Total H=12.\n\nCan we do better? \n\nAlternative: instead of going down at turn41, we could stay at freeway1 for one turn? But we saw that at turn42 the car on freeway1 covers 0? So we cannot stay at freeway1 at turn42.\n\nAnother alternative: we go up to freeway1 at turn41, then at turn42 we go up to freeway3? But we can only move by 1 per turn. So we cannot jump from 1 to 3.\n\nWe could go up to 1 at turn41, then at turn42 we go down to 0? Then at turn43 we go up to 1 again? Then at turn44 we go to 2? \n\nBut that is the same as above: we get to 2 at turn44. Then we are delayed by 2 turns.\n\nBut what if we wait at 0? \n\n   Turn40: S (stay at 0) -> safe.\n   Turn41: U -> to 1 (freeway1) at turn42: \n        freeway1 at turn42: dt=2 -> tail=-71+48=-23, head=-48+48=0 -> [ -23,0] -> includes 0? yes. So collision.\n\n   So we cannot be at freeway1 at turn42.\n\n   Then we do: \n        Turn40: S\n        Turn41: S? -> still at 0 at turn42? \n        Turn42: U -> to 1 at turn43: \n             freeway1 at turn43: dt=3: tail=-71+72=1, head=-48+72=24 -> [1,24] -> safe.\n\n        Then we continue:\n             Turn43: at 1 -> we want to go to 2 at turn44: \n                 freeway2 at turn44: dt=4 -> tail=-83+36*4=61, head=-48+144=96 -> safe.\n\n        Then we are at 2 at turn44. Same as above.\n\n        Then we need from 0 to 9: \n            We started at 0 for two extra turns (turn40: S, turn41: S) then turn42: U to 1, turn43: U to 2? \n            Then at turn43 we are at 1? Then turn44: U to 2 -> at turn44 we are at 2.\n\n        Then we are at 2 at turn44. Then we need 7 more U to get to 9: \n            turn45:3, turn46:4, turn47:5, turn48:6, turn49:7, turn50:8, turn51:9.\n\n        Then at turn51 we are at 9. Then we do an extra action at turn51: S? -> so H=12 again.\n\n        Sequence: \n            Turn40: S\n            Turn41: S\n            Turn42: U\n            Turn43: U\n            ... same as before but without the down.\n\n        This also works? And we avoid the collision at freeway1 at turn43? \n\n        But we must check freeway2 at turn44: which we did and it's safe.\n\n        However, we also have to check the other freeways at the times we are there? \n\n        We are at freeway3 at turn45: \n            freeway3: car (-48,-83,right,36) -> dt=5: tail=-83+180=97, head=-48+180=132 -> safe.\n\n        freeway4 at turn46: dt=6: tail=-83+216=133, head=-48+216=168 -> safe.\n\n        freeway5 at turn47: \n            (48,37,right,6): dt=7: tail=37+42=79, head=48+42=90 -> safe.\n            (12,1,right,6): tail=1+42=43, head=12+42=54 -> safe.\n            (-24,-35,right,6): tail=-35+42=7, head=-24+42=18 -> safe? 0 not in [7,18] -> safe.\n\n        freeway6 at turn48: \n            (48,37,right,6): dt=8: tail=37+48=85, head=48+48=96 -> safe.\n            (12,1,right,6): tail=1+48=49, head=12+48=60 -> safe.\n            (-24,-35,right,6): tail=-35+48=13, head=-24+48=24 -> safe.\n\n        freeway7 at turn49: \n            (48,37,right,12): dt=9: tail=37+108=145, head=48+108=156 -> safe.\n\n        freeway8 at turn50: \n            (48,37,right,4): dt=10: tail=37+40=77, head=48+40=88 -> safe.\n\n        Then turn51: we go to 9 -> safe.\n\n        So this also works: and we don't have to go down. We just wait at 0 for two turns.\n\n        Then total actions: \n            Turn40: S\n            Turn41: S\n            Turn42: U\n            Turn43: U\n            Turn44: U (to 3)\n            Turn45: U (4)\n            Turn46: U (5)\n            Turn47: U (6)\n            Turn48: U (7)\n            Turn49: U (8)\n            Turn50: U (9) -> at turn51 we are at 9? \n            Then we need one more action: turn51: S\n\n        But wait: after 11 actions (from turn40 to turn50) we are at turn51 at 9. Then we do action at turn51: S -> then at turn52 we are at 9. But we require to be at 9 at turn40+H-1. So 40+H-1=51? Then H=12. Then we output 12 actions.\n\n        But note: at turn51 we are at 9? Actually, the action at turn50 (U) moves us from 8 at turn50 to 9 at turn51. So at turn51 we are at 9. Then we do S at turn51. Then we are at 9 at turn52. But we only care about turn51 (40+12-1=51) being at 9. And it is.\n\n        This sequence is 12 actions, same as the previous.\n\nBut which one is minimal? They are both H=12.\n\nIs there a path with H=11? \n\nWe need to be at 9 at turn40+11-1=50. So we need to be at 9 at turn50.\n\nHow many moves? From 0 to 9: 9 moves. So we need 9 upward moves. But we have 10 actions? (from turn40 to turn49: 10 actions). Then we can do 9 U and one S? \n\nBut we must avoid collisions. The minimal time to go from 0 to 9 is 9 moves (if we do U every turn). Then we would be at 9 at turn49. Then we require H such that 40+H-1=49 -> H=10. But we saw that the straight path fails at turn42.\n\nSo we need to detour. The detour we did added 2 extra turns (we got to 9 at turn51 instead of 49). So we cannot do it in 10.\n\nBut can we do it in 11? \n\nWe need to be at 9 at turn50 (because 40+11-1=50). So we need to get to 9 in 10 moves? (from turn40 to turn49: 10 actions, which would get us to turn50). \n\nBut we start at 0 at turn40. Then if we do 9 U moves and one extra move (which could be S or D) then we would be at 9 only if the extra move doesn't reduce the count. But 9 U moves in 10 actions: we must have 9 U and 1 non-U. \n\nBut if we do 9 U and 1 S: then we are at 9 in 9 moves and then we do S in the 10th move? Then we are at 9 at the end. \n\nBut the moves:\n\n   Let the non-U move be at some turn. Then we have to compensate by an extra U? \n\nActually, the net displacement is the number of U minus the number of D. We need net +9.\n\nSo if we do a D at some point, we have to do an extra U. \n\nTherefore, to get to 9, we must have at least 9 U moves. And the total moves is the number of actions. So if we do 10 actions: we can have 9 U and 1 S, or 10 U (but then we would go to 10 which is invalid) so we cannot do 10 U. We can do 9 U and 1 S: then we are at 9 at the 10th move? \n\nBut the 10th move is the last action at turn49. Then at turn50 we are at 9 (if the last action is S and we were at 9 at turn49) or if the last action is U and we were at 8 at turn49 then we go to 9 at turn50.\n\nBut we must be at 9 at turn50. \n\nSo one possibility: we do 9 U moves and 1 S. The S can be at any time? But we must avoid collisions.\n\nAlternatively, we can do 10 U? But then we would go to 10 at the last step, which is invalid. So we cannot.\n\nSo we have to do 9 U and 1 non-U (S or D). But if we do a D, we have to do an extra U to compensate. So total moves: 10 actions: 10 moves, net displacement: (number of U) - (number of D). \n\nIf we do 10 actions: let u = number of U, d = number of D, s = number of S, then u+d+s=10, and u-d=9.\n\nThen: u = 9+d, and 9+d + d + s = 10 -> 9 + 2d + s = 10 -> 2d+s=1.\n\nSo d can be 0 and s=1 -> then u=9, d=0, s=1: which is 9 U and 1 S.\nOr d=1 and s=-1? -> not possible.\n\nSo the only possibility is 9 U and 1 S.\n\nWe need to place the S somewhere so that we avoid all collisions.\n\nWe start at 0 at turn40.\n\nThe straight path: \n   Turn40: U ->1\n   Turn41: U ->2 -> collides at freeway2 at turn42? \n        But note: we are at freeway2 at turn42? Actually, at turn42 we are at 2 (because we did U at turn41). Then we have collision.\n\nBut if we do an S at one of the moves, we can shift the entire path.\n\nFor example, if we do S at turn40: \n   Turn40: S -> still at 0 at turn41.\n   Turn41: U -> to 1 at turn42.\n   Turn42: U -> to 2 at turn43.\n   Then we are at freeway2 at turn43: \n        dt=3: freeway2: tail=-83+36*3=-83+108=25, head=-48+108=60 -> [25,60] -> does not include 0 -> safe.\n\n   Then we can continue: \n        Turn43: U ->3 at turn44: freeway3: dt=4: tail=-83+36*4=61, head=-48+144=96 -> safe.\n        Turn44: U ->4 at turn45: freeway4: dt=5: tail=-83+180=97, head=-48+180=132 -> safe.\n        Turn45: U ->5 at turn46: freeway5: \n             cars: \n                 (48,37,right,6): dt=6: tail=37+36=73, head=48+36=84 -> safe.\n                 (12,1,right,6): tail=1+36=37, head=12+36=48 -> safe.\n                 (-24,-35,right,6): tail=-35+36=1, head=-24+36=12 -> [1,12] -> does not include 0? -> safe.\n        Turn46: U ->6 at turn47: freeway6: same cars, dt=7:\n                 (48,37): tail=37+42=79, head=48+42=90 -> safe.\n                 (12,1): tail=1+42=43, head=12+42=54 -> safe.\n                 (-24,-35): tail=-35+42=7, head=-24+42=18 -> safe.\n        Turn47: U ->7 at turn48: freeway7: (48,37,right,12): dt=8: tail=37+96=133, head=48+96=144 -> safe.\n        Turn48: U ->8 at turn49: freeway8: (48,37,right,4): dt=9: tail=37+36=73, head=48+36=84 -> safe.\n        Turn49: U ->9 at turn50: goal.\n\n        Then we are at 9 at turn50. \n\n        But we have done 9 U and 1 S: total 10 actions? \n           Actions: \n              turn40: S\n              turn41: U\n              turn42: U\n              turn43: U\n              turn44: U\n              turn45: U\n              turn46: U\n              turn47: U\n              turn48: U\n              turn49: U   -> 10 actions.\n\n        Then we require H=11? Because the sequence is from t=0 to H-1 -> 10 actions -> H=11.\n\n        And we are at 9 at turn50 = 40+11-1 = 51? -> 40+11-1=50? \n            H=11 -> 40+H-1=40+11-1=50 -> yes.\n\n        So we are at 9 at turn50.\n\n        This sequence has H=11.\n\n        Let me verify the collisions:\n\n            Turn40: at 0 -> safe.\n            Turn41: at 0 -> safe? (we did S at turn40: so at turn41 we are at 0 -> no car)\n            Turn41: action U -> so at turn42 we are at 1 -> freeway1: \n                T=42: freeway1: dt=2: tail=-71+24*2=-71+48=-23, head=-48+48=0 -> [-23,0] -> includes 0? yes. -> collision at turn42.\n\n        Oh no! We are at freeway1 at turn42 and the car covers 0.\n\n        So we collide at turn42.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot do S at turn40? \n\n        What if we do S at a different turn?\n\n        We need to avoid freeway1 at turn42? \n\n        We are at freeway1 at turn42: and the car is there.\n\n        How about we do S at turn41? \n\n        Sequence:\n            Turn40: U -> to 1 at turn41: freeway1 at turn41: dt=1: tail=-71+24=-47, head=-48+24=-24 -> safe.\n            Turn41: S -> stay at 1 at turn42: then at turn42 we are at freeway1: \n                dt=2: tail=-71+48=-23, head=-48+48=0 -> [-23,0] -> collision.\n\n        So same problem.\n\n        What if we do S at turn42? \n            Turn40: U -> turn41:1 (safe at freeway1: dt1: [-47,-24] safe)\n            Turn41: U -> turn42:2 -> freeway2: dt=2: [-11,24] -> collision.\n\n        What if we do S at turn43?\n            Turn40: U ->41:1 (safe)\n            Turn41: U ->42:2 -> collision at freeway2.\n\n        So we cannot avoid the collision at freeway2 at turn42 by simply inserting an S? \n\n        We must shift the time we are at freeway2 to a time when the car does not cover 0.\n\n        The car on freeway2: \n            It covers 0 when: \n                tail <= 0 <= head\n                -83+36*dt <= 0 <= -48+36*dt\n\n            Solve: \n                -83+36*dt <=0 -> 36*dt<=83 -> dt<=83/36≈2.305 -> dt<=2 (since integer)\n                0<=-48+36*dt -> 36*dt>=48 -> dt>=48/36=4/3≈1.33 -> dt>=2.\n\n            So dt=2: then the span is [-83+72, -48+72] = [-11,24] -> covers 0.\n\n            For dt>=3: \n                tail = -83+36*3 = -83+108=25, head=-48+108=60 -> 0 not in [25,60] -> safe.\n\n            So we must be at freeway2 at a turn with dt>=3.\n\n        Similarly, for freeway1: \n            It covers 0 when: \n                -71+24*dt <=0<=-48+24*dt\n                -71+24*dt<=0 -> 24*dt<=71 -> dt<=71/24≈2.95 -> dt<=2\n                0<=-48+24*dt -> 24*dt>=48 -> dt>=2.\n\n            So only at dt=2: [-23,0] -> covers 0.\n\n        Therefore, we must avoid being at freeway1 at dt=2 and freeway2 at dt=2.\n\n        How can we arrange the moves? \n\n        We start at 0 at dt=0 (turn40).\n\n        We need to be at freeway1 at a time when dt != 2, and freeway2 at a time when dt != 2.\n\n        And we need to go from 0 to 1 to 2.\n\n        The times we pass freeway1: it must be at a turn T such that dt = T-40 = some value not 2.\n        Similarly for freeway2: not at dt=2.\n\n        We will be at freeway1 at the turn immediately after we leave 0 and go to 1. \n        Then we go to freeway2 at the next turn.\n\n        So the two consecutive turns: \n            T1: we are at freeway1 -> dt1 = T1-40\n            T2: we are at freeway2 -> dt2 = T2-40 = dt1+1\n\n        We require dt1 != 2 and dt2 != 2.\n\n        But if dt1=2, then dt2=3 -> which is safe for freeway2 but not safe for freeway1.\n        If dt1=1, then dt2=2 -> safe for freeway1? \n            freeway1 at dt1=1: safe (as we saw) \n            but freeway2 at dt2=2: unsafe.\n\n        If dt1=0: \n            Then we are at freeway1 at turn40? But we start at turn40 at 0. We cannot be at freeway1 at turn40. We would have to have moved at turn40 to 1 at turn41 -> then at turn41 we are at freeway1: dt1=1.\n\n        So we cannot have dt1=0.\n\n        If dt1=3: \n            Then we are at freeway1 at turn43: safe (dt1=3: freeway1: [1,24] -> safe)\n            Then freeway2 at turn44: dt2=4: safe.\n\n        How to get to freeway1 at dt1=3? \n            We start at turn40 at 0.\n            We need to get to 1 at turn43.\n\n            That means we spend 3 turns to go from 0 to 1? \n\n            We can: \n                Turn40: S (stay at 0) -> turn41:0\n                Turn41: S (stay at 0) -> turn42:0\n                Turn42: U (to 1) -> turn43:1\n\n            Then at turn43: freeway1: safe (dt=3).\n            Then turn43: U -> turn44:2 -> freeway2: dt=4: safe.\n\n        Then we can continue with U moves to 9.\n\n        How many moves? \n            From turn40 to turn43: we are at 1.\n            Then we go to 2 at turn44, 3 at turn45, 4 at turn46, 5 at turn47, 6 at turn48, 7 at turn49, 8 at turn50, 9 at turn51.\n\n            Then we are at 9 at turn51.\n\n            Then we require H such that 40+H-1=51 -> H=12.\n\n        But we want H=11? \n\n        Alternatively, we might go faster after freeway2.\n\n        However, we cannot skip any freeway? We have to go through 3,4,...,8.\n\n        The minimal time from 2 to 9 is 7 moves (7 U).\n\n        So we get to 2 at turn44, then at turn51 we get to 9: 7 moves -> 7 turns. So total from start: \n            turn40:0\n            turn41:0\n            turn42:0\n            turn43:1\n            turn44:2\n            turn45:3\n            turn46:4\n            turn47:5\n            turn48:6\n            turn49:7\n            turn50:8\n            turn51:9\n\n        Then we are at 9 at turn51 -> H=12.\n\n        But we want to be at 9 at turn50 (for H=11: 40+11-1=50). \n\n        How can we be at 9 at turn50? We need 9 moves upward. \n\n        We have 10 actions (H=11: 11 actions from turn40 to turn50). \n\n        And we need to avoid the collisions.\n\n        We know we must be at freeway1 at a dt not 2 and freeway2 at a dt not 2.\n\n        And we are constrained by the movement: only one step per turn.\n\n        The earliest we can be at freeway1 is turn41 (if we do U at turn40) -> dt=1.\n        Then freeway2 at turn42 -> dt=2 -> unsafe.\n\n        The next chance: \n            Be at freeway1 at dt=1 (turn41) and then at freeway2 at dt=3? But we can't jump over freeway2.\n\n        Or be at freeway1 at dt=3 (turn43) and freeway2 at dt=4 (turn44) -> safe, but then we get to 2 at turn44. Then we need 7 more U moves -> so we get to 9 at turn51.\n\n        But we need to be at 9 at turn50. \n\n        We can try to go faster by not waiting? \n\n        But we have to wait at 0 for two turns to avoid freeway1 at dt=2.\n\n        Then we are at 1 at turn43, 2 at turn44, ... 9 at turn51.\n\n        We cannot get to 9 earlier than turn51 if we start moving upward at turn42.\n\n        Alternatively, we can go down and then up? But that would take more moves.\n\n        Or we can try to skip some freeway by going up twice? But we cannot.\n\n        So it seems H=11 is not achievable.\n\n        Therefore, minimal H is 12.\n\n        We have two strategies:\n\n        Strategy A: \n          40: U\n          41: D   (back to 0)\n          42: U   (to 1)\n          43: U   (to 2)\n          44: U   (to 3)\n          ... until 51: S\n\n        But we already computed that this gets to 9 at turn51.\n\n        Strategy B:\n          40: S\n          41: S\n          42: U   (to 1)\n          43: U   (to 2)\n          44: U   (to 3)\n          ... \n          50: U   (to 9 at turn51)\n          51: S\n\n        Both are 12 actions.\n\n        But note: in strategy B, we don't go down, so it might be simpler.\n\n        However, we must check the entire path for strategy B.\n\n        We did check freeway1 and freeway2. What about freeway5 at turn47? \n            freeway5 at turn47: \n                dt = 47-40 = 7\n                car1: (48,37,right,6): tail=37+6*7=37+42=79, head=48+42=90 -> safe.\n                car2: (12,1,right,6): tail=1+42=43, head=12+42=54 -> safe.\n                car3: (-24,-35,right,6): tail=-35+42=7, head=-24+42=18 -> safe.\n\n        But wait, the third car: at turn47: tail=7, head=18. The player is at freeway5 (y=5) at turn47. The car spans x from 7 to 18. The player is at x=0. 0 is not in [7,18] -> safe.\n\n        Similarly, freeway6 at turn48: \n            dt=8\n            car3: tail=-35+6*8=-35+48=13, head=-24+48=24 -> [13,24] -> safe.\n\n        So both strategies work.\n\n        We can choose strategy B because it doesn't require going down.\n\n        Sequence for strategy B:\n\n            Turn40: S\n            Turn41: S\n            Turn42: U   -> at turn43: y=1 (freeway1) -> safe? \n                freeway1 at turn43 (dt=3): tail=-71+24*3= -71+72=1, head=-48+72=24 -> [1,24] -> does not include 0 -> safe.\n\n            Turn43: U   -> at turn44: y=2 (freeway2) -> safe? \n                freeway2 at turn44 (dt=4): tail=-83+36*4= -83+144=61, head=-48+144=96 -> safe.\n\n            Turn44: U   -> at turn45: y=3 (freeway3) -> \n                freeway3: car (-48,-83,right,36) -> dt=5: tail=-83+180=97, head=-48+180=132 -> safe.\n\n            Turn45: U   -> at turn46: y=4 (freeway4) -> \n                freeway4: same car: dt=6: tail=-83+216=133, head=-48+216=168 -> safe.\n\n            Turn46: U   -> at turn47: y=5 (freeway5) -> \n                three cars:\n                  car1: (48,37,right,6): dt=7: tail=37+42=79, head=48+42=90 -> safe.\n                  car2: (12,1,right,6): tail=1+42=43, head=12+42=54 -> safe.\n                  car3: (-24,-35,right,6): tail=-35+42=7, head=-24+42=18 -> safe.\n\n            Turn47: U   -> at turn48: y=6 (freeway6) -> \n                same three cars: dt=8: \n                  car1: tail=37+48=85, head=48+48=96 -> safe.\n                  car2: tail=1+48=49, head=12+48=60 -> safe.\n                  car3: tail=-35+48=13, head=-24+48=24 -> safe.\n\n            Turn48: U   -> at turn49: y=7 (freeway7) -> \n                one car: (48,37,right,12): dt=9: tail=37+108=145, head=48+108=156 -> safe.\n\n            Turn49: U   -> at turn50: y=8 (freeway8) -> \n                one car: (48,37,right,4): dt=10: tail=37+40=77, head=48+40=88 -> safe.\n\n            Turn50: U   -> at turn51: y=9 -> goal.\n            Then we need to do an action at turn51: we do S.\n\n        So the sequence of 12 actions:\n\n            Turn40: S\n            Turn41: S\n            Turn42: U\n            Turn43: U\n            Turn44: U\n            Turn45: U\n            Turn46: U\n            Turn47: U\n            Turn48: U\n            Turn49: U\n            Turn50: U\n            Turn51: S\n\n        But note: the last action at turn51 is S, and we are at 9 at turn51 (which is 40+12-1=51) -> satisfies.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do without the last S? \n\n        But we need 12 actions. The sequence must be of length H=12. So we have to output 12 actions.\n\n        And the last action at turn51: we are at 9, so we can do S.\n\n        But we could also do D? But that would move us to 8 at turn52, but we don't care. However, it's unnecessary.\n\n        We choose S.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 40: S\nTurn 41: S\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: S\n}\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"current turn is t1\", and we are to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... up to t1+H-1.\n\nHere, t1=40, and H=12, so we output from turn40 to turn40+12-1=51.\n\nYes.\n\nBut note: the car on freeway1 at turn43: the span is [1,24] -> does not include 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all others are safe.\n\nThis is minimal H=12.\n\nWe cannot do H=11.\n\nSo we output the above.\n\nLet me double-check freeway1 at turn43: \n   car: (-48, -71, right, 24) at turn43: dt=3\n   tail = -71 + 24*3 = -71+72 = 1\n   head = -48 + 72 = 24\n   so [1,24] -> 0 is not in there -> safe.\n\nAnd freeway2 at turn44: \n   car: (-48, -83, right, 36) -> dt=4\n   tail = -83 + 36*4 = -83+144=61\n   head = -48+144=96 -> [61,96] -> safe.\n\nThe rest we already checked.\n\nSo this works.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 40, while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 12. The sequence of actions is designed to avoid collisions by waiting at \\(y = 0\\) for two turns to shift the timing of crossing freeways 1 and 2, ensuring the player is not on these freeways when cars cover \\(x = 0\\).\n\n- At turn 40, the player is at \\(y = 0\\). Staying (S) avoids moving into freeway 1 prematurely.\n- At turn 41, staying (S) continues to avoid freeway 1 until a safe time.\n- At turn 42, moving up (U) to \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1) at turn 43 is safe because the car on freeway 1 at \\(dt = 3\\) (turn 43) spans \\([1, 24]\\), not covering \\(x = 0\\).\n- At turn 43, moving up (U) to \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2) at turn 44 is safe because the car on freeway 2 at \\(dt = 4\\) (turn 44) spans \\([61, 96]\\), not covering \\(x = 0\\).\n- Subsequent upward moves (U) from turn 44 to turn 50 progress through freeways 3 to 8, all safe as cars do not cover \\(x = 0\\) at the respective turns:\n  - Freeway 3 at turn 45 (\\(dt = 5\\)): \\([97, 132]\\)\n  - Freeway 4 at turn 46 (\\(dt = 6\\)): \\([133, 168]\\)\n  - Freeway 5 at turn 47 (\\(dt = 7\\)): cars span \\([79, 90]\\), \\([43, 54]\\), \\([7, 18]\\) (none cover 0)\n  - Freeway 6 at turn 48 (\\(dt = 8\\)): cars span \\([85, 96]\\), \\([49, 60]\\), \\([13, 24]\\) (none cover 0)\n  - Freeway 7 at turn 49 (\\(dt = 9\\)): \\([145, 156]\\)\n  - Freeway 8 at turn 50 (\\(dt = 10\\)): \\([77, 88]\\)\n- At turn 50, moving up (U) reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 51. Since \\(y = 9\\) has no cars, no collision occurs.\n- At turn 51, staying (S) maintains \\(y = 9\\), and the sequence ends with the player at \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 51 (which is turn \\(40 + 12 - 1 = 51\\)).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 40: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 41: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 42: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 43: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 44: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 45: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 46: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 47: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 48: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 49: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 50: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 51: \\text{S}\n}",

For example, freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24). Since it's right-moving, the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [-71, -48]? But the table says \"head\" and \"tail\", and for right-moving the head is the front? Actually, the update rule for right-moving uses [τ, h] -> [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt]. So in the data, the first number is the head and the second is the tail? But for right-moving, the head should be the rightmost (larger x) and tail the leftmost (smaller x). So in the example: (-48, -71, right, 24): \n  - At t1=42, the car is from x=-71 to x=-48? But -71 < -48, so that would be from left to right? Actually, that doesn't make sense because -71 is more negative. So the head is at -48 and tail at -71? Then the span is from tail to head: [-71, -48]. But the update rule for right-moving: [τ, h] = [-71, -48] becomes at time T: [-71 + 24*(T-42), -48 + 24*(T-42)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving we don't have any in this problem? All are right-moving? Actually, looking at the table, all directions are \"right\". So we only need to handle right-moving cars.\n\nBut note: freeway 5 and 6 have multiple cars. For example, freeway 5: \n  (48, 37, right, 6), (12, 1, right, 6), (-24, -35, right, 6)\n\nFor each car, we compute the span at time T (relative to t1=42) as:\n  [τ + s*(T-42), h + s*(T-42)]\n\nBut note: in the representation, the first number is head and the second is tail? Actually, the update rule for right-moving uses [τ, h] and the data is given as (head, tail). So we need to interpret: \n  In the update rule: [τ, h] -> [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt]\n  But in the data, the car is given as (head, tail). For right-moving, the head is the front (which is the right end) and tail is the rear (left end). So the span at t1 is [tail, head]? \n\nWait, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\". And in the data, the car is represented as (head, tail). So is head = h and tail = τ? Then the span at t1 is [tail, head]? \n\nYes, because the update rule uses [τ, h] and the data gives (head, tail) meaning h = head and τ = tail. So for the first car on freeway 5: head=48, tail=37 -> span at t1 is [37,48]? But that is a very short car (only 12 units long) and it's moving right at speed 6.\n\nBut wait: 37 to 48? Then at time T, the car is [37 + 6*(T-42), 48 + 6*(T-42)].\n\nSimilarly, the second car: (12,1,right,6) -> [1,12] at t1, then [1+6*(T-42), 12+6*(T-42)]\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,6) -> [-35,-24] at t1, then [-35+6*(T-42), -24+6*(T-42)]\n\nBut note: the problem says that collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T. So for a freeway, we have to check every car on that freeway.\n\nWe are to compute the minimal H and the sequence of actions.\n\nWe start at y=0 at turn t1=42. We need to reach y=9. We can only change y by -1,0,1 per turn.\n\nNote: we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe are at y=0 at the initial turn (turn 42). We are not on any freeway (since freeways are 1 to 8) so at turn 42 we are safe. Then we take action a_42, which leads to y_43 = y_42 + Δy.\n\nBut note: at the moment of moving, when we are at a freeway (y from 1 to 8) we must check the cars on that freeway at that turn.\n\nWe are to find a path from y=0 to y=9 in minimal turns.\n\nSince the grid is small (only 10 vertical positions) and the moves are limited, we can use BFS in the state space of (turn_offset, y) where turn_offset = t - t1 (so from 0 to ...). But note the cars move over time, so we must check for collisions at each step.\n\nHowever, note that the cars move linearly and the problem is periodic? Actually, the cars are moving continuously. But the x-coordinate of the cars change linearly with time.\n\nWe are only concerned with whether the car covers x=0 at a particular turn T.\n\nFor a given freeway k and a given car on it, we can compute the times T (relative to t1=42) when the car covers x=0.\n\nBut note: multiple cars per freeway.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k (from 1 to 8) the set of turns T (>=42) at which there is at least one car on freeway k that covers x=0.\n\nThen, the player must avoid being on freeway k at turn T if freeway k is dangerous at T.\n\nBut note: the player's position at turn T is determined by the actions taken from turn 42 to T.\n\nWe are to minimize H, the number of turns (from turn 42 to turn 42+H-1) such that at turn 42+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nWe start at turn 42 at y=0. Then we take H actions: at turn 42 (action a_42) to turn 42+H-1 (the last action). Then at the next turn (turn 42+H) we would be at y_{42+H}, but we don't require that. We require that at turn 42+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nSo the last state is at turn 42+H-1 with y=9.\n\nWe can model the state as (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at 42) and y in {0,1,...,9}. The goal is to reach (t,9) for some t>=42, and we want minimal H = t - 42 + 1? \n\nWait: \n  Turn 42: we are at (42,0). \n  After H-1 actions, we are at turn 42+H-1, and we want y_{42+H-1}=9.\n\nSo the number of actions is H, and the turns we use are from 42 to 42+H-1 (H turns of actions). \n\nWe can do BFS over the state (time, y). The time starts at 42 and increases. But note that the time can go arbitrarily high? However, we are going to 9, and we can only move one step at a time, so H at least 9 (if we go straight up). But we might have to wait to avoid cars, so H might be more.\n\nBut note: the car movements are linear and periodic? Actually, the cars are moving at constant speed. The x-coordinate of the car segments are linear in time. The condition for a car (on freeway k) to cover x=0 at time T is:\n\nFor a right-moving car with initial (at t1=42) span [τ, h] (which is [tail, head]), then at time T, the span is [τ + s*(T-42), h + s*(T-42)].\n\nWe require that 0 is in [A, B] where A = τ + s*(T-42), B = h + s*(T-42). So:\n\nA <= 0 <= B\n\nWhich is:\n\nτ + s*(T-42) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-42)\n\nSolving for T:\n\nFrom first inequality: T-42 >= ceil(-τ / s)   if s>0? But note τ is negative? Actually, let's see the data.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: car (-48, -71, right, 24) -> head=-48, tail=-71, s=24.\n\nSo at time T, the car is [ -71 + 24*(T-42), -48 + 24*(T-42) ].\n\nWe need:\n  -71 + 24*(T-42) <= 0 <= -48 + 24*(T-42)\n\nSolve:\n\nLeft: 24*(T-42) <= 71  -> T-42 <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958 -> T <= 44.958 -> so T<=44? (since T integer) -> T-42 <= 2 -> T<=44.\n\nBut wait, actually:\n\n  -71 + 24*(T-42) <= 0  => 24*(T-42) <= 71 => T-42 <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958 -> so T-42 can be 0,1,2 -> T=42,43,44.\n\nThen the right inequality: 0 <= -48 + 24*(T-42) => 24*(T-42) >= 48 => T-42 >= 2.\n\nSo together: T-42>=2 and T-42<=2.958 -> so T-42=2 -> T=44.\n\nCheck: at T=44: \n  left: -71+24*2 = -71+48 = -23 <=0\n  right: -48+48=0>=0 -> so yes, at T=44, the car covers 0.\n\nBut what about T=42: \n  left: -71 <=0, right: -48>=0? no -> so not covered.\nT=43: left: -71+24= -47<=0, right: -48+24=-24>=0? no.\nT=44: as above, yes.\n\nSo freeway 1 is dangerous only at T=44.\n\nSimilarly, let's compute for all freeways.\n\nBut note: freeway 5 has multiple cars. We need to check for each car independently. If any car covers 0 at turn T, then the freeway is dangerous at T.\n\nWe'll precompute for each freeway k (1..8) the set of turns T (>=42) for which at least one car on k covers x=0.\n\nBut note: the cars might cover 0 at multiple times? Actually, each car might cover 0 for a contiguous set of turns? But since the car moves continuously, it will cover 0 for an interval of time. However, we are only checking integer turns. The condition is for integer T.\n\nSo for a car, we can compute the interval of time (in real numbers) during which it covers 0, and then the integer T in that interval.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute:\n\nFor a car (tail, head, s) [note: we interpret the data as (head, tail) for a right-moving car, so the initial segment is [tail, head] at T=42? Actually, the update rule uses [τ, h] and the data gives (head, tail). So we have τ = tail, h = head.\n\nSo condition at time T (integer) for one car:\n\n  tail + s*(T-42) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-42)\n\nWhich is:\n\n  T >= ceil( ( -head ) / s ) + 42   [from 0<=head+s*(T-42) => s*(T-42)>=-head => T-42 >= ceil(-head/s) if s>0? But note: if head is negative, -head is positive]\n\nBut actually, we can write:\n\n  T >= ceil( ( -head ) / s + 42 )? Let me rearrange:\n\nFrom 0 <= head + s*(T-42) => s*(T-42) >= -head => T-42 >= ceil(-head/s)   [if s>0, and we are using real numbers, then T-42 must be at least the smallest integer >= -head/s]\n\nSimilarly, from tail + s*(T-42) <=0 => s*(T-42) <= -tail => T-42 <= floor(-tail/s)\n\nSo the integer T must satisfy:\n\n  ceil( (-head) / s ) <= T-42 <= floor( (-tail) / s )\n\nBut note: the direction of inequalities. Let me check with the example:\n\nFreeway 1: head=-48, tail=-71, s=24.\n\nThen:\n  (-head)/s = 48/24 = 2.0 -> ceil(2.0)=2\n  (-tail)/s = 71/24 ≈ 2.958 -> floor(2.958)=2\n\nSo T-42 must be between 2 and 2 -> so T=44.\n\nAnother example: freeway 5, first car: (48,37,right,6) -> head=48, tail=37, s=6.\n\nThen:\n  (-head)/s = -48/6 = -8 -> ceil(-8)= -8\n  (-tail)/s = -37/6 ≈ -6.166 -> floor(-6.166)= -7? \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because T-42 must be nonnegative? \n\nBut note: the condition is:\n\n  tail + s*(T-42) <= 0   => 37 + 6*(T-42) <=0 -> 6*(T-42) <= -37 -> T-42 <= -37/6 ≈ -6.166 -> so T-42 <= -7? (since integer) -> but T>=42, so no solution? \n\nIndeed, the car is at [37,48] at T=42, and it moves right. So it will never cover x=0? Because 37>0 and moving right.\n\nSimilarly, the second car: (12,1,right,6): head=12, tail=1 -> at T=42: [1,12]. It moves right. When will it cover 0? \n  Condition: 1+6*(T-42) <=0 <=12+6*(T-42)\n  First: 1+6*(T-42)<=0 -> 6*(T-42)<=-1 -> T-42<= -1/6 -> no solution? because T>=42, so no.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,6): head=-24, tail=-35, s=6.\n  (-head)/s = 24/6=4 -> ceil(4)=4\n  (-tail)/s = 35/6 ≈5.833 -> floor(5.833)=5\n  So T-42 must be between 4 and 5 -> T=46 or 47? \n\nCheck at T=46: \n  tail: -35+6*(4)= -35+24=-11 <=0\n  head: -24+24=0 >=0 -> so 0 is covered? Actually, the head is at 0? The condition is 0 is in [A,B] meaning A<=0<=B -> so if B=0 then 0 is included? Yes.\n\nAt T=47:\n  tail: -35+6*5 = -35+30=-5<=0\n  head: -24+30=6>=0 -> so 0 is covered.\n\nSo freeway 5 is dangerous at T=46 and 47? But wait, we have three cars, and the first two never cover 0. So only the third car causes danger at T=46 and 47.\n\nSimilarly, we need to do for every freeway.\n\nBut note: freeway 5 and 6 have the same car configurations? \n  Freeway 6: same as 5? Yes: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: (48,37,right,12) -> head=48, tail=37, s=12. \n  Will it cover 0? \n  Condition: 37+12*(T-42)<=0? -> 12*(T-42)<=-37 -> T-42<= -37/12≈-3.08 -> no.\n\nFreeway 8: (48,37,right,4) -> similarly, 37+4*(T-42)<=0 -> 4*(T-42)<=-37 -> T-42<=-9.25 -> no.\n\nSo freeway 7 and 8 are always safe? \n\nBut wait, freeway 1: only at T=44.\nFreeway 2: (-48,-83,right,36) -> head=-48, tail=-83, s=36.\n  (-head)/s=48/36=1.333 -> ceil(1.333)=2\n  (-tail)/s=83/36≈2.305 -> floor(2.305)=2\n  So T-42=2 -> T=44? \n\nBut let me check: \n  T=44: tail: -83+36*2 = -83+72=-11<=0, head: -48+72=24>=0 -> yes, covers 0.\n\nBut wait, the condition we derived: \n  ceil( (-head)/s ) = ceil(48/36)=ceil(1.333)=2\n  floor( (-tail)/s ) = floor(83/36)=floor(2.305)=2 -> so only T=44.\n\nBut what about T=43? \n  tail: -83+36*1 = -47<=0\n  head: -48+36=-12<0 -> so 0 is not in [-47,-12]? because -47<=0 but the upper bound is -12 which is <0 -> so 0 is not in the segment? \n  Actually, the segment is [-47, -12] and 0 is not in there.\n\nT=44: [-11,24] -> covers 0.\n\nT=45: [-83+36*3, -48+36*3] = [-83+108, -48+108] = [25,60] -> does not cover 0.\n\nSo only T=44.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-48,-83,right,36) -> same as above: only T=44.\n\nFreeway 4: same as 2 and 3: (-48,-83,right,36) -> T=44.\n\nSo summary of dangerous turns for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: {44}\nFreeway 2: {44}\nFreeway 3: {44}\nFreeway 4: {44}\nFreeway 5: {46,47}   [from the third car]\nFreeway 6: {46,47}   [same as 5]\nFreeway 7: none\nFreeway 8: none\n\nWe also note that freeways 7 and 8 are always safe.\n\nNow, the player must avoid being on a freeway k at a turn T if T is in the dangerous set for k.\n\nWe are at turn 42 at y=0. We are safe at y=0 (not a freeway). Then we take actions.\n\nWe want to go from y=0 to y=9. The minimal number of turns is at least 9 (if we go up every turn). But we have to avoid dangerous turns.\n\nLet's try to go straight up:\n\nTurn 42: at y=0 -> safe (not on freeway)\nAction: U -> then at turn 43, we are at y=1.\n\nBut at turn 43, we are on freeway 1? and we check: freeway 1 is dangerous at T=44, not 43 -> so safe? \nBut wait, we need to check at turn 43: freeway 1 at turn43: \n  We computed that for freeway1, the dangerous turn is 44. At turn43: \n    car on freeway1: [-71+24*(43-42), -48+24*(43-42)] = [-71+24, -48+24] = [-47,-24] -> does not cover 0? so safe.\n\nThen at turn43: we are at y=1 (freeway1) and safe? Then we can do U again to y=2 at turn44.\n\nAt turn44: we are at y=2 (freeway2) and at turn44, freeway2 is dangerous! So we collide.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway2 at turn44.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being at freeway2 at turn44.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 1,2,3,4 are dangerous at turn44? But note: we are at freeway2 at turn44: that's dangerous.\n\nBut what if we are at freeway1 at turn44? freeway1 is dangerous at turn44? yes. Similarly for freeway3 and 4? So we cannot be on freeways 1,2,3,4 at turn44.\n\nWhat about freeway5 at turn44? freeway5 is dangerous at 46,47, not 44 -> so safe.\n\nSo at turn44, we must be either at y=0,5,6,7,8,9? or not on freeway (which are 1-8) so y=0 or y=9 is safe? but we are at the beginning.\n\nWe start at y=0 at turn42. We have to move up.\n\nWe need to plan:\n\nOption: wait at y=0 for one turn? Then at turn42: action S -> stay at y=0 (safe). Then at turn43: we are still at y=0? Then we can start moving.\n\nBut then we are delayed.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid the dangerous freeways at the dangerous turn by being above or below.\n\nSince freeways 1-4 are dangerous at turn44, we want to be either below freeway1 (y=0) or above freeway4 (y>=5) at turn44.\n\nBut at turn44, we have had 2 moves (from turn42 to turn43 and turn43 to turn44). So we can be at most at y=2 (if we go up twice) or y=0 (if we stay twice) or y=1 (if we go up then stay, or stay then up).\n\nWe cannot reach y=5 by turn44: that would require 5 moves? from turn42 to turn44: two moves -> maximum y=2.\n\nSo at turn44, we must be at y=0,1, or 2.\n\nBut if we are at y=0 at turn44: safe (not freeway)\ny=1: freeway1 -> dangerous at turn44? yes -> collision.\ny=2: freeway2 -> dangerous at turn44? yes -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=1 or 2 at turn44. The only safe place at turn44 is y=0.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y=0 at turn44.\n\nSo at turn44, we must be at y=0.\n\nHow to get to y=0 at turn44? \n\nWe start at turn42: y=0.\nAt turn42: we can do S (stay) -> then at turn43: y=0.\nAt turn43: we do S again -> then at turn44: y=0.\n\nAlternatively, we could go down? But we are at y=0, so down would be invalid? because y cannot go below 0. So we can only do S.\n\nSo we do two stays: \n  Turn42: S\n  Turn43: S\n\nThen at turn44: y=0 (safe).\n\nNow at turn44, we are at y=0. Then we can start moving up.\n\nBut we have freeways 5 and 6 dangerous at turn46 and 47. So we must avoid being at freeway5 or 6 at turns46 and47.\n\nWe are at turn44: y=0.\n\nWe want to reach y=9.\n\nFrom turn44 onward, we can move up.\n\nBut we have to avoid freeways 5 and 6 at turns46 and47.\n\nLet's see the timeline:\n\nTurn44: at y=0 (safe)\nAction: U -> then at turn45: y=1 (freeway1). Now, freeway1 at turn45: we computed that freeway1 was only dangerous at 44. At turn45: \n  freeway1: [-71+24*(45-42), -48+24*3] = [-71+72, -48+72] = [1,24] -> does not cover 0? so safe.\n\nThen at turn45: we are at y=1 (safe). Then we can do U again to y=2 at turn46.\n\nAt turn46: we are at y=2 (freeway2). Now, freeway2: we had only danger at 44. At turn46: \n  freeway2: car (-48,-83,right,36): \n      at T=46: [-83+36*(46-42), -48+36*4] = [-83+144, -48+144] = [61,96] -> no 0 -> safe.\n\nBut wait, we are at freeway2 at turn46? and freeway2 is safe at turn46? yes.\n\nBut we have to worry about freeway5 and6 at turn46 and47? But we are at freeway2, which is not 5 or 6, so we are safe.\n\nThen at turn46: we can do U to y=3 at turn47.\n\nAt turn47: we are at y=3 (freeway3). Check freeway3 at turn47: \n  freeway3: same as freeway2? car (-48,-83,right,36): \n      at T=47: [-83+36*5, -48+36*5] = [-83+180, -48+180] = [97,132] -> safe.\n\nBut also, we are not on freeway5 or6? so safe.\n\nThen at turn47: we do U to y=4 at turn48.\n\nAt turn48: y=4 (freeway4). Check freeway4: same car? at T=48: [-83+36*6, -48+36*6] = [-83+216, -48+216] = [133,168] -> safe.\n\nThen we continue: \n  turn48: U -> y=5 at turn49.\n  turn49: at freeway5? and at turn49: freeway5 dangerous at 46,47? not 49 -> safe.\n  Then U to y=6 at turn50: freeway6 at turn50: dangerous at 46,47? not 50 -> safe.\n  Then U to y=7 at turn51: freeway7 -> always safe.\n  Then U to y=8 at turn52: freeway8 -> always safe.\n  Then U to y=9 at turn53: and we are at y=9 at turn53? \n\nBut note: we require that at turn53 we are at y=9? Actually, the state at turn53: we are at y=9? \n\nWe started at turn44: y=0.\nThen:\n  turn44: U -> turn45: y=1\n  turn45: U -> turn46: y=2\n  turn46: U -> turn47: y=3\n  turn47: U -> turn48: y=4\n  turn48: U -> turn49: y=5\n  turn49: U -> turn50: y=6\n  turn50: U -> turn51: y=7\n  turn51: U -> turn52: y=8\n  turn52: U -> turn53: y=9\n\nSo at turn53, we are at y=9.\n\nBut we started at turn42. We did:\n  turn42: S\n  turn43: S\n  turn44: U\n  ... until turn52: U\n\nThen the last action is at turn52 (which leads to y=9 at turn53). But we require that at turn52 we are at ...? Actually, we are at y=8 at turn52, then we do U to go to y=9 at turn53. \n\nBut the problem: we require the state at turn42+H-1 to be at (0,9). The state at the turn after the last action is at turn42+H. \n\nWe have taken H actions: \n  actions at turns: 42,43,...,42+H-1.\n\nThen at turn42+H, we are at the next state. But we want at turn42+H-1, we are at the state after the action? \n\nActually, the state is updated at the next turn. So:\n\nAt turn t, we are at state (t, y_t). Then we choose action a_t, then we move to state (t+1, y_{t+1}).\n\nWe start at (42,0). We take H actions: a_42, a_43, ..., a_{42+H-1}. Then we end at state (42+H, y_{42+H}).\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1\". \n\nWait, the problem says: \"at turn t_1+H-1, we are at (0,9)\". \n\nBut according to the update: at turn t, we are at (0, y_t). Then we take action a_t, and then at turn t+1 we are at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nSo the state at turn t is (0, y_t). \n\nTherefore, we require that at turn t1+H-1 = 42+H-1, we are at (0,9).\n\nSo in our plan, we are at (0,9) at turn53? Then 42+H-1=53 -> H-1=11 -> H=12.\n\nBut we started at turn42. Then the actions are taken at turns 42,43,...,53? But that would be 12 actions? \n\nBut note: the state at turn42 is given. Then we take an action at turn42 to go to turn43, etc.\n\nWe require the state at turn42+H-1 to be (0,9). \n\nIn our plan:\n\nAt turn42: y=0 (given)\nAt turn43: after action at turn42: we did S -> y=0\nAt turn44: after action at turn43: we did S -> y=0\nAt turn45: after action at turn44: we did U -> y=1\nAt turn46: y=2\nAt turn47: y=3\nAt turn48: y=4\nAt turn49: y=5\nAt turn50: y=6\nAt turn51: y=7\nAt turn52: y=8\nAt turn53: after action at turn52: U -> y=9\n\nSo at turn53, we are at y=9. We want at turn42+H-1 to be y=9. So 42+H-1 = 53 -> H-1=11 -> H=12.\n\nSo the sequence of actions: 12 actions.\n\nBut we can try to optimize: is there a way to get there faster?\n\nWe must avoid being at freeway1,2,3,4 at turn44. We did that by waiting two turns (turn42 and43: S,S).\n\nBut then we went straight up without any further delay. Total turns: 12.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in less than 12?\n\nWe must be at y=0 at turn44. Then we need 9 moves to go from 0 to9. So the earliest we can be at y=9 is at turn44+9 = 53? So that is 11 turns after turn44? But we started at turn42: we have to count from 42 to53: 12 turns? \n\nThe state at turn53: y=9 -> so the turn index is 53, and 53 = 42 + 11? because 42 to53 is 11 steps? \n\nWait: \n  Turn42: start\n  Turn43: after 1 action\n  ...\n  Turn53: after 11 actions? \n\nThe number of actions is the number of turns we take actions: from turn42 to turn52 (11 actions) and then at turn53 we are at y=9. \n\nBut the problem says: we require at turn t1+H-1 = 42+H-1 to be at (0,9). \n\nSo if we are at (0,9) at turn53, then 42+H-1=53 -> H-1=11 -> H=12. \n\nBut note: the state at turn53 is the result of the action at turn52. So the last action is at turn52 (the 11th action: since actions from turn42 to turn52: 11 actions). Then H=11? \n\nWait, the actions are from t= t1 to t1+H-1. So we have H actions. The state after H actions is at turn t1+H. But we require the state at turn t1+H-1 to be at (0,9). \n\nThis is confusing. \n\nLet me re-read:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nSo we start at turn t1 (42). We take H actions: at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then at the next turn (t1+H) we would be at the next state. But the problem says that we are to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThat means that after taking the first H-1 actions (from t1 to t1+H-2) we are at turn t1+H-1 and at (0,9). \n\nBut that does not match the update: because after taking an action at time t, we are at time t+1.\n\nAlternatively, the state at turn t is the state before the action? \n\nThe problem says: \n  \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose a_t, and then we are at y_{t+1} at the beginning of turn t+1.\n\nWe start at turn t1: at (0, y_{t1}) = (0,0). \n\nWe require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nSo we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nThe actions we take are at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? \n\nBecause the last action that affects the state is at turn t1+H-2: which leads to state at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo the sequence of actions is for turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? But the problem says the actions are {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, which would be a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}. \n\nBut if we take an action at turn t1+H-1, that would lead to state at turn t1+H, which we don't care about.\n\nTherefore, the requirement is: we take H actions? but the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is taken when we are at turn t1+H-1, and then we move to turn t1+H. But we don't require anything at turn t1+H.\n\nBut we require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). However, at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}. Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} which leads to y_{t1+H}. \n\nSo to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we must have achieved it by the actions taken at turns t1 to t1+H-2.\n\nTherefore, the actions that affect the state at turn t1+H-1 are the actions from t1 to t1+H-2. So we only need H-1 actions? \n\nBut the problem says the sequence has H actions: from t=0 to H-1, so t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThis seems inconsistent.\n\nLooking at the problem statement:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nand we require to \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nBut if we take an action at turn t1+H-1, then after that action we are at turn t1+H. So we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 before taking the action? Then the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken when we are at (0,9)? and then we move to (0, y_{t1+H}) which might be 9,10? but 10 is invalid, or 8? \n\nBut we are required to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So we are at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1}. But we don't care what happens after? \n\nBut the minimal H would be achieved if we get to 9 as early as possible, and then we can do any action? \n\nBut note: we must avoid collisions at every turn we are on a freeway. At turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9) -> which is not a freeway (freeways are 1..8), so safe.\n\nSo we can take any action at the last turn? but the problem doesn't require anything after.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", meaning the minimal H such that we can take H actions and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nBut note: if we get to 9 earlier, we can just stop? But we have to specify H actions? \n\nNo, we specify exactly H actions, and after taking those H actions, we have that at the turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nBut the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and we are at 9 at the beginning of that turn? Then the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken from state 9. \n\nBut we can do that.\n\nIn our plan, we are at 9 at turn53. So t1+H-1 = 42+H-1 = 53 -> H=11? \n\nBut we had 11 actions? \n\nLet me count:\n\nWe start at turn42: y=0.\n\nWe take action at turn42: S -> then at turn43: y=0.\nAction at turn43: S -> turn44: y=0.\nAction at turn44: U -> turn45: y=1.\nAction at turn45: U -> turn46: y=2.\nAction at turn46: U -> turn47: y=3.\nAction at turn47: U -> turn48: y=4.\nAction at turn48: U -> turn49: y=5.\nAction at turn49: U -> turn50: y=6.\nAction at turn50: U -> turn51: y=7.\nAction at turn51: U -> turn52: y=8.\nAction at turn52: U -> then at turn53: y=9.\n\nBut we are at turn52: we are at y=8. Then we take action U at turn52 to go to y=9 at turn53.\n\nBut we require that at turn t1+H-1 = 42+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nAt which turn are we at (0,9)? At turn53. So 42+H-1=53 -> H=12.\n\nThe actions we took: from turn42 to turn52: that's 11 actions? (42,43,...,52: 52-42+1=11 actions). But we need H=12, so we must have 12 actions. \n\nBut then we would be at turn53 after 11 actions? Then we need one more action? \n\nAlternatively, we are at turn53 at the beginning: we are at y=9. Then we take an action at turn53? But we are already at 9. \n\nBut the problem says: we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. If we take H=12, then t1+H-1=42+12-1=53. So at turn53, we must be at (0,9). \n\nIn our scenario, we are at (0,9) at turn53. So we don't need to take an action at turn53? But the sequence of actions is for t from t1 to t1+H-1: 42 to 53? that's 12 actions.\n\nBut we only took 11 actions to get to turn53. \n\nTo be at y=9 at turn53, we must have taken the last action at turn52. Then the action at turn53 is taken when we are at y=9. \n\nSo we can do:\n\nAt turn53: we can do any action (say S) but we are already at 9. \n\nBut then the sequence has 12 actions: from turn42 to turn53.\n\nBut the first 11 actions (turn42 to turn52) get us to y=9 at turn53, and then at turn53 we do an action (which doesn't change the fact that we are at 9 at turn53).\n\nSo the minimal H is 12.\n\nBut is there a way to get to 9 earlier? \n\nWe must be at y=0 at turn44. Then the earliest we can be at y=9 is at turn44+9 = 53? because we need 9 moves up. So we cannot get there earlier than turn53.\n\nSo H=12 is minimal.\n\nBut let me check if we can get to 9 earlier by a different path.\n\nSuppose we try to go up at turn42: then at turn43: y=1. Then we must avoid being at freeway1,2,3,4 at turn44. So at turn43: we can go down? but we are at y=1: down to y=0? then at turn44: y=0 (safe). Then we have lost one move.\n\nThen we start from y=0 at turn44: same as before. Then we go up 9 times: at turn53: y=9.\n\nTotal: same as before: 12 actions? \n\nBut we did: \n  turn42: U -> turn43: y=1\n  turn43: D -> turn44: y=0\n  then from turn44: same as before.\n\nSo the actions: \n  42: U\n  43: D\n  44: U\n  45: U\n  ... until 52: U -> then at turn53: y=9.\n\nBut we are at y=9 at turn53. Then we need to have the last action at turn52? and then we have an action at turn53? \n\nWe require 12 actions: so we have to list 12 actions. \n\nBut in this plan, we have actions at 42 to 52: 11 actions? then we need one more at turn53: say S.\n\nBut then we are at y=9 at turn53 (from the action at turn52) and then at turn53 we do S -> y=9 at turn54. But we are at turn53: we are at y=9? Then we do S and remain at 9 at turn54. But we require to be at 9 at turn53? \n\nNo: we require at turn t1+H-1=42+12-1=53 to be at 9. But at the beginning of turn53, we are at y_53. How did we get to y_53? by the action at turn52. So if we did U at turn52, then y_53=9. Then at the beginning of turn53, we are at 9. Then we take an action at turn53 (the 12th action) and then go to y_54. But we don't care about y_54.\n\nSo this is acceptable.\n\nBut in this plan, we did:\n  42: U -> to y=1 at turn43\n  43: D -> to y=0 at turn44\n  44: U -> to y=1 at turn45\n  ... then we go up 8 more times? to get to 9 at turn53? \n\nBut from turn44: y=0, then:\n  turn44: U -> turn45: y=1\n  turn45: U -> turn46: y=2\n  ...\n  turn52: U -> turn53: y=9\n\nBut that is 9 moves from turn44 to turn53: so 9 moves? then total moves: 42:U, 43:D, then 44:U,45:U,...,52:U -> that's 11 moves? Then we need a 12th move at turn53: S.\n\nSo the state at turn53: we are at y=9 (from the action at turn52). Then at turn53, we do S -> we stay at 9 at turn54.\n\nBut we require to be at 9 at turn53 (which we are) and then we take an action at turn53.\n\nBut is this faster? It is also 12 actions.\n\nBut we avoided the two stays? but we did an up and then a down, which is also two moves that don't make progress.\n\nBut we have to check safety:\n\nAt turn42: y=0 -> safe.\nAction U: then at turn43: y=1 (freeway1). At turn43: freeway1: we computed earlier: at T=43: [-47,-24] -> doesn't cover 0? safe.\nAt turn43: we are at y=1. Then we do D: to y=0 at turn44 -> safe (since y=0 not freeway).\nAt turn44: we are at y=0. Then we do U to y=1 at turn45: freeway1 at turn45: [1,24] -> no 0? safe.\n\nThen we proceed as before.\n\nBut we have to check freeway5 and6 at turns46 and47? we are at freeway2 at turn46? and freeway3 at turn47? which are safe at those times? yes.\n\nBut note: at turn46: we are at y=2? and freeway2 at turn46: we computed [61,96] -> safe.\nAt turn47: we are at y=3? freeway3 at turn47: [97,132] -> safe.\n\nSo this plan is safe.\n\nBut is it shorter? No, same 12 actions.\n\nBut we started by going up and then down, which is the same as staying twice? \n\nActually, the minimal H is 12, and both plans work.\n\nBut we can also consider going faster? \n\nWe must be at y=0 at turn44. So we have to spend two turns at y=0. \n\nAlternatively, we could go to y=0 at turn44 by other means? \n\nBut we start at y=0. So we have to stay for two turns.\n\nNow, what about freeway5 and6? We avoided them by being at freeway2 and3 at turns46 and47? which are safe. But what if we want to go through freeway5 and6 at other times? \n\nBut we don't have to: we went through freeway1 at turn45, freeway2 at46, freeway3 at47, freeway4 at48, then freeway5 at49, which is after the danger (46,47) so safe.\n\nBut is there a way to go faster? For example, can we get to y=9 before turn53?\n\nWe are constrained: we must be at y=0 at turn44. Then we need at least 9 moves to go from 0 to9. So the state at turn44: y=0, then after 9 moves (actions at turn44 to turn52) we are at y=9 at turn53. Then we need to include the two actions at turn42 and43? So total 11 moves? but then we have to have H=12 because we require 12 actions? \n\nBut the minimal H in terms of the number of turns to wait is 12.\n\nBut note: we don't require to take an action after we are at 9? but the problem says we have to specify H actions. And we are at 9 at turn53 (after 11 actions) but we have to take one more action at turn53? \n\nSo H=12.\n\nNow, let's write the sequence.\n\nWe can do:\n\nOption 1 (two stays at the beginning):\n  Turn42: S\n  Turn43: S\n  Turn44: U\n  Turn45: U\n  Turn46: U\n  Turn47: U\n  Turn48: U\n  Turn49: U\n  Turn50: U\n  Turn51: U\n  Turn52: U\n  Turn53: ? \n\nBut we need to be at 9 at turn53? But in this plan, at turn53 we are at y=9? \n\nHow? \n  After turn42: S -> turn43: y=0\n  turn43: S -> turn44: y=0\n  turn44: U -> turn45: y=1\n  turn45: U -> turn46: y=2\n  ...\n  turn52: U -> turn53: y=9\n\nSo at turn53, we are at y=9. Then we must take an action at turn53. We can do S.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn42: S\nTurn43: S\nTurn44: U\nTurn45: U\nTurn46: U\nTurn47: U\nTurn48: U\nTurn49: U\nTurn50: U\nTurn51: U\nTurn52: U\nTurn53: S\n\nBut the last action (turn53:S) is taken when we are at 9, and then we stay at 9.\n\nBut we are at 9 at the beginning of turn53? Then we do S and remain at 9 at turn54.\n\nBut we only require to be at 9 at turn53 (which we are) and we take the action at turn53.\n\nSo this is valid.\n\nOption 2 (up then down):\n  Turn42: U\n  Turn43: D\n  Turn44: U\n  Turn45: U\n  ... same as above until turn52: U -> turn53: y=9\n  Then turn53: S\n\nBut we need to check if at turn43 we are at y=1: safe? yes (freeway1 at turn43: safe). And turn44: y=0: safe.\n\nBut in this plan, at turn45: we are at y=1 (freeway1) and we computed freeway1 at turn45: [1,24] -> doesn't cover 0? safe.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut we have the same number of actions.\n\nWe can also consider going up continuously and then avoiding the dangerous freeways by waiting at a safe freeway? \n\nBut at turn44, we must not be on freeways1-4. The only safe place is y=0. So we have to be at y=0 at turn44.\n\nSo both plans are 12 actions.\n\nNow, what about the later freeways? We are going through freeway5 at turn49: \n  freeway5 at turn49: \n      third car: [-35+6*(49-42), -24+6*7] = [-35+42, -24+42] = [7,18] -> doesn't cover 0? safe.\n      other cars: not covering 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6 at turn50: same computation: safe.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nTherefore, we can choose either. Let's choose the first one: two stays then up all the way.\n\nBut note: at turn52: we are at y=8, then we do U to go to 9 at turn53. Then at turn53 we do S.\n\nBut we can do at turn52: we are at y=8, and then we do S at turn52? Then we would be at y=8 at turn53? not 9.\n\nSo we must do U at turn52 to get to 9 at turn53.\n\nNow, write the sequence for 12 actions:\n\nTurn42: S\nTurn43: S\nTurn44: U\nTurn45: U\nTurn46: U\nTurn47: U\nTurn48: U\nTurn49: U\nTurn50: U\nTurn51: U\nTurn52: U   # to get to 9 at turn53\nTurn53: S   # we can do S to stay at 9, or anything? but we are at 9, so D would go to 8, which is bad. So we do S.\n\nBut the problem does not require to stay at 9, but we are at 9 at turn53, and then we take an action. We can choose S.\n\nBut note: we must avoid collisions at turn53: we are at y=9 (not a freeway) so safe.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn42: S\nTurn43: S\nTurn44: U\nTurn45: U\nTurn46: U\nTurn47: U\nTurn48: U\nTurn49: U\nTurn50: U\nTurn51: U\nTurn52: U\nTurn53: S\n\nBut the last turn index is 53, which is t1+11? because t1=42, 42+11=53. And H=12, so the actions are from t1 to t1+11.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so t1 to t1+H-1 = t1+11.\n\nYes.\n\nBut is there a way to save a turn? \n\nSuppose we do not do the last S? but the problem requires H actions. We must output 12 actions.\n\nWe could get to 9 one turn earlier? But we cannot because we must be at 0 at turn44 and then it takes 9 moves to 9, arriving at turn53.\n\nTherefore, we output the above.\n\nBut let me check the freeway at turn53: we are at y=9, not a freeway, so no need to check.\n\nBut in the action at turn53, we are at y=9, then we do S -> y=9 at turn54. But we don't care.\n\nSo the minimal H is 12.\n\nBut note: we could do the last U at an earlier turn? no, because we are at y=8 at turn52 and we do U to get to 9 at turn53.\n\nAlternatively, we could have gone up faster? but we are constrained by the freeways at turns46,47? we were at freeway2 and3 at those turns, which were safe. But what if we skip some? \n\nFor example, after turn44: we are at y=0. Then we do two U: turn44:U -> turn45:y=1; turn45:U->turn46:y=2. Then at turn46: we are at freeway2: safe. Then we can do two U per turn? but we can only do one.\n\nWe must go one by one.\n\nSo I think 12 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the sequence of 12 actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=12.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 42: S\nTurn 43: S\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: S\n}\n\nBut note: the turn indices: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\", etc. So:\n\nTurn 42: S\nTurn 43: S\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: S\n\nBut wait, the last turn we write is 53? and t1=42, so the last action is at t1+11=53.\n\nBut H=12, so we have 12 actions.\n\nWe can also do without the last S? but we need 12 actions. So we have to include it.\n\nAlternatively, we can do at the last move: instead of U and then S, we could do at turn52: S to stay at 8? but then we are not at 9 at turn53.\n\nWe must be at 9 at turn53. So we must do U at turn52 to get from 8 to 9 at turn53.\n\nSo I think this is the only way.\n\nTherefore, we output the sequence.\n\nNote: we must ensure that at turn53 we are at 9. We are. Then we do S to stay.\n\nBut the problem does not require to stay, but we have to specify an action.\n\nSo this is acceptable.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial state at turn 42 is 12. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a dangerous freeway at a turn when a car covers \\(x = 0\\).\n\n- At turn 42, the player starts at \\((0, 0)\\), which is safe as it is not a freeway.\n- Turns 42 and 43: The player stays (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\), avoiding freeways 1-4 at turn 44 (dangerous due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\)).\n- Turns 44 to 52: The player moves up (U) consecutively to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 53.\n- Turn 53: The player stays (S) to remain at \\(y = 9\\), which is safe as it is not a freeway.\n\nThe sequence ensures:\n- At turn 44, \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not a freeway).\n- At turns 45-48, \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 4\\): Freeways 1-4 are safe at these turns (cars do not cover \\(x = 0\\)).\n- At turns 49-50, \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 6\\): Freeways 5-6 are safe at these turns (dangerous turns 46-47 have passed).\n- At turns 51-52, \\(y = 7\\) to \\(y = 8\\): Freeways 7-8 are always safe.\n- At turn 53, \\(y = 9\\) (safe, not a freeway).\n\nThe actions are:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 42: S\nTurn 43: S\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t_1 = 46, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\n The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical position y is updated as:\n   y_{t+1} = y_t + 1 (if U)\n   y_{t+1} = y_t - 1 (if D)\n   y_{t+1} = y_t (if S)\n\n And we must remain in the bounds [0,9]. We start at y=0 and want to end at y=9.\n\n Collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (where k is between 1 and 8) and at that turn T, the player is at x=0, then we check the cars on freeway k at turn T.\n   - For a car on freeway k: at turn T, its span is computed by:\n        if the car is left-moving: span = [h - s*(T - t_1), tau - s*(T - t_1)]\n        if right-moving: span = [tau + s*(T - t_1), h + s*(T - t_1)]\n\n   However, note that the given car state is at turn t_1 (current turn). So for a turn T (>= t_1), we compute the car's position relative to the starting turn t_1.\n\n Important note: when the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at the moment of turn T, the player is still on freeway y_T. Therefore, we only check the cars on the freeway corresponding to the current y_T at turn T.\n\n Also note: the player is never on a freeway when at y=0 or y=9? Actually, the freeways are at y=1 to 8. So when the player is at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars. Therefore, we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\n We must avoid being on a freeway row (y from 1 to 8) at a turn T when the car on that row has a span that includes 0 at turn T.\n\n Since we start at y=0 at turn 46, we are safe at turn 46. We need to end at y=9, which is also safe.\n\n The challenge is to move through rows 1 to 8 without being hit by a car.\n\n We are to compute the minimal H and the sequence of actions.\n\n Approach:\n We can model this as a state-space search where the state is (turn, y). We start at (46,0) and we want to reach (t,9) for some t>=46. The minimal H is the minimal number of turns (including the starting turn) such that we end at 9. But note: the problem asks for the sequence of actions from t_1 (which is 46) to t_1+H-1, and at the end of the sequence we should be at 9.\n\n Therefore, H is the number of turns we take (so we take H actions, and we end at turn t_1 + H - 1? Actually, the sequence is for t = t_1 to t_1+H-1, so the last action is at turn t_1+H-1 and then the position becomes 9 at that same turn? Actually, the position update happens at the same turn: at turn T, we take action a_T and then we are at y_{T+1}? But note the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\n However, the problem states: \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\", meaning at turn t, we take an action and then the next state is at turn t+1. So:\n\n   At turn t_1 (46): we are at y_{46}=0. We take action a_{46} and then at the start of turn 47 we are at y_{47}=0+Delta.\n\n But note: the collision condition says: at turn T, if the player is at (0, y_T) and y_T is a freeway (1..8) then we check the cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\n Therefore, at the moment of turn T, the player is at y_T. Then we take an action and move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\n So we are only concerned with the row we are on at the beginning of each turn.\n\n Steps:\n\n   We start at turn 46, y=0 (safe).\n\n   We need to plan a sequence of actions (starting at turn 46) until we first reach y=9.\n\n   Since each move changes y by at most 1, we must go through each row from 0 to 9. But note we can also go down? However, we start at 0 and want to go to 9, so we will mostly go up. But sometimes we might wait (by staying or even going down to avoid a car) and then go up.\n\n   We are to minimize the number of turns.\n\n   The minimal number of turns without any cars would be 9 moves (all U) and then we would be at 9 after 9 turns (so H=9, and we take actions at turns 46,47,...,54, and at turn 54 we are at 9).\n\n   But with cars, we might have to wait sometimes.\n\n   How to compute the car positions at a future turn T (relative to turn t_1=46)?\n\n     Let T = t_1 + delta = 46 + delta, then the car's head and tail at turn T are computed as:\n\n        For a car given at turn 46 as (h, tau, d, s):\n\n          if d is right: \n             the span at turn T is [tau + s * (T-46), h + s * (T-46)]\n          if d is left:\n             the span at turn T is [h - s * (T-46), tau - s * (T-46)]\n\n     However, note the example: for a right-moving car, the initial span at turn 46 is [tau, h]? Actually, the table says for a right-moving car: \"Span(t_1) = [tau, h]\". But in the input, the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\n     For example, freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24). \n\n        This means at turn 46, the head is at -48 and the tail at -71? But for a right-moving car, the head is the front? Actually, the problem states for right-moving: \n            Span(t_1) = [tau, h] \n        so in the input, the first number is h (head) and the second is tau (tail). But note the representation: for right-moving, the head is the rightmost? So if the car is moving right, then the tail is the leftmost. Therefore, the span at t_1 is [tail, head] = [tau, h]. \n\n        So for freeway 1: tail = -71, head = -48, so the car spans from -71 to -48? \n\n        Then at turn T, it moves to [tau + s*(T-46), h + s*(T-46)].\n\n        Similarly, for left-moving, the head is the leftmost? and the tail is the rightmost? The problem says for left-moving: Span(t_1)=[h, tau] and then at T: [h - s*(T-46), tau - s*(T-46)].\n\n     But note: in the input, we are given (head, tail, direction, speed). So regardless of direction, the first number is head and the second is tail.\n\n     However, the meaning of head and tail depends on direction:\n\n        For right-moving: head is the front (rightmost) and tail is the rear (leftmost). So the span at t_1 is [tail, head] = [tau, h].\n        For left-moving: head is the front (leftmost) and tail is the rear (rightmost). So the span at t_1 is [head, tail] = [h, tau].\n\n     But in our input, all cars in the given state are right-moving? \n\n        Freeway 1: right\n        Freeway 2: right\n        Freeway 3: right\n        Freeway 4: right\n        Freeway 5: three cars, all right\n        Freeway 6: three cars, all right\n        Freeway 7: right\n        Freeway 8: right\n\n     So we only have right-moving cars.\n\n     Therefore, for every car, at turn T, the span is [tau + s*(T-46), h + s*(T-46)].\n\n     Collision condition on freeway k at turn T: if the player is on row k at turn T (i.e., y_T = k) and the x-coordinate 0 is in one of the spans of the cars on that freeway.\n\n     But note: a freeway might have multiple cars (like freeways 5 and 6 have three cars each). So we must check all cars on that freeway.\n\n How to check if 0 is in the span [a, b]? \n        It is if a <= 0 <= b.\n\n     Since the car is right-moving, the span at T is [tau + s*(T-46), h + s*(T-46)].\n\n     So we require: \n          tau + s*(T-46) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-46)\n\n     But note: for a right-moving car, the tail is the leftmost and the head is the rightmost, so the span is increasing. So the condition is:\n\n          tau + s*(T-46) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-46)\n\n     However, note that the head and tail as given: for freeway 1: h=-48, tau=-71 -> then at T=46, the span is [-71, -48]. 0 is not in that span. So we are safe at turn 46 on freeway 1? But we are not on freeway 1 at turn 46 (we are at y=0).\n\n     We need to know when we are on a freeway row at a future turn.\n\n Plan:\n\n   We wish to compute for each freeway row (1 to 8) and for each future turn T (>=46) whether there is a car on that row at turn T that covers x=0.\n\n   We can precompute for each row k and for each turn T (from 46 to, say, 46+100) whether row k is safe (i.e., no car on row k at turn T has 0 in its span).\n\n   But note: the problem is that we don't know how long we might have to wait. However, the cars move at constant speed and the grid is infinite? But the cars are moving and eventually will pass? Also note that the speeds are positive and the initial positions are negative? So they will eventually pass 0 and then move to positive? And then we might have to wait until they pass? Or maybe we can time our crossing.\n\n   Since we want minimal turns, we want to go as fast as possible. We can try to simulate moving up as quickly as possible and check if we can avoid collisions. If we find a collision, we might have to wait (by using S or even D) until the car passes.\n\n   However, note that we can also change the timing by waiting at a safe row. But rows 0 and 9 are safe. Also, if we are on a freeway row that is safe at that turn, we can stay there.\n\n   We'll precompute for each row k (1..8) and for each turn T (starting from 46) the safety.\n\n   Let safe[k][T] = True if at turn T, the freeway k is safe (i.e., no car on row k has 0 in its span).\n\n   How to compute for a row k at turn T:\n\n        Look at the car state for row k. The table gives one or more cars.\n\n        For each car on row k:\n\n            h0 = initial head (at turn 46)\n            tau0 = initial tail (at turn 46)\n            s = speed\n            direction (all right in this case)\n\n            At turn T, the head = h0 + s*(T-46)\n            the tail = tau0 + s*(T-46)\n\n            The span is [tail, head] = [tau0 + s*(T-46), h0 + s*(T-46)]\n\n            Check if 0 is in [tau0 + s*(T-46), h0 + s*(T-46)]: \n                   tau0 + s*(T-46) <= 0 <= h0 + s*(T-46)\n\n            If for at least one car this holds, then the row is unsafe at T.\n\n        If no car on row k has 0 in its span at T, then safe[k][T] = True.\n\n   But note: the problem says that if the player is at row k at turn T, then we check the cars on row k at turn T.\n\n   We are only concerned with the turns when we are on row k.\n\n   However, we need to plan a path: we are at (turn, y) and we choose an action (U, D, S) to go to (turn+1, y+delta). We must not be on a freeway row at a turn T if that row is unsafe at T.\n\n   We can do a BFS in the state space (turn, y). The state is (t, y). The actions: U, D, S (but note that if y is 0, D is not allowed? Actually, the update says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y=0 and we do D, then y_{t+1} = max(0, 0-1)=0. Similarly at y=9, U would leave at 9.\n\n   The minimal H is the minimal t such that we are at y=9 (and we started at turn 46). The number of turns is t - 46 + 1? Actually, we take one action per turn. We start at turn 46 at y=0. Then we take an action at turn 46 to get to y_47, then at turn 47 to get to y_48, etc. We want the first turn T at which we have y_T = 9. But note: the state at turn T is y_T. We are at y=9 at turn T. How many actions? The actions are taken at turns 46, 47, ..., T-1? Actually:\n\n        Turn 46: we are at y=0. Then we take action a_46 -> at turn 47 we are at y_47.\n        ...\n        At turn T-1: we take an action that gets us to y_T = 9.\n\n        So the number of actions is (T - 46). And we want to minimize T? Actually, the problem says: minimal number of turns H. And then the sequence is from t_1 to t_1+H-1. So H is the number of actions. Therefore, we have:\n\n            T = t_1 + H   ??? \n\n        Let me clarify:\n\n            We start at turn t_1 (46) at y=0.\n            We take H actions: at turns 46, 47, ..., 46+H-1.\n            Then the state after H actions is at turn 46+H, and we have y_{46+H} = 9.\n\n            Therefore, the minimal H is the minimal number of actions to get to y=9.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"the sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So t=0 corresponds to a_{t_1}, t=1 to a_{t_1+1}, ... t=H-1 to a_{t_1+H-1}. And after these H actions, we are at (0,9).\n\n        How many state updates? We start at turn t_1 (state y_{t_1}=0). Then after one action (at turn t_1) we are at y_{t_1+1}. After two actions, at y_{t_1+2}, ... after H actions, we are at y_{t_1+H} = 9.\n\n        Therefore, we require y_{46+H} = 9.\n\n        So we are looking for the smallest H such that we can get from y=0 at turn 46 to y=9 at turn 46+H.\n\n        The number of turns in the game from start to finish is H (the actions) and the time elapsed is H turns (from turn 46 to turn 46+H-1 for the actions, and then at turn 46+H we are at 9).\n\n        But the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning the actions are taken at turns: t_1, t_1+1, ... t_1+H-1. And then at the next turn (t_1+H) we are at 9.\n\n        However, the collision condition is checked at the turn when we are at a row. Specifically:\n\n            At turn T (which is between 46 and 46+H-1), we are at y_T (which is the state at the beginning of turn T). Then we take an action and move to y_{T+1}. \n\n            The collision condition at turn T: if y_T is between 1 and 8, then we check the cars on row y_T at turn T.\n\n        Therefore, we must ensure that for every turn T from 46 to 46+H-1, if y_T is in [1,8] then the freeway y_T is safe at turn T.\n\n        Note: at turn 46+H, we are at y=9, which is safe. And at turn 46, we are at y=0, which is safe.\n\n        So we only care about turns T in the range [46, 46+H-1] and for the state y_T (which is the state at the beginning of turn T) being in [1,8] must be safe at turn T.\n\n   Steps for BFS:\n\n        State: (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at 46) and y is the current row.\n\n        We start at (46,0) with cost (number of actions so far) = 0.\n\n        We want to reach a state with y=9. The turn when we first have y=9 is the state (t,9) for some t. The cost (number of actions) is t - 46? But note: we start at turn 46 without having taken any action. Then we take an action at turn 46 and move to turn 47? Actually, in the state (t, y), we are at the beginning of turn t. We then choose an action that will determine y_{t+1}.\n\n        So from state (t, y), we can choose:\n\n            a = U: then next state is (t+1, min(9, y+1))\n            a = D: then next state is (t+1, max(0, y-1))\n            a = S: then next state is (t+1, y)\n\n        We must check: at the current state (t, y) we are safe: \n            if y is 0 or 9 -> safe.\n            if y is in [1,8] -> we need safe[y][t] to be True.\n\n        But note: the state (t,y) is at the beginning of turn t. We are about to take an action. The collision condition for being on row y at turn t must be satisfied.\n\n        Therefore, we only expand the state (t,y) if it is safe at turn t.\n\n        Then we take an action and move to the next state (t+1, y').\n\n        We want to minimize the number of actions until we get to y=9. The number of actions taken to get to state (t,y) is (t - 46). And we want to get to (t,9) for some t. Then H = t - 46? \n\n        Actually, when we are at state (t,9), we have already taken (t - 46) actions? \n\n            Start: at turn 46, we have taken 0 actions.\n            After one action: turn 47 -> 1 action.\n            ...\n            At turn t: we have taken (t - 46) actions.\n\n        But note: at state (t,9), we are at the beginning of turn t. We do not need to take an action at turn t because we are already at 9? However, the problem requires a sequence until we reach (0,9). So we must have that at the beginning of turn t, we are at 9. And we do not take an action at turn t? \n\n        Actually, the sequence of actions is defined for turns starting at t_1 (46) up to the last action that brings us to 9. The last action is taken at the turn before we are at 9? \n\n        But note: the update: at turn t, we take an action and then we are at y_{t+1}. So to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn t, that means we were moved to 9 by the action taken at turn t-1.\n\n        Therefore, if we are at (t,9), then we have taken the action at turn t-1. So the sequence of actions is for turns 46 to t-1. The number of actions H = (t - 46). \n\n        We start at turn 46: we are at (46,0). Then we take an action at turn 46 and move to turn 47 at y_47. We end when at the beginning of some turn t we are at y=9. That means the last action (that got us to 9) was taken at turn t-1. So the sequence of actions is from turn 46 to turn t-1, which is H = t - 46 actions.\n\n        Therefore, we want to minimize H = t - 46, meaning minimize t.\n\n        So we can do a BFS (or Dijkstra, since all actions cost 1) over states (t, y) for t>=46 and y in [0,9]. We start at (46,0) and we want to reach (t,9) for the smallest t.\n\n        However, t can be arbitrarily large? But we can set a bound. Note the cars move at integer speeds and eventually the cars will pass 0. We can compute the safety for a sufficiently large T.\n\n        We'll set a maximum turn: say 46 + 1000.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            Precomputation: for each row k (1..8) and for T from 46 to 46+max_bound (say 1000), compute safe[k][T] by checking all cars on that row.\n\n            Then run BFS:\n\n                Let dist[t][y] = minimal number of actions (which is t-46) to be at (t,y) and safe. But we can also use a visited array to avoid revisiting states with the same (t,y) (since if we get to (t,y) with a higher number of actions, we skip).\n\n                However, note: we might want to wait arbitrarily? But we are minimizing the turn t. So if we have two paths to (t,y) and (t',y) with t < t', then the one with t is better.\n\n                We can do a BFS in increasing t.\n\n                Queue: (t, y)\n\n                Start: (46,0) -> safe because y=0.\n\n                Then for each state (t,y), we consider the next state (t+1, y') for y' in {y-1, y, y+1} (clamped to [0,9]).\n\n                But we can only move to (t+1, y') if the state (t+1, y') is safe? Actually, no: the state (t+1, y') is safe if at turn t+1, the row y' is safe (if y' in [1,8]) or if y' is 0 or 9. However, note that at the beginning of turn t+1, we are at y'. So we must check the safety at turn t+1 for row y'.\n\n                But the state we are expanding is (t+1, y') and we check safety at turn t+1 for row y'.\n\n                Algorithm:\n\n                    Let max_t = 46 + 1000   (a bound to avoid infinite)\n\n                    Initialize: \n                         queue = deque([(46,0)])\n                         dist[46][0] = 0   (number of actions taken so far is 0, but we don't need to store that separately because the turn t is the key)\n\n                    We mark visited[t][y] to avoid revisiting the same (t,y) with a higher or same cost? But if we get to (t,y) by two different paths, we want the one that got there with a smaller t? Actually, we are traversing in increasing t, so the first time we get to (t,y) is the minimal t.\n\n                    While queue:\n                         pop state (t,y)\n\n                         if y == 9: then we found a solution. The number of actions is t - 46. And we can reconstruct the path.\n\n                         Otherwise, we consider the three actions: U, D, S -> leading to y_next = y+1, y-1, y (clamped to [0,9])\n\n                         Then the next state is (t+1, y_next).\n\n                         But we must check that at the next state (t+1, y_next) is safe? Actually, at the beginning of turn t+1, we are at y_next. So we check:\n\n                            if y_next == 0 or y_next == 9 -> safe.\n                            else (1<=y_next<=8) -> check safe[y_next][t+1] (which we precomputed).\n\n                         If safe, then we push (t+1, y_next) and record the action taken and the parent.\n\n                    We break when we pop (t,9).\n\n        Then we reconstruct the sequence of actions from turn 46 to turn t-1? \n\n            Actually, in the BFS:\n\n                We start at (46,0). Then we take an action at turn 46 to get to (47, y1). Then at turn 47 we take an action to get to (48, y2), ... until we get to (t,9).\n\n                The actions: \n                    at turn 46: the action that led from (46,0) to (47,y1) -> that action is stored as the action taken at state (46,0) to get to (47,y1).\n\n                So we need to store for each state (t,y) (for t>46) the parent state (t-1, y_prev) and the action taken at turn t-1.\n\n        Implementation:\n\n            Let parent[t][y] = (prev_y, action) at turn t-1? Actually, we know the previous state was at turn t-1 and position prev_y, and we took an action at turn t-1 to get to (t,y). \n\n            Alternatively, we can store:\n\n                We traverse backwards: at state (t,y), we know we got here by an action a at turn t-1 from state (t-1, y_prev). \n\n                So we can store:\n\n                    parent[t][y] = (y_prev, a)\n\n                Then to reconstruct:\n\n                    Start at (t,9). Then the action taken at turn t-1 is a. Then we go to (t-1, y_prev). Then we look for parent[t-1][y_prev] = (y_prev2, a_{t-2}) and so on until we get to (46,0).\n\n                Then the sequence of actions: from turn 46 to turn t-1.\n\n        However, note: the problem requires the actions from turn t_1 (46) to turn t_1+H-1. And H = t - 46 (because we took t-46 actions: from 46 to t-1). \n\n        So the sequence: \n            Turn 46: a_46\n            Turn 47: a_47\n            ...\n            Turn t-1: a_{t-1}\n\n        We reconstruct the actions in reverse: from turn t-1 down to 46.\n\n        We'll store:\n\n            Let act[46] = the first action, ... \n\n        Alternatively, we can store during BFS for each state (t,y) the action that we took to get there (which was taken at turn t-1) and the previous state (t-1, y_prev). Then we can backtrack.\n\n   Precomputation of safe[k][t] for k in [1,8] and t in [46, max_t]:\n\n        max_t = 46 + 1000   (we set a bound)\n\n        For each row k:\n\n            cars = list of cars on row k (from the table)\n\n            For t from 46 to max_t:\n\n                safe_flag = True\n\n                For each car in cars:\n\n                    h0 = head, tau0 = tail, s = speed, d = direction (all right)\n\n                    tail_t = tau0 + s*(t-46)\n                    head_t = h0 + s*(t-46)\n\n                    if tail_t <= 0 <= head_t:\n                         safe_flag = False; break\n\n                safe[k][t] = safe_flag\n\n   Note: the arithmetic: the cars might wrap around? But the problem doesn't say they wrap. They just move. Since they are moving right and start at negative positions, they will eventually pass 0 and then become positive. So we can compute.\n\n   Example: freeway 1: car = (-48, -71, right, 24) at turn 46.\n\n        At turn t, the car's tail = -71 + 24*(t-46)\n        head = -48 + 24*(t-46)\n\n        When does it cover 0?\n\n            We require: -71 + 24*(t-46) <= 0 <= -48 + 24*(t-46)\n\n        Solve:\n\n            First inequality: 24*(t-46) >= 71 -> t-46 >= 71/24 = 2.958 -> so t>=46+3 = 49.\n            Second inequality: -48 + 24*(t-46) >= 0 -> 24*(t-46) >= 48 -> t-46>=2 -> t>=48.\n\n        So the car covers 0 for t in [49, ... until when? \n\n            tail_t = -71 + 24*(t-46) <= 0 -> t<=46+ ceil(71/24)=46+3? actually 71/24=2.958, so at t=46+3=49: tail_t = -71+24*3 = -71+72=1 -> wait, that's positive? \n\n            Let me compute:\n\n                t=48: tail_t = -71 + 24*(48-46) = -71+48 = -23 -> still negative? \n                t=49: tail_t = -71+24*3 = -71+72=1 -> so at t=49, the tail is at 1? Then the head at t=49: -48+72=24.\n\n            Therefore, at t=49, the car spans from 1 to 24. So 0 is not covered.\n\n        When was 0 covered? \n\n            We require the tail_t <=0 and head_t>=0.\n\n            tail_t <=0: -71+24*(t-46) <=0 -> t-46 <= 71/24=2.958 -> so t<=48.958 -> so only for t<=48? \n\n            At t=48: tail_t = -71+24*2 = -71+48 = -23 (<=0) and head_t = -48+48=0 -> so 0 is covered? because the span is [-23,0] -> 0 is included.\n\n            At t=47: tail_t = -71+24*1 = -47, head_t=-48+24=-24 -> then 0 is not in [-47,-24]? \n\n            So only at t=48: head_t=0, so 0 is included? \n\n            Therefore, freeway 1 is unsafe at t=48.\n\n        But note: the head_t at t=48: -48+24*2 = -48+48=0. So the condition: tail_t <=0<=head_t -> -23<=0<=0 -> true.\n\n        So safe[1][48] = False.\n\n        Similarly, we must check for all cars on the same row? But freeway 1 has only one car.\n\n   Freeway 5: has three cars. We must check all three.\n\n   We'll precompute for each row.\n\n   Now, let's precompute the safety for each row and for t from 46 to, say, 46+100.\n\n   We note the speeds are positive and the initial positions are negative for all cars? \n\n        Looking at the table:\n\n            Freeway 1: (-48,-71) -> both negative.\n            Freeway 2: (-48,-83) -> negative.\n            Freeway 3: (-48,-83) -> negative.\n            Freeway 4: (-48,-83) -> negative.\n            Freeway 5: (48,37) -> positive? but wait, there are three cars: \n                  (48,37, right,6) -> head=48, tail=37 -> positive? \n                  (12,1, right,6) -> positive?\n                  (-24,-35, right,6) -> negative.\n\n            Similarly freeway 6: same as 5.\n\n            Freeway 7: (48,37,right,12) -> positive.\n            Freeway 8: (48,37,right,4) -> positive.\n\n        So for freeways 5,6,7,8, we have cars that are already at positive positions? \n\n        For example, freeway 5: \n            Car1: (48,37,right,6): at turn 46, span [37,48] -> which is entirely positive? so 0 is not covered? \n            Car2: (12,1,right,6): [1,12] -> positive, so 0 not covered?\n            Car3: (-24,-35,right,6): [-35,-24] -> negative, so 0 not covered.\n\n        But then at a future turn, the positive cars will move further right and the negative car will move right and eventually might cover 0.\n\n        For car3 on freeway5: \n            tail_t = -35 + 6*(t-46)\n            head_t = -24 + 6*(t-46)\n\n            We require: -35+6*(t-46) <=0<= -24+6*(t-46)\n\n            Solve: \n                -35+6*(t-46)<=0 -> 6*(t-46)<=35 -> t-46<=35/6≈5.833 -> t<=51.833 -> so t<=51\n                -24+6*(t-46)>=0 -> 6*(t-46)>=24 -> t-46>=4 -> t>=50.\n\n            So at t=50,51: \n                t=50: tail_t = -35+6*4 = -35+24 = -11, head_t=-24+24=0 -> so 0 is included? because tail_t=-11<=0<=0 -> true.\n                t=51: tail_t=-35+6*5=-35+30=-5, head_t=-24+30=6 -> then 0 is in [-5,6] -> true.\n\n            So freeway5 is unsafe at t=50,51.\n\n        Similarly, the other cars on freeway5: \n            Car1: at turn t: [37+6*(t-46), 48+6*(t-46)] -> always positive? so 0 never covered.\n            Car2: [1+6*(t-46),12+6*(t-46)] -> always positive? so 0 never covered.\n\n        Therefore, freeway5: unsafe at t=50,51.\n\n   Similarly, freeway6: same as freeway5? unsafe at t=50,51.\n\n   Freeway7: one car (48,37,right,12) -> \n        tail_t = 37+12*(t-46)\n        head_t = 48+12*(t-46)\n\n        Always positive? so safe at all t.\n\n   Freeway8: (48,37,right,4) -> \n        tail_t = 37+4*(t-46)\n        head_t = 48+4*(t-46)\n\n        Always positive? so safe at all t.\n\n   Now, freeway1: we found unsafe at t=48.\n\n   Freeway2: (-48,-83,right,36)\n        tail_t = -83+36*(t-46)\n        head_t = -48+36*(t-46)\n\n        Condition: \n            tail_t<=0: -83+36*(t-46)<=0 -> 36*(t-46)<=83 -> t-46<=83/36≈2.305 -> t<=48.305 -> so t<=48\n            head_t>=0: -48+36*(t-46)>=0 -> 36*(t-46)>=48 -> t-46>=48/36=1.333 -> t>=47.333 -> so t>=48? (since integer, t>=48)\n\n        Therefore, only t=48: \n            tail_t = -83+36*2 = -83+72 = -11\n            head_t = -48+72 = 24\n            so 0 in [-11,24] -> unsafe at t=48.\n\n        Also, at t=47: \n            tail_t = -83+36= -47\n            head_t = -48+36 = -12 -> 0 not in [-47,-12] -> safe.\n        At t=49: \n            tail_t = -83+36*3 = -83+108=25 -> positive -> 0 not covered? \n            head_t = -48+108=60 -> positive -> but tail_t=25>0, so 0 not in [25,60] -> safe.\n\n        So freeway2: unsafe only at t=48.\n\n   Freeway3: same as freeway2: (-48,-83,right,36) -> unsafe at t=48.\n\n   Freeway4: same -> unsafe at t=48.\n\n   So summary for safety (for t from 46 to 60):\n\n        Row 1: unsafe at t=48? (from our freeway1 calculation: unsafe at t=48) -> and safe at other times? \n                Actually, we computed: freeway1: unsafe at t=48 only? \n                    t=48: unsafe.\n                    t=49: safe? because tail_t=1 (so [1,24] -> 0 not included) -> safe.\n\n        Row 2: unsafe at t=48 only.\n\n        Row 3: unsafe at t=48 only.\n\n        Row 4: unsafe at t=48 only.\n\n        Row 5: unsafe at t=50,51.\n\n        Row 6: unsafe at t=50,51.\n\n        Row 7: safe at all t.\n\n        Row 8: safe at all t.\n\n   Now, we can run BFS.\n\n   We start at (46,0) -> safe.\n\n   We consider actions: U, D, S.\n\n        U: y=1 -> then next state: (47,1) -> we must check safety at turn 47 for row1: safe? (from above, row1 is safe at t=47) -> safe.\n        D: y=0 -> (47,0) -> safe.\n        S: y=0 -> (47,0) -> safe.\n\n   We want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\n   The minimal without obstacles is 9 moves (all U). But let's see if we can do that:\n\n        Turn 46: U -> (47,1) -> safe? row1 at t=47: safe (since row1 unsafe only at t=48) -> safe.\n        Turn 47: U -> (48,2) -> at turn 48, row2: unsafe at t=48 -> collision.\n\n        So we cannot do U at turn47 to go to row2 at turn48 (which is unsafe).\n\n   Therefore, we must avoid being on row2 at turn48.\n\n   How? At turn47, we are at row1. Instead of moving up to row2 at turn48, we can stay at row1 at turn48? But row1 at turn48: unsafe? we found row1 unsafe at t=48 -> so we cannot stay at row1 at turn48.\n\n        Then we can move down to row0? But at turn48, we would be at row0? \n\n        How: \n            At turn47: we are at row1. Then we take D: then at turn48, we are at row0 -> safe.\n\n        Then at turn48: we are at row0. Then we can move up at turn48 to row1? but row1 at turn48 is unsafe -> so we cannot go to row1 at turn48? Actually, at turn48 we are at row0 (safe) and then we take U -> at turn49 we are at row1. \n\n        Now, row1 at turn49: safe? we computed row1 safe at t=49 -> safe.\n\n        Then we can continue.\n\n        Alternatively, we can wait at row0 at turn47? \n\n        How: \n            Turn46: we start at row0 -> we can take S -> then at turn47, we are at row0 -> safe.\n            Then turn47: take U -> at turn48, we are at row1? but row1 at turn48: unsafe -> collision.\n\n        Or turn46: take D -> same as S? we stay at 0.\n\n        So the only way to avoid row2 at turn48 is to be at row0 at turn48? \n\n        How to be at row0 at turn48?\n\n            We start at row0 at turn46.\n\n            Option1: \n                turn46: U -> to row1 at turn47.\n                turn47: D -> to row0 at turn48.\n\n            Option2:\n                turn46: D or S -> stay at row0 at turn47.\n                turn47: D or S -> stay at row0 at turn48.\n\n        Then at turn48, we are at row0 -> safe.\n\n        Then we can start moving up:\n\n            turn48: U -> to row1 at turn49 -> safe (row1 safe at t=49)\n            turn49: U -> to row2 at turn50 -> row2 at turn50: safe? we only computed row2 unsafe at t=48 -> safe at t=50.\n\n            But row5 and row6 are unsafe at t=50 and 51. We are currently at row2 at turn50. We need to go through rows 3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\n            We are at row2 at turn50. Then:\n\n                turn50: U -> row3 at turn51 -> row3 at turn51: safe? (row3 unsafe only at t=48) -> safe.\n                turn51: U -> row4 at turn52 -> safe.\n                turn52: U -> row5 at turn53 -> row5 at turn53: safe? (row5 unsafe at t=50,51 -> safe at t=53) -> safe.\n                turn53: U -> row6 at turn54 -> row6 at turn54: safe? (row6 unsafe at t=50,51 -> safe at t=54) -> safe.\n                turn54: U -> row7 at turn55 -> row7 safe always -> safe.\n                turn55: U -> row8 at turn56 -> row8 safe always -> safe.\n                turn56: U -> row9 at turn57 -> safe.\n\n            Total turns: from turn46 to turn57 -> 12 turns? But the actions: \n                We took actions at turns 46,47,...,56 -> 11 actions? and we end at turn57 at row9.\n\n            Therefore, H=11.\n\n        But wait: the minimal without obstacles was 9. We spent two turns (at turn46 and turn47) to avoid row2 at turn48? \n\n            Actually, we did:\n\n                turn46: U -> row1 at turn47.\n                turn47: D -> row0 at turn48.   [we lost one step]\n\n                Then from turn48 to turn56: we went from row0 to row9 in 8 moves? \n                    turn48: U -> row1 at turn49\n                    turn49: U -> row2 at turn50\n                    turn50: U -> row3 at turn51\n                    turn51: U -> row4 at turn52\n                    turn52: U -> row5 at turn53\n                    turn53: U -> row6 at turn54\n                    turn54: U -> row7 at turn55\n                    turn55: U -> row8 at turn56\n                    turn56: U -> row9 at turn57\n\n                That's 9 moves (from turn48 to turn56) but we started at row0 at turn48 and ended at row9 at turn57 -> 9 moves.\n\n            Total moves: \n                turn46: U (1 move)\n                turn47: D (2 moves)\n                then 9 moves from turn48 to turn56 -> total 11 moves.\n\n            So H=11.\n\n        Alternatively, we might avoid the detour by waiting at row0 until after the unsafe time for row1? \n\n            We can do:\n\n                turn46: S -> row0 at turn47.\n                turn47: S -> row0 at turn48.   [we are safe at turn47 and turn48 at row0]\n\n                Then at turn48: we are at row0. Then we start moving up.\n\n                But we cannot go to row1 at turn49? because row1 is safe at turn49.\n\n                Then we do the same 9 moves: \n                    turn48: U -> row1 at turn49\n                    turn49: U -> row2 at turn50\n                    ... until turn56: U -> row9 at turn57.\n\n                Total moves: 10? \n                    Actions at turns:46(S),47(S),48(U),49(U),...,56(U) -> 11 actions? \n                    But wait: turns: 46 to 56 -> 11 actions? and we end at turn57 at row9 -> H=11.\n\n            Same.\n\n        But note: we could have avoided the two extra moves? \n\n            What if at turn46 we don't move? and then at turn47 we move up? \n\n                turn46: S -> row0 at turn47.\n                turn47: U -> row1 at turn48 -> but row1 at turn48: unsafe -> collision.\n\n            So we cannot.\n\n        Another idea: at turn47, can we be at row2? \n\n            But row2 at turn47: safe? we computed row2 unsafe only at t=48 -> so row2 at turn47 is safe.\n\n            Then:\n\n                turn46: U -> row1 at turn47 (safe, row1 at t47: safe)\n                turn47: U -> row2 at turn48 -> row2 at turn48: unsafe -> collision.\n\n            So we cannot.\n\n        Another: turn46: U -> row1 at turn47 (safe)\n                 turn47: S -> row1 at turn48 -> unsafe? because row1 at turn48: unsafe -> collision.\n\n        So the only safe option at turn47 for row1 is to go down to row0.\n\n        Therefore, we have to spend two moves to avoid row1 and row2 at turn48.\n\n        But wait, what about going to row3? We can't jump.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\n   However, we must check if we can do it in 10? \n\n        We must be at row9 at turn56 (then we took 10 actions: from 46 to 55). \n\n        How? \n            We start at row0 at turn46.\n\n            We need to be at row9 at turn56 -> that means we took 9 moves? but 10 actions -> so we must have one wait? \n\n            Actually, we must make 9 upward moves and one other move (either S or D) to avoid a collision.\n\n            How to avoid the collision at row1 and row2 at turn48? \n\n            We must be at row0 at turn48? \n\n                How many moves from row0 at turn46 to row0 at turn48? \n                    We can do: \n                         turn46: S -> row0 at turn47\n                         turn47: S -> row0 at turn48 -> 2 moves.\n\n                Then we have 8 moves left? but we need 9 upward moves to get to row9? \n\n                Total moves: 2 (to stay at 0) + 9 (to go to 9) = 11.\n\n            Alternatively, we could do:\n\n                turn46: D -> row0 at turn47? same as S.\n\n            So we cannot do 10.\n\n   But what if we go faster at the beginning? \n\n        We must avoid row1 at turn48? and row2 at turn48? \n\n        But note: we can be at row3 at turn48? \n\n            How: \n                turn46: U -> row1 at turn47\n                turn47: U -> row2 at turn48 -> unsafe (row2 at turn48) -> collision.\n\n        Or: \n                turn46: U -> row1 at turn47\n                turn47: U -> row2 at turn48 -> unsafe.\n\n        Or: \n                turn46: U -> row1 at turn47\n                turn47: U -> row2 at turn48 -> unsafe.\n\n        We cannot.\n\n        What if we go up twice in a row?

We are at row5 at t=53 -> safe.\n\n        Similarly, row6 at t=54 -> safe.\n\n   So the above path is valid.\n\n   Therefore, we output a sequence of 11 actions.\n\n   Let me choose the first one I found:\n\n        Turn46: U\n        Turn47: D\n        Turn48: U\n        Turn49: U\n        Turn50: U\n        Turn51: U\n        Turn52: U\n        Turn53: U\n        Turn54: U\n        Turn55: U\n        Turn56: U\n\n   But wait: at turn56, after taking U, we are at row9 at turn57 -> which is the goal.\n\n   This is 11 actions.\n\n   However, note: we can also avoid the D at turn47 by staying at row0 until turn48? \n\n        Turn46: S (or D) -> row0 at turn47.\n        Turn47: S (or D) -> row0 at turn48.\n        Turn48: U -> row1 at turn49.\n\n        Then same as above: \n            Turn49: U -> row2 at turn50\n            ... until turn56: U -> row9 at turn57.\n\n        This is also 11 actions.\n\n   I'll choose the one that uses U at turn46 and then D at turn47 to illustrate.\n\n   Therefore, the answer:\n\n        Turn 46: U\n        Turn 47: D\n        Turn 48: U\n        Turn 49: U\n        Turn 50: U\n        Turn 51: U\n        Turn 52: U\n        Turn 53: U\n        Turn 54: U\n        Turn 55: U\n        Turn 56: U\n\n   But wait: at turn56, we are at row8? then we take U to go to row9. That's the last action.\n\n   We have 11 actions: turns 46 to 56.\n\n   So the minimal number of turns H is 11.\n\n   Let me write in the required format.\n\n   Note: the current turn is t_1=46.\n\n   The sequence: \n        Turn 46: U\n        Turn 47: D\n        Turn 48: U\n        Turn 49: U\n        Turn 50: U\n        Turn 51: U\n        Turn 52: U\n        Turn 53: U\n        Turn 54: U\n        Turn 55: U\n        Turn 56: U\n\n   We can output.\n\n   But note: we must be sure that at turn48 we are at row0? \n\n        At turn46: we take U -> so at turn47: y47 = 0+1 = 1.\n        At turn47: we take D -> so at turn48: y48 = 1-1 = 0.\n        Then at turn48: we take U -> so at turn49: y49 = 0+1 = 1.\n        Then at turn49: U -> y50=2.\n        ... until turn56: U -> y57=9.\n\n   And we are safe at every turn:\n\n        turn46: y46=0 -> safe.\n        turn47: y47=1 -> we check row1 at t=47: safe (precomputed) -> safe.\n        turn48: y48=0 -> safe.\n        turn49: y49=1 -> row1 at t=49: safe.\n        turn50: y50=2 -> row2 at t=50: safe.\n        turn51: y51=3 -> row3 at t=51: safe.\n        turn52: y52=4 -> row4 at t=52: safe.\n        turn53: y53=5 -> row5 at t=53: safe.\n        turn54: y54=6 -> row6 at t=54: safe.\n        turn55: y55=7 -> row7 at t=55: safe.\n        turn56: y56=8 -> row8 at t=56: safe.\n\n   And then at turn57: we are at y57=9 -> safe and goal.\n\n   So it is valid.\n\n   Therefore, we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: D\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: U\nTurn 54: U\nTurn 55: U\nTurn 56: U\n}\n\n   But note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". Here H=11, so t from 0 to 10.\n\n   The actions are for turns: 46 (t=0), 47 (t=1), ... 56 (t=10).\n\n   So the above is correct.\n\n   However, note that we could have a shorter path? \n\n        What if we go down at turn46? \n\n            turn46: D -> then at turn47: y=0.\n            turn47: U -> at turn48: y=1 -> but row1 at turn48: unsafe -> crash.\n\n        So that fails.\n\n        Or turn46: U, then turn47: S -> then at turn48: y=1 -> unsafe.\n\n        So the only safe option at turn47 from row1 is to go down.\n\n   Therefore, we output the above.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from (0, 0) at turn 46 while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, the minimal number of turns required is 11. The sequence of actions ensures the player moves safely by avoiding rows at turns when cars occupy x=0. The safety of each row at each turn is precomputed based on car movements (all cars are right-moving, with positions updated as \\([\\tau + s \\cdot (T - 46), h + s \\cdot (T - 46)]\\) for turn \\(T\\), and collision occurs if 0 is in this span).\n\n- Rows 1-4 are unsafe at turn 48.\n- Rows 5-6 are unsafe at turns 50 and 51.\n- Rows 7-8 are always safe.\n\nThe optimal path involves:\n- Moving up to row 1 at turn 47 (safe).\n- Moving down to row 0 at turn 48 (safe, avoiding rows 1-4).\n- Moving up consecutively from turn 48 to turn 56, reaching row 9 at turn 57.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 46: U \\\\\nTurn 47: D \\\\\nTurn 48: U \\\\\nTurn 49: U \\\\\nTurn 50: U \\\\\nTurn 51: U \\\\\nTurn 52: U \\\\\nTurn 53: U \\\\\nTurn 54: U \\\\\nTurn 55: U \\\\\nTurn 56: U\n}",

The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where there's a car whose span includes 0 at that turn. The span moves based on the car's direction and speed.\n\nCars are on specific freeways, and each freeway has one or more cars. I need to consider the position of cars at each turn relative to t_1=48.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=48 for simplicity, so t_1=48. I need to find actions from t=48 onwards.\n\nThe player starts at y=0. Since the goal is y=9, and we can only move up or down by 1 each turn, the minimum number of turns just to move from y=0 to y=9 is 9 turns if we only go up. But we have to avoid collisions, so it might take more if we need to wait or detour.\n\nThe collisions depend on the cars on the freeways we pass through.\n\nLet me list all the cars and their positions at turn t=48.\n\nFor each car, the span is given at t=48, and we can compute the span at any future turn T using the formulas.\n\nFirst, freeway k=1: one car, head h=0, tail τ=-23, direction right, speed s=24.\n\nSince it's right-moving, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)] where t=48.\n\nAt T, span = [τ + s(T-48), h + s(T-48)] for right-moving cars.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all cars seem right-moving; let me check.\n\nFreeway 1: d=right, s=24, h=0, τ=-23\n\nFreeway 2: d=right, s=36, h=24, τ=-11? It says (24, -11, right, 36), so head=24, tail=-11? That seems odd because for right-moving, head should be greater than tail, but here head=24, tail=-11, so span is from -11 to 24, which is length 35, but with speed 36, it might be moving right.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (24, -11, right, 36) — same as k=2.\n\nFreeway 4: also (24, -11, right, 36) — all three are identical? But they are on different freeways, so I need to consider each separately.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6) all with speed 6.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6: same as freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: (56,45,right,4)\n\nAll cars are right-moving, so for all, at time T, span = [τ + s(T-48), h + s(T-48)]\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in [τ + s(T-48), h + s(T-48)]\n\nSince the player is at x=0 always, we only care about when x=0 is covered by a car's span on the row y_T.\n\nNow, the player moves vertically, so at each turn, we choose to go up, down, or stay, which changes y for the next position.\n\nImportant note: when you move to a new y, you are not on that new y until the next turn. Specifically, at turn T, you are on y_T, and after action, you go to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nFrom the collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, you are on freeway y_T. If you stay or move, but you are only on y_T at that turn. When you move, at turn T you are on y_T, and after action, at turn T+1 you are on y_{T+1}.\n\nSo for collision at T, it depends on y_T and the cars on that freeway at time T.\n\nNow, the player starts at t=48, y=0.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway with cars; the freeways are y=1 to y=8, so at y=0, there are no cars, so it's safe. Similarly, y=9 is the goal, no cars.\n\nBut we need to reach (0,9), so we must pass through y=1 to y=8.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway and each possible time, when it is unsafe, i.e., when there is a car covering x=0.\n\nSince the cars move, we need to find for each freeway k, at time T, if 0 is in the span of any car on k.\n\nStart with freeway 1 (y=1):\n\nCars: one car, head h=0, tail τ=-23, d=right, s=24\n\nAt time T, span = [τ + s(T-48), h + s(T-48)] = [-23 + 24(T-48), 0 + 24(T-48)] = [24(T-48) - 23, 24(T-48)]\n\n0 is in this span if 24(T-48) - 23 <= 0 <= 24(T-48)\n\nSince the span is [L, R] with L <= R.\n\nSo 24(T-48) - 23 <= 0 and 0 <= 24(T-48)\n\nFrom 0 <= 24(T-48), T-48 >= 0, so T >= 48\n\nFrom 24(T-48) - 23 <= 0, 24(T-48) <= 23, T-48 <= 23/24 < 1, so T-48 <= 0 since T integer.\n\nThus T-48 <= 0 and T-48 >=0, so T-48=0, T=48.\n\nAt T=48, L = 24(0) -23 = -23, R=0, so [ -23, 0], which includes 0.\n\nFor T>48, L = 24(T-48) -23, R=24(T-48), both positive and increasing, so L > -23 but since T-48 >=1, L >= 24(1)-23=1, R=24, so [1,24], 0 not included.\n\nFor T<48, but since we start at T=48, we don't care about earlier times.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe only at T=48.\n\nAt T=48, if player is on y=1, it would be collision, but at T=48, player is at y=0, not on y=1.\n\nPlayer starts at T=48 on y=0.\n\nNow, if player moves to y=1 at some turn.\n\nFor example, if at turn T=48, player does U, then at T=49, y=1.\n\nBut at T=49, for freeway 1, is it safe?\n\nAt T=49, span = [24(1)-23, 24(1)] = [1,24], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, later times, it's safe.\n\nSo freeway 1 is only unsafe at T=48, but since player not there at T=48, it can be crossed safely after, as long as not at T=48.\n\nNow freeway 2: k=2, one car: head=24, tail=-11, right, s=36\n\nAt T, span = [τ + s(T-48), h + s(T-48)] = [-11 + 36(T-48), 24 + 36(T-48)]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 36(T-48) <= 0 <= 24 + 36(T-48)\n\nFirst, 0 <= 24 + 36(T-48) always true for T>=48, since 24>0.\n\nSecond, -11 + 36(T-48) <= 0 => 36(T-48) <= 11 => T-48 <= 11/36 < 1, so T-48 <=0, T<=48.\n\nThus only at T=48, L= -11 +0 = -11, R=24, [ -11,24] includes 0.\n\nFor T>48, L = -11 +36(T-48) >= -11 +36=25 >0 for T=49, so [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe only at T=48.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, (24,-11,right,36), so unsafe only at T=48.\n\nFreeway 4: same, unsafe only at T=48.\n\nNow freeway 5: has three cars.\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,6) head=60, tail=49, s=6\n\nAt T, span = [49 + 6(T-48), 60 + 6(T-48)] = [6(T-48)+49, 6(T-48)+60]\n\n0 in span? 6(T-48)+49 <= 0 <= 6(T-48)+60\n\nBut 6(T-48)+49 >= 49 >0 for T>=48, so 0 cannot be <= since left end >=49>0, so never includes 0.\n\nSimilarly, 6(T-48)+60 >0, so 0 not in [L,R] since L>0.\n\nSecond car on k=5: (24,13,right,6) head=24, tail=13, s=6\n\nSpan = [13 + 6(T-48), 24 + 6(T-48)]\n\nFor T>=48, L=13 +6(T-48) >=13>0, R larger, so 0 not in span.\n\nThird car: (-12,-23,right,6) head=-12? tail=-23\n\nSpan = [-23 + 6(T-48), -12 + 6(T-48)]\n\n0 in span if -23 +6(T-48) <= 0 <= -12 +6(T-48)\n\nFirst inequality: -23 +6(T-48) <=0 => 6(T-48) <=23 => T-48 <= 23/6 ≈3.833, so T<=48+3=51? T-48 <= floor(23/6)=3 since 6*3=18<23, 6*4=24>23, so T-48 <=3? Let's solve.\n\n6(T-48) <=23, T-48 <= 23/6 = 3 + 5/6, so since T integer, T-48 <=3, T<=51.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -12 +6(T-48) => 12 <= 6(T-48) => 2 <= T-48 => T >=50\n\nSo both: T >=50 and T <=51\n\nAt T=50: L = -23 +6(2) = -23+12= -11, R= -12+12=0, span [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nAt T=51: L= -23 +6(3)= -23+18= -5, R= -12+18=6, span [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nAt T=52: L= -23+24=1, R= -12+24=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, earlier times not relevant.\n\nSo for freeway 5, unsafe at T=50 and T=51 due to the third car.\n\nFirst two cars never cover 0.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5, three cars with same parameters, so unsafe at T=50 and T=51.\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-59,right,12) head=-48, tail=-59? Usually head should be larger, but here head=-48, tail=-59, and right-moving, so span moving right.\n\nAt T, span = [τ + s(T-48), h + s(T-48)] = [-59 + 12(T-48), -48 + 12(T-48)]\n\n0 in span if -59 +12(T-48) <= 0 <= -48 +12(T-48)\n\nFirst: -59 +12(T-48) <=0 => 12(T-48) <=59 => T-48 <= 59/12 ≈4.916, so T<=48+4=52? 12*4=48<59, 12*5=60>59, so T-48 <=4? T-48 <= floor(59/12)=4 since 59/12=4.916, floor 4.\n\n12(T-48) <=59, T-48 <= 59/12 = 4 + 11/12, so T-48 <=4 for integer, T<=52.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 +12(T-48) => 48 <= 12(T-48) => 4 <= T-48 => T>=52\n\nSo T>=52 and T<=52? T-48=4, T=52.\n\nAt T=52: L= -59 +12(4) = -59+48= -11, R= -48+48=0, span [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nAt T=53: L= -59+60=1, R= -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe only at T=52.\n\nFreeway 8: (56,45,right,4) head=56, tail=45, s=4\n\nSpan = [45 +4(T-48), 56 +4(T-48)]\n\nFor T>=48, L=45 +4(T-48) >=45>0, so never includes 0. Safe at all times.\n\nSummary of unsafe times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: unsafe only at T=48\n\n- y=2: unsafe only at T=48\n\n- y=3: unsafe only at T=48\n\n- y=4: unsafe only at T=48\n\n- y=5: unsafe at T=50 and T=51\n\n- y=6: unsafe at T=50 and T=51\n\n- y=7: unsafe only at T=52\n\n- y=8: safe at all times\n\nPlayer starts at T=48, y=0.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9 in minimal H turns, meaning after H actions, at turn t_1 + H - 1 = 48 + H - 1, y=9.\n\nLet T be the turn number, starting from T=48.\n\nAt each turn T, we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T.\n\nAfter action at T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy based on a_T.\n\nThe sequence: at T=48, y_48=0.\n\nAfter action a_48, y_49 = y_48 + Δy_48\n\nAt T=49, y_49, then action a_49, y_50 = y_49 + Δy_49, and so on.\n\nWe want for some H, at turn T=48 + H - 1, y_{48 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nT_final = 48 + H - 1\n\ny_{T_final} = 9.\n\nSince we start at y=0, and need to get to y=9, minimum moves: if we go up every turn, we can reach y=9 in 9 turns: from T=48 to T=56? Let's see.\n\nStart T=48, y=0\n\nAfter a_48: if U, y_49=1\n\na_49: U, y_50=2\n\n...\n\nAfter 9 up moves: at turn T=48+9-1? The turn when y=9.\n\nAfter k actions, we are at turn T=48 + k, with y_{48+k} = 0 + number of ups minus downs.\n\nTo reach y=9 with only ups, it takes 9 actions: a_48 to a_56? T=48: after 0 actions, y=0\n\nAfter 1 action (a_48), at T=49, y=1\n\nAfter 2 actions (a_48,a_49), at T=50, y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter 9 actions (a_48 to a_56), at T=57, y=9? Let's index.\n\nAt turn T, y_T is position before action or after? The position is given for turn t, so at turn T, position is (0, y_T), then we choose action a_T, which updates y for next turn.\n\nSo at T=48, y_48=0\n\nAfter a_48, y_49 = y_48 + Δy\n\nAt T=49, y_49, and so on.\n\nTo have y_T = 9 at some T.\n\nFrom y_48=0 to y_T=9, the number of turns elapsed is T - 48.\n\nThe change in y is +9, with each action changing y by -1,0,+1.\n\nMinimal actions: if all U, then after 9 actions, y_{48+9} = y_57 = 9.\n\nT = 48 + k, where k is number of actions taken.\n\nAfter k actions, we are at turn T = 48 + k, with y_{48+k}.\n\ny_{48+k} = 0 + sum of Δy from t=48 to t=47+k? Actions from t=48 to t=48+k-1 affect y from 49 to 48+k.\n\ny_{48} = 0\n\ny_{49} = y_48 + Δy_{48}\n\ny_{50} = y_49 + Δy_{49} = y_48 + Δy_{48} + Δy_{49}\n\n...\n\ny_{48+k} = y_48 + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} Δy_{48+i}\n\nSet y_{48+k} = 9, so sum_{i=0}^{k-1} Δy_{48+i} = 9\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, so to minimize k, we need all Δy=1, so k=9, y_{57} =9.\n\nAt turn T=57, y=9.\n\nNow, during the path, from T=48 to T=56 (since at T=57 we are at y=9, and no need to be on freeway), we need to be safe at each turn T when y_T between 1 and 8.\n\nCollision only when on freeway y=1 to 8.\n\nAt T=48, y=0, safe.\n\nAt T=57, y=9, safe.\n\nBut between, for T from 49 to 56, y_T from 1 to 8 potentially.\n\nNow, with all up moves: actions a_48 to a_56 all U.\n\nThen:\n\nT=48: y=0, safe\n\nT=49: y=1, now check freeway 1 at T=49: from earlier, safe, since unsafe only at T=48.\n\nT=50: y=2, freeway 2 at T=50: unsafe only at T=48, so safe.\n\nSimilarly T=51: y=3, freeway 3 unsafe only at T=48, safe.\n\nT=52: y=4, freeway 4 unsafe only at T=48, safe.\n\nT=53: y=5, freeway 5 at T=53: unsafe at T=50,51, but T=53>51, safe.\n\nT=54: y=6, freeway 6 at T=54: unsafe at T=50,51, T=54>51, safe.\n\nT=55: y=7, freeway 7 at T=55: unsafe at T=52, T=55>52, safe.\n\nT=56: y=8, freeway 8 always safe.\n\nT=57: y=9, safe.\n\nSo with all up moves, we reach y=9 at T=57, and no collisions.\n\nIs that possible? Let me confirm the unsafe times.\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe at T=50,51; at T=53, y=5, but T=53 not unsafe, so ok.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut in this path, at T=50, y=2, which is freeway 2, unsafe only at T=48, so safe.\n\nAt T=51, y=3, freeway 3, safe.\n\nAt no point are we on an unsafe freeway at unsafe time.\n\nBut freeway 5 is unsafe at T=50 and 51, but in this path, at T=50, we are on y=2, not y=5; at T=51, on y=3, not y=5.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 unsafe at T=52, but at T=52, we are on y=4 (since all up: T=48:y=0, T=49:y=1, T=50:y=2, T=51:y=3, T=52:y=4), so y=4 at T=52, which is freeway 4, unsafe only at T=48, safe.\n\nThen T=53:y=5, freeway 5, T=53 safe.\n\nT=54:y=6, freeway 6, T=54 safe (unsafe at 50,51).\n\nT=55:y=7, freeway 7, T=55 safe (unsafe only T=52).\n\nT=56:y=8, safe.\n\nT=57:y=9.\n\nSo with 9 up actions, we reach in 9 turns, no problem.\n\nBut the minimal H is 9? H is the number of turns, I think.\n\nThe sequence has H actions, from t=48 to t=48+H-1, and at turn t=48+H-1, y=9.\n\nIn this case, actions from t=48 to t=56, that's 9 actions: t=48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56.\n\nThen at turn t=57, y=9.\n\nt=48+H-1=57, so H-1=9, H=10? I think I confused.\n\nDefine: the sequence of actions is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, so indices t=48, 48+1, ..., 48+H-1.\n\nAfter these H actions, at the next turn, y_{t_1 + H} =9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t_1 =48, position is given.\n\nAfter action a_{48}, we go to turn 49 with y_{49}.\n\nAfter action a_{49}, turn 50 with y_{50}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions: actions a_{48} to a_{48+H-1}, we have set y_{49} to y_{48+H}.\n\nSpecifically, after k actions, we have y_{48+k} for k=1 to H.\n\nAnd we want y_{48+H} =9.\n\nAt turn t=48+H, y=9.\n\nSince we start at t=48, the turn when we reach y=9 is t=48 + H.\n\nBut in the answer, it says \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\", let me check.\n\nFrom the problem: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nReaching at turn t_1 + H - 1.\n\nSo at turn T = t_1 + H - 1, position is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, with all up, we reach at T=57, so t_1 + H - 1 =48 + H -1 =57, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions from t=48 to t=48+9=57? t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nH actions: t = t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter these, at turn (t_1 + H -1) +1 = t_1 + H, y is set, but we reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn T, position is (0, y_T).\n\nAfter actions from t=48 to t=48+H-1, the position at turn T=48+H-1 is (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, for example, with all U:\n\nAt T=48: y=0, then a_48=U, so y_49=1\n\nAt T=49: y=1, a_49=U, y_50=2\n\n...\n\nAt T=56: y=8, a_56=U, then y_57=9, but we are at turn T=56, y=8, not yet 9.\n\nTo have at turn T=48+H-1, y=9.\n\nWith all U, at which turn is y=9?\n\nAfter 9 up actions, y_{48+9} = y_57 =9, so at turn T=57, y=9.\n\nBut we want at turn T = t_1 + H -1 =48 + H -1 =57, so 48 + H -1 =57, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nBut with H=10 actions, but to reach y=9, we only need 9 up moves, but with 10 actions, we might have an extra stay or something.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nStart: turn T=48, y_48=0\n\nWe perform H actions: a_{48}, a_{49}, ..., a_{48+H-1}\n\nAfter a_{48}, y_49 = y_48 + Δy_48\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{48+H-1}, y_{48+H} = y_{48+H-1} + Δy_{48+H-1}\n\nBut we want at turn T=48+H-1, y_{48+H-1}=9.\n\nAt the turn before the last action, y should be 9.\n\nFor example, to have at T=48, y=9, but we start at y=0, so impossible at T=48.\n\nMinimal: at T=48, y=0\n\nAfter a_48=U, at T=49, y=1\n\nTo have y=9 at T=49, impossible since max change is +1.\n\nEarliest to reach y=9 is at T=57, with all U from T=48 to T=56.\n\nAt T=57, y=9.\n\nBut we want to reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo set 48 + H -1 =57, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen the actions are from t=48 to t=48+9=57? t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1 =48 to 48+10-1=57.\n\nActions a_{48} to a_{57}.\n\nBut after a_{57}, y_{58} is set, but we care about position at turn before or at the action turn.\n\nAt turn T, before action, position is given, we choose action.\n\nAfter all actions, at turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nWith actions, we need to have y_{48 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn the all up case, y_{57} =9, so 48 + H -1 =57, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen actions from t=48 to t=57, that's 10 actions.\n\nBut with a_{48} to a_{56} all U, y_{57}=9, so at turn T=57, y=9.\n\nNow, what about a_{57}? We don't need to act after reaching, but the sequence includes actions up to t=57, but at t=57, if we are at y=9, we can choose S, for example.\n\nBut in this case, with a_{48} to a_{56} all U, and for a_{57}, we can set S, but at turn T=57, we are already at y=9, so action at T=57 doesn't change position, but we need to specify the action.\n\nSince we reach at T=57, and H=10, actions from t=48 to t=57.\n\nBut to have y_{57}=9, with previous actions.\n\nIn this path, with a_{48} to a_{56} all U, y_{57}=9.\n\nThen a_{57} can be anything, S, U, or D, but if U, y_{58}=10, but y must be <=9, so if y=9, U not allowed? y in [0,9], so if y=9, U is invalid? The player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=9, Δy cannot be +1, similarly if 0, cannot be -1.\n\nIn this case, at T=57, y=9, so action a_{57} cannot be U, can be S or D.\n\nBut since we are at goal, probably S is fine.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to output actions for t=48 to t=57.\n\nBut for reaching, we only need up to a_{56}, but the turn when we reach is T=57, so actions include a_{57} as well? No.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at time t_1 + t.\n\nSo for H=10, t from 0 to 9, actions at t=48+0=48 to t=48+9=57.\n\nWe need to have at turn t_1 + H -1 =48+10-1=57, y=9.\n\nWith a_{48} to a_{56} all U, y_{57}=9.\n\nThen a_{57} can be S, for example.\n\nIn this case, during the path, as before, no collisions.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nMinimal H: since we need to go from y=0 to y=9, and each action can increase y by at most 1, we need at least 9 actions to increase y by 9, but with H actions, the number of turns is H, but the position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nLet K = H -1, then at turn t_1 + K, y=9.\n\nK is the number of turns after start.\n\nAt turn t_1, y=0.\n\nAt turn t_1 + K, y=9.\n\nThe minimal K such that we can reach in K turns.\n\nWith all U, K=9, at T=48+9=57, y=9.\n\nCan we reach earlier? Only if we start higher, but we start at 0, so no. Minimal K=9, H=K+1? From above, at turn t_1 + K, y=9, and K=9, then t_1 + H -1 = t_1 + K, so H-1=K, H=K+1=10.\n\nSince at turn t_1, we are at y=0, and after first action, we can be at y=1 at earliest turn t_1 +1.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t_1 + M, we can be at y=M at earliest.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn t_1 + M, minimal M=9, at T=57.\n\nThus minimal H: since at turn t_1 + H -1 =57, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nWith H=10, we can reach with 9 up and one stay, or something.\n\nIn the path above, with all up actions except possibly the last.\n\nBut in this case, with the car constraints, it seems we can do it in H=10 with no issue.\n\nBut earlier I thought freeway 5 and 6 are unsafe at T=50,51, but in the path, we are not there at those times.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 at T=52 unsafe, but we are on y=4 at T=52.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nBut perhaps we can go faster? No, we cannot reach before T=57.\n\nMaybe with down moves, but that would take more turns, not less.\n\nSo minimal H=10.\n\nBut let me confirm the unsafe times again.\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe at T=50 and 51.\n\nIn the path: at T=50, y=2 (freeway 2), not 5.\n\nT=51, y=3, not 5.\n\nT=52, y=4, not 5.\n\nT=53, y=5, freeway 5, T=53 safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same, unsafe T=50,51; at T=54, y=6, T=54 safe.\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe T=52; at T=55, y=7, T=55 safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter path by going down or staying to avoid, but since we don't need to, and it takes more turns, H would be larger.\n\nFor example, if we stay at some point, it takes more actions to reach y=9.\n\nSo minimal H is 10.\n\nNow, the sequence: actions from t=48 to t=57.\n\nWith a_{48} to a_{56} all U, and a_{57} can be S, since y=9.\n\nBut at t=57, we are at y=9, so action a_{57} should be S to stay, or D to go down, but going down is not good, so S.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to output for each turn the action.\n\nBut the action at t affects the next position.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be like:\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 56: U\n\nThen Turn 57: S\n\nBut at Turn 57, we are already at y=9, so S is fine.\n\nSince we reach at turn 57, and H=10, actions from 48 to 57.\n\nBut for t=57, the action is chosen, but it doesn't affect the position at turn 57, since position is before action.\n\nBut we need to specify the action.\n\nTo minimize, we could have a_{57} not needed, but we have to include it.\n\nIn this case, with a_{48} to a_{56} U, and a_{57} S.\n\nBut a_{56} U from y=8 to y=9 at T=57.\n\nThen a_{57} S to stay at y=9.\n\nNow, is there a problem with any car?\n\nAt T=57, y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nIn the sequence, during T=48 to T=56, we are on various freeways, but as before, safe.\n\nFreeway 8 at T=56: y=8, freeway 8 always safe, as we saw.\n\nBut let me list the turns and positions for clarity.\n\nAssume actions: a_{48}=U, a_{49}=U, ..., a_{56}=U, a_{57}=S\n\nThen:\n\n- At T=48: y=0 (safe)\n\n- Action a_{48}=U → y_{49}=1\n\n- At T=49: y=1, freeway 1, T=49 safe (since unsafe only at 48)\n\n- Action a_{49}=U → y_{50}=2\n\n- At T=50: y=2, freeway 2, T=50 safe (unsafe only at 48)\n\n- Action a_{50}=U → y_{51}=3\n\n- At T=51: y=3, freeway 3, T=51 safe (unsafe only at 48)\n\n- Action a_{51}=U → y_{52}=4\n\n- At T=52: y=4, freeway 4, T=52 safe (unsafe only at 48)\n\n- Action a_{52}=U → y_{53}=5\n\n- At T=53: y=5, freeway 5, T=53: unsafe at 50,51, not 53, safe\n\n- Action a_{53}=U → y_{54}=6\n\n- At T=54: y=6, freeway 6, T=54: unsafe at 50,51, not 54, safe\n\n- Action a_{54}=U → y_{55}=7\n\n- At T=55: y=7, freeway 7, T=55: unsafe at 52, not 55, safe\n\n- Action a_{55}=U → y_{56}=8\n\n- At T=56: y=8, freeway 8, always safe\n\n- Action a_{56}=U → y_{57}=9\n\n- At T=57: y=9, safe\n\n- Action a_{57}=S → y_{58}=9, but we don't care.\n\nSince we reach at T=57, and H=10, the sequence includes a_{57}, which we set to S.\n\nNow, but in the action at T=57, it is after we have reached, but we need to include it in the sequence.\n\nTo avoid the extra action, but minimal H requires 10 actions to have turn 57 with y=9.\n\nSince at turn 57, y=9, and we perform action at T=57, but it doesn't change the reaching.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier with different moves, but impossible.\n\nAnother thing: what if we go down at some point? But that would only delay reaching y=9, so H larger, not smaller.\n\nSo H=10 is minimal.\n\nBut let me check if for some freeway, at other times it might be unsafe, but from above, no.\n\nFor example, freeway 5: we have T=53 safe, but is there another car that could be unsafe?\n\nEarlier I checked all cars on freeway 5: only the third car causes unsafe at T=50,51, others never cover 0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 6 same.\n\nFreeway 7 only at T=52.\n\nSo yes.\n\nPerhaps the player can move faster by going up multiple, but no, only one step per turn.\n\nSo I think the minimal H is 10 with all up and last stay.\n\nBut in the sequence, we can have a_{57} as U, but y=9, cannot go up, so invalid. Must be S or D.\n\nD would go to y=8, not good.\n\nSo S is fine.\n\nSince at T=56, y=8, after a_{56}=U, y_{57}=9, and at T=57, we are done.\n\nBut the action at T=57 is still required in the sequence.\n\nPerhaps we can have H=9, but let's see.\n\nIf H=9, then actions from t=48 to t=48+8=56.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H -1 =48+9-1=56, we need y_{56}=9.\n\nBut from y=0 at T=48, to y=9 at T=56, that requires increasing by 9 in 8 turns? From T=48 to T=56, that's 8 steps? Positions: T=48 to T=56, 8 turns later.\n\ny_{56} = y_{48} + sum of Δy from t=48 to t=55? Actions a_{48} to a_{55} affect y_{49} to y_{56}.\n\ny_{56} = y_{48} + sum_{i=0}^{7} Δy_{48+i}  (since from i=0 to 7, 8 actions? Let's count.\n\nTo have y_{56} =9, starting from y_{48}=0.\n\nThe changes: actions a_{48} to a_{55} determine y_{49} to y_{56}.\n\nThere are 8 actions: a_{48} to a_{55}.\n\nEach Δy <=1, so max y_{56} = 0 + 8*1 =8, which is less than 9.\n\nCannot reach y=9 in 8 actions; maximum y=8 at T=56.\n\nThus minimal to reach y=9 is at T=57 with 9 up actions (from a_{48} to a_{56}).\n\nThus H must be 10, with actions up to t=57, and at T=57, y=9.\n\nSo in the sequence, a_{48} to a_{56} = U, and a_{57} = S.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nBut in the format, it should be for each turn.\n\nAlso, the initial turn is t_1=48.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: S\n\nBut at Turn 57, action S, but position is already 9.\n\nTo save, we could have a_{57} not needed, but we have to include.\n\nPerhaps we can have only 9 actions, but then we reach at T=56 with y=8, not 9.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n\nBut in the sequence above, during T=50, we are on y=2, which is safe, etc.\n\nBut let me confirm T=50: y=2, freeway 2, at T=50, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=51: y=3, freeway 3, safe.\n\nAt T=52: y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nAnd freeway 5 unsafe at T=50,51, but we are not on y=5 at those times.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 6, same.\n\nBut freeway 6 has cars, but unsafe only at T=50,51, same as freeway 5.\n\nIn the state, freeway 5 and 6 have the same car configurations, so both unsafe at T=50,51.\n\nBut in the path, we are not on them at those times.\n\nAt T=54, we are on y=6, T=54 safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10, with the sequence above.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to box it.\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nAlso, the car state for freeway 5 and 6 have multiple cars, but I think I covered.\n\nAnother thing: for freeway 7, unsafe at T=52, at which we are on y=4, not y=7.\n\nSo fine.\n\nSo I think this works.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 0) at turn 48 and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\n### Analysis of Car Positions and Unsafe Times\nThe unsafe times for each freeway (when a car covers x=0) are derived from the car states at turn 48 and their movement rules (all cars are right-moving). The calculations show:\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Unsafe only at turn 48.\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Unsafe only at turn 48.\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Unsafe only at turn 48.\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Unsafe only at turn 48.\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Unsafe at turns 50 and 51.\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Unsafe at turns 50 and 51.\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Unsafe only at turn 52.\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Safe at all times.\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9) in Minimal Turns\nThe minimal number of turns to reach y=9 from y=0 is 9 upward moves, as each move increases y by at most 1. This requires reaching y=9 at turn 57 (since starting at turn 48, y=0). The number of actions \\(H\\) is determined such that the position at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 57\\) is (0, 9). Solving:\n\\[\n48 + H - 1 = 57 \\implies H - 1 = 9 \\implies H = 10\n\\]\nThus, 10 actions are needed, from turn 48 to turn 57.\n\nThe sequence of all \"U\" (up) actions from turn 48 to turn 56 achieves y=9 at turn 57, with no collisions:\n- At turn 48: y=0 (safe, no cars at y=0).\n- At turn 49: y=1 (freeway 1, safe as unsafe only at turn 48).\n- At turn 50: y=2 (freeway 2, safe as unsafe only at turn 48).\n- At turn 51: y=3 (freeway 3, safe as unsafe only at turn 48).\n- At turn 52: y=4 (freeway 4, safe as unsafe only at turn 48).\n- At turn 53: y=5 (freeway 5, safe as unsafe at turns 50-51, not 53).\n- At turn 54: y=6 (freeway 6, safe as unsafe at turns 50-51, not 54).\n- At turn 55: y=7 (freeway 7, safe as unsafe only at turn 52).\n- At turn 56: y=8 (freeway 8, always safe).\n- At turn 57: y=9 (safe, no cars at y=9).\n\nAt turn 57, y=9, so the action must be \"S\" (stay) to remain at y=9, as \"U\" would violate y ≤ 9.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions for turns 48 to 57 is:\n- Turn 48: U\n- Turn 49: U\n- Turn 50: U\n- Turn 51: U\n- Turn 52: U\n- Turn 53: U\n- Turn 54: U\n- Turn 55: U\n- Turn 56: U\n- Turn 57: S\n\nThis achieves the position (0, 9) at turn 57 (i.e., \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 48 + 10 - 1 = 57\\)) with \\(H = 10\\), the minimal number of turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 48: U \\\\\nTurn 49: U \\\\\nTurn 50: U \\\\\nTurn 51: U \\\\\nTurn 52: U \\\\\nTurn 53: U \\\\\nTurn 54: U \\\\\nTurn 55: U \\\\\nTurn 56: U \\\\\nTurn 57: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 0) at turn t1 = 52. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. Collision occurs if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. Also, when moving, the player isn't on the new row until the next turn, so no collision on the row you're moving to at the turn you move.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nNow, the car states are given for each freeway. I need to model where the cars are at any future turn based on their initial state at t1=52.\n\nLet t be the number of turns after t1, so at time t, the actual turn is t1 + t, and t starts from 0.\n\nSo at t=0, position is (0,0).\n\nI need to find actions for t from 0 to H-1, and at t=H-1, y should be 9.\n\nSince we start at y=0 and need to reach y=9, and we can only change y by -1,0,+1 per turn, the minimum number of turns H must be at least 9, because we need to increase y by 9 units. Each U increases by 1, so with all U, it would take 9 turns to go from 0 to 9. But we might have to avoid cars, so we might need to wait or go down sometimes, which could increase H.\n\nBut let's see if we can do it in 9 turns with all U.\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions on the way.\n\nNow, the cars are on rows 1 to 8, and we move through those rows.\n\nAt each turn, when we are on a row, we check if there's a car that covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe player is always at x=0, since it's a vertical move, I assume x is fixed at 0.\n\nThe grid is 2D, but player moves vertically, cars move horizontally on their rows.\n\nPlayer position is (0, y_t), so x=0 always.\n\nCars are on specific y rows, moving left or right.\n\nFor collision: at turn T, if player is on freeway k (so y_T = k), and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in its span [h, τ] or [τ, h] depending on direction, at that turn.\n\nSpan is given with head and tail.\n\nFor left-moving cars, head is left or right? The notation says:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ], and it moves left, so h decreases.\n\nIn the update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nIn the initial state, for left-moving, h is the head, which I think is the front, and for right-moving, it might be similar.\n\nBut in the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor example, on freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nDirection is right, so it's right-moving.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t1) should be [tail, head] or [head, tail]?\n\nFrom the update: right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nAt T=t1, Span(t1) = [τ +0, h +0] = [τ, h]\n\nBut in the input, it's given as (head, tail), so for this car, head=-48, tail=-71.\n\nThen at t1, span is [τ, h] = [-71, -48]? But -71 to -48, which is from left to right? -71 is smaller, so if x increases to the right, [-71, -48] means from x=-71 to x=-48, so head at -48, tail at -71, and moving right, so as time increases, both increase, so the car moves right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, τ] with h > τ, moving left.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nAt t1=52, position: head h=-48, tail τ=-71, direction right, so span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-71, -48]\n\nSince moving right, at time T, span is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] = [-71 + 24*(T-52), -48 + 24*(T-52)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision for freeway k at turn T if player is on y=k and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway.\n\nIf multiple cars, we need to check all.\n\nNow for freeway 5 and 6, there are multiple cars listed.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nAll with speed 6.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6 same cars.\n\nFreeway 7: one car (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: one car (48,37,right,4)\n\nFreeway 1: one car (-48,-71,right,24)\n\nFreeway 2: (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2? (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nFreeway 4: same (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nAll seem to have high speeds.\n\nNow, since we start at y=0, and need to go to y=9, we need to pass through y=1 to 8.\n\nAt each step, when we are on a row, we need to ensure that at that turn, no car on that row has span covering 0.\n\nAlso, when we move, at the turn we move, we are not on the new row yet, so no collision there.\n\nFor example, if at turn T we are on y=k, and we move to y=k+1, then at turn T, we are on k, so we need no collision on k at T. Then at turn T+1, we are on k+1, so need no collision on k+1 at T+1.\n\nIf we stay, we are on the same row.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible, but may need to wait if there's a car at x=0.\n\nSince all cars are moving, the position where they cover x=0 changes with time.\n\nI need to find for each row, when it is safe to be on that row, i.e., when no car covers x=0.\n\nThen, since the player moves at one row per turn, we need to schedule the times when we are on each row such that at that time, the row is safe.\n\nBut we start at t=0 on y=0, and need to be on y=9 at some turn.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, since cars only on y=1 to 8, so no collision possible on y=0 or y=9.\n\nSo we only care about rows 1 to 8.\n\nWe need to go from y=0 to y=9, so we must visit each row from 1 to 8 at least once, but we can stay or move up/down, so we might visit some rows multiple times if we go down, but that would increase H, so for minimal H, we probably want to go directly up with no down, only up or stay, to minimize time.\n\nSince we start at 0 and end at 9, and each U increases y by 1, the minimal H is 9, with all U: U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U from t=0 to 8, at t=8, y=8, then at t=9, y=9, but at t=9, we are at y=9, which is safe, but we need to reach at turn H-1, let's see.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, actions a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAt t=0, after action, position at t=1? Let's see the update.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo after action at time t, position changes to y_{t+1}.\n\nAt time t, position is y_t.\n\nThen action a_t determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nIn terms of turns: at the start of turn t, position is y_t.\n\nThen we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T based on y_T, the position at that turn.\n\nFor turn T, if y_T = k for some k=1 to 8, and on freeway k, there is a car with 0 in span at T.\n\nIn the sequence, for each turn, we have y_t.\n\nFor minimal H, we want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe earliest possible is H=9, with y_t = t for t from 0 to 9? Let's index properly.\n\nSet t as the turn index after t1.\n\nAt t=0 (turn 52), position y=0.\n\nAfter action a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0.\n\nGenerally, at turn t (meaning turn t1+t), position y_t.\n\nThen action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nWe need y_H = 9 for some H, and we want min H.\n\ny_t is defined for t=0 to H.\n\nAt t=0, y_0=0.\n\nAt t=H, y_H=9.\n\nThe number of actions is from t=0 to H-1, so H actions to go from t=0 to t=H.\n\nAfter H actions, we have position at t=H.\n\nWe need y_H=9.\n\nThe minimal H is when we increase y as fast as possible, so with all U, y_t = min(t,9) or something.\n\nStart y_0=0.\n\nAfter a_0=U, y_1=1\n\na_1=U, y_2=2\n\n...\n\na_8=U, y_9=9\n\nSo at t=9, y_9=9, so H=9, and we have actions from t=0 to 8.\n\nt from 0 to 8, that's 9 actions, position from y_0 to y_9.\n\ny_0 at t=0, y_9 at t=9.\n\nNow, we need to check for each t from 1 to 8, when y_t is between 1 and 8, that at that turn t, for freeway y_t, no car covers x=0.\n\ny_t is the position at turn t, so for collision at turn t, we look at y_t.\n\nIn this sequence, with all U, y_t = t for t=0 to 9.\n\ny_0=0, no car, safe.\n\ny_1=1, at turn t=1 (which is t1 +1 =53)\n\nSimilarly, y_2=2 at t=2, etc.\n\nWe need to check for each row k=1 to 8, at time when we are on it.\n\nIn this case, for each t, y_t=t, so we need at turn t, for row k=t, no car covers 0.\n\nSo for row 1, at turn t=1\n\nRow 2 at t=2, ..., row 8 at t=8.\n\nNow, let's compute for each row, when 0 is covered by a car.\n\nFirst, for a given row, at time T, the span of each car.\n\nT is absolute turn, but since we care about time from t1, let τ = T - t1, so τ is time offset from current turn.\n\nAt τ=0, t1=52.\n\nFor a car, at time τ, span is:\n\nIf left-moving: [h - s*τ, τ - s*τ]? From earlier.\n\nLeft-moving: Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] but τ is tail, I used τ for time, conflict.\n\nBetter to use different variable.\n\nSet δt = T - t1, time elapsed since t1.\n\nFor a car with initial head h, tail t, direction d, speed s.\n\nAt time δt, the span is:\n\nIf d = left: [h - s*δt, t - s*δt]  (since both decrease)\n\nIf d = right: [t + s*δt, h + s*δt]  (both increase)\n\nThen 0 is covered if min(span) <= 0 <= max(span)\n\nFor collision on that row, if there exists a car such that 0 is in [min, max] of the span.\n\nNow, for each row, we have the cars.\n\nStart with row 1: freeway 1.\n\nCars: only one car: head=-48, tail=-71, direction=right, speed=24\n\nSo at δt, span = [t + s*δt, h + s*δt] = [-71 + 24*δt, -48 + 24*δt]\n\n0 in span if -71 + 24*δt <= 0 <= -48 + 24*δt\n\nSo -71 + 24*δt <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 24*δt\n\nFirst inequality: -71 + 24*δt <= 0 => 24*δt <= 71 => δt <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 + 24*δt => 48 <= 24*δt => δt >= 48/24 = 2\n\nSo 2 <= δt <= 2.958\n\nThus for row 1, unsafe when δt between 2 and 2.958, approximately.\n\nSince δt integer, δt=2 or 3? 2.958, so at δt=2 and δt=3.\n\nδt=2: -71 + 24*2 = -71 + 48 = -23 <=0, and 0 <= -48 + 48 =0, yes 0<=0, so covered.\n\nδt=3: -71 + 72 =1 >0? min=-71+72=1, max=-48+72=24, so [1,24], 0 not in [1,24], since 0<1.\n\nAt δt=2: min=-71+48=-23, max=-48+48=0, so [-23,0], 0 is included.\n\nAt δt=3: min=-71+72=1, max=-48+72=24, [1,24], 0 not in.\n\nAt δt=1: min=-71+24=-47, max=-48+24=-24, [-47,-24], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nAt δt=0: min=-71, max=-48, both negative.\n\nSo unsafe only at δt=2.\n\nδt=2: min=-23, max=0, so 0 is included.\n\nδt=3: min=1, max=24, 0 not <= max? max=24, 0<1, not in.\n\nSo only at δt=2, row 1 is unsafe.\n\nδt=2 corresponds to turn t1+2=54.\n\nIn our sequence, for row 1, we are on it at turn t=1, which is δt=1.\n\nt=0: turn t1+0=52, y=0\n\nt=1: turn t1+1=53, y=1 if we go up\n\nδt = T - t1, so at turn T=t1+δt.\n\nIn our notation, at turn index t (after start), the turn number is t1 + t.\n\nPosition y_t at that turn.\n\nFor row 1, we are on it at t=1, which is turn 53, δt = (t1+t) - t1 = t.\n\nSince t1 is fixed, δt = t for our sequence.\n\nAt t=1, δt=1, row 1.\n\nAt δt=1, as above, safe, since span [-47,-24], no 0.\n\nAt t=2, we would be on row 2, not row 1.\n\nIn all U sequence, we are on row 1 only at t=1, δt=1, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nNow row 2: freeway 2.\n\nCars: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nhead=-48? tail=-83, direction right, speed 36.\n\nAt δt, span = [t + s δt, h + s δt] = [-83 + 36 δt, -48 + 36 δt]\n\n0 in span if -83 + 36 δt <= 0 <= -48 + 36 δt\n\nFirst: -83 + 36 δt <= 0 => 36 δt <= 83 => δt <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 36 δt => 36 δt >= 48 => δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333\n\nSo δt from 1.333 to 2.305, so integer δt=2.\n\nAt δt=2: min=-83+72= -11, max=-48+72=24, so [-11,24], 0 in it.\n\nAt δt=1: min=-83+36=-47, max=-48+36=-12, [-47,-12], no 0.\n\nδt=2: min=-11, max=24, yes 0 in.\n\nδt=3: min=-83+108=25, max=-48+108=60, [25,60], no 0.\n\nSo unsafe only at δt=2.\n\nIn all U, we are on row 2 at t=2, δt=2, which is unsafe! Collision.\n\nSo at t=2, if we are on row 2, collision.\n\nTherefore, in all U, at t=2, we would crash.\n\nSo we need to avoid that.\n\nSimilarly, row 3: freeway 3, same as row 2? (-48,-83,right,36), identical to row 2.\n\nCars: same, so unsafe at δt=2 only.\n\nSimilarly row 4: same, unsafe at δt=2.\n\nNow row 5: freeway 5, multiple cars.\n\nCars: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nAll right-moving, speed 6.\n\nFor each, find when 0 in span.\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37? head and tail.\n\nDirection right, so at δt, span = [t + s δt, h + s δt]\n\nTail=37, head=48? But 37<48, so tail is left, head is right.\n\nAt δt, span = [37 + 6 δt, 48 + 6 δt]\n\n0 in [37+6δt, 48+6δt]?\n\nSince min=37+6δt >0 for δt>=0, always positive, so never covers 0. 37+6δt >=37>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,6)\n\nSpan = [1 + 6 δt, 12 + 6 δt], min=1+6δt >=1>0, always positive, never covers 0.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nHead=-24, tail=-35? tail=-35, head=-24.\n\nSince right-moving, span = [t + s δt, h + s δt] = [-35 + 6 δt, -24 + 6 δt]\n\n0 in span if -35 + 6 δt <= 0 <= -24 + 6 δt\n\nFirst: -35 + 6 δt <= 0 => 6 δt <= 35 => δt <= 35/6 ≈ 5.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 + 6 δt => 6 δt >= 24 => δt >= 4\n\nSo 4 <= δt <= 5.833, so δt=4,5\n\nAt δt=4: min=-35+24= -11, max=-24+24=0, [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt δt=5: min=-35+30= -5, max=-24+30=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt δt=6: min=-35+36=1, max=-24+36=12, [1,12], no 0.\n\nSo unsafe for δt=4,5.\n\nBut first two cars never cover 0, so only this one matters.\n\nFor row 5, unsafe at δt=4 and 5.\n\nIn all U, we would be on row 5 at t=5, δt=5, which is unsafe.\n\nt=5, y=5.\n\nNow row 6: freeway 6, same as row 5: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nIdentical to row 5, so unsafe at δt=4 and 5.\n\nIn all U, at t=6, y=6, δt=6, which for row 6, at δt=6, as above min=1, max=12 for the third car? For row 6, same cars, so at δt=6, safe, since [1,12] no 0.\n\nBut at t=6, we are on row 6 at δt=6, safe.\n\nNow row 7: freeway 7, one car: (48,37,right,12)\n\nSpan = [37 + 12 δt, 48 + 12 δt], min=37+12δt >=37>0, always positive, never covers 0. So row 7 always safe.\n\nSimilarly row 8: freeway 8, (48,37,right,4)\n\nSpan = [37 + 4 δt, 48 + 4 δt], min=37+4δt >=37>0, always safe.\n\nNow back to all U sequence:\n\nt=0, y=0, safe (no car)\n\nt=1, y=1, row1 at δt=1: safe, as earlier\n\nt=2, y=2, row2 at δt=2: unsafe! Because row2 unsafe at δt=2.\n\nAlso, row3 and row4 also unsafe at δt=2, but we are on row2 at t=2.\n\nSo collision at t=2.\n\nTherefore, cannot go all U directly.\n\nNeed to avoid being on row 2 at δt=2.\n\nSimilarly, row 5 unsafe at δt=4 and 5.\n\nBut first, let's list all unsafe times for each row.\n\nRow 1: unsafe at δt=2\n\nRow 2: unsafe at δt=2\n\nRow 3: unsafe at δt=2 (since same as row2)\n\nRow 4: unsafe at δt=2\n\nRow 5: unsafe at δt=4 and 5\n\nRow 6: unsafe at δt=4 and 5\n\nRow 7: always safe\n\nRow 8: always safe\n\nRows 7 and 8 safe all time.\n\nNow, for minimal H, we want to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nSince rows 2,3,4 all unsafe at δt=2, and we need to pass them, we might need to be on them at different times or wait.\n\nSince we start at t=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe critical point is δt=2, when rows 1,2,3,4 are unsafe? Row1 unsafe only at δt=2, row2 at δt=2, etc.\n\nBut row1 unsafe at δt=2, but at other times safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nWe can be on row1 at δt=1 or δt=3, etc.\n\nSimilarly for row2, unsafe only at δt=2, so safe at other times.\n\nSame for row3 and row4.\n\nRow5 and row6 unsafe at δt=4 and 5, so safe at other times.\n\nNow, since we need to go through all rows, and minimal H=9 might be possible if we adjust timing.\n\nH=9 means we reach y=9 at t=9.\n\nWe need to set the times when we are on each row.\n\nSince we can only change y by ±1 or 0 per turn, we need a sequence of actions.\n\nTo minimize time, we should go up as much as possible, but wait or adjust for unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at t=2, δt=2, rows 1-4 are unsafe, so we should not be on rows 1-4 at t=2.\n\nBut at t=2, if we are on y=0 or y=5 or above, but we start from low, so at early times, y low.\n\nAt t=0, y=0\n\nt=1, if we go up, y=1, which is row1, at δt=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=2, if we go up to y=2, but row2 unsafe at δt=2.\n\nIf we stay on y=1 at t=2, but row1 is unsafe at δt=2, since unsafe at δt=2.\n\nAt t=2, δt=2, if on row1, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if on row2, unsafe.\n\nBut if we are on y=0 at t=2, or y=5, but y=5 at t=2 is impossible since we start from y=0, at t=1 we can be y=1 max.\n\nAt t=0: y=0\n\nAfter a_0: if U, y_1=1\n\nIf S, y_1=0\n\nIf D, y_1=0? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, y in [0,9], so if y_t=0, D would make y_{t+1}=0, since min 0.\n\nSimilarly at top.\n\nAt t=1: position y_1\n\nIf we went up at t=0, y_1=1\n\nThen at t=1, we choose action for y_2.\n\nNow, t=1 is turn t1+1, δt=1.\n\ny_1=1, row1, at δt=1, safe as before.\n\nNow for t=2, δt=2.\n\nIf we go up, y_2=2, but row2 at δt=2 unsafe.\n\nIf we stay, y_2=1, row1 at δt=2 unsafe.\n\nIf we go down, y_2=0, but y=0 has no car, safe, but we are going down, which is away from goal.\n\nBut we can do that to avoid.\n\nSimilarly, we could have stayed at t=0.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nTo avoid being on rows 1-4 at δt=2.\n\nδt=2 is t=2.\n\nAt t=2, we should be on y=0 or y=5 or above, but y=5 at t=2 impossible since from y=0, after two moves, max y=2.\n\nAfter t=0 and t=1 actions, y at t=2 can be 0,1,2.\n\ny=0: safe\n\ny=1: row1 unsafe at δt=2\n\ny=2: row2 unsafe at δt=2\n\nSo at t=2, all possible positions are unsafe if on row, or safe if y=0.\n\nSo only safe is to be on y=0 at t=2.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y=0 at t=2.\n\nNow, at t=0, y=0\n\nTo be at y=0 at t=2, we need y_2=0.\n\ny_2 = y_1 + Δy_1? y_2 depends on y_1 and a_1.\n\ny_1 depends on a_0.\n\ny_0=0\n\nAfter a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0 = 0 + Δy_0\n\nIf a_0 = U, y_1=1\n\nIf a_0 = S, y_1=0\n\nIf a_0 = D, y_1=0\n\nThen at t=1, after a_1, y_2 = y_1 + Δy_1\n\nWe need y_2=0.\n\nSo if y_1=0, then to have y_2=0, a_1 must be S or D.\n\nIf y_1=1, then to have y_2=0, a_1 must be D, so y_2=1-1=0.\n\nBut if y_1=1, at t=1, δt=1, row1 safe, but then we go down to y=0 at t=2.\n\nWe could have stayed at y=0.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nFirst, to have y_2=0.\n\nOne way: at t=0, a_0=S, so y_1=0\n\nThen at t=1, a_1=S or D, so y_2=0\n\nAnother way: a_0=U, y_1=1\n\nThen a_1=D, y_2=0\n\nIn both cases, we are at y=0 at t=2, safe.\n\nNow, at t=2, y=0.\n\nNow we need to go up, but we have lost time.\n\nt=0: y=0\n\nt=1: if we stayed, y=0 or went up and down, but at t=1, if y_1=0, safe; if y_1=1, safe as δt=1.\n\nThen t=2, y=0.\n\nNow from here, we need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal from here: at t=2, y=0.\n\nThen we can start going up.\n\nBut rows 1-4 are safe except at δt=2, which is past.\n\nδt=2 is t=2, done.\n\nNow for future, δt>2.\n\nRow1 safe for δt>2 except it was only unsafe at δt=2, so for δt≠2, safe.\n\nSimilarly row2,3,4 unsafe only at δt=2, so for δt>2, all safe.\n\nRow5 and row6 unsafe at δt=4 and 5.\n\nδt=4 and 5 correspond to t=4 and t=5.\n\nNow at t=2, y=0.\n\nWe can go up.\n\nt=2: y=0\n\nNow action a_2, we can go U to y=1.\n\nAt t=3, δt=3? t=2 is turn t1+2, δt=2.\n\nPosition y_t at turn t, which is δt=t.\n\nAt t=2, δt=2, y=0, safe.\n\nAfter a_2, y_3.\n\nIf a_2=U, y_3=1.\n\nt=3, δt=3, y=1, row1.\n\nAt δt=3, row1 safe, as earlier.\n\nSimilarly, we can go up.\n\nBut we need to avoid row5 at δt=4 and 5, etc.\n\nFirst, let's go up from t=2.\n\nt=2: y=0\n\na_2=U, then y_3=1\n\nt=3: position y=1, δt=3, row1 safe.\n\na_3=U, y_4=2\n\nt=4: y=2, δt=4, row2.\n\nNow row2 unsafe only at δt=2, which is past, so at δt=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_4=U, y_5=3\n\nt=5: y=3, δt=5, row3 safe (since unsafe only δt=2)\n\na_5=U, y_6=4\n\nt=6: y=4, δt=6, row4 safe\n\na_6=U, y_7=5\n\nt=7: y=5, δt=7, row5.\n\nNow row5 unsafe at δt=4 and 5.\n\nAt δt=7, which is after, safe? δt=7, for row5, the car that matters is the third one, span min=-35 +6*7= -35+42=7, max=-24+42=18, [7,18], no 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, row6 same.\n\nThen a_7=U, y_8=6\n\nt=8: y=6, δt=8, row6 safe (min=1+48=49? For row6, cars same, at δt=8, third car min=-35+48=13, max=-24+48=24, [13,24], no 0)\n\na_8=U, y_9=7\n\nt=9: y=7, δt=9, row7 always safe\n\na_9=U, y_10=8\n\nt=10: y=8, δt=10, row8 safe\n\na_10=U, y_11=9\n\nt=11: y=9, safe.\n\nBut we reached at t=11, y=11? t=11 is time index, y_t at t.\n\nAt t=0, y=0\n\nt=1, y=?\n\nIn this sequence: from t=2, y=0\n\na_2=U, y_3=1\n\nt=3, y=1\n\na_3=U, y_4=2\n\nt=4, y=2\n\na_4=U, y_5=3\n\nt=5, y=3\n\na_5=U, y_6=4\n\nt=6, y=4\n\na_6=U, y_7=5\n\nt=7, y=5\n\na_7=U, y_8=6\n\nt=8, y=6\n\na_8=U, y_9=7\n\nt=9, y=7\n\na_9=U, y_10=8\n\nt=10, y=8\n\na_10=U, y_11=9\n\nt=11, y=9\n\nSo at t=11, y=9, so H=11, since we need y_H=9, so H=11, actions from t=0 to 10.\n\nBut we started with t=0 to t=2 at y=0 or something.\n\nIn the beginning, to avoid t=2, we had to be at y=0 at t=2.\n\nFor example, one sequence:\n\nt=0: a_0 = S (stay), so y_1 = 0 (since y_0=0, S, Δy=0)\n\nThen t=1: y=0, safe\n\na_1 = S or D, say S, y_2=0\n\nt=2: y=0, safe\n\nThen from t=2 as above, a_2=U, y_3=1 at t=3\n\n...\n\nUp to a_10=U, y_11=9 at t=11.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut we can be faster.\n\nAnother way: at t=0, a_0=U, so y_1=1 at t=1, safe (δt=1)\n\nThen at t=1, a_1=D, so y_2=1-1=0 at t=2, safe.\n\nThen same as above, from t=2 y=0, go up.\n\nStill reach y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut we lost two turns at the beginning.\n\nNow, can we do better?\n\nFor example, after avoiding δt=2, we can go faster, but we have to go through all rows.\n\nSince rows 5 and 6 are unsafe at δt=4 and 5, but in the above, we are on row5 at t=7, δt=7>5, safe.\n\nSimilarly row6 at t=8, δt=8>5, safe.\n\nBut we used many turns.\n\nPerhaps we can be on row5 and row6 at different times.\n\nFor example, if we can be on row5 at δt=3 or δt=6, etc.\n\nIn the above sequence, we are on row1 at t=3 (δt=3), row2 at t=4 (δt=4), etc., all safe except the issue at start.\n\nBut at the start, we wasted two turns to be at y=0 at t=2.\n\nt=0 and t=1 we didn't progress.\n\nPerhaps we can go up to y=4 or something before δt=2, but impossible because at t=0, y=0, t=1 y=1, t=2 max y=2, which is row2, unsafe at δt=2.\n\nSo we must be below or at y=0 at t=2, and since y=1 and y=2 unsafe, only y=0 safe.\n\nSo we must spend at least two turns not going up, or going down.\n\nThus, minimal H must be more than 9.\n\nThe direct path takes 9 turns but crashes at t=2.\n\nBy waiting two turns, we take 11 turns to reach.\n\nBut perhaps we can save time elsewhere.\n\nFor example, rows 7 and 8 are always safe, so we can go fast there.\n\nBut we have to go through the lower rows.\n\nAnother idea: since row5 and row6 are unsafe at δt=4 and 5, but if we can pass them quickly or at safe times.\n\nIn the sequence above, we pass row5 at t=7, δt=7, safe.\n\nBut δt=7 is late, but we started late.\n\nPerhaps we can reach higher rows earlier by not waiting at the beginning, but we have to avoid t=2.\n\nAt t=0: y=0\n\na_0 = S, y_1=0\n\nt=1: y=0\n\na_1 = U, but if a_1=U, y_2=1, but at t=2, y=1, row1 at δt=2, unsafe! Because row1 unsafe at δt=2.\n\nIf at t=1, a_1=S, y_2=0, safe.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nIf at t=0, a_0=U, y_1=1\n\nThen at t=1, if a_1=S, y_2=1, but at t=2, y=1, row1 δt=2 unsafe.\n\nIf a_1=D, y_2=0, safe.\n\nSo only options to be at y=0 at t=2.\n\nNo way to be at y=3 or something at t=2.\n\nSo we must have y_2=0.\n\nThus, from t=0 to t=2, we have net zero progress in y.\n\nThen from y=0 at t=2, we need to go to y=9, which takes at least 9 more turns, so min H=11.\n\nWith actions: for example, a_0=S, a_1=S, then a_2 to a_10 U, but let's list.\n\nt from 0 to H-1 actions.\n\ny_t at turn t.\n\nWe need y_H=9.\n\nWith H=11, y_11=9.\n\nSequence:\n\nt=0: action a_0, after which y_1\n\nPerhaps list actions and positions.\n\nTurn t (after t1): action a_t, then position at t+1? Better to list for each turn the position and action.\n\nSince collision depends on position at turn.\n\nFor each turn index t (0 to H), position y_t.\n\nActions a_t for t=0 to H-1 determine y_{t+1}.\n\nBut for the answer, we need to output actions for turns starting from t1.\n\nIn the sequence, we need actions a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn terms of our t.\n\nNow for minimal H, H=11 seems necessary.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can do H=10.\n\nIf H=10, y_10=9.\n\nThen at t=10, y=9.\n\nNow, we need to be at y=0 at t=2, as before.\n\nAt t=2, y=0.\n\nThen from t=2 to t=10, we have 8 turns to go from y=0 to y=9, which requires at least 9 steps? y_2=0, y_10=9, so delta y=9, with 8 actions (t=2 to t=9 actions?).\n\nActions from t=2 to t=9 for y_3 to y_10.\n\ny_2 at t=2\n\nAfter a_2, y_3\n\n...\n\nAfter a_9, y_10\n\nNumber of actions: from a_2 to a_9, that's 8 actions (t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)\n\ny from y_2 to y_10, which is 8 steps, from 0 to 9, so we need to increase by 9, but only 8 actions, so impossible with only U, since each U increases by 1, max increase 8 in 8 actions, to y=8, not 9.\n\nIf we start from y_2=0, after 8 actions, max y_10=8, since y_{k} = y_2 + sum of Δy from t=2 to 9, 8 terms, each <=1, so y_10 <= 0 + 8 =8 <9.\n\nThus cannot reach y=9 in 8 actions from y=0.\n\nTherefore, H=10 is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, H=11: from t=0 to t=10, 11 actions, y_0 to y_11.\n\ny_0=0, y_11=9, so 11 steps for 9 increase, possible with 2 stays or downs.\n\nIn our case, we have two \"wasted\" actions at beginning.\n\nWith H=11, we can have y_11=9.\n\nIn the sequence I had, with a_0=S, a_1=S, then a_2 to a_10 all U? Let's compute y.\n\nt=0: y_0=0\n\na_0=S, so y_1=0\n\nt=1: y_1=0\n\na_1=S, y_2=0\n\nt=2: y_2=0\n\na_2=U, y_3=1\n\nt=3: y_3=1\n\na_3=U, y_4=2\n\nt=4: y_4=2\n\na_4=U, y_5=3\n\nt=5: y_5=3\n\na_5=U, y_6=4\n\nt=6: y_6=4\n\na_6=U, y_7=5\n\nt=7: y_7=5\n\na_7=U, y_8=6\n\nt=8: y_8=6\n\na_8=U, y_9=7\n\nt=9: y_9=7\n\na_9=U, y_10=8\n\nt=10: y_10=8\n\na_10=U, y_11=9\n\nt=11: y_11=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nt=0: y=0, safe\n\nt=1: y=0, safe\n\nt=2: y=0, safe\n\nt=3: y=1, row1, δt=3 (since t=3, turn t1+3, δt=3), row1 at δt=3: as earlier, min=-48+24*3=-48+72=24?

In our seq, t=4 y=2.\n\nIf we can be higher.\n\nBut at t=2, y=0.\n\nIf at t=2, a_2=U, y_3=1 at t=3\n\nt=3, a_3=U, y_4=2 at t=4\n\nBut y_4=2, but we can do more? Only two actions from t=2 to t=4? a_2 and a_3 for y_3 and y_4.\n\ny_2=0, after a_2, y_3; after a_3, y_4.\n\nSo y_4 <= y_2 + 2 =2, so at t=4, max y=2.\n\nThen proceed as before.\n\nTo avoid row5 at δt=4 and 5, we need not to be on row5 at t=4 or t=5 (since δt=t).\n\nt=4 δt=4, t=5 δt=5.\n\nIn our sequence, we are on row5 at t=7, δt=7, fine.\n\nIf we could be on row5 at t=3, but t=3 y<=3, and row5 is y=5, impossible.\n\nOr at t=6, but at t=6, with y_2=0, y_6<=4, so y=5 at t=6 impossible.\n\nThus, no better.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=11.\n\nNow for the action sequence, we can choose either: all S at start or U then D.\n\nBut in the answer, perhaps we need to specify.\n\nSince the player might not want to go up and down, but it doesn't matter.\n\nIn the sequence with S,S, we stay at y=0 for two turns.\n\nSimilarly with U,D, we go to y=1 and back.\n\nBut both fine.\n\nNow, in the car state, for freeway 5 and 6, there are multiple cars, but we considered.\n\nAlso, for row 7 and 8, no issue.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow output the sequence.\n\nUsing the S,S start.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 52: S\n\nTurn 53: S\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nIn terms of turn:\n\nTurn t1=52: a_{52} = S\n\nTurn t1+1=53: a_{53} = S\n\nTurn t1+2=54: a_{54} = U\n\nTurn t1+3=55: a_{55} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t1+10=62: a_{62} = U\n\nAfter a_{62}, y at turn 63=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to t=10, which is 11 actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 52: S Turn 53: S Turn 54: U Turn 55: U Turn 56: U Turn 57: U Turn 58: U Turn 59: U Turn 60: U Turn 61: U Turn 62: U }\n\nBut let's write properly.\n\nSince we need to reach at turn t1 + H -1? No.\n\nIn the task: reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1, and after H actions, at turn t1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn the player update: after action at turn t, position at turn t+1.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAction a_T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nAnd actions from turn t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1 + H.\n\nIn our case, at turn 52 (t=0), position y=0.\n\nAfter action a_52, y at turn 53.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{52 + H-1}, y at turn 52 + H.\n\nWe need y_{52 + H} = 9.\n\nWith H=11, actions from turn 52 to 62, y at turn 63=9.\n\nIn the sequence above: turn 52: S, then y at 53:0\n\nTurn 53: S, y at 54:0\n\nTurn 54: U, y at 55:1\n\n...\n\nTurn 62: U, y at 63:9\n\nYes.\n\nTo write the actions:\n\nTurn 52: S\n\nTurn 53: S\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nNow, in the boxed format.\n\nBut for freeway 5 and 6, we have multiple cars, but we handled.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter path if we go down later, but I don't think so.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=0, go U to y=1 at t=1\n\nThen at t=1, if we could stay, but at t=2, if y=1, unsafe.\n\nIf go down, y=0 at t=2.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf we go to y=0 at t=2, then proceed.\n\nSo no shorter.\n\nThus, minimal H=11.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 52\\) is 11. This requires a sequence of actions that avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at each turn.\n\n### Key Constraints and Solution:\n- **Collision Avoidance**: \n  - Rows 1 to 4 are unsafe only at \\(\\delta t = 2\\) (i.e., turn \\(t_1 + 2 = 54\\)).\n  - Rows 5 and 6 are unsafe at \\(\\delta t = 4\\) and \\(\\delta t = 5\\) (turns \\(t_1 + 4 = 56\\) and \\(t_1 + 5 = 57\\)).\n  - Rows 7 and 8 are always safe.\n- **Initial Position**: At turn 52 (\\(t = 0\\)), the player is at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no cars).\n- **Requirement**: To avoid collision at \\(\\delta t = 2\\), the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 54 (\\(t = 2\\)). This is achieved by staying at \\(y = 0\\) for the first two turns (actions: S, S).\n- **Path to \\(y = 9\\)**: After turn 54, the player moves up (U) every turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 63 (\\(t = 11\\)).\n- **Collision Checks**:\n  - At \\(\\delta t = 2\\) (turn 54), \\(y = 0\\) (safe).\n  - Rows 1 to 4 are visited at \\(\\delta t \\geq 3\\) (safe, as unsafe only at \\(\\delta t = 2\\)).\n  - Rows 5 and 6 are visited at \\(\\delta t = 7\\) and \\(\\delta t = 8\\) (safe, as unsafe only at \\(\\delta t = 4\\) and \\(5\\)).\n  - Rows 7 and 8 are always safe.\n- **Minimal \\(H\\)**: \n  - \\(H = 10\\) is impossible because starting from \\(y = 0\\) at turn 54, 8 actions (turns 54 to 61) can only reach \\(y = 8\\) at turn 62 (since each U increases \\(y\\) by 1, and 8 actions yield max \\(y = 8\\)).\n  - \\(H = 11\\) is achievable and minimal.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1 + t\\) from \\(t = 0\\) to \\(t = 10\\) (turns 52 to 62) is:\n\n- Turn 52: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\))\n- Turn 53: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\))\n- Turn 54: U (move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 55)\n- Turn 55: U (move to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 56)\n- Turn 56: U (move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 57)\n- Turn 57: U (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 58)\n- Turn 58: U (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 59)\n- Turn 59: U (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 60)\n- Turn 60: U (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 61)\n- Turn 61: U (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 62)\n- Turn 62: U (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 63)\n\n### Verification:\n- **Turn 52 (t=0)**: Position \\(y = 0\\) (safe).\n- **Turn 53 (t=1)**: Position \\(y = 0\\) (safe).\n- **Turn 54 (t=2)**: Position \\(y = 0\\) (safe).\n- **Turn 55 (t=3)**: Position \\(y = 1\\), \\(\\delta t = 3\\): Row 1 car span at \\(\\delta t = 3\\) is \\([1, 24]\\) (0 not in span, safe).\n- **Turn 56 (t=4)**: Position \\(y = 2\\), \\(\\delta t = 4\\): Row 2 car span at \\(\\delta t = 4\\) is \\([61, 96]\\) (0 not in span, safe).\n- **Turn 57 (t=5)**: Position \\(y = 3\\), \\(\\delta t = 5\\): Row 3 car span at \\(\\delta t = 5\\) is \\([97, 132]\\) (0 not in span, safe).\n- **Turn 58 (t=6)**: Position \\(y = 4\\), \\(\\delta t = 6\\): Row 4 car span at \\(\\delta t = 6\\) is similar to row 2/3 (0 not in span, safe).\n- **Turn 59 (t=7)**: Position \\(y = 5\\), \\(\\delta t = 7\\): Row 5 cars—third car span \\([7, 18]\\) (0 not in span, safe).\n- **Turn 60 (t=8)**: Position \\(y = 6\\), \\(\\delta t = 8\\): Row 6 cars—third car span \\([13, 24]\\) (0 not in span, safe).\n- **Turn 61 (t=9)**: Position \\(y = 7\\), \\(\\delta t = 9\\): Row 7 always safe.\n- **Turn 62 (t=10)**: Position \\(y = 8\\), \\(\\delta t = 10\\): Row 8 always safe.\n- **Turn 63 (t=11)**: Position \\(y = 9\\) (safe, goal reached).\n\nThis sequence minimizes \\(H\\) to 11 and avoids all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 52: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 53: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 54: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 55: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 56: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 57: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 58: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 59: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 60: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 61: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 62: \\text{ U} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 54, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and the car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nThe player updates at the same time as the cars. Note that when the player moves (U, D, S), the new position is set at the next turn. Specifically, at turn T, the player is at y_T. Then we choose an action a_T which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nCrucial: When the player is at turn T at position y_T, we check the cars on freeway y_T at turn T. If the player moves to y_{T+1} at the next turn, then at turn T+1 we check the cars on freeway y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nNote: The problem states that if you move to a different freeway at turn T, then at turn T you are still on the old freeway, and at turn T+1 you are on the new freeway. So you avoid the new freeway at turn T.\n\nWe are starting at (0,0) at turn 54. Our goal is to reach (0,9). The vertical axis is from 0 to 9. The player can only be at integer y values.\n\nWe need to compute the positions of the cars at any future turn T (>=54). The time elapsed is (T - 54).\n\nLet me denote:\n  T0 = 54\n\nFor a car at freeway k, given its state at T0 (head, tail, direction, speed), we can compute its span at turn T (>=54) as:\n\nIf the car is moving right (d = 'right'):\n  head(T) = head0 + s * (T - T0)\n  tail(T) = tail0 + s * (T - T0)\n  So the span is [tail(T), head(T)] (since head0 > tail0 for a right-moving car, and it increases).\n\nIf the car is moving left (d = 'left'):\n  head(T) = head0 - s * (T - T0)\n  tail(T) = tail0 - s * (T - T0)\n  So the span is [head(T), tail(T)]? But note the problem says for left-moving: \n      Span(T0) = [h, τ] -> Span(T) = [h - s*(T-T0), τ - s*(T-T0)]\n  And note that in the initial state for left-moving, the head is the rightmost? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: at T0 the span is [h, τ] and then it moves left. But in the given data, all cars are right-moving? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the given data, all cars have direction 'right'. So we only need to handle right-moving.\n\nTherefore, for every car, the span at turn T is:\n  [τ0 + s*(T-T0), h0 + s*(T-T0)]\n\nBut note: the problem states for right-moving: \n  Span(T0) = [τ, h] -> [τ + s*(T-T0), h + s*(T-T0)]\n\nIn the table, the cars are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For example, freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24). So head0 = -48, tail0 = -71? But note the representation: for right-moving, the head is the front (which is the larger x-coordinate) and tail is the rear. However, in the initial state, the head is -48 and tail is -71, so the span is from -71 to -48? But that would be [tail, head] = [-71, -48]. Then at turn T, the car moves right, so both increase.\n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and then becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So the initial span is [τ, h] meaning from τ to h. In this case, τ = -71 and h = -48, so [-71, -48] is the initial span.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5, we have three cars: \n  (48, 37, right, 6) -> [37,48]\n  (12, 1, right, 6) -> [1,12]\n  (-24, -35, right, 6) -> [-35,-24]\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway y at turn T if there is any car on that freeway at turn T such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nThe player starts at (0,0) at turn 54. We want to move to (0,9). The moves are U (up: y increases by 1), D (down: y decreases by 1), S (stay: y same). The y must stay in [0,9].\n\nWe are to find a sequence of actions from turn 54 to turn 54+H-1 such that at the last turn (turn 54+H-1) the player is at y=9.\n\nWe need to avoid collisions: for every turn T from 54 to 54+H-1, if the player is at y_T (which is in {0,1,...,9}) and y_T is between 1 and 8 (freeways), then we must check that for all cars on freeway y_T at turn T, the span does not contain 0.\n\nNote: When the player is at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars (freeways are only 1-8), so no collision can occur.\n\nTherefore, we can break the problem: we need to traverse from y=0 to y=9, passing through the freeways 1 to 8. We can plan a path that avoids the times when a car on a freeway we are on covers the x=0.\n\nWe are going to simulate the car positions at future turns.\n\nWe note that the cars move continuously to the right. We are only concerned with when the car's span covers x=0.\n\nFor a given car on a freeway, we can compute the interval of turns when the car covers x=0.\n\nFor a right-moving car with initial (h0, τ0, s) at T0=54, the car covers x=0 when:\n  τ0 + s*(T-54) <= 0 <= h0 + s*(T-54)\n\nSolve for T:\n  T_min = ceil( ( - h0 + 54*s ) / s )? Actually, we can solve:\n\n  τ0 + s*(T-54) <= 0  => T <= ( -τ0 ) / s + 54\n  and\n  0 <= h0 + s*(T-54) => T >= ( -h0 ) / s + 54\n\nBut note: because the car moves right, the entire car is at positions that increase. The car covers 0 when:\n  τ0 + s*(T-54) <= 0 <= h0 + s*(T-54)\n\nSo:\n  ( - h0 ) / s <= T-54 <= ( - τ0 ) / s\n\nBut note: since h0 > τ0 (because the head is the front) and the car is moving right, we have:\n  T-54 must be in the interval [ ( - h0 ) / s, ( - τ0 ) / s ]\n\nBut because T is integer, we can compute:\n\n  T_start = ceil( ( - h0 ) / s + 54 )\n  T_end = floor( ( - τ0 ) / s + 54 )\n\nHowever, note: the condition is inclusive. And we must be cautious with integer boundaries.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the exact real times and then take the integer turns.\n\nBut note: the span is continuous? Actually, the problem says the span is an interval of integers? The grid is discrete? The x-axis is integers? The problem doesn't specify, but the car positions are given as integers, and the collision is when 0 is in the span. So we can assume the span is [a, b] inclusive of integers.\n\nSo the car covers x=0 if there exists an integer x in the span that is 0? Actually, the condition is \"0 in the span\", meaning 0 is between the tail and head (inclusive).\n\nSo the condition is:\n  τ0 + s*(T-54) <= 0 <= h0 + s*(T-54)\n\nRearranged:\n  τ0 <= -s*(T-54) <= h0   -> but this is not linear in T.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n  Let dt = T - 54, then:\n      τ0 <= -s * dt <= h0\n\nBut note: s is positive, so we can divide by s (but direction matters?).\n\nActually, we have two inequalities:\n  1) s * (T-54) >= -h0   [from 0 <= h0 + s*(T-54) => s*(T-54) >= -h0]\n  2) s * (T-54) <= -τ0   [from τ0 + s*(T-54) <= 0 => s*(T-54) <= -τ0]\n\nSo:\n  -h0 / s <= T-54 <= -τ0 / s\n\nTherefore, the car is covering x=0 for T in the interval:\n  T_min = ceil(54 - h0/s)   [since T must be integer and the inequality is inclusive?]\n  T_max = floor(54 - τ0/s)\n\nBut note: because the inequalities are inclusive, we need T such that:\n  T-54 >= -h0/s   and T-54 <= -τ0/s\n\nSince T is integer, we can define:\n  T_min = ceil(54 + (-h0)/s) \n        = ceil(54 - h0/s)\n  T_max = floor(54 + (-τ0)/s)\n        = floor(54 - τ0/s)\n\nBut note: because the car moves continuously, the boundaries are inclusive. However, if at T_min the value (-h0)/s is an integer, then T_min = 54 - h0/s is the first turn. Similarly for T_max.\n\nBut we can also compute the exact integer turns by:\n\n  T_min = ceil(54 - h0/s)   [because T-54 must be at least ceil(-h0/s) to satisfy the first inequality?]\n\nActually, let me test with a simple example.\n\nExample: car at freeway 1: h0=-48, τ0=-71, s=24.\n\nThen:\n  T-54 >= -(-48)/24 = 48/24 = 2 -> T>=56\n  T-54 <= -(-71)/24 = 71/24 ≈ 2.958 -> T<=56 (because 54+2.958=56.958, so T<=56)\n\nSo T in [56,56]. Only turn 56.\n\nCompute by formula:\n  T_min = ceil(54 - (-48)/24) = ceil(54+2) = ceil(56)=56\n  T_max = floor(54 - (-71)/24) = floor(54+71/24) = floor(54+2.958) = floor(56.958)=56\n\nSo indeed, only turn 56.\n\nAnother car: freeway 2: (-48,-83,right,36)\n  T-54 >= -(-48)/36 = 48/36 ≈ 1.333 -> T>=55.333 -> T>=56 (ceiling to 56)\n  T-54 <= -(-83)/36 = 83/36 ≈ 2.305 -> T<=56.305 -> T<=56\n\nSo T_min = ceil(54 - (-48)/36) = ceil(54+48/36)=ceil(54+1.333)=ceil(55.333)=56\n  T_max = floor(54 - (-83)/36)=floor(54+83/36)=floor(54+2.305)=floor(56.305)=56\n\nSo again only turn 56.\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2? -> also turn 56.\n\nFreeway 4: same as 2? -> also turn 56.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6)\n  T-54 >= -48/6 = -8 -> T>=54-8=46 -> no lower bound constraint? Actually, T>=46, but we are at T>=54, so from 54 onward? \n  But also T-54 <= -37/6 ≈ -6.166 -> T<=54-6.166≈47.833 -> T<=47? \n\nWait, we have:\n  T-54 >= -48/6 = -8   -> T>=46\n  T-54 <= -37/6 ≈ -6.166 -> T<=47.833 -> T<=47\n\nSo T in [46,47]. But we are starting at T=54, so this car does not cover 0 at any T>=54? Because 47<54. So safe.\n\nSecond car on freeway 5: (12,1,right,6)\n  T-54 >= -12/6 = -2 -> T>=52\n  T-54 <= -1/6 ≈ -0.166 -> T<=53.833 -> T<=53\n\nSo T in [52,53]. Again, 53<54, so safe.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,6)\n  T-54 >= -(-24)/6=24/6=4 -> T>=58\n  T-54 <= -(-35)/6=35/6≈5.833 -> T<=59.833 -> T<=59\n\nSo T in [58,59]. So we must avoid freeway 5 at turns 58 and 59.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same cars as freeway 5? So same: avoid at 58 and 59.\n\nFreeway 7: (48,37,right,12)\n  T-54 >= -48/12 = -4 -> T>=50\n  T-54 <= -37/12≈-3.083 -> T<=50.916 -> T<=50\n\nSo T in [50,50]? But 50<54, so safe.\n\nFreeway 8: (48,37,right,4)\n  T-54 >= -48/4 = -12 -> T>=42\n  T-54 <= -37/4 = -9.25 -> T<=44.75 -> T<=44\n\nSo safe.\n\nTherefore, the dangerous periods are:\n\n  Freeway 1: turn 56\n  Freeway 2: turn 56\n  Freeway 3: turn 56\n  Freeway 4: turn 56\n  Freeway 5: turns 58,59\n  Freeway 6: turns 58,59\n\nWe can summarize the dangerous turns for each freeway:\n\n  y=1: {56}\n  y=2: {56}\n  y=3: {56}\n  y=4: {56}\n  y=5: {58,59}\n  y=6: {58,59}\n  y=7: safe (no collision at T>=54)\n  y=8: safe\n\nAdditionally, we note that the player starts at y=0 at turn 54. We must reach y=9. We can only change y by at most 1 per turn.\n\nWe need to avoid being on freeway y at the dangerous turns.\n\nSince the dangerous turns are only at 56 for freeways 1-4 and 58-59 for freeways 5-6, and freeways 7 and 8 are safe, we can plan accordingly.\n\nWe have to go from y=0 (turn54) to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns is at least 9 moves (if we go up every turn: 9 steps). But we might have to wait to avoid collisions.\n\nLet me denote the state at turn t (starting at t0=54) as (t, y). We start at (54,0). We need to get to (t,9) for some t.\n\nWe can model the state as (time, y) and try to do a BFS.\n\nThe moves: at time t, at position y, we can choose:\n  a_t = U: then y_{t+1} = y+1\n  a_t = D: then y_{t+1} = y-1\n  a_t = S: then y_{t+1} = y\n\nBut note: we are at time t at position y. Then we choose an action and then at time t+1 we are at the new y.\n\nWe must avoid collisions at every time step: when we are at (t, y), if y is between 1 and 8, then we check if t is a dangerous turn for freeway y? And if it is, then we cannot be there.\n\nBut note: at time t, we are at y, so if y is in [1,8] and t is in the dangerous set for y, then collision.\n\nWe are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H (number of turns) such that we start at turn54 and after H-1 actions (so at turn54+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nWe can simulate from turn54 to as many as needed.\n\nLet me try to go as fast as possible: 9 consecutive Ups. Then we would be:\n\n  Turn54: start at y0=0 -> action U -> at turn55: y=1\n  Turn55: at y=1 -> action U -> turn56: y=2\n  Turn56: at y=2 -> action U -> turn57: y=3\n  Turn57: at y=3 -> action U -> turn58: y=4\n  Turn58: at y=4 -> action U -> turn59: y=5\n  Turn59: at y=5 -> action U -> turn60: y=6\n  Turn60: at y=6 -> action U -> turn61: y=7\n  Turn61: at y=7 -> action U -> turn62: y=8\n  Turn62: at y=8 -> action U -> turn63: y=9 -> done in 9 moves? H=9? But we have 9 actions: from turn54 to turn62.\n\nBut check collisions:\n\n  At turn54: y=0 -> safe.\n  At turn55: y=1 -> safe? Check: freeway1 dangerous at turn56 only -> so safe at 55.\n  At turn56: y=2 -> freeway2 is dangerous at turn56 -> collision! So we cannot be at y=2 at turn56.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being at y=2 at turn56.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid being at y=1,2,3,4 at turn56? Actually, we see that freeways 1,2,3,4 are all dangerous at turn56. So we must not be on any of these freeways at turn56.\n\nSo at turn56, we must be at y=0 or y>=5? But we are going up, so at turn56 we are at y=2. So we must change.\n\nWe can try to wait at y=0 or y=1 until after turn56? Or we can go up to y=5 by turn56? But that would require 5 moves in 2 turns (from turn54 to turn56) which is impossible (max 2 moves: from 0 to 1 at turn55, then to 2 at turn56 -> but then we are stuck at 2 at turn56).\n\nAlternative: we can avoid being on freeways 1-4 at turn56 by either:\n\n  Option 1: Stay at y=0 for a few turns until after turn56? Then we start moving.\n\n  Option 2: Move up to y=5 by turn56? That requires 5 moves in 2 steps: 54->55: from 0 to 4? -> impossible.\n\nSo we must wait at y=0 or y=1 until turn56 is over? But note: we can be at y=0 at turn56 (safe) or y=1 at turn56? But freeway1 is dangerous at turn56 -> so we cannot be at y=1 at turn56.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot be at y=2,3,4 at turn56.\n\nSo at turn56, we must be at y=0 or y>=5? But how to get to y>=5 by turn56? \n\n  At turn54: start at y=0.\n  At turn55: we can go to y=1 (if U) or stay at 0 (S) or down to 0 (D) but D would stay at 0? Actually, from 0, D: y_{55}= max(0,0-1)=0.\n  At turn56: from y=1 at turn55, we can go to y=0,1,2. From y=0 at turn55, we can go to 0 or 1.\n\nSo we cannot get above y=2 by turn56.\n\nTherefore, the only safe positions at turn56 are y=0 and y>=5? But we can only be at y=0,1,2 at turn56.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 at turn56.\n\nThen after turn56, we can start moving.\n\nBut we also have to avoid freeways 5 and 6 at turns58 and59.\n\nPlan:\n\n  Turn54: at y=0 -> we can stay (S) so that at turn55: y=0.\n  Turn55: at y=0 -> we can stay (S) so that at turn56: y=0 (safe).\n  Then at turn56: we start moving.\n\nBut then we are behind. We need to go from y=0 at turn56 to y=9.\n\nWe have to avoid freeways 5 and 6 at turns58 and59.\n\nWe can try to move quickly:\n\n  Turn56: at y=0 -> action U -> turn57: y=1\n  Turn57: U -> turn58: y=2\n  But at turn58: we are at y=2 -> safe? freeway2 is not dangerous at turn58? But freeway5 is dangerous at turn58? But we are at y=2, not 5. So safe.\n\n  Then at turn58: we are at y=2 -> action U -> turn59: y=3 -> safe? because freeway3 is not dangerous at turn59? and freeway5 is dangerous but we are at y=3, not 5.\n\n  Then at turn59: we are at y=3 -> action U -> turn60: y=4\n  Then turn60: U -> turn61: y=5 -> but freeway5 at turn61: safe? because freeway5 dangerous only at 58,59 -> so safe at 61.\n  Then we can continue: U at 61: y=6 -> but at turn61: freeway6 is dangerous only at 58,59 -> safe.\n  Then U at 62: y=7 -> safe\n  U at 63: y=8 -> safe\n  U at 64: y=9 -> done.\n\nSo H = 64 - 54 + 1? Wait, we start at turn54 and we do actions at turn54,55,...,63? That's 10 actions? Then the last turn is turn54+10-1 = 63? Then at turn63 we are at y=9? Actually:\n\n  Turn54: action S -> at turn55: y=0\n  Turn55: action S -> at turn56: y=0\n  Turn56: action U -> at turn57: y=1\n  Turn57: action U -> at turn58: y=2\n  Turn58: action U -> at turn59: y=3\n  Turn59: action U -> at turn60: y=4\n  Turn60: action U -> at turn61: y=5\n  Turn61: action U -> at turn62: y=6\n  Turn62: action U -> at turn63: y=7\n  Turn63: action U -> at turn64: y=8 -> wait, we need to get to 9.\n\nWe did 10 moves? Then at turn64: we are at y=8. We need one more: U at turn64: then at turn65: y=9.\n\nSo 11 actions? Then H=11.\n\nBut we started at turn54 and we end at turn54+H-1 = 54+11-1 = 64? Then at turn64 we are at y=9? Actually, no: we have to do 11 actions and the last action is at turn64, which leads to y=9 at turn65.\n\nBut we are required to be at (0,9) at the last turn (turn54+H-1). So if we do H actions, then the last state is at turn54+H.\n\nWait, the problem says: we are to determine a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1, meaning:\n  a_{t1} = a54\n  a_{t1+1} = a55\n  ...\n  a_{t1+H-1} = a_{54+H-1}\n\nThen the player's position after H actions is at turn54+H. And we require that at turn54+H-1? Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nBut note: after the last action (the H-th action, which is at t1+H-1), we are at the next turn: turn t1+H? So the position at turn t1+H is determined by the last action. \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\" ??? \n\nLet me reread: \n  \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nBut note: the state at turn t is determined by the actions taken at turns t-1, t-2, ... \n\nSpecifically:\n  At turn t1, we are at (0, y_{t1}) = (0,0) [given].\n  Then we take an action a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}.\n  Then we take a_{t1+1} -> at turn t1+2, we are at y_{t1+2}.\n  ...\n  After H actions (from t1 to t1+H-1), we have the state at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLooking at the problem: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" \n  and then \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nBut note: the action a_{t1} is taken at turn t1, and then we are at turn t1+1 at y_{t1+1}. The last action is a_{t1+H-1} taken at turn t1+H-1, which leads to turn t1+H. But the problem says we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? That would be before the last action.\n\nActually, the problem states: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". So the state at turn t1+H-1 must be (0,9).\n\nTherefore, we are at (0,9) at the same turn as the last action is taken? But note: the action taken at turn t1+H-1 will change the state to turn t1+H. But we are concerned with the state at the beginning of the turn? Or after the action?\n\nThe problem says: the player update is: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where the action a_t is taken at turn t and affects the next turn.\n\nTherefore, at the start of turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose an action a_t, which will determine y_{t+1}. So the state at turn t is (t, y_t). And we are required to have at turn t1+H-1: y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo the last action we take is at turn t1+H-1? And that action will lead to the next state, but we don't care as long as at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nBut note: we are at turn t1+H-1 at position 9. Then we don't need to take an action that turn? But the sequence includes actions from t1 to t1+H-1. The last action is taken at turn t1+H-1. But if we are already at 9 at turn t1+H-1, then we can choose action S (or U? but if we choose U we go to 10 which is invalid). Actually, we can only choose S to stay at 9? But we are already at 9 at the beginning of the turn. Then the action S will keep us at 9 for the next turn? But we don't care about the next turn.\n\nBut the requirement is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So we must have y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nTherefore, we must arrive at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn the sequence of actions, we take H actions: the first at turn t1, the last at turn t1+H-1. The last action (at turn t1+H-1) is taken when we are at y_{t1+H-1} (which is 9) and then we set y_{t1+H} = 9 + Δy, but we don't care as long as at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nBut note: we start at turn t1 at y_{t1}=0. Then we take action a_{t1} to go to y_{t1+1}. Then ... until we take action a_{t1+H-2} to go to y_{t1+H-1}. Then at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}. Then we take the last action a_{t1+H-1} (which must be S, because if we move we leave 9? but we can only move to 8 or 10? 10 is invalid, so we must choose S to stay at 9? Actually, we are at 9, so we can choose S: then y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem doesn't require anything about the state after turn t1+H-1. So we just need to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo the minimal H is the number of actions to get from y=0 at turn54 to y=9 at some turn T, and then H = T - 54? But note: we start at turn54, and we take actions at turn54,55,...,T-1 to get to turn T. Then the number of actions is T - 54. And we require that at turn T we are at y=9? But the problem says: at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nSet T = t1+H-1. Then H = T - t1 + 1? \n\nWe start at turn t1 (54). We take actions at turn t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the state after H actions is at turn t1+H. But we require the state at turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9). \n\nTherefore, we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, and we have taken H-1 actions? \n\nActually, the actions: \n  action0 at turn54: leads to turn55\n  action1 at turn55: leads to turn56\n  ...\n  action_{H-1} at turn54+H-1: leads to turn54+H.\n\nBut the state at turn54+H-1 is the state we have after action_{H-2}? \n\nLet me clarify:\n\n  At turn54: we are at y54=0 (given). \n  We take action a54 -> then at turn55: y55 = y54 + Δy54.\n  Then at turn55: we take a55 -> at turn56: y56 = y55 + Δy55.\n  ...\n  At turn54+H-2: we take a_{54+H-2} -> at turn54+H-1: y_{54+H-1} = y_{54+H-2} + Δy_{54+H-2}.\n  Then at turn54+H-1: we are at y_{54+H-1}. We require y_{54+H-1}=9. Then we take the last action a_{54+H-1} (which can be anything? but we must output it, and it doesn't affect the state we care about).\n\nTherefore, we need to be at y=9 at turn54+H-1, and we have taken H actions: from a54 to a_{54+H-1}. The last action is taken at the turn where we are already at 9.\n\nSo in the previous plan:\n\n  We were at y=0 at turn56 (which is turn54+2, so H so far? we have taken two actions: a54=S, a55=S).\n\n  Then we did:\n      turn56: U -> turn57: y=1\n      turn57: U -> turn58: y=2\n      turn58: U -> turn59: y=3\n      turn59: U -> turn60: y=4\n      turn60: U -> turn61: y=5\n      turn61: U -> turn62: y=6\n      turn62: U -> turn63: y=7\n      turn63: U -> turn64: y=8\n      turn64: U -> turn65: y=9\n\n  So at turn65: y=9. That is turn54+11. So we are at turn65 = 54+11. Then we require that at turn54+H-1 we are at 9. \n      So 54+H-1 = 65 -> H-1 = 11 -> H=12.\n\n  But wait, we took 11 actions: from turn54 to turn64. Then at turn65 we are at y=9. But we require to be at y=9 at turn54+H-1. So if we set H=12, then turn54+12-1=65, which matches.\n\n  Therefore, we need H=12.\n\nBut the last action (at turn64) is U, which moves us from y=8 to y=9 at turn65. Then at turn64 we are at y=8? Then we are not at y=9 at turn64. We are at y=9 at turn65.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn54+H-1, we must have:\n\n  turn54+H-1 = 65 -> H-1 = 11 -> H=12.\n\nAnd the actions are from turn54 to turn65? Actually, the actions are from t1 to t1+H-1: turn54 to turn54+11 (which is 65? no: 54+11=65? but 54 to 54+11-1=64). \n\nThe actions: \n  a54, a55, a56, a57, a58, a59, a60, a61, a62, a63, a64 -> 11 actions? Then H=11? \n\nBut then we require at turn54+H-1 = 54+11-1 = 64 to be at 9. But we are at 9 at turn65, not turn64.\n\nSo we must be at 9 at turn64. How?\n\nWe need to arrive at 9 one turn earlier.\n\nAlternative plan: we start moving earlier? But we cannot avoid the collision at turn56 without waiting.\n\nWe can try to get to y=5 by turn57? Then avoid freeway5 at 58 and59 by being above 6? \n\nBut note: we have to avoid freeway5 at turns58 and59: so we must not be at y=5 at turn58 or59, and not at y=6 at turn58 or59.\n\nSo we can be at y=5 at turn57? Then we must leave freeway5 by turn58? But from y=5 at turn57, we can go to y=6 at turn58? Then we are at freeway6 at turn58 -> which is dangerous at turn58? So we must avoid that.\n\nAlternatively, we can wait at y=4 until turn60? Then we can move up.\n\nBut let me try:\n\n  We wait at y=0 until turn56: \n      turn54: S -> y55=0\n      turn55: S -> y56=0\n  Then we move up quickly to y=4 by turn60? \n      turn56: U -> y57=1\n      turn57: U -> y58=2\n      turn58: U -> y59=3\n      turn59: U -> y60=4\n      Then we are at y=4 at turn60. Then we can move up: \n      turn60: U -> y61=5 -> but freeway5 is safe at turn61? (dangerous at 58,59 -> safe at 61) -> safe.\n      turn61: U -> y62=6 -> safe (freeway6 dangerous only at 58,59) -> safe.\n      turn62: U -> y63=7\n      turn63: U -> y64=8\n      turn64: U -> y65=9\n\n  Then we are at y=9 at turn65. We need H=12: because we require at turn54+H-1=65 -> H=12.\n\n  But then the last action is at turn64 (the 11th action? from 54 to 64: 11 actions) and we are at y=9 at turn65. But we require to be at y=9 at turn54+H-1=65, so that matches. And we took 11 actions? Actually, the actions are for t=0 to H-1, so 12 actions? \n\n  Let me count: \n      Action0: at turn54 -> S\n      Action1: at turn55 -> S\n      Action2: at turn56 -> U\n      Action3: at turn57 -> U\n      Action4: at turn58 -> U\n      Action5: at turn59 -> U\n      Action6: at turn60 -> U\n      Action7: at turn61 -> U\n      Action8: at turn62 -> U\n      Action9: at turn63 -> U\n      Action10: at turn64 -> U\n\n  So 11 actions. Then H=11? Then the turn at which we are at 9 is turn65 = 54+11? and we require to be at 9 at turn54+H-1 = 54+11-1 = 63? But we are at 9 at turn65, which is 54+11? \n\n  This is confusing.\n\n  We must be at (0,9) at turn54+H-1. With H=11, that turn is 54+10 = 64. But in this plan, at turn64 we are at y=8, not 9.\n\n  So we need to be at 9 at turn64. Then we must arrive one turn earlier.\n\nHow? We need to be at y=9 at turn64.\n\nFrom the above, we were at y=4 at turn60. Then we did:\n  turn60: U -> turn61:5\n  turn61: U -> turn62:6\n  turn62: U -> turn63:7\n  turn63: U -> turn64:8 -> not 9.\n\nWe need to be at 9 at turn64. So we must be at 8 at turn63? Then we can do U at turn63 to get to 9 at turn64.\n\nSo we must be at y=8 at turn63. How?\n\n  We were at y=0 at turn56. We have 7 moves from turn56 to turn63: 7 moves can get us to y=7? \n\n  We need 8 moves to get from 0 to 8? But we have 7 actions: from turn56 to turn62? Then at turn63 we are at y=7? Then we do U at turn63: turn64: y=8.\n\n  We need 9 at turn64? We are at 8 at turn64. So we need one more move? \n\n  Alternatively, we can go faster? But we can only move one per turn.\n\n  We must start moving earlier.\n\n  Instead of waiting two turns, we wait only one? But then we are at y=1 at turn56? and freeway1 is dangerous at turn56 -> collision.\n\n  Or we can go to y=0 at turn56 by:\n      turn54: D? but we are at 0, D would stay at 0? \n      turn55: D -> still 0? \n      so same as staying.\n\n  What if we do:\n      turn54: S -> y55=0\n      turn55: U -> y56=1 -> but at turn56, we are at y=1 -> freeway1 is dangerous -> collision.\n\n  So we must be at y=0 at turn56.\n\n  Then we have 7 moves from turn56 to turn63? We can get to y=7 at turn63? Then at turn63: U -> turn64:8 -> not 9.\n\n  Then at turn64: U -> turn65:9. So we are at 9 at turn65. Then we require H such that 54+H-1 = 65 -> H=12.\n\n  And the actions: 12 actions? from turn54 to turn65? Actually, the last action is at turn65? But we are already at 9 at turn65, so we don't need to move? \n\n  But the problem requires a sequence of H actions that we take from turn54 to turn54+H-1. Then at the turn54+H-1 we are at 9. \n\n  So if we want to be at 9 at turn65, then 54+H-1=65 -> H=12. Then we take actions at turn54 to turn65-1=64? So 12 actions? \n\n  But then at turn65 we are at 9? And we took the last action at turn64. But the state at turn65 is after the action at turn64. But we require the state at turn54+H-1 = turn65 to be 9. So that matches.\n\n  Therefore, the minimal H is 12.\n\nBut can we do better? \n\n  We must avoid freeway1-4 at turn56: so we must be at y=0 at turn56.\n\n  Then we have to go from 0 to 9 in the next turns. The fastest is 9 moves: 9 turns. So the earliest we can be at 9 is turn56+9 = turn65.\n\n  So minimal H is 12.\n\nNow, we also have to avoid freeway5 and6 at turns58 and59.\n\nIn the plan I had:\n\n  turn56: at y=0 -> U to y=1 at turn57\n  turn57: U to y=2 at turn58\n  turn58: U to y=3 at turn59\n  turn59: U to y=4 at turn60\n  turn60: U to y=5 at turn61 -> safe (freeway5 safe at 61)\n  turn61: U to y=6 at turn62 -> safe (freeway6 safe at 62)\n  turn62: U to y=7 at turn63\n  turn63: U to y=8 at turn64\n  turn64: U to y=9 at turn65\n\nBut we are at y=9 at turn65, which is 54+11? turn65=54+11. Then 54+H-1=65 -> H=12.\n\nBut in the above, we did 10 actions after turn55? \n\nLet me list the turns and actions:\n\n  Turn54: we start at y=0. Action: S -> then at turn55: y=0.\n  Turn55: action: S -> turn56: y=0.\n  Turn56: action: U -> turn57: y=1.\n  Turn57: action: U -> turn58: y=2.\n  Turn58: action: U -> turn59: y=3.\n  Turn59: action: U -> turn60: y=4.\n  Turn60: action: U -> turn61: y=5.\n  Turn61: action: U -> turn62: y=6.\n  Turn62: action: U -> turn63: y=7.\n  Turn63: action: U -> turn64: y=8.\n  Turn64: action: U -> turn65: y=9.\n\nWe took actions at turn54,55,...,64: that's 11 actions. So H=11? But then we require to be at 9 at turn54+H-1=54+10=64. But we are at 9 at turn65, not at turn64.\n\nWe need to be at 9 at turn64. So we must arrive one turn earlier. How?\n\nWe must be at y=8 at turn63? Then we can do U at turn63 to get to 9 at turn64.\n\nFrom y=0 at turn56, we have 7 moves (from turn56 to turn62) to get to y=8? That's 8 moves? Impossible, because 7 moves only get to y=7.\n\nAlternatively, we can skip some freeways faster? But we can only move one per turn.\n\nOr we can go down? But that would be inefficient.\n\nAnother idea: can we be at y=5 at turn60? Then we avoid freeway5 at turn58,59 by being elsewhere. But we are at y=2 at turn58 and y=3 at turn59, which are safe.\n\nBut then we still take 5 moves from y=0 at turn56 to y=5 at turn61? \n\n  turn56: U ->57:1\n  turn57: U ->58:2\n  turn58: U ->59:3\n  turn59: U ->60:4\n  turn60: U ->61:5\n\nThen we need 4 more to get to 9: turn61:U->62:6, turn62:U->63:7, turn63:U->64:8, turn64:U->65:9.\n\nStill at turn65.\n\nTo be at 9 at turn64, we must be at 8 at turn63. From turn56 to turn63 we have 7 moves: we can go up 7 times to y=7 at turn63. Then we need to be at 9 at turn64? We can only move one step. So we would be at 8 at turn64.\n\nUnless we move faster? We can't.\n\nWhat if we start moving earlier? But we cannot: because at turn56 we must be at 0.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 12.\n\nBut note: at turn65 we are at 9, so we set H=12, then turn54+H-1=54+11=65? No: 54+12-1=65. So H=12.\n\nAnd we take 12 actions: from turn54 to turn65? But the actions are taken at turns 54,55,...,65? That would be 12 actions? But then the last action is at turn65, which would lead to turn66. We don't want that.\n\nThe actions are for t=0 to H-1: so we take actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nWe require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nIn our plan, we are at 9 at turn65. So we set t1+H-1=65 -> 54+H-1=65 -> H=12.\n\nThen we take actions at turns: 54,55,...,54+11=65? But that would be 12 actions? And then at turn65 we are at 9? But the action at turn65 is taken when we are at 9? Then we set y66 = 9 + Δy65. But we don't care about y66.\n\nWe can choose the last action as S.\n\nBut in the plan above, we did U at turn64 to get to 9 at turn65. Then at turn65, we are at 9. Then we take an action at turn65: we can choose S.\n\nSo the last action is S at turn65.\n\nThen the sequence:\n\n  Turn54: S\n  Turn55: S\n  Turn56: U\n  Turn57: U\n  Turn58: U\n  Turn59: U\n  Turn60: U\n  Turn61: U\n  Turn62: U\n  Turn63: U\n  Turn64: U   -> at turn65: we are at 9.\n  Turn65: S   -> to stay at 9? but we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn65? And then we output action S.\n\nBut the requirement is to be at 9 at turn54+H-1=65. So at the beginning of turn65, we are at 9. Then we take an action S, which is valid.\n\nSo we need 12 actions.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 11? \n\n  If we can be at 9 at turn64 (which is 54+10), then H=11: because 54+11-1=64.\n\n  How to be at 9 at turn64? \n\n      We start at turn54: y=0.\n      We need to be at y=9 at turn64.\n\n      We must avoid freeways 1-4 at turn56: so at turn56 we must be at y=0.\n\n      Then from turn56 to turn64: 8 turns. We need to go from 0 to 9: 9 moves. But we only have 8 moves? Impossible.\n\n  Therefore, minimal H is 12.\n\nNow, we have to make sure that in the entire path we avoid collisions.\n\nWe already know:\n\n  At turn56: y=0 -> safe.\n  At turn58: y=2 -> safe (freeway2 dangerous only at 56, and freeway5 dangerous at 58 but we are at y=2, not 5)\n  At turn59: y=3 -> safe (freeway3 dangerous at 56, freeway5 at 59: we are at y=3, not 5)\n  At turn61: y=5 -> freeway5: dangerous only at 58,59 -> safe at 61.\n  At turn62: y=6 -> freeway6: dangerous only at 58,59 -> safe at 62.\n\n  Other freeways are safe.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of actions for H=12:\n\n  Turn54: S\n  Turn55: S\n  Turn56: U\n  Turn57: U\n  Turn58: U\n  Turn59: U\n  Turn60: U\n  Turn61: U\n  Turn62: U\n  Turn63: U\n  Turn64: U\n  Turn65: S   [but note: at turn65, we are at 9, and we output S to stay]\n\nBut the last action is at turn65, and we require the sequence to be for t=0 to H-1=11, so 12 actions.\n\nBut wait, at turn65 we are at 9, and we take an action S. But the state at turn65 is already 9, and we are not required to be at 9 at turn66. The requirement is only for turn65.\n\nWe could avoid the last action? But the problem requires a sequence of H actions. So we must provide 12 actions.\n\nAlternatively, we can not move after we are at 9? But then we would be at 9 at turn64? which we cannot.\n\nSo we must do 12 actions.\n\nBut note: the last action at turn65 is taken when we are at 9, and we do S, which keeps us at 9 for turn66. But we don't care about turn66.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\n  Turn54: S\n  Turn55: S\n  Turn56: U\n  Turn57: U\n  Turn58: U\n  Turn59: U\n  Turn60: U\n  Turn61: U\n  Turn62: U\n  Turn63: U\n  Turn64: U   -> at turn65: y=9 (because we were at 8 at turn64, then U moves to 9 at turn65)\n  Turn65: S   -> to stay at 9 for turn66.\n\nBut at turn65, we are at y=9 at the beginning? Then we take action S. So the state at turn65 is 9, and we are outputting an action for turn65.\n\nBut the problem says: we are to reach (0,9) at turn54+H-1 = turn65. So we are at 9 at turn65, and we are taking an action at turn65. That is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, we output 12 actions.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? What if we go down to y=0 at some point to avoid something? It won't help because we are already at 0.\n\nOr wait, we can try to go to y=9 faster by not using U every time? But we must go up 9 times. The minimal number of moves is 9. And we have to wait at least 2 turns (at turn54 and 55) to avoid turn56 at freeways. So total turns: 2 (wait) + 9 (up) = 11 moves? But then the state at turn54+11-1= turn64 should be 9? but we are at 9 at turn65.\n\nThe time from turn54 to turn65 is 11 turns of waiting/moving? But we took 12 actions.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  Turn54: S   -> turn55:0\n  Turn55: S   -> turn56:0\n  Turn56: U   -> turn57:1\n  Turn57: U   -> turn58:2\n  Turn58: U   -> turn59:3\n  Turn59: U   -> turn60:4\n  Turn60: U   -> turn61:5\n  Turn61: U   -> turn62:6\n  Turn62: U   -> turn63:7\n  Turn63: U   -> turn64:8\n  Turn64: U   -> turn65:9\n\nThen we are at 9 at turn65. We have taken 11 actions. Then H=11, and we require at turn54+H-1 = 54+10 = turn64 to be at 9? But at turn64 we are at 8, not 9.\n\nSo we need one more action: at turn65 we do S to remain at 9? But then we are at 9 at turn65, and we have taken 12 actions.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 12.\n\nFinal sequence:\n\n  Turn54: S\n  Turn55: S\n  Turn56: U\n  Turn57: U\n  Turn58: U\n  Turn59: U\n  Turn60: U\n  Turn61: U\n  Turn62: U\n  Turn63: U\n  Turn64: U\n  Turn65: S\n\nBut note: at turn64, we are at y=8 (at the beginning of turn64). Then we do U, so at turn65: y=9.\nThen at turn65, we are at y=9. Then we do S, which sets y66=9.\n\nBut we are only concerned with up to turn65.\n\nWe can avoid the last S? But the problem requires a sequence of H=12 actions. So we must output 12.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  At turn65, we are at 9, and we don't need to move, but we have to output an action. We choose S.\n\nSo the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 54: S\nTurn 55: S\nTurn 56: U\nTurn 57: U\nTurn 58: U\nTurn 59: U\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: U\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: U\nTurn 64: U\nTurn 65: S\n}\n\nBut let me check the collision at turn65: at turn65, we are at y=9? Then no car check. So safe.\n\nAnd at turn64: we are at y=8? freeway8 is safe (only dangerous at turns<=44). So safe.\n\nTherefore, this is a valid plan.\n\nBut note: the problem says the player position is given at (0,0) at turn54. Then we take action at turn54, which is S, so we stay at 0 for turn55. Then at turn55, we are at 0, then S again to stay at 0 for turn56. Then at turn56, we are at 0, then we do U to go to 1 at turn57. \n\nAnd so on.\n\nWe must ensure that at every turn from 54 to 65, we are safe.\n\nLet me list the state at each turn:\n\n  Turn54: y=0 (given) -> safe (no freeway)\n  Turn55: y=0 (after S at turn54) -> safe\n  Turn56: y=0 (after S at turn55) -> safe\n  Turn57: y=1 (after U at turn56) -> freeway1: dangerous only at 56? 57 is safe -> safe\n  Turn58: y=2 (after U at turn57) -> freeway2: dangerous only at 56 -> safe\n  Turn59: y=3 (after U at turn58) -> freeway3: dangerous only at 56 -> safe\n  Turn60: y=4 (after U at turn59) -> freeway4: dangerous only at 56 -> safe\n  Turn61: y=5 (after U at turn60) -> freeway5: dangerous at 58,59 -> safe at 61\n  Turn62: y=6 (after U at turn61) -> freeway6: dangerous at 58,59 -> safe at 62\n  Turn63: y=7 (after U at turn62) -> freeway7: safe at all turns>=54 -> safe\n  Turn64: y=8 (after U at turn63) -> freeway8: safe -> safe\n  Turn65: y=9 (after U at turn64) -> safe (no freeway at 9)\n\nAnd then we do S at turn65, which doesn't affect the state at turn65 (we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn65).\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 12, and the sequence is as above.\n\nBut note: the problem asks for the minimal number of turns H. We have H=12.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 11? We concluded no. So this is minimal.\n\nWe can try to see if we can avoid waiting two turns? \n\n  We must be at y=0 at turn56. How many turns do we have from turn54 to turn56? Two turns: we can only be at 0,0,0? So we must do two S (or D, but D at 0 stays at 0). \n\n  So we must use two turns to stay at 0.\n\n  Then 9 moves to go up: total 11 moves? But then we would be at 9 at turn65, which is 11 moves after turn54? But then we require to be at 9 at turn64? which is not possible.\n\n  Therefore, H=12 is minimal.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 54, while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), is 12. The sequence of actions is designed to avoid dangerous turns:\n\n- Freeways 1 to 4 are dangerous at turn 56, so the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) (safe) at turn 56. This is achieved by staying at \\(y = 0\\) for turns 54 and 55 using actions \\(S\\).\n- From turn 56 onwards, the player moves up (\\(U\\)) every turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible.\n- Freeways 5 and 6 are dangerous at turns 58 and 59. At turn 58, the player is at \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2, safe as danger is only at turn 56). At turn 59, the player is at \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3, safe as danger is only at turn 56). Thus, collisions are avoided.\n- At turn 64, the player moves from \\(y = 8\\) to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 65. The action at turn 65 is \\(S\\) to stay at \\(y = 9\\), satisfying the requirement to be at \\((0, 9)\\) at turn \\(54 + H - 1 = 65\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 54: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 55: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 56: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 57: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 58: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 59: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 60: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 61: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 62: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 63: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 64: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 65: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 56, and I start at y=0.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For each freeway, there are cars with positions that change over time based on their speed and direction.\n\nThe collision condition is that at turn T, if I'm on a freeway y, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that turn, I collide. But note that when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nThe player position updates at the same time as the cars, I think. Let me read carefully.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, based on action at t.\n\nCar update: for a car, at turn T > t_1, span is [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)] for left-moving? No, let's see.\n\nIt says left-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nBut in the table, for freeway 1, it's (-48, -71, right, 24). Head and tail, with direction.\n\nFor right-moving, it says [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nThat seems inconsistent. Let me read.\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nBut in the car state, for example, freeway 1 has (-48, -71, right, 24). So for right-moving cars, it should be different.\n\nIt says: \"Right-moving: [Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the car listing, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). So for a right-moving car, head is the front, so when moving right, head is larger.\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24). So head is -48, tail is -71. Since it's right-moving, at time t_1, the car is from τ to h, but τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn the span definition for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h] meaning from tail to head.\n\nThen Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the car state, all cars seem to be right-moving except possibly some, but let's see the directions.\n\nIn the table:\n\nFreeway 1: right\n\n2: right\n\n3: right\n\n4: right\n\n5: three cars, all right\n\n6: three cars, all right\n\n7: right\n\n8: right\n\nAll cars are right-moving. No left-moving cars mentioned.\n\nSo for all, since right-moving, Span(T) = [tail + s(T-t_1), head + s(T-t_1)]\n\nAt time t_1, for a car, we have head and tail at t_1.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: head h = -48, tail τ = -71, speed s=24, direction right.\n\nSo at time T, position is from τ + s(T-t_1) to h + s(T-t_1)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision happens if at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is within the span of that car at that turn, meaning the car covers position 0 at time T.\n\nSpecifically, for a car on freeway k, if y_T = k, and min(span) ≤ 0 ≤ max(span) at time T.\n\nSince the span is an interval, 0 is in [min, max].\n\nFor right-moving car, min is τ + s(T-t_1), max is h + s(T-t_1)\n\nAnd since it's moving right, min and max increase over time.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9. y=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, since no freeways there. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe zones, no cars.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so at some turn, y=9.\n\nActions: U (up), D (down), S (stay). But since I start at y=0, and need to go to y=9, I probably need to go up, but down might be used to avoid cars, but since I start at 0, and 0 is safe, going down to y=-1 is not possible, y_t in [0,9], so I can't go below 0 or above 9. So from 0, D is invalid or stays at 0? The action D from y=0 would try to go to -1, but y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so probably it stays at 0 or something? The update doesn't specify what happens if out of bounds.\n\nIt says y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], but it doesn't say how it's enforced. Probably, if action would take it out of bounds, it stays or something. But to be safe, I should avoid actions that would go out of bounds.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, U would go to 10, not allowed.\n\nBut in this case, since I start at y=0, and need to reach y=9, I should mostly go up.\n\nBut there are cars on y=1 to 8, so I need to time when I cross each freeway so that no car is at position 0 when I'm on that row.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, if I take action U, I go to y_{T+1} = y_T + 1, but at turn T, I am still on y_T, and the move happens for the next turn.\n\nLet me denote the turn.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position (0, y_t).\n\nI take action a_t, which determines Δy_t.\n\nThen y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with constraints.\n\nAt the same time, for cars, at turn t, the car positions are as per their update.\n\nCollision at turn T if y_T = k for some k=1 to 8, and for that freeway, there is a car with 0 in its span at time T.\n\nIf I am not on freeway, at y=0 or y=9, no collision.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, if I take action to change y, at that turn T, I am still on the current y, so I only check cars on current y at that time.\n\nFor example, if at turn T I am on y=3, and I take U, then at turn T, I am on y=3, so I check if cars on freeway 3 at time T cover 0.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am on y=4, so I check cars on freeway 4 at time T+1, and so on.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions from t=56 onwards, to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nMinimal H, the number of turns.\n\nH is the number of actions, I think, from t=56 to t=56+H-1, so that after H actions, at turn t=56+H, I am at y=9? Let's see.\n\nStart at turn t_1=56, position y_{56} = 0.\n\nI take actions a_{56}, a_{57}, ..., up to a_{56+H-1}.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=56+H, y_{56+H} = y_{56} + sum of Δy from t=56 to 56+H-1.\n\nAnd I want y_{56+H} = 9.\n\nSince I start at 0, and each action changes y by -1,0,+1, I need at least 9 up actions, but I can have stays or even downs, but downs would increase H, so probably no downs, since I need to go up.\n\nBut I might need to stay to avoid cars.\n\nSo minimal H is at least 9, if I can go directly up without stopping.\n\nBut due to cars, I might need to wait sometimes.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when there is a car covering position 0.\n\nFor each freeway k, and for each car on it, find the times T when 0 is in the car's span at time T.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, if any car covers 0 at T, it's unsafe.\n\nFor freeway k, unsafe at T if for some car on k, min_span(T) <= 0 <= max_span(T).\n\nNow, T is turn number, starting from t_1=56.\n\nSet τ = T - t_1 = T - 56, so time offset.\n\nThen for a car, at time T, span min and max as above.\n\nFor right-moving car: min_span(T) = τ + s * (T - t_1)  ? τ is tail at t_1.\n\nLet me use notation.\n\nFor a car, at t_1, tail = τ, head = h, speed s, direction right.\n\nThen at time T, min_x = τ + s * (T - t_1)\n\nmax_x = h + s * (T - t_1)\n\n0 is in [min_x, max_x] if min_x <= 0 <= max_x\n\nSimilarly for left, but all are right here.\n\nSo min_x <= 0 <= max_x\n\nWhich is τ + s*(T-56) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-56)\n\nNow, solve for T.\n\nFirst inequality: τ + s*(T-56) <= 0 => s*(T-56) <= -τ => T-56 <= -τ / s\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= h + s*(T-56) => -s*(T-56) <= h => T-56 >= -h/s ? Let's see.\n\n0 <= h + s*(T-56) => s*(T-56) >= -h => T-56 >= -h/s\n\nAnd from first: τ + s*(T-56) <= 0 => s*(T-56) <= -τ => T-56 <= -τ/s\n\nSince s > 0.\n\nAlso, since the car exists, min_x <= max_x, so τ <= h at t_1, I assume.\n\nIn the data, for each car, head and tail, with head > tail for right-moving, I think.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: h=-48, τ=-71, so τ < h since -71 < -48.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo min_x <= max_x.\n\nNow, 0 in [min_x, max_x] iff min_x <= 0 and 0 <= max_x iff τ + s*(T-56) <= 0 and h + s*(T-56) >= 0\n\nWhich is s*(T-56) <= -τ and s*(T-56) >= -h\n\nSo T-56 <= -τ / s and T-56 >= -h / s\n\nSince s > 0.\n\nSet δ = T - 56, time offset.\n\nThen for unsafe: -h/s <= δ <= -τ/s\n\nBecause from above: s δ >= -h and s δ <= -τ\n\nSo δ >= -h/s and δ <= -τ/s\n\nSince τ and h are negative, -τ/s and -h/s are positive.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: h = -48, τ = -71, s=24\n\nSo δ >= -(-48)/24 = 48/24 = 2\n\nδ <= -(-71)/24 = 71/24 ≈ 2.958\n\nSo δ from 2 to 71/24, since δ integer? T is turn number, integer, so δ integer.\n\nδ >= 2 and δ <= 71/24, 71/24=2.958, so δ <= 2.958, so δ <= 2 since integer? No.\n\nδ <= -τ/s = 71/24 ≈ 2.958, and δ >= -h/s = 48/24 = 2\n\nSo δ >= 2 and δ <= 2.958\n\nSince δ integer, δ=2\n\nBecause δ=2: 2 >=2 and 2 <=2.958, yes\n\nδ=3: 3 >=2 true, but 3 <=2.958? 3 > 2.958, false, so only δ=2\n\nSimilarly, let's compute for each car.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1: only one car, so unsafe at δ=2\n\nThat means at T=56+2=58, freeway 1 has a car at position 0.\n\nδ=2, T=58.\n\nNow, min_x at T=58: τ + s*2 = -71 + 24*2 = -71 + 48 = -23\n\nmax_x = h + s*2 = -48 + 48 = 0\n\nSo [ -23, 0 ], yes, 0 is included.\n\nAt δ=1, min_x = -71 +24*1 = -47, max_x=-48+24=-24, [-47,-24], 0 not in.\n\nδ=3, min_x=-71+72=1, max_x=-48+72=24, [1,24], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=58.\n\nNow freeway 2: car (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nh=-48, τ=-83, s=36\n\nδ >= -h/s = -(-48)/36 = 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333\n\nδ <= -τ/s = -(-83)/36 = 83/36 ≈2.305\n\nδ integer, so δ=2 (since 2 >=1.333 and 2<=2.305)\n\nδ=1: 1>=1.333? 1<1.333, false\n\nδ=2: 2>=1.333 and 2<=2.305, true\n\nδ=3: 3<=2.305 false\n\nSo only δ=2, T=58\n\nAt T=58, min_x= τ + s*2 = -83 + 72 = -11? s=36, δ=2, T-56=2\n\nmin_x = τ + s δ = -83 + 36*2 = -83 + 72 = -11\n\nmax_x = h + s δ = -48 + 72 = 24\n\nSo [-11,24], includes 0.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-48, -83, right, 36) identical to freeway 2.\n\nIn table: freeway 3: (-48, -83, right, 36) same as freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same.\n\nFreeway 5: has three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48, 37, right, 6)\n\nh=48, τ=37? Head and tail.\n\nFor right-moving, head should be larger than tail, 48 > 37, yes.\n\ns=6\n\nNow, unsafe when min_x <=0<= max_x\n\nmin_x(T) = τ + s δ = 37 + 6 δ\n\nmax_x(T) = h + s δ = 48 + 6 δ\n\nNow, min_x <=0: 37 +6δ <=0? 37+6δ <=0 => 6δ <= -37 => δ <= -37/6 ≈ -6.166, but δ >=0, since T>=t_1, so min_x =37+6δ >=37>0, so min_x >0 for all δ>=0, so 0 never <= min_x? min_x <=0 is false since min_x >=37>0, so 0 < min_x <= max_x, so 0 not in [min_x, max_x] for this car. Similarly, max_x >=48>0, but min_x>0, so car is always to the right, never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway 5: (12, 1, right, 6)\n\nh=12, τ=1, s=6\n\nmin_x = τ + s δ =1 +6δ\n\nmax_x=12 +6δ\n\nmin_x <=0: 1+6δ <=0 => 6δ <=-1, δ<= -1/6, impossible for δ>=0, so min_x >=1>0, so 0 not in [min_x, max_x]\n\nThird car: (-24, -35, right, 6)\n\nh=-24, τ=-35, s=6\n\nmin_x = τ + s δ = -35 +6δ\n\nmax_x = h + s δ = -24 +6δ\n\n0 in [min_x, max_x] if min_x <=0 and 0<=max_x\n\nmin_x <=0: -35 +6δ <=0 => 6δ <=35 => δ <= 35/6 ≈5.833\n\n0<=max_x: 0 <= -24 +6δ => 6δ >=24 => δ >=4\n\nSo δ >=4 and δ <=5.833, so δ=4,5\n\nFor δ=4: min_x= -35+24= -11, max_x=-24+24=0, so [-11,0], 0 included\n\nδ=5: min_x=-35+30= -5, max_x=-24+30=6, [-5,6], 0 included\n\nδ=6: min_x=-35+36=1, max_x=-24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo for third car, unsafe at δ=4 and 5, T=60 and 61\n\nNow for freeway 5, unsafe if any car unsafe, so at δ=4 and 5, T=60,61\n\nNow freeway 6: same cars as freeway 5? In table: freeway 6: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6) identical to freeway 5.\n\nSo same, unsafe at T=60 and 61.\n\nNow freeway 7: one car (48,37,right,12)\n\nh=48, τ=37, s=12\n\nmin_x=37+12δ >0 for all δ, so never unsafe. Always positive.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: (48,37,right,4)\n\nh=48, τ=37, s=4\n\nmin_x=37+4δ >=37>0, always positive, never unsafe.\n\nNow, freeway 1,2,3,4 are unsafe only at T=58, as we saw.\n\nFreeway 1 at T=58\n\nFreeway 2 at T=58\n\nFreeway 3 same as 2, T=58\n\nFreeway 4 same, T=58\n\nFreeway 5 and 6 unsafe at T=60 and 61\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 always safe.\n\ny=1,2,3,4 unsafe only at T=58\n\ny=5 and 6 unsafe at T=60 and 61\n\ny=7 and 8 always safe.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nStart at t=56, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince y=7 and 8 are always safe, I can cross them anytime.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on y=1,2,3,4 at T=58, and on y=5 or 6 at T=60 or 61.\n\nAlso, when I move, I need to consider the sequence.\n\nMinimal H: since I need to increase y by 9, with actions U,D,S, minimal actions is 9 if all U, but I might need to wait.\n\nPossible to go directly if I can avoid the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, if I go up continuously, starting from t=56.\n\nAt t=56, y=0, I take action.\n\nLet me denote the turn and y.\n\nAt turn t, y_t, I take a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAt turn t, I am on row y_t.\n\nFor collision at turn t, it depends on y_t and the cars on that row at time t.\n\nNow, unsafe rows:\n\ny=1: unsafe at t=58\n\nSimilarly y=2,3,4 at t=58\n\ny=5 and 6 at t=60 and 61.\n\ny=7 and 8 always safe.\n\nI need to not be on y=1,2,3,4 at t=58, and not on y=5 or 6 at t=60 or 61.\n\nAlso, since I start at y=0 at t=56, and need to reach y=9.\n\nLet me see possible times to be on each row.\n\nSince I can only change y by at most 1 per turn, the sequence of y must be non-decreasing or with stays, but I can go down, but that would increase time, so probably not needed.\n\nAssume I only go up or stay, no down, to minimize time.\n\nSo y increases from 0 to 9 with steps of 0 or +1.\n\nLet S be the number of stay actions, U be up actions, then after H turns, y = U, since start at 0, and y_{56+H} = U, set to 9, so U=9.\n\nH = number of actions, from t=56 to t=56+H-1, so after H actions, at turn t=56+H, y= sum of Δy from actions.\n\nActions from t=56 to t=56+H-1, H actions.\n\ny_{56} = 0\n\nAfter a_{56}, y_{57} = y_{56} + Δy_{56}\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{56+H-1}, y_{56+H} = y_{56} + sum_{k=0}^{H-1} Δy_{56+k}\n\nSet equal to 9.\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1, but since we start at 0 and end at 9, and y>=0, probably no down, so Δy >=0, so y non-decreasing.\n\nThus, number of U actions must be 9, number of S actions is S, then H = 9 + S, and y_{56+H} = 9.\n\nThe time to reach y=9 is turn t=56+H.\n\nBut I need to reach (0,9), which is at some turn when y=9.\n\nNow, the critical part is the path through the rows.\n\nI need to avoid being on unsafe rows at unsafe times.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If on y=1,2,3, or 4 at t=58, collision.\n\n- If on y=5 or 6 at t=60 or 61, collision.\n\nSince y=1,2,3,4 all unsafe only at t=58, and similarly y=5,6 at t=60,61.\n\nBut y=7 and 8 always safe.\n\nNow, I start at t=56, y=0.\n\nI need to go through each row from 1 to 8, but I can stay on rows or skip, but I have to go through each to move up.\n\nWhen I am on a row, I might stay multiple turns.\n\nBut for unsafe rows, I need to not be there at specific times.\n\nFor safe rows, no problem.\n\nNow, let me list the unsafe times for each row:\n\nRow 1: unsafe only at t=58\n\nSimilarly row 2,3,4 at t=58\n\nRow 5: unsafe at t=60 and 61\n\nRow 6: unsafe at t=60 and 61\n\nRow 7: always safe\n\nRow 8: always safe\n\nNow, since I have to traverse from 0 to 9, I will be on each row 1 to 8 for at least one turn, but I can be on a row for multiple turns if I stay.\n\nTo minimize H, I want to minimize stays, so go up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nNow, the critical times are t=58 for rows 1-4, and t=60,61 for rows 5-6.\n\nI need to not be on rows 1-4 at t=58, and not on rows 5-6 at t=60 or 61.\n\nSince rows 1-4 are all unsafe at the same time t=58, I need to be not on any of them at t=58.\n\nSimilarly for rows 5-6 at t=60 and 61.\n\nNow, let me consider the timing.\n\nSuppose I start at t=56, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe first possible turn to be on y=1 is t=57, if I take U at t=56.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nLet me define the turn when I first arrive at each row.\n\nBut I might stay, so the time I spend on each row.\n\nSince I can only move one step at a time, the state is sequential.\n\nLet me consider possible actions.\n\nI need to avoid t=58 on rows 1-4.\n\nSo at t=58, I must not be on y=1,2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly, at t=60 and 61, not on y=5 or 6.\n\nNow, where can I be at t=58.\n\nt=58 is 2 turns after start, since t=56,57,58.\n\nAt t=56: y=0\n\nAfter a_56, y_57\n\nAfter a_57, y_58\n\nAfter a_58, y_59, and so on.\n\ny_58 is the position at turn 58.\n\nI need y_58 not in {1,2,3,4}\n\nSimilarly, y_60 and y_61 not in {5,6}\n\ny_60 and y_61 both not 5 or 6.\n\nNow, y_58 must be 0, or 5,6,7,8,9 but I start from 0, at t=58, y<=8? Since from t=56 to t=58, only two actions, so y_58 <=2, because each action can increase by at most 1.\n\nAt t=56, y=0\n\nAfter one action (t=56), y_57 <=1\n\nAfter second action (t=57), y_58 <=2\n\nSo possible y_58: 0,1,2\n\nBut I need y_58 not in {1,2,3,4}, but since y_58 <=2, so not 3 or 4 possible, but I need not 1 or 2? y_58 must not be 1,2,3,4, but since max 2, so y_58 cannot be 1 or 2.\n\ny_58 must not be in {1,2,3,4}, and possible values are 0,1,2.\n\nSo if y_58=1 or 2, it is in {1,2,3,4}, which must be avoided.\n\nTherefore, y_58 must be 0.\n\nBecause y_58 cannot be 1 or 2.\n\nSo y_58 must be 0.\n\nThat means at turn 58, I must be on row 0.\n\nNow, row 0 is safe, no freeway.\n\nSo I need to be at y=0 at t=58.\n\nBut at t=56, I am at y=0.\n\nSo to be at y=0 at t=58, I must not move up at t=56 and t=57.\n\nThat is, take S at t=56 and S at t=57.\n\nThen y_57 =0 (after a_56=S), y_58=0 (after a_57=S).\n\nIf I take U at t=56, y_57=1, then at t=57, if I take D, y_58=0, but D from y=1 to y=0, but at t=57, when I take action, I am on y_57=1.\n\nBut taking D might not be necessary, and it increases time.\n\nBut in this case, to have y_58=0, I can either stay at 0 or move down, but moving down from 1 to 0.\n\nBut since I start at 0, staying is better.\n\nSo simplest: take S at t=56 and S at t=57, so y_57=0, y_58=0.\n\nNow, next, I need to go up.\n\nBut I also have to avoid rows 5-6 at t=60 and t=61.\n\nNow, t=60 and t=61.\n\nt=60 is 4 turns after start, t=56 to t=60 is 4 actions? Turns: t=56,57,58,59,60, so from t=56 to t=60 is 4 steps, y_60 depends on actions from t=56 to t=59.\n\nSimilarly, t=61: actions to t=60.\n\nList turns:\n\nTurn | y after action, but y_t is position at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t taken at turn t affects y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t, take a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nFor collision at turn t, it depends on y_t and cars at t.\n\nWe have t=58: y_58 must be 0.\n\nSo at t=58, y=0.\n\nNow, from there, I need to go up.\n\nt=58: y=0, I take some action.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nAlso, constraints at t=60 and t=61.\n\nt=60: I need y_60 not in {5,6}\n\nSimilarly t=61: y_61 not in {5,6}\n\nNow, from t=58, y=0.\n\nAt t=58, I take a_58, then y_59 = y_58 + Δy_58 = 0 + Δy_58\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, possible actions.\n\nSince I need to go up, I will take U or S, no D probably.\n\nNow, let me see the time.\n\nt=58: y=0\n\nt=59: y_59, depends on a_58\n\nt=60: y_60, depends on a_59\n\nt=61: y_61, depends on a_60\n\nI need y_60 not 5 or 6, y_61 not 5 or 6.\n\nSince I start from y=0 at t=58, and go up.\n\nThe maximum y I can be at t=60: from t=58 to t=60, two actions: a_58 and a_59.\n\ny_59 = 0 + Δy_58\n\ny_60 = y_59 + Δy_59\n\nEach Δy <=1, so y_60 <= 2, since from 0, after two actions, y<=2.\n\nSimilarly, y_61 <=3.\n\nNow, rows 5 and 6 are higher, so y_60 <=2 <5, so y_60 cannot be 5 or 6, since max 2.\n\nSimilarly, y_61 <=3 <5, so cannot be 5 or 6.\n\nTherefore, for t=60 and t=61, since y is at most 3 at t=61, which is less than 5, so automatically y_60 and y_61 are not in {5,6}, because they are at most 2 and 3 respectively.\n\ny_60 <=2, y_61 <=3, both less than 5, so not in {5,6}.\n\nTherefore, the constraint at t=60 and t=61 is automatically satisfied, no issue.\n\nThen, I only have the constraint at t=58, which forced me to stay at y=0 for t=57 and t=58.\n\nt=56: y=0, take a_56=S? Let's list the actions.\n\nAt t=56: y_56=0, take a_56, then y_57 = y_56 + Δy_56\n\nTo have y_58=0, since y_57 <=1, and y_58 = y_57 + Δy_57.\n\nIf y_57=0, then to have y_58=0, take a_57=S.\n\nIf y_57=1, then to have y_58=0, take a_57=D, but D would decrease to 0.\n\nBut to avoid down action, better to stay.\n\nIn this case, since from t=56, if I take a_56=S, then y_57=0.\n\nThen at t=57, take a_57=S, then y_58=0.\n\nIf I take a_56=U, y_57=1.\n\nThen at t=57, to have y_58=0, take a_57=D, then y_58=1 + (-1)=0.\n\nBut then I used a down, which might not be efficient, but possible.\n\nBut with down, I might have extra actions.\n\nSince I need to go to 9, using down would require more actions.\n\nFor example, if I go up to 1 and down to 0, I wasted two actions to stay at 0, same as two S.\n\nBut with S, I stay at 0 without moving.\n\nIn terms of position, same, but with U and D, I moved but came back, so extra action? No.\n\na_56=U: y_57=1\n\na_57=D: y_58=0\n\nAfter two actions, back to 0.\n\nIf a_56=S: y_57=0\n\na_57=S: y_58=0\n\nAlso back to 0 after two actions.\n\nSame number of actions.\n\nBut in the first case, I was at y=1 at t=57, but at t=57, y=1, is that safe?\n\nt=57, row y=1.\n\nIs row 1 unsafe at t=57?\n\nEarlier we have row 1 unsafe only at t=58.\n\nAt t=57, what is the car position.\n\nFor freeway 1, we computed unsafe only at δ=2, T=58.\n\nAt t=57, δ=1, T=57, min_x = τ + s δ = -71 +24*1 = -47, max_x=-48+24=-24, so [-47,-24], not including 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, other rows, since unsafe only at t=58, so at t=57, all rows are safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=59, etc.\n\nSo at t=57, y=1 is safe, no car at 0.\n\nBut in our case, to have y_58=0, we can either stay at 0 or go to 1 and back.\n\nBut going to 1 and back takes two actions to stay, same as staying, so no benefit.\n\nMoreover, with stay, I remain at safe y=0.\n\nSo better to take S at t=56 and S at t=57.\n\nThen y_57=0, y_58=0.\n\nNow, from t=58, y=0, I can start going up.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince rows 7 and 8 are always safe, and rows 5 and 6 are unsafe only at t=60 and 61, but as we saw, at t=60 and 61, I cannot be on high rows because I start late.\n\nt=58: y=0\n\nt=59: I can take action.\n\nIf I take U at t=58, y_59=1\n\nThen at t=59, I can take U, y_60=2\n\nU, y_61=3\n\nU, y_62=4\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I need to go to 9.\n\nSince no other constraints, I can just go up continuously from here.\n\nBut let's see if I can be on rows at unsafe times, but rows 5-6 unsafe at t=60,61, but at t=60, if I start from t=58 y=0.\n\nAfter a_58: y_59 <=1\n\nAfter a_59: y_60 <=2\n\nAfter a_60: y_61 <=3\n\nAfter a_61: y_62 <=4\n\n...\n\ny_60 <=2 <5, so not on 5 or 6.\n\ny_61 <=3 <5, not on 5 or 6.\n\nAnd rows 1-4 unsafe at t=58, but I am at y=0 at t=58, safe.\n\nNow, when I go through rows 1-4, it will be after t=58.\n\nFor example, if I go up:\n\nt=58: y=0, take a_58=U, then y_59=1\n\nAt t=59, I am on y=1.\n\nIs it safe? t=59, row 1.\n\nCars on row 1 at t=59.\n\nδ = t - 56 = 59-56=3\n\nFor freeway 1: min_x = τ + s δ = -71 + 24*3 = -71 + 72 =1\n\nmax_x = h + s δ = -48 + 72 =24\n\nSo [1,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, other rows, since unsafe only at t=58, so at t=59, all should be safe.\n\nFor example, row 2: at t=59, δ=3\n\ncar: τ=-83, s=36, min_x= -83 + 36*3 = -83 + 108 =25\n\nmax_x= -48 + 108=60, [25,60], no 0.\n\nSimilarly, row 5: at t=59, δ=3\n\nFor row 5, cars: the first two cars always safe, third car unsafe at δ=4,5.\n\nAt δ=3, min_x= -35 +6*3= -35+18= -17, max_x=-24+18= -6, [-17,-6], no 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThus, from t=58 onwards, I can go up continuously without stopping.\n\nt=58: y=0, take U, y_59=1\n\nt=59: y=1, take U, y_60=2\n\nt=60: y=2, take U, y_61=3\n\nt=61: y=3, take U, y_62=4\n\nt=62: y=4, take U, y_63=5\n\nNow at t=63, y=5, which is row 5.\n\nIs it safe? t=63, δ=7\n\nRow 5: cars, third car at δ=7: min_x= -35 +6*7= -35+42=7, max_x=-24+42=18, [7,18], no 0. Safe.\n\nt=63: y=5, take U, y_64=6\n\nt=64: y=6, row 6. δ=8, min_x for car: -35+48=13, max= -24+48=24, [13,24], no 0. Safe.\n\nt=64: take U, y_65=7\n\nt=65: y=7, row 7 always safe, take U, y_66=8\n\nt=66: y=8, row 8 safe, take U, y_67=9\n\nNow at y=9, reached.\n\nBut I need to be at (0,9), and y_67=9, so at turn 67.\n\nNow, let's count the actions.\n\nStart from t=56: actions from t=56 to t=66, since y_{67} after last action at t=66.\n\nt=56: action a_56, to y_57\n\n...\n\nt=66: action a_66, to y_67=9\n\nNumber of actions: from t=56 to t=66 inclusive? t=56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66: that's 11 actions.\n\nH = number of actions = 11.\n\ny_{56+H} = y_{67} =9, so H=11.\n\nBut earlier at t=56 and t=57, I took S, then from t=58 to t=66, I took U each time.\n\nt=58 to t=66: 9 actions? t=58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66: that's 9 actions, all U.\n\nPlus t=56 and t=57: two S actions.\n\nTotal actions: 11.\n\nSequence:\n\nt=56: S\n\nt=57: S\n\nt=58: U\n\nt=59: U\n\nt=60: U → y=2\n\nt=61: U → y=3\n\nt=62: U → y=4\n\nt=63: U → y=5\n\nt=64: U → y=6\n\nt=65: U → y=7\n\nt=66: U → y=8? After a_65, y_66=7? Let's list positions.\n\nAt t=56: y=0\n\na_56=S → y_57=0\n\na_57=S → y_58=0\n\na_58=U → y_59=1\n\na_59=U → y_60=2\n\na_60=U → y_61=3\n\na_61=U → y_62=4\n\na_62=U → y_63=5\n\na_63=U → y_64=6\n\na_64=U → y_65=7\n\na_65=U → y_66=8\n\na_66=U → y_67=9\n\nYes, at t=67, y=9.\n\nH=11 actions: t=56 to t=66.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nI had to wait at start because of t=58.\n\nBut could I start earlier?\n\nAt t=56, if I take U immediately, y_57=1\n\nThen at t=57, y=1, if I take U, y_58=2\n\nBut at t=58, y=2, which is row 2, unsafe at t=58, collision.\n\nIf at t=57, I take S, y_58=1, still row 1, unsafe.\n\nIf take D, y_58=0, safe, but then I am at y=0 at t=58.\n\nThen from there same as before, but I used one extra action: a_56=U, a_57=D, then y_58=0.\n\nThen from t=58 same as above, but I have one more action, so H would be larger.\n\nFor example:\n\na_56=U → y_57=1\n\na_57=D → y_58=0\n\nThen a_58=U → y_59=1\n\n...\n\nUp to y_67=9? From t=58 to t=66: 9 actions to go from 0 to 9, but y_58=0, after a_58 to a_66: 9 actions to y_67=9.\n\nBut I have a_56 and a_57, so total actions 11, same as before.\n\nBut in this case, at t=57, I was at y=1, which was safe, but I used down, no benefit.\n\nSo the stay approach is fine.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nIn the above, I reached at t=67 with 11 actions.\n\nBut can I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I didn't have to wait, I could reach in 9 turns: from t=56 to t=64, 9 actions, y_{65}=9.\n\nBut with the constraint, I had to stay two turns, so 11.\n\nBut is there a way to avoid the stay?\n\nFor example, if I can be on row 0 at t=58, but I am already there.\n\nPerhaps I can be on higher rows earlier, but at t=58, I can only be at y<=2, and must be 0, so no.\n\nAnother thing: at t=58, I need not be on rows 1-4, but since I can only be on 0,1,2, and 1 and 2 are unsafe, so must be on 0.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut in the sequence, when I go through row 5 at t=63, which is safe, etc.\n\nBut row 5 is unsafe at t=60 and 61, but t=63 is later, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the answer, I need to output the actions from t_1=56 onwards.\n\nIn the sequence above, actions:\n\nTurn 56: S\n\nTurn 57: S\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nThen at turn 67, y=9.\n\nBut the last action is at t=66, to reach y=9 at t=67.\n\nH=11 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose I take actions faster.\n\nBut at t=58, I must be at y=0, so I cannot start going up before.\n\nUnless I can be at y=0 at t=58 without staying, but I have to.\n\nAnother idea: what if I go up to row 5 or higher before t=60, but rows 5-6 unsafe at t=60,61.\n\nFor example, if I were on row 5 at t=60, unsafe.\n\nBut can I be on row 5 at t=60?\n\nFrom start, t=56 y=0.\n\nIf I go up continuously: a_56=U, y_57=1\n\na_57=U, y_58=2 → but at t=58, y=2, unsafe, collision. Cannot.\n\nIf I stay somewhere, but I have to reach high.\n\nSuppose I stay at y=0 longer? But that would delay.\n\nFor example, stay until later, but then I reach later.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nGo up to y=4 quickly, but y=4 unsafe at t=58.\n\nBut at t=58, if I am on y=4, it is unsafe.\n\nBut can I be on y=4 at t=58? Only if I take four U in two turns? Impossible, max y=2 at t=58.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nThus, the only way is to be at y=0 at t=58.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nIn the up sequence, I go through y=5 at t=63, which is after t=61, safe.\n\nBut is there a way to go faster to y=9?\n\nFor example, from y=0 at t=58, I take U each turn.\n\ny_59=1, y_60=2, y_61=3, y_62=4, y_63=5, y_64=6, y_65=7, y_66=8, y_67=9.\n\n9 steps from t=58 to t=66 for actions, y from 0 to 9.\n\nBut since I started actions from t=56, with two S.\n\nTotal turns from start to end: from t=56 to t=67, 12 turns, but number of actions is 11.\n\nThe minimal H should be 11.\n\nBut let me see if I can reduce by not staying all at start.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=56 I take S, y_57=0\n\nThen at t=57 I take U, y_58=1? But at t=58, y=1, which is row 1, unsafe! Collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nIf at t=56 U, y_57=1\n\nt=57 S, y_58=1, unsafe.\n\nt=57 D, y_58=0, safe, but as before, same.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, must have y_58=0.\n\nNow, about rows 5-6, but since I pass them after t=61, safe.\n\nBut just to be thorough, is there any other unsafe time?\n\nFor example, row 5 unsafe at t=60 and 61 only, as we computed.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 always safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nBut in the output, I need to list actions for each turn.\n\nAlso, H=11.\n\nBut let me write the actions:\n\nTurn 56: S\n\nTurn 57: S\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U  (y=2 at t=60)\n\nTurn 61: U  (y=3 at t=61)\n\nTurn 62: U  (y=4 at t=62)\n\nTurn 63: U  (y=5 at t=63)\n\nTurn 64: U  (y=6 at t=64)\n\nTurn 65: U  (y=7 at t=65)\n\nTurn 66: U  (y=8 at t=66)\n\nThen after this, y_67=9, reached.\n\nBut I need to specify up to when.\n\nThe last action is at turn 66, to reach y=9 at turn 67.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=56 to t=66.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1}\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nWith H actions.\n\nHere t_1=56, H=11, so actions from turn 56 to turn 56+10=66.\n\nt_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nt_1=56, t_1 + H-1 =66, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 56: S\n\nTurn 57: S\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 60, y=2, which is row 2, but t=60, δ=4, row 2: car at t=60.\n\nδ=4, min_x= τ + s δ = -83 + 36*4 = -83 + 144 =61, max_x=-48+144=96, [61,96], no 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nAt turn 63, y=5, t=63, δ=7, row 5: as before, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nIs there a shorter sequence?\n\nSuppose I take some S later, but that would increase H, so no.\n\nFor example, if I take S at some point, I arrive later.\n\nSo minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let me confirm the number.\n\nStart at t=56, y=0.\n\nAfter 0 actions: y=0\n\nAfter 1 action: y<=1\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, y <= k.\n\nTo reach y=9, need at least 9 actions with U.\n\nBut here I have two S, so 11 actions.\n\nDue to the constraint, I must have at least two extra actions to wait.\n\nIn this case, I used two S at start.\n\nCould I use S later? But no need, and it would not help to reduce H.\n\nSo H=11 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nAlso, the player reaches (0,9) at turn t=67, but we don't need to specify, just the actions up to reaching.\n\nIn the sequence, after last action, y=9.\n\nIn the box.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 56: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 57: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 58: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 59: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 60: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 61: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 62: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 63: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 64: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 65: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 66: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }\n\nBut in the text, it should be with actions.\n\nSince it's a sequence.\n\nI think this is fine.\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 56\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11. The sequence of actions must ensure that the player is not on freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3, 4\\) at turn 58 or on freeways \\(y = 5, 6\\) at turns 60 and 61, as these are the unsafe times due to car positions covering \\(x = 0\\).\n\n- At turn 58, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) to avoid collision, as \\(y = 1, 2, 3, 4\\) are unsafe. Starting from \\(y = 0\\) at turn 56, this requires staying at \\(y = 0\\) for turns 57 and 58 by taking \"S\" (stay) actions at turns 56 and 57.\n- After turn 58, the player can move upward continuously (\"U\" actions) without stopping, as the constraints at turns 60 and 61 are automatically satisfied (since \\(y \\leq 3\\) at these turns, which is below \\(y = 5\\) and \\(y = 6\\)). Freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are always safe.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n- Turn 56: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\))\n- Turn 57: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\))\n- Turn 58: U (move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 59)\n- Turn 59: U (move to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 60)\n- Turn 60: U (move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 61)\n- Turn 61: U (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 62)\n- Turn 62: U (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 63)\n- Turn 63: U (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 64)\n- Turn 64: U (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 65)\n- Turn 65: U (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 66)\n- Turn 66: U (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 67)\n\nAfter 11 actions, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 67. This sequence minimizes \\(H\\) while avoiding all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 56: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 57: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 58: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 59: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 60: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 61: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 62: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 63: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 64: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 65: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 66: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

So at turn T, we only care about the freeway y (current) and at turn T+1 we care about the new freeway y' (if moving).\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1=60. Each car is defined by (head, tail, direction, speed). The update rule for cars:\n\n- Left-moving: direction left? But note the example: \n  - Left-moving: Span(t1)=[h, τ] -> at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  - Right-moving: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nWait, the representation for right-moving is given as (head, tail) but the span is [τ, h] meaning the head is at the higher x? Actually, in the update:\n\nFor left-moving: \n  At t1: the car spans from h to τ? But note that h and τ might not be in increasing order? The update rule clarifies:\n\n  Left-moving: the entire car moves left. So the head (which is the leading part in the direction of travel) is at h at t1, and then at T, it is at h - s*(T-t1). Similarly, the tail is at τ at t1, so at T it is at τ - s*(T-t1). And the span is [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]? But note: if the car is moving left, then the head is the rightmost part? Actually, the problem says:\n\n  For left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. This suggests that at t1, the car occupies from h to τ, and then moves left.\n\nBut wait: in the right-moving example, they write \"Span(t1)=[τ, h]\" and then becomes [τ+s*(T-t1), h+s*(T-t1)]. So in the right-moving case, τ is the leftmost and h the rightmost? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1)=[τ, h]\" meaning the car spans from τ to h (with τ < h). Then when moving right, the entire segment shifts right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, they write [h, τ] and then it becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. But if the car is moving left, then the head (front) is the leftmost? Actually, no: in the update, the entire segment moves left. So the head and tail both decrease.\n\nBut note the representation: for left-moving, the head is at a higher x than the tail? Or lower? The update rule doesn't specify the order. However, the collision condition is: we are at x=0, so we care if 0 is in the interval [min, max] of the car's span.\n\nSo regardless of the order of h and τ, the car's span at time T is the interval from min(h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)) to max(h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)) for left-moving? Actually, the problem states the span as [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] for left-moving. This is an interval that might be decreasing? But typically we write intervals as [min, max]. However, the collision condition is just whether 0 is in the interval, so we can compute the min and max of the two endpoints.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] -> we can take the min and max.\n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So if at t1 the car is from τ to h (with τ < h), then at T it is from τ + s*(T-t1) to h + s*(T-t1). Similarly, for left-moving: if at t1 the car is from h to τ? But if h and τ are given arbitrarily, we need to know the order? The problem states:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24) -> but note: direction is right. So for a right-moving car, the representation is (head, tail, ...). But in the update rule, for right-moving, they use [τ, h] meaning the tail is τ and head is h? And then the update: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So in the given data, the first two numbers are head and tail? But the update rule uses τ and h. How do we map?\n\nLooking at the update rule for right-moving: \n  Span(t1) = [τ, h] -> becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the given data, the car is represented as (head, tail, ...). So we must map: \n  For a right-moving car: the head is the front (which is the rightmost point) and the tail is the rear (leftmost). So at t1, the car spans from tail (left) to head (right). Therefore, τ = tail, h = head. So the span is [tail, head] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car: the head is the front (which is the leftmost point?) and the tail is the rear (rightmost)? But the update rule for left-moving says: Span(t1)=[h, τ] and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. So if the car is moving left, then the head (front) is at h (which is the leftmost) and the tail (rear) is at τ (rightmost). Then the span at t1 is from h (left) to τ (right). So the interval [h, τ] is increasing? Actually, if the car is moving left, then the head is the leftmost? That would be the front. So the entire car is from h (left) to τ (right). Then when moving left, both decrease.\n\nBut wait: in the given data, we have only right-moving cars? Let's check:\n\nFreeway 1: direction right -> so it's right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, all cars in the given data are right-moving? \n\nFreeway 1: (-48,-71,right,24) -> so head = -48, tail = -71? But for a right-moving car, the head (front) should be at a higher x than the tail? But -48 > -71, so that makes sense: the car spans from tail=-71 to head=-48. So at t1=60, the car is at [-71, -48]? But wait: the update rule for right-moving: [τ, h] -> so τ is the tail and h is the head. So at t1, the car is from τ=-71 to h=-48.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 has three cars: (48,37,right,6) -> but 48>37, so the car spans from 37 to 48? And then (12,1,right,6) -> from 1 to 12, and (-24,-35,right,6) -> but -24 > -35, so from -35 to -24? \n\nBut wait: the update rule for right-moving: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So for the car (48,37,right,6) at t1=60: \n  τ = 37, h = 48? But the representation is (head, tail) = (48,37). So head=48, tail=37. Then the span at t1 is [37,48]. Then at time T, it becomes [37 + 6*(T-60), 48 + 6*(T-60)].\n\nSimilarly, the car (-24,-35,right,6): head=-24, tail=-35 -> so at t1, the car spans from -35 to -24. Then at T: [-35 + 6*(T-60), -24 + 6*(T-60)].\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is at freeway k (which we are on) and at that turn T, there is a car on freeway k such that 0 is in the car's span at T.\n\nWe are starting at turn t1=60 at y=0. We want to go to y=9. We must avoid freeways 1 to 8 when there is a car that covers 0 at the same turn.\n\nNote: at turn T, we are on freeway y_T. We start at y_60 = 0. At turn 60, we are at y=0, which is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8) so no collision. Then we take an action at turn 60 to move to y_61.\n\nWe need to plan the actions: a_{60}, a_{61}, ... until we reach y=9.\n\nThe goal: minimal H such that at turn t1+H-1 (the last turn in the sequence) we are at y=9. So the actions are for t=60 to t=60+H-1, and the state at turn 60+H-1 is (0,9).\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway y (1..8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway at T that covers 0.\n\nWe are given the state at t1=60. For each car, we can compute its position at any future turn T by:\n  For a right-moving car: \n      tail_T = tail_60 + s*(T-60)\n      head_T = head_60 + s*(T-60)\n      The span is [tail_T, head_T] (which is increasing because tail_60 <= head_60? In the data, for right-moving: head_60 >= tail_60).\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving? But we don't have any left-moving cars in this instance.\n\nSo we only consider right-moving.\n\nWe must compute for each freeway (1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, the times T at which the car covers 0? Actually, we don't need the entire set, but for each turn T we are considering, we can check if the car covers 0 at that turn.\n\nBut note: we are going to simulate turn by turn.\n\nWe start at:\n  Turn 60: position y=0 (safe, because freeway 0 is not considered for collision)\n  We choose an action: U, D, or S.\n\nBut we want to go up to 9, so we should mostly go up. But we have to avoid the freeways at the times when cars are at 0.\n\nWe are going to design a path: we need to get from y=0 to y=9. The minimal number of turns without cars would be 9 turns (each U, then we go 0->1, 1->2, ... 8->9: 9 moves). But we have to avoid collisions, so we might have to wait (S) or even go down sometimes? But going down would increase the number of steps.\n\nWe are to minimize H, the number of turns. So we want as few as possible.\n\nWe can use a BFS or Dijkstra-like approach in the state space: state = (turn, y). But note the turn can go arbitrarily high? But the cars move linearly, and we can compute the car positions at any turn.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute for each freeway (row) and for each time (starting from 60) the safety: whether at that time that row is safe (i.e., no car on that row at that time covers 0).\n\nBut note: for a given freeway k, there might be multiple cars. We have to check all cars on that freeway at that time.\n\nFirst, let's list the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -71, right, 24) -> so head=-48, tail=-71, s=24, right.\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nFreeway 3: one car: (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nFreeway 4: one car: (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: \n  car1: (48,37,right,6)\n  car2: (12,1,right,6)\n  car3: (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: three cars: same as freeway5? \n  (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (48,37,right,4)\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway k and for a time T (>=60) whether 0 is in the span of any car on k at T.\n\nFor a right-moving car: \n  The car at time T: \n      tail_T = tail_60 + s*(T-60)\n      head_T = head_60 + s*(T-60)\n  Then 0 is in [tail_T, head_T] if tail_T <= 0 <= head_T.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving we don't have any.\n\nSo let's compute for each freeway and each car the condition for 0 being in the car at T:\n\nFreeway 1:\n  car: tail0 = -71, head0 = -48, s=24\n  Condition: \n      -71 + 24*(T-60) <= 0 <= -48 + 24*(T-60)\n  Solve for T:\n      First inequality: -71 + 24*(T-60) <= 0  => 24*(T-60) <= 71  => T-60 <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958 => T <= 62.958 -> T<=62 (since T integer)\n      Second inequality: 0 <= -48 + 24*(T-60) => 24*(T-60) >= 48 => T-60 >= 2 => T>=62.\n  So both: T=62? \n      At T=62: \n        tail = -71 + 24*2 = -71+48 = -23\n        head = -48 + 24*2 = -48+48=0\n        So the car is from -23 to 0. Then 0 is included? Yes, because the head is 0 -> so [ -23, 0] includes 0.\n      At T=63: \n        tail = -71+24*3 = -71+72=1, head=-48+72=24 -> [1,24] doesn't include 0.\n      So only T=62 is dangerous? Actually, at T=62: head=0 -> 0 is included. At T=61: \n        tail=-71+24= -47, head=-48+24=-24 -> [-47,-24] doesn't include 0.\n      So only T=62.\n\nFreeway 2:\n  car: tail0=-83, head0=-48, s=36\n  Condition:\n      -83 + 36*(T-60) <= 0 <= -48 + 36*(T-60)\n  First: -83+36*(T-60) <=0 -> 36*(T-60)<=83 -> T-60<=83/36≈2.305 -> T<=62.305 -> T<=62\n  Second: 0<=-48+36*(T-60) -> 36*(T-60)>=48 -> T-60>=48/36=1.333 -> T>=61.333 -> T>=62\n  So only T=62?\n      At T=62: \n        tail=-83+36*2=-83+72=-11\n        head=-48+72=24\n        [-11,24] includes 0? Yes.\n  At T=61: \n        tail=-83+36=-47, head=-48+36=-12 -> [-47,-12] doesn't include 0.\n  At T=63: \n        tail=-83+108=25, head=-48+108=60 -> [25,60] doesn't include 0.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway2? \n  car: (-48,-83,right,36) -> same as freeway2? Actually, the head and tail are the same? \n  So same: dangerous at T=62.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway2 and 3? \n  So dangerous at T=62.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars.\n\nCar1: (48,37,right,6) -> tail0=37, head0=48, s=6\n  Condition: \n      37+6*(T-60) <=0 <=48+6*(T-60) -> \n      First: 37+6*(T-60)<=0 -> 6*(T-60)<=-37 -> which is impossible because T>=60 -> left side >=37? \n      Actually: 37+6*(T-60) is at least 37 (when T=60) and increases. So the car is always to the right of 0? \n      So never covers 0.\n\nCar2: (12,1,right,6) -> tail0=1, head0=12, s=6\n  Condition:\n      1+6*(T-60) <=0 <=12+6*(T-60)\n      First: 1+6*(T-60)<=0 -> 6*(T-60)<=-1 -> impossible (since T>=60, the left side>=0). So never.\n\nCar3: (-24,-35,right,6) -> tail0=-35, head0=-24, s=6\n  Condition:\n      -35+6*(T-60) <=0<=-24+6*(T-60)\n      First: -35+6*(T-60)<=0 -> 6*(T-60)<=35 -> T-60<=35/6≈5.833 -> T<=65.833 -> T<=65\n      Second: 0<=-24+6*(T-60) -> 6*(T-60)>=24 -> T-60>=4 -> T>=64\n      So T=64,65?\n        T=64: tail=-35+6*4=-35+24=-11, head=-24+24=0 -> [-11,0] includes 0? Yes.\n        T=65: tail=-35+30=-5, head=-24+30=6 -> [-5,6] includes 0? Yes.\n        T=66: tail=-35+36=1, head=-24+36=12 -> [1,12] doesn't include 0.\n      So dangerous at T=64,65.\n\nTherefore, freeway5 is dangerous at T=64 and 65.\n\nFreeway6: same as freeway5? \n  So same: dangerous at T=64,65.\n\nFreeway7: one car: (48,37,right,12) -> tail0=37, head0=48, s=12\n  Condition: \n      37+12*(T-60) <=0<=48+12*(T-60) -> \n      First: 37+12*(T-60)<=0 -> 12*(T-60)<=-37 -> impossible. So never dangerous.\n\nFreeway8: one car: (48,37,right,4) -> tail0=37, head0=48, s=4\n  Similarly, always positive and increasing? So never dangerous.\n\nSummary of dangerous times per freeway:\n\nFreeway1: T=62\nFreeway2: T=62\nFreeway3: T=62\nFreeway4: T=62\nFreeway5: T=64,65\nFreeway6: T=64,65\nFreeway7: safe\nFreeway8: safe\n\nNow, we are at turn 60, y=0.\n\nWe have to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) to get to y=9, avoiding being on a freeway at the dangerous times.\n\nWe note:\n  At turn T, we are at y_T. We are safe if:\n    - y_T = 0 or 9: no collision (because freeways are 1-8)\n    - or if y_T is between 1 and 8, then T must not be one of the dangerous times for that freeway.\n\nWe start at T=60, y=0 (safe).\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nThe minimal steps without obstacles: 9 steps (each U). But we must avoid:\n\n  - At T=62, we cannot be on freeways 1,2,3,4.\n  - At T=64 and 65, we cannot be on freeways 5 and 6.\n\nWe can try to go as fast as possible and see if we can avoid these times on the dangerous rows.\n\nConsider the timeline:\n\n  Turn 60: y0=0 -> safe\n  Turn 61: we take an action -> then y61 = y60 + a60: if U then y61=1, if S then 0, if D then -1? But y must be in [0,9] -> so D from 0 would stay 0? Actually, the update: \n      y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, and then clamped to [0,9]? But the problem says \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\". So if at 0 and D, then y_{t+1}=max(0,0-1)=0.\n\nSo we can only stay or go up.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, we can only stay or go down.\n\nBut we start at 0, so at turn60: we can only do U or S? (D would leave us at 0).\n\nWe want to minimize H, so we prefer U.\n\nLet me try to go up as fast as possible:\n\n  T=60: y=0 (safe)\n  T=61: U -> y=1 (freeway1) -> is T=61 dangerous for freeway1? We saw freeway1 is dangerous at T=62 only. So at T=61: freeway1 is safe? \n        How do we know? We computed for freeway1: dangerous only at T=62. So at T=61, freeway1 is safe? \n        But we must check the car on freeway1 at T=61: \n          tail = -71 + 24*(61-60) = -71+24 = -47\n          head = -48+24 = -24 -> so [-47,-24] doesn't cover 0. So safe.\n\n  T=62: U -> y=2 (freeway2). But at T=62, freeway2 is dangerous! So we cannot be on freeway2 at T=62.\n\nSo if we go up at T=61 to y=1, then at T=62 we are going to y=2 -> but then at T=62 we are on freeway2 -> collision.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeways 1,2,3,4 at T=62.\n\nHow to avoid? We can either:\n  - Not be on freeways 1,2,3,4 at T=62.\n  - Or if we are, then we must be on a freeway that is safe at T=62? But freeways 1,2,3,4 are all dangerous at T=62. So we must not be on any of them at T=62.\n\nAt T=62, we can be on:\n  - y=0: safe (not a freeway)\n  - y=5,6: but freeway5 and 6 are safe at T=62? (they are dangerous at T=64,65) -> so safe at T=62.\n  - y=7,8: safe (we saw freeway7 and 8 are always safe)\n  - y=9: safe.\n\nSo at T=62, we must be at y=0,5,6,7,8, or 9.\n\nBut we are starting at y=0 at T=60. How can we get to y=5 at T=62? That would require 5 steps in 2 turns? Impossible: maximum we can go is 2 steps (from 0 to 2).\n\nSimilarly, to y=6: 6 steps in 2 turns? no.\n\nSo the only safe positions at T=62 are y=0 and y>=5? But we can only get to y=0,1,2 in two moves.\n\nSo we can only be at y=0 at T=62? Or if we go down we stay at 0, but we are already at 0.\n\nTherefore, the only safe position at T=62 is y=0.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 at T=62.\n\nHow?\n  At T=60: y=0 -> safe.\n  At T=61: we can choose:\n        U: then y=1 -> then at T=62: we must not be on freeway2? But we are at y=1 -> freeway1? \n            Actually, at T=62, if we are at y=1, then we are on freeway1 -> which is dangerous at T=62 -> collision.\n        S: then at T=61: y=0 -> safe.\n        D: then y=0 -> safe.\n\n  Then at T=62: we are still at y=0 (if we did S or D at T=61). Then at T=62: safe.\n\nSo we must stay at y=0 at T=61? Then we are safe at T=62.\n\nBut then we have lost one turn.\n\nThen from T=62 onward, we can go up.\n\nBut now we have to avoid freeways 5 and 6 at T=64 and T=65.\n\nWe are at T=62: y=0.\nWe want to go to y=9.\n\nWe need to plan:\n\n  T=62: y=0\n  T=63: we can go to y=0 or y=1.\n  T=64: ... \n  T=65: ...\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway5 or 6 at T=64 and T=65.\n\nSo at T=64: we must not be on freeway5 or 6 -> so y must be 0,1,2,3,4,7,8,9 at T=64.\nSimilarly at T=65: same.\n\nBut note: we are starting from y=0 at T=62.\n\nWe can do:\n\n  T=62: at y=0 -> safe (non-freeway)\n  T=63: U -> y=1 (freeway1) -> at T=63: is freeway1 dangerous? We computed only T=62 for freeway1. At T=63: freeway1: tail=-71+24*3=-71+72=1, head=-48+72=24 -> [1,24] -> doesn't cover 0? so safe.\n  T=64: U -> y=2 (freeway2) -> at T=64: freeway2: \n        tail=-83+36*(64-60)= -83+36*4=-83+144=61, head=-48+144=96 -> [61,96] -> doesn't cover 0 -> safe? \n        But wait, we have freeway2 only dangerous at T=62? So safe at T=64.\n        However, we must also check: at T=64 we are on freeway2, but freeway2 is safe at T=64? Yes.\n\n  Then T=65: U -> y=3 (freeway3) -> at T=65: freeway3: \n        tail=-83+36*(65-60)= -83+36*5=-83+180=97 -> [97, head=-48+180=132] -> safe.\n\n  T=66: U -> y=4 (freeway4) -> at T=66: freeway4: \n        tail=-83+36*6=-83+216=133 -> safe.\n\n  T=67: U -> y=5 (freeway5) -> at T=67: freeway5: \n        We have three cars. We computed dangerous at T=64,65 -> T=67 is safe? \n        Check car3: tail=-35+6*(67-60)=-35+42=7, head=-24+42=18 -> [7,18] -> doesn't include 0 -> safe.\n        The other cars are even further right.\n\n  Then T=68: U->y=6 -> freeway6: same as freeway5? at T=68: \n        car3: tail=-35+6*8=-35+48=13, head=-24+48=24 -> safe.\n\n  T=69: U->y=7 -> freeway7: safe always.\n  T=70: U->y=8 -> freeway8: safe.\n  T=71: U->y=9 -> goal.\n\nTotal turns: from T=60 to T=71 -> 12 turns? \n\nBut wait: we started at T=60 at y=0. Then:\n\n  T=60: start\n  T=61: S (or D) -> y=0\n  T=62: S (or D) -> y=0\n  T=63: U -> y=1\n  T=64: U -> y=2\n  T=65: U -> y=3\n  T=66: U -> y=4\n  T=67: U -> y=5\n  T=68: U -> y=6\n  T=69: U -> y=7\n  T=70: U -> y=8\n  T=71: U -> y=9\n\nSo the actions from T=60 to T=71: that's 12 actions? But the goal is to be at y=9 at turn T=71, which is the last action at T=71? \n\nActually, the sequence of actions: \n  We start at T=60: we take action at T=60, then we are at T=61 at y_{61}. \n  Then we take actions at T=61, T=62, ... until we are at y=9.\n\nWe are at y=9 at T=71. The last action was taken at T=70? \n\nLet me define:\n  At the start of turn T, we are at y_T. Then we choose an action a_T, and then we move to y_{T+1} = y_T + Delta(a_T).\n\nWe start at T=60: y60=0. Then we take a_60: which we set to S -> so y61=0.\nThen at T=61: we take a_61: S -> y62=0.\nThen at T=62: we take a_62: U -> y63=1.\nThen at T=63: U -> y64=2.\n...\nThen at T=70: U -> y71=9.\n\nSo we have taken actions at T=60 to T=70: 11 actions? And we are at y=9 at T=71. \n\nBut the problem says: we want the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1 such that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9).\n\nSo the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then immediately after that we are at (0,9). \n\nSo in our plan: \n  After the last action at T=70, we are at T=71 at y=9. \n  So H = 11? Because we start at T=60 and take 11 actions: T=60,61,...,70 -> 11 turns. Then at T=71 we are at y=9.\n\nBut let me count: \n  Actions: 60,61,62,...,70 -> 11 actions? \n  Then at the next turn (T=71) we are at y=9.\n\nSo H=11.\n\nBut is there a faster way? \n\nWe must avoid being at freeways 1,2,3,4 at T=62. The only safe position at T=62 is y=0. So we must be at y=0 at T=62.\n\nWe started at T=60 at y=0. So we have two moves: T=60 and T=61 to do nothing (stay at 0). \n\nThen at T=62 we are at y=0. Then we start moving.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid freeways 5 and 6 at T=64 and T=65.\n\nAt T=63: we are at y=1 (if we go up from T=62: a62=U -> then at T=63 we are at y=1).\nAt T=64: we go to y=2 -> safe? because freeway2 is safe at T=64? (we computed: freeway2 at T=64: [61,96] -> safe).\nAt T=65: we go to y=3 -> freeway3: at T=65: [97,132] -> safe.\n\nThen we continue: \n  T=66: y=4 (freeway4: safe at T=66? \n        freeway4: tail=-83+36*(66-60)= -83+216=133 -> safe)\n  T=67: y=5 -> freeway5: at T=67: \n        car3: tail=-35+6*(67-60)=-35+42=7, head=-24+42=18 -> [7,18] -> safe.\n  T=68: y=6 -> freeway6: same -> safe.\n  T=69: y=7 -> safe.\n  T=70: y=8 -> safe.\n  T=71: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo we have:\n  T=60: S (or D) -> y61=0\n  T=61: S (or D) -> y62=0\n  T=62: U -> y63=1\n  T=63: U -> y64=2\n  T=64: U -> y65=3\n  T=65: U -> y66=4\n  T=66: U -> y67=5\n  T=67: U -> y68=6\n  T=68: U -> y69=7\n  T=69: U -> y70=8\n  T=70: U -> y71=9\n\nSo actions: \n  Turn 60: S\n  Turn 61: S\n  Turn 62: U\n  Turn 63: U\n  Turn 64: U\n  Turn 65: U\n  Turn 66: U\n  Turn 67: U\n  Turn 68: U\n  Turn 69: U\n  Turn 70: U\n\nTotal 11 actions. H=11.\n\nBut can we do better? \n\nWhat if we don't wait two turns? We must be at y=0 at T=62. We started at T=60 at y=0. So we have to spend two turns at y=0? \n\nAlternatively, we could have done: \n  T=60: S -> y61=0\n  T=61: S -> y62=0\n\nBut we could also do D at T=60: then y61=0, then at T=61 we do D again: y62=0. Same.\n\nIs there a way to avoid waiting two turns? \n\nWhat if we go up at T=60 to y=1? Then at T=61 we are at y=1. Then at T=61 we must avoid being at freeway1 at T=61? But freeway1 at T=61 is safe. Then at T=61, we can choose:\n  U: then at T=62 we are at y=2 -> freeway2 at T=62: dangerous -> collision.\n  D: then at T=62 we are at y=0 -> safe.\n  S: then at T=62 we are at y=1 -> freeway1 at T=62: dangerous -> collision.\n\nSo the only safe option at T=61 if we are at y=1 is to go down to y=0 at T=62.\n\nThen we have:\n\n  T=60: U -> y61=1\n  T=61: D -> y62=0\n\nThen we are at T=62: y=0 -> safe.\n\nThen we start moving from T=62 onward: same as before. \n\nTotal actions: \n  T=60: U\n  T=61: D\n  T=62: U -> y63=1\n  ... same as before: then we go up 9 times to get to y=9 at T=71.\n\nBut the sequence of actions: \n  T=60: U\n  T=61: D\n  T=62: U\n  T=63: U\n  ... until T=70: U -> then y71=9.\n\nThat's 11 actions too.\n\nBut we have an extra D? Actually, we did U then D: that cancels? So the net movement is 0 at the first two moves. Then we move up 9 times: total 9 moves? But we did 11 actions.\n\nWe started at y=0 at T=60. After T=60:U -> T=61:y=1. Then T=61:D -> T=62:y=0. Then from T=62 to T=71: we go from 0 to 9: 9 moves? That would be 9 actions? So total actions: 2 (for the first two) + 9 = 11.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut we can try to avoid the two wasted moves? We must be at y=0 at T=62. So we must lose two moves? \n\nAlternatively, we might wait only one move? But we start at T=60 at y=0. Then at T=61: we are at y=0 (if we do S or D). Then at T=62: we are at y=0. So we have to do at least two moves? \n\nBut if we do nothing at T=60 and T=61, that's two moves. \n\nIn the alternative: we did U at T=60 and D at T=61: that's two moves and we end at y=0 at T=62.\n\nSo we cannot avoid two moves to be spent at the beginning.\n\nThen the minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let me check if we can get to y=9 earlier by going faster? \n\nWe have to avoid freeways 5 and 6 at T=64 and T=65. \n\nIn our plan, we are at:\n  T=64: y=2 -> safe\n  T=65: y=3 -> safe\n  T=66: y=4 -> safe\n  T=67: y=5 -> but freeway5 at T=67: we computed safe? \n        freeway5: car3 at T=67: tail=-35+6*(67-60)= -35+42=7 -> [7,18] -> safe.\n  So we are safe.\n\nBut what if we try to go faster? \n\nWe are at T=62: y=0.\nWe want to get to y=9 as fast as possible: 9 moves? \n\nBut we must avoid being on freeway5 or 6 at T=64 and T=65.\n\nAt T=64: we are at turn 64. We started at T=62. So we have two moves: T=62 and T=63.\n\nFrom y=0 at T=62, we can only get to y=2 at T=64? Because:\n  T=62: U -> T=63: y=1\n  T=63: U -> T=64: y=2\n\nBut we must not be on freeway5 or 6 at T=64 -> we are at y=2 -> freeway2 -> which is safe at T=64? Yes.\n\nThen at T=65: we do U -> y=3 -> freeway3: safe at T=65? Yes.\n\nThen we can continue: \n  T=64: y=2 -> then we have to go 7 more steps: T=64 to T=71: 7 moves? Then we get to y=9 at T=71? \n\nSame as before.\n\nBut what if we do three moves in two turns? Impossible: each move only one step.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to jump over the dangerous freeways at the dangerous times? \n\nFor freeways 5 and 6, they are dangerous at T=64 and T=65. So we must avoid being on freeway5 or 6 at T=64 and T=65.\n\nWe can be on freeway5 at T=63? or T=66? \n\nIn our plan, we go through freeway5 at T=67: which is safe.\n\nBut can we go through freeway5 earlier? \n\nSuppose we go faster: \n  T=62: U -> T=63: y=1\n  T=63: U -> T=64: y=2\n  T=64: U -> T=65: y=3\n  T=65: U -> T=66: y=4\n  T=66: U -> T=67: y=5 -> same as before.\n\nBut we are on freeway5 at T=67: safe.\n\nWhat if we go even faster? We can't.\n\nBut note: we can also go down? That would be counterproductive.\n\nAlternatively, we could wait at some safe freeway? \n\nFor example, at T=64 and T=65, we must not be on freeway5 and 6. So we could be on freeway7 or 8? But we are at y=0 at T=62. To get to freeway7 (y=7) at T=64: we would need to go 7 steps in two moves? Impossible.\n\nSo we must be below freeway5 at T=64 and T=65.\n\nTherefore, the plan we have is minimal: 11 actions.\n\nBut let me check if we can skip the waiting at the beginning? \n\nWe must be at y=0 at T=62. We start at T=60 at y=0. So we need two moves to stay at 0? \n\nAlternatively, we could have left earlier? But we start at T=60.\n\nAnother idea: what if we go up to y=5 at T=62? But that requires 5 moves in 2 turns? Impossible.\n\nSo we are stuck with two moves at the beginning.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nWe can choose either:\n\nOption 1:\n  T=60: S\n  T=61: S\n  T=62: U\n  T=63: U\n  T=64: U\n  T=65: U\n  T=66: U\n  T=67: U\n  T=68: U\n  T=69: U\n  T=70: U\n\nOption 2:\n  T=60: U\n  T=61: D\n  T=62: U\n  T=63: U\n  ... same as above until T=70: U.\n\nBoth are 11 moves.\n\nBut note: in option2, we did an extra U and D at the beginning. It doesn't harm.\n\nWe can choose either. Let me choose the first one: two S's.\n\nBut note: at T=60: we are at y=0. If we do D, we stay at 0. Same as S.\n\nSo we can write S or D for the actions that keep us at 0.\n\nBut the problem: the action set is {U, D, S}. \n\nWe'll write:\n\nTurn 60: S\nTurn 61: S\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: U\nTurn 64: U\nTurn 65: U\nTurn 66: U\nTurn 67: U\nTurn 68: U\nTurn 69: U\nTurn 70: U\n\nBut wait: the last action at T=70: U -> then at T=71 we are at y=9.\n\nSo the sequence is 11 actions.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1? \n\nWe have actions at t1=60, 61, ... 70 -> that's 11 actions.\n\nSo H=11.\n\nNow, we must verify the dangerous times:\n\nAt T=62: we are at y=0 -> safe.\n\nAt T=64: we are at y=2 -> freeway2: \n      car: tail=-83+36*(64-60)= -83+144=61, head=-48+144=96 -> [61,96] -> safe.\n\nAt T=65: we are at y=3 -> freeway3: \n      tail=-83+36*5=-83+180=97 -> safe.\n\nAt T=67: we are at y=5 -> freeway5: \n      car3: tail=-35+6*7=-35+42=7 -> [7,18] -> doesn't include 0 -> safe.\n\nAt T=68: we are at y=6 -> freeway6: same as freeway5 at T=68: \n      car3: tail=-35+6*8=-35+48=13 -> [13,24] -> safe.\n\nOther freeways: we are at y=1 at T=63: freeway1 at T=63: \n      tail=-71+24*3=-71+72=1, head=-48+72=24 -> [1,24] -> doesn't include 0 -> safe.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence has 11 actions.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 60: S\nTurn 61: S\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: U\nTurn 64: U\nTurn 65: U\nTurn 66: U\nTurn 67: U\nTurn 68: U\nTurn 69: U\nTurn 70: U\n}\n\nNote: we could have used D for the first two instead of S, but S is more natural.\n\nBut the problem: the action D at y=0 would also yield y=0. So same effect.\n\nWe choose S.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 60\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The analysis considers the dangerous times for each freeway based on car movements:\n\n- Freeways 1, 2, 3, and 4 are dangerous at turn 62 (i.e., collision occurs if the player is on these freeways at turn 62).\n- Freeways 5 and 6 are dangerous at turns 64 and 65.\n- Freeways 7 and 8 are always safe.\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 0\\) (safe) at turn 60. To avoid being on freeways 1–4 at turn 62, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 62. From turn 62 onward, the player moves upward, avoiding freeways 5 and 6 at turns 64 and 65 by being at \\(y = 2\\) and \\(y = 3\\) respectively (safe positions). The player continues moving up to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 71.\n\nThe minimal sequence requires 11 actions (turns 60 to 70), with the player reaching \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 71.\n\n**Action Sequence**:\n- **Turn 60**: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\) (safe).\n- **Turn 61**: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\) (safe).\n- **Turn 62**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1 is safe at turn 62 for the player, as the car does not cover \\(x=0\\)).\n- **Turn 63**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2 is safe at turn 63).\n- **Turn 64**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3 is safe at turn 64; avoiding freeway 5 and 6 at this turn).\n- **Turn 65**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4 is safe at turn 65; avoiding freeway 5 and 6 at this turn).\n- **Turn 66**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5 is safe at turn 66, as cars do not cover \\(x=0\\)).\n- **Turn 67**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6 is safe at turn 67).\n- **Turn 68**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7 is always safe).\n- **Turn 69**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8 is always safe).\n- **Turn 70**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\) (goal reached at turn 71).\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions and achieves the goal in the minimal 11 turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 60: S \\\\\nTurn 61: S \\\\\nTurn 62: U \\\\\nTurn 63: U \\\\\nTurn 64: U \\\\\nTurn 65: U \\\\\nTurn 66: U \\\\\nTurn 67: U \\\\\nTurn 68: U \\\\\nTurn 69: U \\\\\nTurn 70: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 62, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical movement is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway row y (from 1 to 8) and at that turn, the car on that row has a span that includes 0 (the horizontal position of the player).\n\nNote: The player is only on a row at a turn if they are on that row at the beginning of the turn (and then they move at the end of the turn). Also, when moving, at the moment of the turn, the player is on the starting row and then moves to the next. Therefore, when moving from row y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T the player is on row y (so we check the car on row y at turn T) and then at turn T+1 the player is on row y+1 (so we check row y+1 at turn T+1).\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1 (which is 62). The cars move at constant speed. For left-moving cars, the span moves left (so the head and tail decrease by s*(T-t1) at turn T. For right-moving, they increase by s*(T-t1).\n\nWe have 8 freeways (rows 1 to 8). Each freeway has one or more cars. Note: for freeways 5 and 6, there are multiple cars.\n\nWe need to compute the position of every car at every future turn? Actually, we only care about when the player is on a particular row and at that turn, whether the car on that row (if any) has a span that includes 0.\n\nBut note: each freeway may have multiple cars. We must check all cars on the freeway the player is on at that turn.\n\nLet me denote:\n- t1 = 62 (current turn)\n- The player starts at y=0 at turn 62.\n\nGoal: get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns without any cars would be 9 (if we move up 9 times). But we have to avoid the cars on rows 1 to 8.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) so that at every turn T (from 62 onwards) when the player is on a row y (which is between 1 and 8) at that turn, no car on that row has a span that includes 0 at that turn.\n\nNote: at the start (turn 62) the player is at y=0, which is safe (since cars are only on rows 1-8). Similarly, when we reach y=9, we are safe.\n\nWe have to compute the positions of the cars at future turns relative to t1=62.\n\nFor a car with initial head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s at turn t1, at turn T (>= t1):\n  If right-moving: the entire car shifts to the right by s*(T-t1). So the new head = h + s*(T-t1), new tail = tau + s*(T-t1). The span is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] (since for right-moving, the head is at the right end and tail at the left? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: initial span is [tau, h] meaning tau is the left end and h the right end? But in the example for right-moving: they give (48,37,right,6) -> so head=48, tail=37? Then the car is from 37 to 48? Then at T, it becomes [37 + s*(T-t1), 48 + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut the problem states for right-moving: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: [h, tau] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\nIn the given data, all cars in this state are right-moving except that the first four freeways have negative head and tail? But they are labeled as \"right\". So that's consistent.\n\nNow, let's list the cars per freeway at turn t1=62:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: h=-48, tau=-71, d=right, s=24 -> span at t1: [-71, -48] (because for right, the span is [tau, h] = [-71, -48])\nFreeway 2: [-83, -48] (right, s=36)\nFreeway 3: same as 2: [-83, -48] (s=36)\nFreeway 4: same: [-83, -48] (s=36)\nFreeway 5: three cars: \n   car1: (48,37,right,6) -> [37,48]\n   car2: (12,1,right,6) -> [1,12]\n   car3: (-24,-35,right,6) -> [-35,-24]\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5: three cars: [37,48], [1,12], [-35,-24] (all right, s=6)\nFreeway 7: one car: (48,37,right,12) -> [37,48] (s=12)\nFreeway 8: one car: (48,37,right,4) -> [37,48] (s=4)\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway and each car, the times (relative to t1) when the car's span includes 0? Actually, we don't need the entire timeline, but we need to know for a given turn T (>=62) and a given freeway row, whether 0 is in the span of any car on that row at turn T.\n\nBut note: at turn T, the car positions are:\n  For a car: the span at T = [A + s*(T-62), B + s*(T-62)] for a right-moving car, where [A, B] is the initial span at t1 (with A=tail, B=head).\n\nSo 0 is in the span if:\n  A + s*(T-62) <= 0 <= B + s*(T-62)\n\nSimilarly for left-moving (but we don't have any).\n\nSo we can solve for T:\n\n  A + s*(T-62) <= 0 <= B + s*(T-62)\n\n=> \n  T >= ( -A ) / s + 62   [if s>0] for the left bound, and \n  T <= ( -B ) / s + 62   [if s>0] for the right bound? Actually, let me rearrange:\n\nFrom A + s*(T-62) <= 0 -> s*(T-62) <= -A -> T-62 <= -A/s -> T <= 62 - A/s   [if s>0, then dividing by positive s doesn't change inequality]\n\nWait: \n  A + s*(T-62) <= 0 \n  => s*(T-62) <= -A \n  => T-62 <= -A/s \n  => T <= 62 - A/s\n\nSimilarly, \n  0 <= B + s*(T-62) \n  => -s*(T-62) <= B \n  => T-62 >= -B/s \n  => T >= 62 - B/s\n\nSo 0 is in the span at T if:\n  62 - B/s <= T <= 62 - A/s\n\nBut note: because A < B (since tail A is left and head B is right). And s is positive.\n\nExample: freeway 5, car2: A=1, B=12, s=6.\n  Then T must be between: 62 - 12/6 = 62-2 = 60 and 62 - 1/6 = 61.833... -> so T in [60, 61.833]. Since T is integer, T=60,61,62? But wait: at T=62, we have the initial state. Let's check at T=62: \n      The car is at [1+0, 12+0] = [1,12] -> 0 is not in [1,12]. \n  Actually, the condition: 62 - 12/6 = 60, and 62 - 1/6 ≈ 61.833. So T must be an integer in [60, 61.833] -> T=60,61.\n\nBut wait, we are starting at T=62. So at T=60 and T=61 the car was covering 0? But we are at T>=62. So for this car, at T>=62, 0 is not covered? Because at T=62, the car is at [1,12] (which doesn't include 0) and then it moves to the right.\n\nBut note: the condition we derived: T must be between 62 - B/s and 62 - A/s. Since B/s and A/s are positive, then 62 - B/s < 62 and 62 - A/s < 62? So at T>=62, this car never covers 0? \n\nWait, let me check: at T=62: [1,12] -> no. Then at T=63: [1+6=7,12+6=18] -> no. So indeed, for this car, 0 is only covered at T=60 and 61? But we are at T=62, so we don't care.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5, car1: A=37, B=48, s=6 -> T must be between 62-48/6=62-8=54 and 62-37/6≈62-6.166≈55.833. So T=54,55? Then at T>=62, not covering 0.\n\nCar3: A=-35, B=-24, s=6 -> T between 62 - (-24)/6 = 62+4=66 and 62 - (-35)/6≈62+5.833≈67.833. So T=66,67.\n\nSo for freeway 5, the only car that will cover 0 in the future is car3 at T=66 and 67.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 6: same as freeway 5? So also car3 at T=66,67.\n\nNow freeway 1: car: A=-71, B=-48, s=24 -> T between 62 - (-48)/24 = 62+2=64 and 62 - (-71)/24≈62+2.958≈64.958. So T=64,65? (since integer)\n\nFreeway 2: A=-83, B=-48, s=36 -> T between 62 - (-48)/36 = 62+48/36=62+4/3≈62+1.333=63.333 and 62 - (-83)/36≈62+83/36≈62+2.305≈64.305. So T=64? (only 64 because 63.333 to 64.305 -> integers: T=64)\n\nBut wait: T must be integer. So for freeway2: T from 63.333 to 64.305 -> integers: T=64.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3 and 4: same as freeway2? So T=64.\n\nFreeway7: one car: A=37, B=48, s=12 -> T between 62-48/12=62-4=58 and 62-37/12≈62-3.083≈58.917. So T=58? (only 58) -> which is before 62, so not a problem.\n\nFreeway8: A=37, B=48, s=4 -> T between 62-48/4=62-12=50 and 62-37/4≈62-9.25=52.75. So T=50,51,52 -> before 62, so no problem.\n\nSo summarizing the dangerous times (for T>=62) per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: T=64,65\nFreeway 2: T=64\nFreeway 3: T=64\nFreeway 4: T=64\nFreeway 5: T=66,67   (from car3)\nFreeway 6: T=66,67   (from car3)\nFreeway 7: no danger at T>=62\nFreeway 8: no danger at T>=62\n\nBut note: freeway 5 and 6 have multiple cars. For freeway 5: we have car1, car2, car3. But only car3 is dangerous at T=66,67. Similarly for freeway6.\n\nSo the dangerous rows and turns:\n\nRow 1: dangerous at T=64,65\nRow 2: dangerous at T=64\nRow 3: dangerous at T=64\nRow 4: dangerous at T=64\nRow 5: dangerous at T=66,67\nRow 6: dangerous at T=66,67\n\nRows 7 and 8: safe at all T>=62.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn 62 at row 0. We want to reach row 9. We can move up, down, or stay. We must avoid being on a dangerous row at a dangerous turn.\n\nNote: the player is at row y at turn T if after T-62 moves (starting at 0) we are at row y. The moves occur at the end of the turn.\n\nAt turn T, the player has taken T-62 actions. Let me denote the turn index relative to t1: let t = T - 62. Then at relative turn t (starting at t=0 for T=62), the player is at row y_t.\n\nAt relative turn t, the absolute turn is T = 62+t.\n\nWe start at t=0: y0=0.\n\nWe want the smallest H such that at the end of H-1 moves (i.e., after H-1 actions) we are at y_{H-1}=9. The actions are taken at turns t=0,1,...,H-2? Actually, we have actions for t from 0 to H-1? But note: the sequence of actions is from turn t1 (62) to turn t1+H-1. After H actions (from t=0 to t=H-1) we have moved H steps, so we are at row y_H. But we require that at turn t1+H-1 (which is the last turn of the sequence) we are at 9. So actually, after H-1 actions? Let me see:\n\nAt the start of turn t1 (T=62): we are at (0,0). Then we choose a_{t1} (which is the action at turn t1). Then at the start of turn t1+1 (T=63): we are at y1 = 0 + delta(a_{t1}).\n\nSo after one action (at the end of turn t1) we are at y1.\n\nAfter H-1 actions (from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2) we are at y_{H-1}. But we want at the start of turn t1+H-1? Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we take H actions? Then we have H moves? Then we end at y_{t1+H}? But we want to reach (0,9) at the last turn of the sequence? \n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". Let me read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nNote: the action at turn t1+t is taken at turn t1+t, and then the next state is y_{t1+t+1}. So:\n\nAt turn t1 (t=0): action a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1: y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + delta(a_{t1})\n\nAt turn t1+1 (t=1): action a_{t1+1} -> then at turn t1+2: y_{t1+2}\n\n...\n\nAt turn t1+H-1 (t=H-1): action a_{t1+H-1} -> then at turn t1+H: y_{t1+H} \n\nBut the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). That means that at the start of turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). However, note that the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". And the action at that turn is taken, but then we move to y_{t1+H}. So actually, we want the position at the beginning of the turn to be (0,9) and then we take an action? But then we would move away. Or does the game end as soon as we are at (0,9)? \n\nLooking at the problem: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1. And the sequence of actions is for turns from t1 to t1+H-1. So the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and at that turn we are at (0,9). But note: at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, the player is at the position from the previous turn. Then we take the action and move to a new position. So to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, we must be at (0,9) at the beginning of that turn? \n\nBut the problem says: \"the player is at (0, y_{t}) at turn t\". So at turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0, y_{t1+H-1}) and we want y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nHow do we achieve that? \n\nAt the beginning of turn t1 (t1=62): we are at (0,0). Then we take an action and move to a new position at the beginning of turn t1+1.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t1, we are at y_{t1}=0.\nAt the beginning of turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + delta(a_{t1}).\n\nTherefore, at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nThat means we have taken (H-1) - 1? Wait: from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, there are (t1+H-1) - t1 = H-1 turns. But we start at turn t1 (with position) and then we take H-1 actions (at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2) to get to the position at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut the sequence of actions is given for t from 0 to H-1: that means we take H actions? Then we would have H moves? Then the position at turn t1+H would be the result.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} (so t=0,...,H-1: H actions) and we want y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nNote: the action a_{t1+t} is taken at turn t1+t, which affects the next state: so the state at turn t1+t+1 is determined by a_{t1+t}. \n\nTherefore, the state at turn t1+H is determined by the last action a_{t1+H-1}. But we want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9. \n\nThis implies that the action a_{t1+H-1} is taken at turn t1+H-1, but it does not change the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. The state at turn t1+H-1 is the result of the previous actions.\n\nSo we have:\n\nTurn t1 (62): state y_{62} = 0 (given)\nAfter action a_{62}: y_{63} = y_{62} + delta(a_{62})\n...\nAfter action a_{62+H-2}: y_{62+H-1} = y_{62+H-2} + delta(a_{62+H-2})\nThen at turn t1+H-1 = 62+H-1, we are at y_{62+H-1} = 9.\n\nWe do not take an action at turn 62+H-1? But the sequence includes an action for turn 62+H-1? \n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1: so the actions are for turns 62, 63, ..., 62+H-1. That means we take H actions. Then the state at turn 62+H is determined by the last action. But we want the state at turn 62+H-1 to be 9.\n\nThis is inconsistent. \n\nLooking back at the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning that we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the state at turn t1+H is the result of the last action. But we require the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9. \n\nSo the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9? Then we take an action and move to 10? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take H-1 actions? But the sequence is indexed from t=0 to H-1, which is H actions.\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd then \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nThis suggests that after H-1 actions (from t=0 to H-2) we are at 9? But the sequence has H actions (t=0 to H-1). \n\nAlternatively, note that the player update: at turn t, we are at position y_t, then we choose action a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1} = y_t + delta(a_t). So the action at turn t causes the move at the end of turn t to y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, to be at position 9 at turn t1+H-1, we have:\n\ny_{t1+H-1} = 9\n\nBut y_{t1+H-1} is the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. How did we get there? By the action taken at turn t1+H-2. \n\nThe action at turn t1+H-1 would then be taken at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we move to y_{t1+H} = 9 + delta(a_{t1+H-1}). \n\nBut we don't care about that because we only require to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\nSo the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1. But the last action (at turn t1+H-1) does not affect the position at turn t1+H-1, but it is taken. However, the problem only requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). The action at that turn can be arbitrary? But we have to avoid collision on the row we are on at that turn? \n\nAt turn t1+H-1, we are at row 9. Row 9 is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8), so no collision. Then we can choose any action? But the problem says we only care about collisions on freeways. So at row 9, we are safe.\n\nTherefore, we can include an action at turn t1+H-1 even though we are already at 9. But note: the minimal H would be the minimal number of turns we take actions until we are at 9 at the beginning of that turn.\n\nHow many actions do we need? We start at 0. To get to 9, we need at least 9 moves upward. But we can also move down and then up? But minimal would be 9 upward moves. However, we might have to wait (stay) to avoid collisions.\n\nThe minimal H would be the number of turns we take actions, and we are at 9 at the beginning of the H-th turn? \n\nLet me define:\n\nTurn index: T (absolute) = 62, 63, ...\nAt T=62: y62=0\nAfter action a62: y63 = y62 + delta(a62)\n...\nAfter action a_{62+k-1}: y_{62+k} = ...\n\nWe want y_{62+H-1} = 9.\n\nThe actions taken are from T=62 to T=62+H-2? Then we take H-1 actions? But the problem says the sequence has H actions: from t=0 to H-1, so absolute turns 62,63,...,62+H-1.\n\nBut then the state at turn 62+H-1 is determined by the first H-1 actions. The last action (at turn 62+H-1) would then determine y_{62+H}. \n\nSo to have y_{62+H-1}=9, we must have that after H-1 actions (at turns 62 to 62+H-2) we are at 9 at the beginning of turn 62+H-1. Then we take an action at turn 62+H-1 (which is the H-th action) and then we move to y_{62+H}=9+delta(a_{62+H-1}). \n\nBut we don't care where we go after, as long as at turn 62+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H must be at least 10: because we start at 0 and need to get to 9, which takes at least 9 moves (so 9 actions). Then we have the 10th action at the turn when we are already at 9? \n\nBut note: at the beginning of turn 62, we are at 0. Then we take 9 upward moves: \n\nTurn 62: U -> at turn 63: y=1\nTurn 63: U -> turn64: y=2\n...\nTurn 70: U -> turn71: y=9\n\nSo at turn 71, we are at y=9. Then we require that the sequence of actions is for turns 62 to 71? That would be 10 actions (t=0 to 9). And H=10? Then we have y_{62+10-1}=y_{71}=9.\n\nSo H=10.\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions. In this 10-step plan, we go:\n\nTurn62: at row0 -> safe (freeways start at row1)\nThen at turn63: row1 -> check freeway1 at turn63: is it dangerous? We have freeway1 dangerous at T=64,65 -> at T=63, freeway1: the car is at [-71+24*(63-62)= -71+24=-47, -48+24=-24] -> so [-47,-24] -> 0 not in there? So safe.\n\nTurn64: row2 -> freeway2 at turn64: dangerous? Yes, freeway2 is dangerous at T=64. So we cannot be on row2 at turn64.\n\nTherefore, we cannot do the naive 9-ups in 9 moves (which would have us at row2 at turn64).\n\nWe need to avoid being on row2 at turn64. Similarly, row1,3,4 at turn64? Actually, row2,3,4 are dangerous at turn64? But we are going sequentially: at turn64 we would be on row2? So we must avoid that.\n\nSo we must adjust.\n\nWe need to plan a path that avoids:\n\n- On row1 at turn64? Actually, row1 is dangerous at T=64 and 65. But we might pass row1 at turn63? which is safe. Then row2 at turn64: dangerous.\n\nSo we can try to delay or speed up? \n\nWe start at row0 at turn62.\n\nWe can only move up, down, or stay.\n\nWe need to be at row9 at some turn T (>=62+9=71, since minimal 9 moves).\n\nWe must avoid:\n\n- row1 at turns 64,65\n- row2 at turn64\n- row3 at turn64\n- row4 at turn64\n- row5 at turns66,67\n- row6 at turns66,67\n\nAnd rows7,8 are safe at all times.\n\nWe can consider the timeline of the player:\n\nLet t be the number of turns after t1 (so at t=0: T=62, y=0)\n\nWe want y_t for t=0,1,2,... \n\nConstraints:\n\nAt a given relative turn t, the absolute turn T = 62+t.\n\nWe must avoid:\n\nIf y_t = 1, then T should not be 64 or 65 -> i.e., t not in {2,3} (because T=62+t: 62+t=64 => t=2; 62+t=65 => t=3)\nIf y_t = 2, then T should not be 64 -> t != 2\nIf y_t = 3, then t != 2\nIf y_t = 4, then t != 2\nIf y_t = 5, then T should not be 66 or 67 -> t not in {4,5}\nIf y_t = 6, then t not in {4,5}\n\nWe are free at t=0: y0=0 (safe)\n\nWe need to get to y_t=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nThe minimal t such that y_t=9: we need to have moved up 9 times. The minimal t is 9 (if we move up every turn: then at t=9, we are at y9=9). But we have constraints at t=2,3,4,5.\n\nAt t=2 (T=64): we must not be on rows 1,2,3,4.\nAt t=3 (T=65): we must not be on row1.\nAt t=4 (T=66): we must not be on rows5,6.\nAt t=5 (T=67): we must not be on rows5,6.\n\nWe can try to plan:\n\nt0: y0=0 -> safe\nt1: we choose an action: U, D, or S.\n\nWe want to avoid being at rows1-4 at t=2 and row1 at t=3, and rows5-6 at t=4,5.\n\nWe have to get to 9 by minimal t.\n\nWe can try to simulate:\n\nOption 1: go up as fast as possible, but avoid the dangerous spots.\n\nAt t0: at 0 -> move up to 1 at t1? \n  Then at t1: y1=1 -> safe (because T=63: freeway1 at T=63: car at freeway1: [-71+24*1 = -47, -48+24=-24] -> 0 not in [-47,-24] -> safe)\nAt t1: we are at 1. Then at t2 (T=64): we must not be at 1,2,3,4. So we cannot move up to 2 (because then at t2 we are at 2 -> dangerous). We cannot stay at 1 (dangerous). We can move down to 0? \n  Action at t1: D -> then at t2: y2=0 -> safe (row0 is safe)\nAt t2: we are at 0. Then at t2: we can choose: \n  We want to get to 9. We are at 0 at t2 (T=64). Now at t3 (T=65): we must not be at row1. \n  We can move up to 1 at t3? \n      But T=65: row1 is dangerous? Yes, so we cannot be at row1 at T=65. \n  So we must avoid being at row1 at t3. \n  Then we can stay at 0? or move down? but we are at 0, so down is not possible? Actually, the update: if at 0 and choose D, we stay at 0? Or the problem says y_{t+1} in [0,9]? So if we are at 0 and choose D, we stay at 0? Similarly for U at 9.\n\nSo at t2 (at 0): \n  We can choose S -> then at t3: y3=0 -> safe (row0)\n  Or D -> same as S? \n  Or U -> then at t3: y3=1 -> but T=65: row1 is dangerous? So we cannot.\n\nTherefore, at t2 we must choose S or D (so stay at 0) to avoid being at 1 at t3.\n\nThen at t3: we are at 0. Then at t3 (T=65): we are safe. Then we can move up at t3: to 1 at t4? \n  T=66: row1? But row1 is only dangerous at T=64,65. T=66 is safe for row1? \n      Freeway1: at T=66: the car is at [-71+24*(66-62)= -71+96=25, -48+96=48] -> [25,48] -> 0 not in there -> safe.\n  So at t4: y4=1 -> safe.\n\nBut now we are at t4 (T=66) at row1. Then we want to move up. But at t4 (T=66): we must not be on row5 or 6? But we are on row1, so safe.\n\nNow we have to get from row1 at t4 to row9. We have 5 more rows to go: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 -> 8 rows? But we are at 1, so we need 8 moves? \n\nBut at t4 we are at row1. The next moves:\n\nt4: at row1 -> move up to row2 at t5? \n  Then at t5 (T=67): we are at row2 -> check: row2 dangerous at T=67? \n      Freeway2: at T=67: the car is at [-83+36*(67-62)= -83+36*5= -83+180=97, -48+180=132] -> [97,132] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n      Also, row2 is only dangerous at T=64? so safe.\n\nThen we can continue: \nt5: row2 -> move up to row3 at t6 (T=68): safe? \nt6: row3 -> move up to row4 at t7 (T=69): safe? \nt7: row4 -> move up to row5 at t8 (T=70): \n      Now, row5 is dangerous at T=66,67? T=70 is safe. \n      Freeway5: car3: at T=70: [-35+6*(70-62)= -35+48=13, -24+48=24] -> [13,24] -> 0 not in -> safe.\nt8: row5 -> move up to row6 at t9 (T=71): \n      row6: dangerous at T=66,67? T=71: safe. \n      Freeway6: same as freeway5? car3: [13,24] -> safe.\nt9: row6 -> move up to row7 at t10 (T=72): safe (row7 always safe)\nt10: row7 -> move up to row8 at t11 (T=73): safe\nt11: row8 -> move up to row9 at t12 (T=74): we are at row9 at turn T=74? \n\nBut we are at row9 at t12? Then we require y_{t12}=9 at turn 62+12=74.\n\nBut is that minimal? We started at t0=62, and we are at 9 at turn 74? Then H is the number of turns in the sequence: from t1=62 to t1+H-1 = 74? So 62+H-1=74 -> H=13.\n\nBut we could be faster.\n\nAlternatively, after the first delay, we might speed up. \n\nWe were at t3: at row0. Then we moved up to row1 at t4 (T=66). Then we moved up every turn until row9 at t12 (T=74). \n\nBut we can try to move faster: at t3 we are at 0. Instead of moving up to 1 at t4, we can move up twice? But we can only do one action per turn.\n\nWe have lost 2 turns: at t1 we moved down (from 1 to 0) and then at t2 and t3 we stayed? Actually, at t1: we moved down to 0 at t2. Then at t2 we did nothing (so stayed at 0 at t3). Then at t3 we moved up to 1 at t4. So from t0 to t4: we only advanced 1 row.\n\nBut we need 9 rows. So total turns: 4 (to get to row1) then 8 more to get to row9? 12 moves? Then at t12 we are at row9. Then H=13 (since we take 13 actions: from turn62 to turn74).\n\nBut we might avoid the delay by taking a different path.\n\nAlternative plan: at t0: we start at 0. Instead of moving up at t0, we stay? \n\nt0: S -> then at t1: y1=0 (safe)\nt1: then we can move up to 1 at t2? but t2 is T=64 -> row1 is dangerous. So we cannot.\n\nOr at t0: move up to 1 at t1 (T=63) -> safe as before.\nThen at t1: we are at 1. Instead of moving down, we stay? \n  Action at t1: S -> then at t2: y2=1 -> but T=64: row1 is dangerous -> collision. So we cannot stay.\n\nSo we must leave row1 at t1? We can only move down to 0 at t2? Then we are safe at t2 (row0). Then same as before.\n\nSo we cannot avoid the delay at the beginning.\n\nBut what if we move up twice quickly? \n\nt0: U -> t1:1 (safe at T=63)\nt1: U -> t2:2 (at T=64: row2 is dangerous) -> collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nWhat if we go up to 1 at t1 (T=63: safe), then at t1 we go down to 0 at t2 (T=64: safe at row0). Then at t2: we are at 0. Then we need to avoid row1 at t3 (T=65: dangerous). So we cannot go up at t2. Then at t2 we stay at 0 at t3. Then at t3 (T=65) we are at 0 -> safe. Then at t3: we move up to 1 at t4 (T=66: safe for row1). Then we are at 1 at t4.\n\nNow, we are at row1 at t4 (T=66). Then we want to get to 9 as fast as possible. But we must avoid rows5 and 6 at t4 and t5? But at t4 we are at row1, so safe. At t5 we can be at row2 (if we move up at t4). Then at t5 (T=67) we are at row2: safe (since row2 only dangerous at T=64). Then we can move up to row3 at t6 (T=68), row4 at t7 (T=69), row5 at t8 (T=70): safe for row5 (because row5 dangerous at 66,67; T=70 is safe). Then row6 at t9 (T=71): safe. Then row7 at t10 (T=72), row8 at t11 (T=73), row9 at t12 (T=74). \n\nSo we get to row9 at t12 (relative turn 12, absolute turn 74). Then H=13: because we take 13 actions (from turn62 to turn74) and at turn74 we are at row9.\n\nBut note: the sequence has H actions: from t1=62 to t1+H-1=74 -> 74-62+1 = 13 actions. And H=13.\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nWe are forced to wait at the beginning for 2 turns (from t2 to t3 we are stuck at 0). Then we move up. Total time: 12 steps to go from 0 to 9? But we only advanced 1 row in the first 4 turns? Then 8 rows in 8 turns? Total 12 turns? Then the state at t12 is row9.\n\nBut minimal without obstacles is 9 turns. We lost 3 turns? Actually, we spent 4 turns to get from 0 to 1 (which normally takes 1 turn). So we lost 3 turns.\n\nWe might try to go down? but we are at 0, we cannot go below 0.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid row1 at the critical times by being on a different row? But we start at 0 and must go up.\n\nAnother idea: at the beginning, we stay at 0 for more turns? \n\nt0: S -> y1=0 at t1 (T=63: safe)\nt1: S -> y2=0 at t2 (T=64: safe at row0)\nt2: then at t2 (T=64) we are at 0. Now we can move up to 1 at t3? but T=65: row1 is dangerous -> not allowed.\nSo we must stay at 0 at t3: \n  t2: S -> y3=0 at t3 (T=65: safe)\nt3: then at t3: we can move up to 1 at t4 (T=66: safe for row1) -> same as before.\n\nSo we are still at row1 at t4.\n\nBut now we used 4 turns to stay at 0? Then we are even slower.\n\nWe can try to move up at t2? \n\nt0: S -> t1:0\nt1: S -> t2:0\nt2: U -> t3:1 (T=65: row1 dangerous) -> not allowed.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nTherefore, the only safe way is to be at row0 at t3 (T=65). Then we move up at t3 to row1 at t4 (T=66).\n\nThen we have to traverse from row1 to row9. We do that in 8 moves: \n  t4: row1 -> row2 at t5 (T=67: safe for row2)\n  t5: row2 -> row3 at t6 (T=68)\n  t6: row3 -> row4 at t7 (T=69)\n  t7: row4 -> row5 at t8 (T=70: safe for row5, because dangerous at 66,67)\n  t8: row5 -> row6 at t9 (T=71: safe for row6)\n  t9: row6 -> row7 at t10 (T=72)\n  t10: row7 -> row8 at t11 (T=73)\n  t11: row8 -> row9 at t12 (T=74)\n\nSo we are at row9 at t12. \n\nTotal relative turns: 12. Then the absolute turn: 62+12=74. \n\nThe sequence of actions: 13 actions? Because we take an action at each turn from 62 to 74 (inclusive). The turns: 62,63,...,74 -> 13 turns.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1. We want at turn t1+H-1=74 we are at 9. So 62+H-1=74 -> H=13.\n\nSo the minimal H is 13.\n\nNow, we need to write the actions:\n\nAt turn62 (t0): we started at 0. We did: \n  t0: U -> to 1 at t1? But in the first plan we did U at t0? Then we had to go down. But then we ended up with the same as above? \n\nWait, let me recount the first plan:\n\nPlan A:\n  t0 (62): U -> y63=1\n  t1 (63): D -> y64=0   [because from 1 down to 0]\n  t2 (64): S (or D) -> y65=0\n  t3 (65): U -> y66=1\n  t4 (66): U -> y67=2\n  t5 (67): U -> y68=3\n  t6 (68): U -> y69=4\n  t7 (69): U -> y70=5\n  t8 (70): U -> y71=6\n  t9 (71): U -> y72=7\n  t10(72): U -> y73=8\n  t11(73): U -> y74=9\n\nAt turn74 (t12): we are at 9. Then we have taken 12 actions? But we have 12 actions? The sequence is from turn62 to turn73? But we require to be at 9 at turn74, which is the beginning of turn74, which is the result of the action at turn73. \n\nBut the sequence of actions is for turns 62 to 73? That is 12 actions. Then H would be 12? But then the last turn in the sequence is turn73, and we are at 9 at turn74? But we require at turn t1+H-1 = 62+12-1=73 we are at 9? \n\nNo, we are at 9 at turn74. \n\nWe need to be at 9 at turn73? Then we would have taken 11 actions: \n  If we are at 9 at turn73 (which is the result of the action at turn72), then we take an action at turn73? But we are already at 9.\n\nSo to be at 9 at turn73, we would have:\n\n  ... \n  t10 (72): U -> y73=9\n\nThen at turn73 (absolute) we are at 9. Then the sequence of actions would be 12 actions: from turn62 to turn73? Then H=12, and at turn73 (t1+H-1=62+12-1=73) we are at 9.\n\nBut in our plan, we are at 9 at turn74, not turn73.\n\nCan we get to 9 by turn73? \n\nRelative turn: t=11 (because 73-62=11). So we need to go from 0 to 9 in 11 moves? That is possible: 9 ups and 2 non-ups? But we had to wait at the beginning.\n\nIn our plan, at turn73 (t11) we are at 8? Then we move up at turn73 to 9 at turn74.\n\nBut we want to be at 9 at turn73. So we must get to 9 at the beginning of turn73.\n\nThat means we must have taken 11 actions? The actions from turn62 to turn72: 11 actions. Then at turn73 we are at 9.\n\nBut in our path, we were at row8 at turn73? How can we get to row9 at turn73? \n\nWe need to advance one more row. But we were at row1 at turn66 (t4). Then we need 8 more rows? That takes 8 moves? So from t4 to t12? That would be 8 moves? So we get to row9 at t12 (turn74). \n\nBut if we start from row1 at t4, and we do 7 moves? Then we would be at row8 at t11 (turn73). Then to get to row9 at turn73, we would have to be at row9 at the beginning of turn73? That would require the action at turn72 to take us to row9. But then we are at row9 at turn73? \n\nBut we were at row8 at turn72? Then we move up at turn72 to row9 at turn73.\n\nBut in our plan, we were at row8 at turn73? Let me re-index:\n\nIn the plan above:\n\nAt t4 (relative turn4, absolute66): row1\nt5 (67): row2\nt6 (68): row3\nt7 (69): row4\nt8 (70): row5\nt9 (71): row6\nt10(72): row7\nt11(73): row8 -> at turn73 (absolute) we are at row8? Then we do an action at turn73: U -> then at turn74 we are at row9.\n\nBut we want to be at row9 at turn73? So we need to be at row9 at the beginning of turn73, which means we must have gotten there by the action at turn72.\n\nSo we need to be at row8 at turn72? Then move up to row9 at turn73.\n\nBut in our plan, we are at row7 at turn72? \n\nWe can try to accelerate: move up every turn from t4 to t11? \n\nt4 (66): row1 -> U -> t5: row2\nt5 (67): row2 -> U -> t6: row3\nt6 (68): row3 -> U -> t7: row4\nt7 (69): row4 -> U -> t8: row5\nt8 (70): row5 -> U -> t9: row6\nt9 (71): row6 -> U -> t10: row7\nt10(72): row7 -> U -> t11: row8\nt11(73): row8 -> U -> t12: row9\n\nBut we are at row9 at turn74.\n\nTo be at row9 at turn73, we need to be at row9 at the beginning of turn73. That means we must have taken an action at turn72 that brought us to row9. So we must have been at row8 at turn72? \n\nBut in the above, at turn72 (t10) we are at row7. Then we move up to row8 at turn73? \n\nSo we are one row behind.\n\nHow to gain one row? We cannot move faster than one row per turn.\n\nUnless we start earlier? But we are delayed at the beginning.\n\nAlternative: at the beginning, we do not move up immediately? \n\nt0 (62): S -> y63=0\nt1 (63): S -> y64=0\nt2 (64): S -> y65=0\nt3 (65): U -> y66=1   [now at row1 at T=66]\nThen we need to go from row1 to row9 in 7 moves? \n  That would be: 8 moves? 7 moves: row1 to row8? then 8th move to row9 at turn74.\n\nBut we want to be at row9 at turn73? That would require 7 moves from row1 to row9? which is impossible (minimal 8 moves).\n\nSo we cannot get to row9 at turn73.\n\nTherefore, the earliest we can be at row9 is turn74.\n\nThen we have 13 actions: from turn62 to turn74? \n\nBut the last action is at turn74? and then we are at row9 at turn75? But we want to be at row9 at turn74.\n\nWe must be at row9 at the beginning of turn74. That means the action at turn73 must have brought us to row9.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nActions at turns: 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73. That is 12 actions? Then at turn74 we are at row9? But we are not at row9 at turn73? \n\nWe want y_{t1+H-1}=9. If H=13, then we are at turn62+12=74? and y74=9.\n\nBut how do we get to y74=9? \n\nThe action at turn73: we were at y73=8, then we move up to y74=9.\n\nSo the action at turn73 is U.\n\nBut the sequence has 13 actions: from turn62 to turn74? That is 13 actions. Then the last action is at turn74. But then y75 = y74 + delta(a74). We want y74=9, so we don't care about a74? But we have to include it? \n\nBut the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. If H=13, then we are at turn62+12=74. So we are at y74=9. The action at turn74 is taken after we are already at 9? \n\nBut the problem says: we take actions from turn62 to turn74 (13 actions) and at turn74 we are at 9.\n\nBut the action at turn74 is taken at the beginning of turn74? Then we move to y75 = 9 + delta(a74). So we are not at 9 at the end of the sequence? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me re-read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nThe last action is a_{t1+H-1} = a_{62+H-1}. \n\nAt the beginning of turn t1+H-1 (62+H-1), we are at y_{t1+H-1}. Then we take action a_{t1+H-1}, and then we move to y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + delta(a_{t1+H-1}).\n\nBut we require y_{t1+H-1}=9. So we are at 9 at the beginning of turn 62+H-1. Then we take an action, and then we move to 9+delta(a). \n\nThe problem does not require us to stay at 9, only to reach it at that turn. So it's acceptable.\n\nBut then the action at turn62+H-1 can be anything? and we don't care about the next state.\n\nIn our plan, we are at 9 at turn74. So 62+H-1=74 -> H=13.\n\nThen the sequence has 13 actions: for t=0 to 12: \n  t=0: turn62\n  t=1: turn63\n  ...\n  t=12: turn74\n\nBut at turn74 (the last action), we are at y74=9 at the beginning? Then we take an action a74. We can choose S, for example, to stay at 9.\n\nBut note: at turn74, we are at row9, which is safe. So we can choose any action.\n\nNow, let's write the entire sequence:\n\nWe have two ways to do the beginning:\n\nOption A:\n  turn62 (t0): U -> to 1 at turn63\n  turn63 (t1): D -> to 0 at turn64\n  turn64 (t2): S -> to 0 at turn65\n  turn65 (t3): U -> to 1 at turn66\n  turn66 (t4): U -> to 2 at turn67\n  turn67 (t5): U -> to 3 at turn68\n  turn68 (t6): U -> to 4 at turn69\n  turn69 (t7): U -> to 5 at turn70\n  turn70 (t8): U -> to 6 at turn71\n  turn71 (t9): U -> to 7 at turn72\n  turn72 (t10): U -> to 8 at turn73\n  turn73 (t11): U -> to 9 at turn74\n  turn74 (t12): S (or any) -> then to 9 at turn75 (but we don't care)\n\nBut wait: at turn74 (absolute) we are at the beginning at y74? How did we get there? By the action at turn73: U from 8 to 9.\n\nThen at turn74, we take an action (say S) and then y75=9.\n\nBut we require that at turn74 (which is t1+H-1=62+13-1=74) we are at 9. We are at 9 at the beginning of turn74, so that satisfies.\n\nBut note: the action at turn74 is included, and it doesn't cause a collision because we are at row9.\n\nSo the sequence of actions for 13 turns:\n\nturn62: U\nturn63: D\nturn64: S\nturn65: U\nturn66: U\nturn67: U\nturn68: U\nturn69: U\nturn70: U\nturn71: U\nturn72: U\nturn73: U\nturn74: S\n\nBut we can also do at turn74: U -> then we go to 10? But that is invalid? The problem says y in [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and choose U, then we should stay at 9? Or the problem says: \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\". So it's bounded. So we stay at 9. Similarly for D at 0.\n\nSo we can choose U, D, or S at turn74. We'll choose S to be safe.\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence? We have 13 actions. But we might avoid the last action? \n\nIf we set H=12, then we take actions from turn62 to turn73 (12 actions). Then we want y_{62+12-1}=y_{73}=9. \n\nBut in our plan, at turn73 we are at 8. So we are not at 9.\n\nCan we get to 9 by turn73? \n\nWe were at row1 at turn66 (t4). Then we need 8 more moves to get to row9. 8 moves from t4 to t12? But t12 is turn74. \n\nAlternatively, we might try to be at row1 earlier? But we cannot because of the danger at turn64 and 65.\n\nAt the beginning, we might move up to row1 at turn63 (t1) as before, then we have to go down to 0 at turn64 (t2) to avoid danger. Then at turn64 (t2) we are at 0. Then we cannot move up at turn64 (t2) because then at turn65 (t3) we would be at 1 (dangerous). So we stay at 0 at turn65 (t3). Then at turn65 (t3) we move up to 1 at turn66 (t4). Then from there we move up as fast as possible: 8 moves to get to 9 at turn74 (t12). \n\nSo we cannot get to 9 before turn74.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 13.\n\nNow, we have to write the sequence.\n\nBut note: at turn64 (t2) we are at 0. We did S (stay) so that at turn65 (t3) we are at 0. Then at turn65 (t3) we move up to 1 at turn66 (t4).\n\nBut we could do D at turn64? That would also keep us at 0 at turn65.\n\nSo we can choose either S or D at turn64 and turn65? But at turn64 we are at 0: if we choose D, we stay at 0. Similarly for S.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nturn62: U\nturn63: D   (from 1 to 0)\nturn64: S   (or D, same) -> stay at 0\nturn65: U   (from 0 to 1)\nturn66: U   (1->2)\nturn67: U   (2->3)\nturn68: U   (3->4)\nturn69: U   (4->5)\nturn70: U   (5->6)\nturn71: U   (6->7)\nturn72: U   (7->8)\nturn73: U   (8->9)\nturn74: S   (or U or D, but we stay at 9)\n\nBut at turn74, we are at 9 at the beginning, and we do S, which is safe.\n\nNow, we must check for collisions at every step:\n\nTurn62: T=62, y=0 -> safe (not on freeway)\nAfter action U: at turn63, y=1.\n\nTurn63: T=63, y=1 -> freeway1: car at [-71+24*(63-62)= -47, -24] -> 0 not in [-47,-24] -> safe.\nAction: D -> to 0 at turn64.\n\nTurn64: T=64, y=0 -> safe.\nAction: S -> to 0 at turn65.\n\nTurn65: T=65, y=0 -> safe.\nAction: U -> to 1 at turn66.\n\nTurn66: T=66, y=1 -> freeway1: car at [-71+24*(66-62)= -71+96=25, -48+96=48] -> [25,48] -> 0 not in -> safe.\nAction: U -> to 2 at turn67.\n\nTurn67: T=67, y=2 -> freeway2: car at [-83+36*(67-62)= -83+180=97, -48+180=132] -> [97,132] -> 0 not in -> safe.\nAction: U -> to 3 at turn68.\n\nTurn68: T=68, y=3 -> freeway3: car at [-83+36*(68-62)= -83+216=133, -48+216=168] -> safe.\nAction: U -> to 4 at turn69.\n\nTurn69: T=69, y=4 -> freeway4: car at [-83+36*7= -83+252=169, -48+252=204] -> safe.\nAction: U -> to 5 at turn70.\n\nTurn70: T=70, y=5 -> freeway5: three cars. Check if any car covers 0.\n  car1: [37+6*(70-62)=37+48=85, 48+48=96] -> [85,96] -> no\n  car2: [1+48=49,12+48=60] -> no\n  car3: [-35+48=13, -24+48=24] -> [13,24] -> no\n  safe.\nAction: U -> to 6 at turn71.\n\nTurn71: T=71, y=6 -> freeway6: same as freeway5? [13,24] for car3 -> safe.\nAction: U -> to 7 at turn72.\n\nTurn72: T=72, y=7 -> freeway7: car at [37+12*(72-62)=37+120=157,48+120=168] -> safe.\nAction: U -> to 8 at turn73.\n\nTurn73: T=73, y=8 -> freeway8: car at [37+4*(73-62)=37+44=81,48+44=92] -> safe.\nAction: U -> to 9 at turn74.\n\nNow, at turn74: T=74, y=9 -> safe (not a freeway). Then we do action S (or whatever) -> stays at 9.\n\nSo the sequence is valid.\n\nBut we have 13 actions. The last action at turn74 is necessary because the sequence must have H=13 actions. And we are at 9 at turn74 (the beginning) which is t1+H-1=62+13-1=74.\n\nTherefore, the answer.\n\nWe can also avoid the down at turn63? \n\nAlternative beginning: \n  turn62: S -> stay at 0 at turn63.\n  turn63: S -> stay at 0 at turn64.\n  turn64: S -> stay at 0 at turn65.\n  turn65: U -> to 1 at turn66.\n  then same as before.\n\nThis also works and is the same from turn66 onward. \n\nBut it takes the same number of turns? We are at row1 at turn66 in both. Then we do 8 ups to get to row9 at turn74.\n\nBut we did not move at turn62 and turn63? So we have:\n\n  turn62: S\n  turn63: S\n  turn64: S\n  turn65: U\n  turn66: U\n  ... same as before.\n\nThen at turn74: we do the last U to get to 9? Then turn74: we do S.\n\nBut we still have 13 actions.\n\nWhich one is better? Both are minimal. We can choose either.\n\nBut the first one (moving up at turn62) might be more efficient in some sense? But both are 13.\n\nWe can choose the one that moves up first.\n\nBut the problem: minimal number of turns H. Both are 13.\n\nSo we can output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 62: U\nTurn 63: D\nTurn 64: S\nTurn 65: U\nTurn 66: U\nTurn 67: U\nTurn 68: U\nTurn 69: U\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: U\nTurn 72: U\nTurn 73: U\nTurn 74: S\n}\n\nBut note: at turn63 we did D. We could have done S at turn64? But we did D at turn63 to get back to 0. Then at turn64 we did S to stay at 0. We could have done D at turn64? But same effect.\n\nBut in the answer, we have to specify.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  turn62: U\n  turn63: D\n  turn64: D   (still at 0)\n  turn65: U\n  ... \n\nBut that is the same.\n\nWe can also avoid the down and use stays? But we have to leave row1 at turn63? The only way is to go down to 0.\n\nSo the above sequence is valid.\n\nBut wait: at turn63 we did D from row1 to row0. Then at turn64 we are at 0. Then at turn64 we do S: stay at 0. Then at turn65 we do U: to 1.\n\nWe can combine: at turn64, if we do U, then we would go to 1 at turn65? But turn65 is dangerous for row1. So we cannot.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is fixed.\n\nBut note: at turn74 we do S. We could do U or D, but since we are at 9, we can choose any. We choose S.\n\nSo the final answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 62\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 13. The sequence of actions is designed to navigate around dangerous rows at critical turns:\n\n- Rows 1, 2, 3, and 4 are dangerous at turn 64 (absolute turn 62 + 2).\n- Row 1 is dangerous at turn 65 (absolute turn 62 + 3).\n- Rows 5 and 6 are dangerous at turns 66 and 67 (absolute turns 62 + 4 and 62 + 5).\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 0\\) (safe) at turn 62. The sequence avoids the dangerous rows at the specified turns by:\n- Moving up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 63, which is safe for row 1 at that turn.\n- Moving down to \\(y = 0\\) at turn 64 to avoid rows 1–4 at turn 64.\n- Staying at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 65 to avoid row 1 at turn 65.\n- Moving up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 66, which is now safe for row 1.\n- Moving up consecutively from turn 66 to turn 73 to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 74, avoiding rows 5 and 6 at turns 66 and 67 by being on lower rows, and rows 7 and 8 are safe at all turns.\n- The action at turn 74 is \"S\" (stay) since the player is already at \\(y = 9\\), and no further movement is needed.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 62: U \\\\\nTurn 63: D \\\\\nTurn 64: S \\\\\nTurn 65: U \\\\\nTurn 66: U \\\\\nTurn 67: U \\\\\nTurn 68: U \\\\\nTurn 69: U \\\\\nTurn 70: U \\\\\nTurn 71: U \\\\\nTurn 72: U \\\\\nTurn 73: U \\\\\nTurn 74: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn 64 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollisions happen only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span is the position of the car on the x-axis, but since the player is always at x=0, we care about when the car covers x=0.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t1=64, and we need to find where they are at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their states at turn 64.\n\nFor each freeway k from 1 to 8:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head h=0, tail τ=-23, direction right, speed s=24. Since it's right-moving, span is [τ, h] = [-23, 0] at turn 64.\n\nDirection right means it's moving to the right, so at time t, position increases.\n\nIn the update:\n\nLeft-moving: span moves left, so h and τ decrease.\n\nRight-moving: span moves right, so h and τ increase.\n\nFor freeway 1: right-moving, so at turn T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-23 + 24(T-64), 0 + 24(T-64)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision when player is on y=k at turn T, and for that k, 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway.\n\nAlso, note that if you move to a new y at turn T, you are not on that new y until the next turn? Let me read carefully.\n\n\"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_{T} at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, you are on y_T. If you choose an action that changes y, at turn T you are still on y_T, and only move to y_{T+1} at the start of turn T+1. So for collision at turn T, it's based on y_T and the cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nWhen you are on y at turn T, you check if for that y, at turn T, 0 is in any car's span on that row.\n\nIf you move, at turn T you are on old y, not new y.\n\nNow, the goal is to reach y=9, which is not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars. y=0 is the start, y=9 is the goal.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,0) at turn t1=64.\n\nWe need to go to (0,9).\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0, so to go from 0 to 9, we need at least 9 up actions, but we can also move down or stay, so H could be more than 9 if we take detours to avoid collisions.\n\nBut since we want minimal H, we should go up as much as possible, but we have to avoid the freeways when cars are at x=0.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway, when cars are at x=0.\n\nThat is, for each freeway k, find the times T when for some car, 0 is in Span(T).\n\nThen, for the player to be safe on freeway k at time T, we need that at that T, for that k, no car has 0 in span.\n\nSince multiple cars on some freeways, we need that for all cars on k, 0 not in span at T.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, right, s=24, span at t1=64: [τ, h] = [-23, 0]\n\nSince right-moving, at time T, span = [-23 + 24(T-64), 0 + 24(T-64)] = [24(T-64) -23, 24(T-64)]\n\n0 in span when min <= 0 <= max, so 24(T-64) -23 <= 0 <= 24(T-64)\n\nSince the car is from left to right? Head and tail.\n\nFor right-moving, head is the front, so at t1, head at 0, tail at -23, so it extends from -23 to 0, and moving right.\n\nSo at T, head at 0 + 24(T-64), tail at -23 + 24(T-64)\n\nSo span [tail, head] = [-23 + 24(T-64), 24(T-64)]\n\n0 in span when -23 + 24(T-64) <= 0 <= 24(T-64)\n\nSince 24(T-64) >= -23 +24(T-64), always, and 0 <= 24(T-64) implies T-64 >=0, which is true for T>=64.\n\nAnd -23 +24(T-64) <=0 implies 24(T-64) <=23, so T-64 <= 23/24 <1, so since T integer, T-64 <=0, so T<=64.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 24(T-64) implies T-64 >=0.\n\nSo 0 in span only when both: T-64 <=0 and T-64 >=0, so T=64.\n\nAt T=64, -23 +0 <=0 <=0, 0<=0 true, and -23<=0 true.\n\nAt T=65, head at 24, tail at 1, span [1,24], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, before T=64, at T=63, head at -24, tail at -47, span [-47,-24], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, only at T=64, 0 is covered.\n\nBut at T=64, player is at y=0, not on freeway 1, so no collision. Player is on y=0 at turn 64.\n\nFreeway 1 is y=1, so only if player is on y=1 at some turn, but at T=64, car is at x=0 on y=1, but player is at y=0, so safe.\n\nAnd for T>64, no car on y=1 at x=0, so freeway 1 is always safe for T>64? At T=64, car is there, but if player is on y=1 at T=64, it would collide, but player is at y=0, so ok.\n\nSince no other cars on freeway 1, and for T>64, car has moved away, so freeway 1 is clear for all future turns.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car, head h=24, tail τ=-11, direction right, speed s=36.\n\nAt t1=64, span [τ, h] = [-11, 24] for right-moving? Let's see the table.\n\n\" | 2 | (24, -11, right, 36) |\"\n\nAnd it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 2: head=24, tail=-11, right, s=36.\n\nSince right-moving, at t1=64, span is [τ, h] = [-11, 24]\n\nAt time T, span = [-11 + 36(T-64), 24 + 36(T-64)]\n\n0 in span when -11 + 36(T-64) <= 0 <= 24 + 36(T-64)\n\nLeft inequality: -11 + 36(T-64) <= 0 => 36(T-64) <= 11 => T-64 <= 11/36 < 1, so T-64 <= 0\n\nRight inequality: 0 <= 24 + 36(T-64) => -24 <= 36(T-64) which is true for T>=64 since T-64>=0.\n\n0 <= 24 + 36(T-64) always true for T>=64 because 24 + something non-negative.\n\nAnd -11 +36(T-64) <=0 only if T-64 <= 11/36 <1, so T<=64.\n\nThus only at T=64, 0 in span: -11 <=0 <=24, true.\n\nFor T>64, min span >0, e.g. T=65, span [-11+36, 24+36] = [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=64, but player not on y=2 at T=64, so freeway 2 also clear for future.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? \" | 3 | (24, -11, right, 36) | \" identical to freeway 2.\n\nSo same thing, only at T=64, 0 covered, but not issue.\n\nFreeway 4: also same? \" | 4 | (24, -11, right, 36) | \" yes, all same.\n\nFreeway 5: multiple cars. \" | 5 | (60, 49, right, 6), (24, 13, right, 6), (-12, -23, right, 6) | \"\n\nThree cars, all right-moving, speed 6.\n\nAt t1=64:\n\nFirst car: head=60, tail=49, so span [49,60] since right-moving? Head and tail.\n\nFor right-moving, span [tail, head] = [49,60]? Tail is smaller? In the notation, for right-moving, tail is left end, head is right end.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, at t1, span is [τ, h].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all right.\n\nSo first car: h=60, τ=49, so span [49,60] at t1.\n\nSecond car: h=24, τ=13, span [13,24]\n\nThird car: h=-12, τ=-23, span [-23,-12]\n\nAll at t1=64.\n\nNow at time T, for each car, span moves right by s(T-64) =6(T-64)\n\nSo car1: span [49 + 6(T-64), 60 + 6(T-64)]\n\nCar2: [13 + 6(T-64), 24 + 6(T-64)]\n\nCar3: [-23 + 6(T-64), -12 + 6(T-64)]\n\n0 in span for car1: 49 +6(T-64) <= 0 <= 60 +6(T-64)\n\nBut 49 +6(dt) >=49>0 for dt>=0, so min >0, 0 never <= min since min >=49, so 0 not in span for car1 for T>=64.\n\nSimilarly, car2: min=13+6(dt) >=13>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nCar3: min=-23+6(dt), max=-12+6(dt)\n\n0 in span if min <=0 <= max, so -23 +6(dt) <=0 and 0 <= -12 +6(dt)\n\nFirst: -23 +6(dt) <=0 => 6(dt) <=23 => dt <= 23/6 ≈3.833, so dt<=3\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12 +6(dt) => 12 <=6(dt) => dt >=2\n\nSo for dt=2,3\n\ndt = T-64\n\nFor dt=2: min=-23+12=-11, max=-12+12=0, span [-11,0], 0 is included since max=0.\n\n0 <=0 is true.\n\nFor dt=3: min=-23+18=-5, max=-12+18=6, span [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nFor dt=1: min=-23+6=-17, max=-12+6=-6, span [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\ndt=4: min=-23+24=1, max=-12+24=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo car3 has 0 in span at T=64+2=66 and T=64+3=65? dt=2 and 3, T=66 and 67.\n\nT-64=2, T=66; T-64=3, T=67.\n\nAt T=66, span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nT=67, span [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nNow for freeway 5, we need to check if any car has 0 in span at time T.\n\nCar1 and car2 never, only car3 at T=66 and T=67.\n\nSo for freeway 5, collision possible at T=66 and T=67 if player is on y=5.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5? \" | 6 | (60, 49, right, 6), (24, 13, right, 6), (-12, -23, right, 6) | \" identical to freeway 5.\n\nSo same, collision on y=6 at T=66 and T=67.\n\nFreeway 7: \" | 7 | (-48, -59, right, 12) | \" one car.\n\nHead h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right, speed 12.\n\nRight-moving, so at t1=64, span [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt time T, span [-59 +12(T-64), -48 +12(T-64)]\n\n0 in span: min <=0 <= max\n\n-59 +12(dt) <=0 and 0 <= -48 +12(dt)\n\nFirst: -59 +12(dt) <=0 => 12(dt) <=59 => dt <= 59/12 ≈4.916, so dt<=4\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +12(dt) => 48 <=12(dt) => dt >=4\n\nSo dt=4: min=-59+48=-11, max=-48+48=0, span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\ndt=3: min=-59+36=-23, max=-48+36=-12, span [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\ndt=5: min=-59+60=1, max=-48+60=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at dt=4, T=64+4=68.\n\nThus for freeway 7, collision at T=68.\n\nFreeway 8: \" | 8 | (56, 45, right, 4) | \" one car.\n\nHead=56, tail=45, right, s=4.\n\nAt t1=64, span [45,56]\n\nAt T, [45 +4(dt), 56 +4(dt)]\n\nMin=45+4(dt) >=45>0, so 0 never in span. Always above 0.\n\nSo freeway 8 always safe.\n\nNow, summarize dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: no danger after t1, safe\n\n- y=2: safe\n\n- y=3: safe? Freeway 3 same as 2, safe\n\n- y=4: same, safe\n\n- y=5: dangerous at T=66 and 67\n\n- y=6: dangerous at T=66 and 67\n\n- y=7: dangerous at T=68\n\n- y=8: safe\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at turn 64.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny must be integer, from 0 to 9.\n\nEach turn, we can change y by -1,0,+1.\n\nTo minimize turns, we should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on dangerous freeways at dangerous times.\n\nDangerous:\n\n- On y=5 at T=66 or 67\n\n- On y=6 at T=66 or 67\n\n- On y=7 at T=68\n\ny=1,2,3,4,8 safe at all times.\n\ny=7 only dangerous at T=68.\n\nNow, time starts at T=64.\n\nPlayer at T=64, y=0.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal time would be if we go up every turn, but we might hit a dangerous spot.\n\nLet’s list the turns: T=64, y=0\n\nT=65, y=?\n\nT=66, y=?\n\nT=67, y=?\n\nT=68, y=?\n\netc.\n\nIf we go up every turn:\n\nAt T=64: y=0\n\nT=65: y=1 (after action U at T=64? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position y_T.\n\nWe take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T, and we choose a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nFor collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and the cars on row y_T at time T.\n\nIn this case, at T=64, y=0, not on freeway, safe.\n\nWe choose a_{64}, which sets y_{65}.\n\nThen at T=65, we are at y_{65}, and so on.\n\nNow, back to going up:\n\nSuppose we do all U:\n\nT=64: y=0, safe (not freeway)\n\na_{64} = U, so y_{65} =1\n\nT=65: y=1, which is freeway 1, but we said freeway 1 is safe for T>64, and T=65>64, so no car at x=0, safe.\n\na_{65} = U, y_{66} =2\n\nT=66: y=2, freeway 2, safe, as we saw.\n\na_{66} = U, y_{67} =3\n\nT=67: y=3, freeway 3, safe.\n\na_{67} = U, y_{68} =4\n\nT=68: y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\na_{68} = U, y_{69} =5\n\nT=69: y=5, freeway 5. Now, at T=69, is it dangerous? For y=5, dangerous at T=66,67, but T=69>67, so car has moved away. Since car3 on y=5 at T=67 span [-5,6], but at T=68: car3 span [-23+6(4), -12+6(4)] dt=T-64, at T=68, dt=4, min=-23+24=1, max=12, span [1,12], 0 not in. Similarly T=69, even higher. So safe.\n\na_{69} = U, y_{70} =6\n\nT=70: y=6, freeway 6. Similarly, dangerous only at T=66,67, at T=70, safe.\n\na_{70} = U, y_{71} =7\n\nT=71: y=7, freeway 7. Dangerous at T=68? T=68 is dangerous for y=7.\n\nAt T=71, dt=7, for freeway 7 car: at T=68, span min=-11, max=0? Earlier for y=7 at T=68.\n\nAt T=68, dt=4, span [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nBut at T=71, dt=7, min=-59+84=25, max=-48+84=36, span [25,36], 0 not in, so safe.\n\na_{71} = U, y_{72} =8\n\nT=72: y=8, freeway 8, always safe.\n\na_{72} = U, y_{73} =9\n\nT=73: y=9, goal.\n\nSo in this path, we reach y=9 at T=73, with actions: U at T=64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72.\n\nThat's 9 actions, from T=64 to T=72, y from 0 to 9 in 9 steps.\n\nBut is there a collision? Let's check the dangerous points.\n\nAt T=66, we are at y=2, which is safe.\n\nT=67, y=3, safe.\n\nT=68, y=4, safe.\n\nT=69, y=5, safe as above.\n\nT=70, y=6, safe.\n\nT=71, y=7, safe.\n\nNo problem.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=5 and y=6 dangerous at T=66,67, but we are not there at those times.\n\nSimilarly y=7 dangerous at T=68, we are at y=4 at T=68.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut can we do better? Minimal is 9 turns if we go directly up.\n\nIn 9 turns, from T=64 to T=72, y=9 at T=73? Let's see the turns.\n\nAt turn T=64, y=0.\n\nAfter H turns, we have actions from t=0 to H-1, so after H actions, we are at turn t1 + H.\n\nStart at turn t1=64, position y.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, y at t1+1.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + H-1}, y at t1 + H.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd H minimal.\n\nIn the sequence above, with all U:\n\nAt T=64, take a_{64}=U, so y_{65}=1\n\nT=65, take a_{65}=U, y_{66}=2\n\n...\n\nT=72, take a_{72}=U, y_{73}=9\n\nSo at turn t1 + H =64 + H, y=9.\n\nWe take actions from t=64 to t=72, which is 9 actions: t=64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72.\n\nH=9, and y at turn 73 is 9.\n\nt1 + H =64 +9=73.\n\nYes.\n\nIs there a way with H<9? No, because from y=0 to y=9, need at least 9 up moves, and since we can only change by at most 1, H must be at least 9. With down or stay, H would be larger, so minimal H is 9, and we achieved it with no collisions.\n\nBut in the path above, we didn't hit any dangerous times, so it should be fine.\n\nBut let me double-check the dangerous times.\n\nFor y=5: dangerous at T=66 and 67.\n\nIn our path, at T=66, y=2; T=67, y=3; not on y=5.\n\nAt T=69, y=5, but T=69>67, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=6 dangerous T=66,67; we at T=70 y=6, safe.\n\ny=7 dangerous T=68; we at T=71 y=7, safe.\n\ny=8 safe.\n\ny=1,2,3,4 safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut the player starts at y=0, which is safe, and we go up each turn.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nBut the problem is to find minimal H and the sequence.\n\nBut in this case, H=9 is minimal and achievable.\n\nBut let me confirm if at T=64, when we are at y=0, is there any issue? No.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we can stay or something to avoid, but no need.\n\nBut in freeway 5 and 6, there are multiple cars, but we only care about x=0.\n\nAnother thing: the note about moving to new y.\n\nFor example, at turn T, if we are on y and move to y+1, at turn T we are still on y, so we check cars on y at T.\n\nIn our case, no problem.\n\nPerhaps for y=7 at T=68, but we are not there.\n\nBut let me see if we can reach faster, but no, 9 is minimum.\n\nUnless we start moving later, but that would take more turns.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps we can go directly without pausing.\n\nBut in this path, we don't pause.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 7 at T=68.\n\nAt T=68, on y=7, car span [-11,0], so x=0 covered.\n\nBut we are at y=4 at T=68.\n\nAll fine.\n\nBut the initial position is (0,0) at turn t1=64, and we need to reach (0,9).\n\nIn the action sequence, we go up each turn.\n\nBut the answer should be the actions from t=64 onwards.\n\nBut let me write them.\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1} = U\n\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1} = U\n\n...\n\nup to turn t1+8: a_{t1+8} = U\n\nt1=64, so turns 64 to 72.\n\nH=9 actions.\n\nBut the sequence is from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to Turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nSo for H=9, actions at t=64 to 72.\n\nAll U.\n\nBut is there a problem at the beginning?\n\nFreeway 1 at T=64 has car at x=0, but player at y=0, not on y=1, so no collision.\n\nAt T=65, we go to y=1, but car has moved, head at 24, tail at 1? For freeway 1, at T=65, span [1,24], not covering 0.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 5, car3 at T=66 and 67, but we avoid.\n\nBut in our path, we don't go to y=5 or 6 at those times.\n\nBut let me see if we can go faster to higher y, but no.\n\nAnother thing: since y=0 and y=9 are safe, we could stay at y=0 or go down, but that would increase H, not good.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5, there is a car at (-12,-23) at t1, but we handled it.\n\nPerhaps I should list the actions.\n\nBut the answer should be in a box.\n\nBut let me see if at T=68, on y=7, dangerous, but we are not there.\n\nBut suppose we want to be at y=9 earlier, but impossible.\n\nt1 + H, with H=9, turn 73.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at turn 72 if we start from higher, but start at y=0 turn 64.\n\nMinimal turn to reach y=9 is turn 73 if we go up every turn from 64.\n\nTurn 64: y=0\n\nTurn 65: y=1\n\n...\n\nTurn 73: y=9\n\nAfter 9 actions.\n\nIf we could teleport, but no.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the freeway 7, at T=68, dangerous, but we are at y=4.\n\nBut let me confirm the time for freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7: car at t1=64, span [-59,-48]\n\ns=12, right.\n\nAt T, span [-59 +12(T-64), -48 +12(T-64)]\n\n0 in span when -59 +12(dt) <=0 <= -48 +12(dt)\n\nSo -59 +12(dt) <=0 => dt <= 59/12=4.916, dt<=4\n\nAnd 0 <= -48 +12(dt) => 12(dt) >=48 => dt>=4\n\nSo dt=4, T=68.\n\nSpan: min=-59+48=-11, max=-48+48=0, so [ -11, 0 ], includes 0.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn our path, no issue.\n\nPerhaps we need to output the sequence.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn this case H=9.\n\nBut let me see if we can do with H=9 but different sequence, but all U is fine.\n\nPerhaps to avoid, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: the player position at turn T is y_T.\n\nAt T=64, y=0.\n\nIf we do S at T=64, then y_65=0, then we need to go up later, H larger.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down, worse.\n\nSo all U is best.\n\nBut let me see if there is a constraint I missed.\n\nThe freeway y=5 and y=6 both dangerous at T=66 and 67.\n\nSuppose we go up slower.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=0 for one turn, then at T=65, y=0, but then we start going up, but we reach later.\n\nFor example, a_64=S, y_65=0\n\nThen a_65=U, y_66=1\n\na_66=U, y_67=2\n\na_67=U, y_68=3\n\na_68=U, y_69=4\n\na_69=U, y_70=5\n\nBut at T=70, y=5, safe, as before.\n\nThen continue, but we reach y=9 at turn 74 or something, later.\n\nWorse.\n\nTo avoid y=7 at T=68, but in our fast path, we not there at T=68.\n\nSuppose we go faster to y=7 before T=68 or after.\n\nBut to go faster, we need to start earlier, but we start at turn 64 y=0.\n\nMinimal time to y=7 is turn 71 if go directly: T=64 y=0, T=65 y=1, ..., T=71 y=7.\n\nAt T=71, y=7, which is after T=68, safe.\n\nSimilarly, in our path, we are at y=7 at T=71.\n\nIf we could be at y=7 at T=67, but from y=0 at T=64, to y=7 at T=67, that would be 7 steps in 3 turns? Turn 64 to 66 actions.\n\nAt T=64, after action, y at T+1.\n\nTo be at y=7 at turn T, we need to have taken actions from some point.\n\nAt turn T, y_T.\n\nFrom turn 64 y=0, to turn T y=7.\n\nThe number of up moves must be 7, and we can have down or stay, but to minimize time, no down or stay.\n\nSo earliest at turn 64 +7 =71? Turn 64: y=0\n\nAfter 1 up: turn 65 y=1\n\nAfter 2: turn 66 y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter 7 up: turn 71 y=7\n\nSimilarly, to y=9 at turn 73.\n\nCannot be earlier.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, with all U actions.\n\nBut let me write the sequence.\n\nTurn t1: a_{64} = U\n\nTurn t1+1: a_{65} = U\n\nTurn t1+2: a_{66} = U\n\nTurn t1+3: a_{67} = U\n\nTurn t1+4: a_{68} = U\n\nTurn t1+5: a_{69} = U\n\nTurn t1+6: a_{70} = U\n\nTurn t1+7: a_{71} = U\n\nTurn t1+8: a_{72} = U\n\nThen at turn t1+9=73, y=9.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0, a_{t1+0} = a_{64}\n\nt=1, a_{65}, etc.\n\nUp to t=8, a_{72}\n\nH=9.\n\nNow, I think that's it.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 5 and 6, there are cars, but we avoided the times.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 same as 5, cars at T=66 and 67 on x=0.\n\nBut we not there.\n\nAnother point: the note about moving to new y.\n\nFor example, at turn T=68, if we were to move to y=7, but we choose action at T=68, which sets y_{69}.\n\nAt T=68, we are at y_{68}, and we choose a_{68}, then y_{69} = y_{68} + Δy.\n\nFor collision at T=68, it depends on y_{68}, not on where we are going.\n\nIn our case, at T=68, y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nWe choose U, so y_{69}=5.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 64\\) is 9. This is achieved by moving up (U) at every turn, which is the fastest path since it requires exactly 9 up moves to increase the y-coordinate from 0 to 9, and no detours or delays are necessary to avoid collisions with cars on the freeways.\n\n### Collision Analysis:\n- The dangerous times for collisions are:\n  - Freeway 5 (y=5): Cars cover x=0 at turns 66 and 67.\n  - Freeway 6 (y=6): Cars cover x=0 at turns 66 and 67.\n  - Freeway 7 (y=7): Cars cover x=0 at turn 68.\n- All other freeways (y=1, 2, 3, 4, 8) are safe at all times, as no cars cover x=0 for turns \\(T \\geq 65\\).\n- In the path:\n  - At turn 66: y=2 (safe, not on y=5 or y=6).\n  - At turn 67: y=3 (safe, not on y=5 or y=6).\n  - At turn 68: y=4 (safe, not on y=7).\n  - At turn 69: y=5 (safe, as danger was only at turns 66 and 67).\n  - At turn 70: y=6 (safe, as danger was only at turns 66 and 67).\n  - At turn 71: y=7 (safe, as danger was only at turn 68).\n\nThus, the player avoids all collisions and reaches y=9 at turn 73 (i.e., \\(t_1 + H = 64 + 9 = 73\\)).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + 8\\) (i.e., turns 64 to 72) is all U (up).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 64: U \\\\\nTurn 65: U \\\\\nTurn 66: U \\\\\nTurn 67: U \\\\\nTurn 68: U \\\\\nTurn 69: U \\\\\nTurn 70: U \\\\\nTurn 71: U \\\\\nTurn 72: U\n}",

We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if at that turn the player is on a freeway (y in {1,...,8}) and the car on that freeway at the same turn has a span that includes 0.\n\nNote: The player's position at turn T is (0, y_T). The update is:\n  - Action U: y_{t+1} = y_t + 1 (if not at 9, then capped? but note y in [0,9] so if at 9, U would leave to 10 -> but the condition says y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]. So we cannot go above 9 or below 0. So if at 9, U is invalid? But the problem says \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\". However, the problem does not specify what happens if we try to go beyond. We must assume that the move is only allowed if the result is within [0,9]. So we have to avoid moves that would take us out of bounds.\n\nBut note: the problem states \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\". So if we are at 9 and try to go up, that move is invalid. Similarly, at 0 and D is invalid. So we must plan accordingly.\n\nHowever, we start at y=1 and goal is y=9. We can only move up, down, or stay. We want to minimize H (the number of turns) so we will try to go up as much as possible, but avoiding cars.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1=65. For each freeway (y=1 to 8) we have one or more cars. Each car is defined by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the representation:\n\nFor left-moving: the car moves to the left. The span at time t1 is [h, τ] and then at time T>t1, it becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\nFor right-moving: the car moves to the right. The span at time t1 is [τ, h] (which is [min, max] but note that in the update they write [τ, h] and then becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]? Actually, the problem states:\n\nRight-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] -> Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\n\nBut note: in the example for freeway 1: (24,1,right,24) at t1=65. So at time 65, the car spans from 1 to 24? But wait: the problem says for right-moving: the span at t1 is [τ, h] meaning [tail, head]. So in this case, tail=1, head=24? Then the car is from 1 to 24? But note that the update for right-moving: \n  Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] = [1 + 24*(T-65), 24 + 24*(T-65)]\n\nBut note: the car is moving to the right. So at time T, it is shifted to the right by s*(T-t1).\n\nCollision condition: at turn T, if the player is at freeway k (i.e., y_T = k) and there is a car on freeway k at time T such that 0 is in the span of that car at time T.\n\nImportant: the player is at (0, y_T) at turn T. So we care about whether 0 is in the car's span at that exact turn.\n\nWe are to plan from turn 65 (t1) to turn 65+H-1 (so H turns, meaning the actions are taken at turns 65, 66, ... 65+H-1, and the last position is at turn 65+H-1 which must be (0,9)).\n\nWe start at turn 65 at (0,1). So we are on freeway 1 at turn 65.\n\nWe must avoid being at a freeway k at a turn T when any car on that freeway has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nLet's note: at turn T, we are at y_T. Then we look at the freeway k = y_T. For every car on that freeway, we compute its span at turn T and check if 0 is in that span.\n\nWe are given the state at t1=65. So for each freeway and each car, we can compute the span at any future turn T.\n\nWe need to simulate the moves. We are to find the minimal H and the sequence of actions.\n\nSince we want minimal H, we would like to go up as fast as possible. However, we might have to wait (stay) or even go down to avoid collisions.\n\nWe start at y=1 at turn 65. Then we can choose U, D, or S.\n\nGoal: reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of moves without any cars would be 8 moves (each U). But we have to avoid cars.\n\nWe need to simulate the cars' positions at each future turn.\n\nLet T = t1 + t, where t=0,1,2,... (so turn 65,66,...)\n\nWe'll denote the time from the start: at step t (relative to t1=65), the absolute turn is 65+t.\n\nWe are at turn 65+t at position (0, y_{65+t}), and we take action a_{65+t} to get to y_{65+t+1}.\n\nBut note: the collision condition is checked at the turn we are at. So at turn 65+t, we are at freeway y_{65+t}. We must ensure that at that turn, the car(s) on that freeway do not cover 0.\n\nWe are given the cars at turn 65. So for a future turn T=65+t, the span of a car on freeway k is computed as:\n\nIf the car is right-moving: \n   initial head h, initial tail τ, speed s.\n   Then at T=65+t, the head becomes h + s*t, and the tail becomes τ + s*t.\n\nBut note: the problem states for right-moving: \n   Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] = [τ + s*t, h + s*t]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: \n   [h - s*t, τ - s*t]   [but note: the initial span is given as [h,τ] for left-moving? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: initial span [h,τ] and then becomes [h - s*t, τ - s*t]. However, we don't have any left-moving cars in this problem? Let's check the directions: all are \"right\". So all cars are right-moving.\n\nTherefore, for every car, at time T=65+t, the span is [τ + s*t, h + s*t] (for right-moving cars). And note: the initial state at t=0 (t1=65) is [τ, h] as given.\n\nBut note: the representation in the table for freeway 1: (24,1,right,24) -> so head=24, tail=1? Then the span at time 65 is [1,24]. Then at time T=65+t, it becomes [1+24*t, 24+24*t].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5: three cars: \n  (-48, -59, right, 6) -> becomes [-59+6*t, -48+6*t] at time T\n  (30, 19, right, 6) -> becomes [19+6*t, 30+6*t]\n  (-6, -17, right, 6) -> becomes [-17+6*t, -6+6*t]\n\nWe must check at each freeway we step on, at the exact turn, that 0 is not in any of the spans of the cars on that freeway.\n\nLet me write down the cars for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=24, tail=1, right, speed=24) -> span at t: [1+24*t, 24+24*t]\nFreeway 2: one car: (60,25,right,36) -> but wait: the table says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\" for freeway 2: (60,25,right,36). So head=60, tail=25? Then span at time t: [25+36*t, 60+36*t]\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2: (60,25,right,36) -> [25+36*t, 60+36*t]\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 2: (60,25,right,36) -> [25+36*t, 60+36*t]\nFreeway 5: three cars:\n   car1: (head=-48, tail=-59, right,6) -> [-59+6*t, -48+6*t]\n   car2: (30,19,right,6) -> [19+6*t, 30+6*t]\n   car3: (-6,-17,right,6) -> [-17+6*t, -6+6*t]\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5? The table says: (-48,-59,right,6), (30,19,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6) -> same three cars.\nFreeway 7: (-36,-47,right,12) -> [-47+12*t, -36+12*t]\nFreeway 8: (60,49,right,4) -> [49+4*t, 60+4*t]\n\nWe start at turn t=0 (absolute turn 65) at y=1. So we are on freeway 1 at t=0.\n\nCheck freeway 1 at t=0: the car span is [1+24*0, 24+24*0] = [1,24]. 0 is not in [1,24] -> safe.\n\nNow we plan the next moves.\n\nWe want to get to y=9. We can only change by at most 1 per turn. We need at least 8 moves (if we go up every turn).\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions at each freeway we are on at the time we are on it.\n\nWe'll simulate the moves. We'll try to go up as much as possible, but if we see that at the next freeway at the next turn there is a car that will hit us, we might have to wait or go down.\n\nSince we are starting at y=1 and we have to get to y=9, we will mostly go up. But we must check each freeway we step on.\n\nWe'll simulate turn by turn.\n\nLet t be the number of steps from the start (turn 65). So at step t, we are at turn 65+t.\n\nWe are at y_t at step t (with t=0: y0=1).\n\nWe choose an action a_{65+t} (which is for the next state) and then at step t+1 we are at y_{t+1} = y_t + delta, and we are at freeway y_{t+1} at turn 65+t+1? \n\nWait: note the timing:\n\nAt turn 65+t:\n   We are at y_{65+t} (which we denote as y_t for simplicity in our relative time? But note: the absolute turn is 65+t, and the position is (0, y_{65+t})).\n\nWe take action a_{65+t} to determine y_{65+t+1}.\n\nSo the collision check at turn 65+t is for the freeway y_{65+t} at time 65+t.\n\nWe start at t0: turn 65, position y0 = 1 -> check freeway1 at t=0 (absolute 65): safe as above.\n\nThen we take an action a_65 to go to y1 (at turn 66).\n\nAt turn 66, we are at y1, and we must check the freeway y1 at absolute time 66 (t=1 in our relative count).\n\nSo we need to compute the car spans for absolute time T = 65+t.\n\nLet me denote the absolute turn as T = 65 + t, where t=0,1,2,... is the step index.\n\nWe are at y_t at absolute turn T=65+t.\n\nWe must ensure that at turn T, the freeway k = y_t is safe: meaning for every car on freeway k, 0 is not in [low, high] of the car.\n\nWe are going to simulate for t=0,1,2,... until we reach y_t=9.\n\nWe'll try to go up as much as possible, but if at the next step (if we go up) we would be on a freeway that is unsafe at the next turn, then we might have to choose S or D.\n\nBut note: we can also stay at the same freeway for multiple turns to avoid a car that is passing by.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H. So we want to get to 9 as fast as possible.\n\nLet me try to compute the car positions at a few future turns for each freeway that we might traverse.\n\nWe are going from y=1 to y=9, so we will step on freeways 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and then 9 (but note: freeways are only 1 to 8; when we are at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars. And the goal is (0,9), so when we are at y=9, we are safe and we stop).\n\nSo we only worry about freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe start at t0 (t=0) at y=1 (freeway1) and we are safe.\n\nNow, we want to go to y=2 at turn 66 (t=1). So we take action U at turn65.\n\nThen at turn66 (t=1) we are at y=2. Check freeway2: the car on freeway2 at t=1: [25+36*1, 60+36*1] = [25+36, 60+36] = [61,96]. 0 is not in [61,96] -> safe.\n\nThen we can go to y=3 at turn67 (t=2): take U again.\nAt turn67 (t=2): freeway3: same car as freeway2? Actually, freeway3 has the same car: [25+36*2, 60+36*2] = [25+72,60+72]=[97,132] -> safe.\n\nThen to y=4 at turn68 (t=3): U.\nAt turn68 (t=3): freeway4: same car: [25+36*3,60+36*3]=[25+108,60+108]=[133,168] -> safe.\n\nThen to y=5 at turn69 (t=4): U.\nAt turn69 (t=4): freeway5 has three cars. We must check each:\n   car1: [-59+6*4, -48+6*4] = [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35, -24] -> 0 not in this.\n   car2: [19+6*4,30+6*4]=[19+24,30+24]=[43,54] -> 0 not in.\n   car3: [-17+6*4, -6+6*4] = [-17+24, -6+24] = [7,18] -> 0 is not in [7,18] -> safe.\n\nThen to y=6 at turn70 (t=5): U.\nAt turn70 (t=5): freeway6: same cars as freeway5? But note: freeway6 has the same three cars? Actually, the table says freeway6 has the same set: (-48,-59,right,6), (30,19,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6). So same as freeway5? \n   car1: [-59+6*5, -48+6*5] = [-59+30, -48+30] = [-29,-18]\n   car2: [19+30,30+30]=[49,60]\n   car3: [-17+30, -6+30] = [13,24] -> 0 not in any -> safe.\n\nThen to y=7 at turn71 (t=6): U.\nAt turn71 (t=6): freeway7: one car: [-47+12*6, -36+12*6] = [-47+72, -36+72] = [25,36] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at turn72 (t=7): U.\nAt turn72 (t=7): freeway8: [49+4*7, 60+4*7] = [49+28,60+28] = [77,88] -> safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at turn73 (t=8): U. Now we are at y=9 at turn73 (t=8). Since y=9 has no cars, we are safe.\n\nSo we can go straight up from y=1 to y=9 in 8 moves? And we never encountered a collision.\n\nBut wait: we have to check every step. We did:\n\nTurn65 (t=0): at y=1 -> safe (as above)\nTurn66 (t=1): at y=2 -> safe\nTurn67 (t=2): at y=3 -> safe\nTurn68 (t=3): at y=4 -> safe\nTurn69 (t=4): at y=5 -> safe\nTurn70 (t=5): at y=6 -> safe\nTurn71 (t=6): at y=7 -> safe\nTurn72 (t=7): at y=8 -> safe\nTurn73 (t=8): at y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo the sequence of actions: 8 consecutive U's.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway5 at t=4 (turn69): \n   car3: [7,18] -> does that include 0? No. \n   And the others don't.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6 at t=5 (turn70): car3: [13,24] -> no.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway1 at the start? We are leaving freeway1 at turn65 (we were there at turn65) and then we never come back. Similarly, we pass each freeway only once.\n\nSo is this safe? It seems so.\n\nBut wait: the problem says for freeway5 at turn69 (t=4) we have a car3: [-6,-17,right,6] at t1=65. Then at t=4: \n   head becomes -6 + 6*4 = -6+24 = 18? \n   tail becomes -17 + 6*4 = -17+24 = 7? \n   So the span is [7,18]? But note: the problem says for right-moving: [τ + s*t, h + s*t]. \n   The car is given as (head=-6, tail=-17, ...). So the initial span at t1=65 is [τ, h] = [-17, -6]. \n   Then at t=4: [-17+24, -6+24] = [7,18]. Correct.\n\nBut 0 is not in [7,18]. So safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6: same car at t=5: [-17+30, -6+30] = [13,24]. Safe.\n\nHowever, let me check freeway5 at other times? We are only at freeway5 at turn69 (t=4). Similarly, we are at freeway6 at turn70 (t=5).\n\nBut what if we had been at freeway5 at a different time? For example, if we had waited? We didn't.\n\nSo the minimal H is 8? Then the sequence is:\n\nTurn 65: U\nTurn 66: U\nTurn 67: U\nTurn 68: U\nTurn 69: U\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: U\nTurn 72: U\n\nThen at turn73 we are at (0,9). So we take 8 actions (from turn65 to turn72) and then at turn73 we don't need to act? But note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" such that after H actions (i.e., H turns) we are at (0,9). \n\nAt turn65 we take the first action, then at turn65+1 we are at a new state, ... until turn65+H-1 we take the last action. Then the position at turn65+H is the one that must be (0,9). \n\nBut note: the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\" and \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nWait: the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nSo at the turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. \n\nIn our plan: \n   t1=65, H=8: then the last turn we take an action is at turn65+7=72, and at that turn we are at y=8, then we take U to go to y=9 at turn73. But wait, the state after the action at turn72 is y_{73}=9. So at turn72 (which is t1+7) we are at y=8, and then we take U and then at the next turn (turn73) we are at 9. But the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. \n\nSo the turn index for the state after H actions? \n\nThe problem states: \n   We have a sequence of actions for t = t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. \n   Then the state at time t1+H is the result of the last action. \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me read:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then in the answer format: \n   Turn t1: a_{t1}\n   Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n   ...\n   (until turn t1+H-1)\n\nand then the position at turn t1+H-1 is 9? \n\nBut note the update: at turn t, we take action a_t and then the next state is at turn t+1. \n\nSo if we take H actions, we start at turn t1 and then we end at turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThis implies that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9? But that doesn't make sense because we take action at turn t1+H-1 to go to the next state. \n\nAlternatively, the state y_t is the state at the beginning of turn t? But the problem states the update: \n   y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, the state at the end of the sequence (after H actions) is at time t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nThis seems to be a discrepancy. Let me re-read the problem:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then in the task: \"minimal number of turns H\" such that \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nThis is ambiguous. However, note the indexing: the actions are taken at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the last action is at time t1+H-1. The state after that action is y_{t1+H}. \n\nBut the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nThat would mean that at the start of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9? Then we don't need to take an action at that turn? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state y_t is defined at the end of turn t? But the update rule is given as: at turn t we take an action and then we get y_{t+1}. \n\nI think there is a confusion in the problem statement. \n\nLooking back: \n\n\"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\"\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, then we take action a_t and then we are at y_{t+1} at the next turn.\n\nTherefore, the state at the beginning of turn t is y_t.\n\nWe start at turn t1: we are at y_{t1}=1.\n\nWe take H actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1.\n\nThen the state after the last action is y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThis must be a typo. Because if we take H actions, we end at turn t1+H.\n\nTherefore, the condition should be y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nHowever, in the example above, we ended at turn73 (t1+8) at y=9. So if we take H=8 actions (from turn65 to turn72), then the state at turn73 (which is t1+8) is 9. So we require y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLooking at the problem statement again: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nAnd the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1: so the last action is at t1+H-1.\n\nThen the state at the time of taking that last action is y_{t1+H-1}. But the problem says we want to be at (0,9) at that turn? \n\nBut note: the update: at the turn we take the action, we are at y_t. Then we move to y_{t+1}. \n\nSo if at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9, then we don't need to move? But we are already at 9? \n\nBut we start at 1, so we must move to get to 9.\n\nAlternatively, if we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, then we don't take an action? But the sequence requires an action for that turn.\n\nThis suggests that the problem means that after taking the action at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9 at the next state, i.e., at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", which would mean that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? But if we are already at 9, then we don't need to take an action? And we are done.\n\nBut that doesn't match because we start at 1.\n\nTherefore, I suspect the problem has a typo. It should be y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps H is defined as the number of turns we are in the game until we reach 9, meaning that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9 and we stop. But then we have taken H-1 actions? \n\nBut the sequence is for H actions.\n\nGiven the confusion, let me look at the problem statement: \"minimal number of turns H\" and \"a sequence of actions ... from t=0 to H-1\" meaning H actions. And then \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThe only way to reconcile: the state y_{t} is the state at the beginning of turn t. At turn t1, we are at y_{t1}=1. We take an action a_{t1} and then we are at y_{t1+1} at the beginning of turn t1+1. \n\nThen we want at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 to be at 9. \n\nThat means we have taken H-1 actions? But the sequence is for H actions: from t1 to t1+H-1. \n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, the problem means that we take H-1 actions? \n\nBut the sequence is indexed from t=0 to H-1, which is H actions.\n\nI think the problem has an off-by-one error.\n\nHowever, note that in the answer format, we write:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1}\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n...\nTurn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nand then we are done. And the condition is that at turn t1+H-1, after taking the action, we are at 9? But the update rule says that after taking a_t at turn t, we go to y_{t+1}. So after the last action at turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H}. \n\nTherefore, we require y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThis must be a mistake in the problem. I will assume that the intended meaning is that we want y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBecause otherwise, if we require y_{t1+H-1}=9, then we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, so we don't need to take an action at that turn. Then the sequence would have H-1 actions? But the problem says the sequence has H actions.\n\nGiven that, and since our plan above gets to y=9 at turn73 (t1+8) with 8 actions (from turn65 to turn72), and that matches y_{t1+8}=9, we'll go with that.\n\nBut to be safe, let me try to see if the problem has a different interpretation.\n\nAnother interpretation: \"turns\" H meaning the number of turns elapsed, and the last action is taken at the turn that brings us to 9. But then the state at the turn we take the action is still the starting state for that turn.\n\nI think the only consistent way is to require y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nIn the problem: \"reach (0,9)\" at the end of the sequence.\n\nTherefore, I will proceed with H=8 and the sequence of 8 U's.\n\nBut wait: what about the freeway we are on at the turn we are on? We must check that we don't collide at any turn.\n\nWe already did: at each turn from t=0 to t=7 (absolute turn65 to turn72) we are at freeway y_t = t+1? \n\nAt turn65 (t=0): y0=1 -> freeway1: safe\nAt turn66 (t=1): y1=2 -> freeway2: safe\nAt turn67 (t=2): y2=3 -> freeway3: safe\nAt turn68 (t=3): y3=4 -> freeway4: safe\nAt turn69 (t=4): y4=5 -> freeway5: safe\nAt turn70 (t=5): y5=6 -> freeway6: safe\nAt turn71 (t=6): y6=7 -> freeway7: safe\nAt turn72 (t=7): y7=8 -> freeway8: safe\n\nThen at turn73, we are at y8=9 -> no freeway, safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nBut wait: at turn72 (t=7) we are at freeway8: the car on freeway8: [49+4*7,60+4*7]=[49+28,60+28]=[77,88] -> doesn't cover 0. Safe.\n\nBut what if we look at freeway5 at an earlier time? For example, at t=0: freeway5: \n   car1: [-59, -48] -> doesn't cover 0.\n   car2: [19,30] -> no.\n   car3: [-17,-6] -> no.\n\nBut we are not on freeway5 at t=0. We are only at freeway5 at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6 at t=0: same cars? \n   car1: [-59,-48] -> no.\n   car2: [19,30] -> no.\n   car3: [-17,-6] -> no.\n\nBut we are at freeway6 at t=5.\n\nSo it seems safe.\n\nBut wait: freeway5 car3 at t=4: [7,18] -> does that include 0? No, because 7 to 18 is above 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6 car3 at t=5: [13,24] -> no.\n\nBut what about freeway7 at t=6: [25,36] -> no.\n\nHowever, I notice that freeway7 has a car that at t=6 is at [25,36]. But we are at freeway7 at turn71 (t=6) and we are at position 0. The car spans from 25 to 36, so 0 is not in there.\n\nBut what if we had been at freeway7 earlier? For example, at t=3: freeway7: [-47+12*3, -36+12*3] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0]. \n\nAt t=3: the car spans [-11,0]. Does that include 0? Yes! So if we were at freeway7 at turn68 (absolute turn65+3=68) then we would collide.\n\nBut in our plan, we are at freeway7 at turn71 (t=6), not at turn68 (t=3). So we are safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8: at t=0: [49,60] -> safe. At t=1: [53,64] -> safe. ... at t=7: [77,88] -> safe.\n\nBut what about freeway1 at later times? We are only at freeway1 at t=0. At t=1: freeway1 car: [1+24,24+24]=[25,48] -> doesn't include 0.\n\nBut if we had stayed on freeway1 for two turns, then at turn66 (t=1) we would be at freeway1 and the car would be at [25,48] -> safe? But we didn't stay, we moved.\n\nSo the direct path is safe.\n\nBut is there a reason to wait? We don't see any. So we can go straight up.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 8, and the actions are 8 U's.\n\nSo the answer:\n\nTurn 65: U\nTurn 66: U\nTurn 67: U\nTurn 68: U\nTurn 69: U\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: U\nTurn 72: U\n\nBut note: the problem says the current turn is t1=65, and we start at (0,1). We take action at turn65 to go to y=2 at turn66, and so on.\n\nBut wait: at turn72 (which is t1+7) we take the last U, and then at turn73 we are at 9.\n\nThe problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. In our case, H=8, so t1+H-1 = 65+7=72. But at turn72 we are at y=8, not 9. \n\nThis is the issue. \n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nAt turn72 (t1+7) we are at y=8? Then we are not at 9 until turn73.\n\nSo we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn72? How?\n\nIf we start at turn65 at y=1, then we need to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn72 (which is t1+7). That means we have taken 7 actions? \n\nBut we have 8 freeways to climb: from 1 to 9: 8 steps. So we need 8 moves.\n\nBut the problem requires that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. \n\nThat means we must be at 9 at the start of turn65+H-1.\n\nWe start at turn65 at y=1.\n\nWe need to get to y=9 by the start of turn65+H-1.\n\nThe number of turns elapsed: (65+H-1) - 65 = H-1 turns.\n\nIn each turn, we can move at most 1. So we need at least 8 moves? But that would take 8 turns? Then we would be at 9 at turn65+8.\n\nBut the requirement is to be at 9 at turn65+H-1.\n\nTherefore, we require 65+H-1 = 65+8 => H-1=8 => H=9.\n\nThis suggests that we need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn65+8, so we have taken 7 actions? But then we would only have moved 7 steps? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the state y_t is the state at the end of turn t. \n\nBut the update rule is written as: y_{t+1} = y_t + ... which suggests that at the end of turn t, we are at y_t, and then we take action at turn t+1? That doesn't match.\n\nI think there is an error in the problem statement.\n\nGiven the confusion, I notice that the problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\" and that \"collision occurs at turn T only if ...\", and we are at freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nIn our simulation, we are safe at every turn we are on a freeway.\n\nAnd we are at 9 at turn73. \n\nBut the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", so if we set H=9, then we require y_{65+8}=9, which is turn73, which is indeed 9. \n\nAnd then the sequence of actions would be for t=0 to 8 (H=9 actions). \n\nBut then we would have 9 actions, but we only need 8 moves? \n\nAt turn65 (first action) we move from y=1 to y=2 at turn66.\n...\nAt turn72 (the 8th action) we move from y=8 to y=9 at turn73.\n\nThen at turn73 we are at 9. \n\nBut if we set H=9, then we are taking actions at turn65 to turn73? But at turn73 we are already at 9? Then we don't need to move? \n\nBut the problem requires an action for turn73.\n\nWe could do an extra action at turn73: but we are at 9, so we can do S (stay).\n\nBut that would be H=9, with the last action being S at turn73. \n\nBut then we are at 9 at turn74? And the requirement is y_{t1+H-1}=y_{65+8}=y_{73}=9? \n\nIf we do 8 actions (turn65 to turn72) then at turn73 we are at 9. But then we haven't taken an action at turn73. \n\nBut the problem requires a sequence of H actions, and we want y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nIf H=8, then t1+H-1 = 65+7=72. We want y_{72}=9. But in our plan, at turn72 we are at y=8, not 9. \n\nSo we are not at 9 at turn72.\n\nTo be at 9 at turn72, we would have to be at 9 at the beginning of turn72. That means we must have arrived at 9 by turn71.\n\nHow? \n   turn65: start at 1\n   turn66: 2\n   turn67: 3\n   turn68: 4\n   turn69: 5\n   turn70: 6\n   turn71: 7\n   turn72: 8 -> not 9.\n\nTo be at 9 at turn72, we must have moved faster? But we can only move one per turn.\n\nUnless we start at turn65 at 1, and then at turn66 we are at 2, ... turn72 we are at 8. We cannot be at 9 at turn72 unless we did 8 moves in 7 turns? Impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that the problem means we want to be at 9 at turn t1+H, and the condition \"y_{t1+H-}=9\" is a typo and should be \"y_{t1+H}=9\".\n\nOtherwise, it's impossible to reach 9 in less than 8 moves.\n\nGiven that, and since the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we can do it in 8 moves (with H=8 actions) and be at 9 at turn73, I think we should output the 8 U's.\n\nBut to match the problem's requirement, we might have to do an extra action.\n\nLet me assume that the problem means that after H actions, we are at 9 at turn t1+H. Then H=8.\n\nBut the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", so if we set H=8, then we require y_{72}=9, which is not true in our plan.\n\nAlternatively, if we set H=9, then we require y_{73}=9, which is true. Then we need to output 9 actions.\n\nWhat would the 9th action be? At turn73, we are at 9, so we can do S.\n\nThen the sequence would be: 8 U's and then one S at turn73.\n\nBut then H=9, and we are at 9 at turn73 (t1+8), and t1+H-1 = 65+9-1=73, so y_{73}=9. This matches.\n\nAnd the minimal H? But is there a way to be at 9 at an earlier turn? For example, turn72? But we cannot because it takes 8 moves to go from 1 to 9.\n\nSo the minimal H is 9? But that seems odd because we are including an extra stay at the end.\n\nBut the problem might require that we are at 9 at the turn we take the last action? That doesn't make sense because we take the action to move to 9.\n\nI think the intended meaning is that after the last action, we are at 9. But then the state after the last action is at turn t1+H, and we require that state to be 9. Then the condition should be y_{t1+H}=9, and then the last action is at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThen for us, H=8, and we have actions from turn65 to turn72, and at turn73 we are at 9.\n\nBut the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", which is not true for H=8 (y_{72}=8, not 9).\n\nTherefore, to satisfy the letter of the problem, we must have y_{72}=9. Which is impossible.\n\nUnless we can move faster? We cannot.\n\nPerhaps we start the action at turn65 and then we are at 2 at turn66, but the state at turn65 is 1, and we take the action to move to 2. The problem requires that at some turn we are at 9, and that turn must be t1+H-1.\n\nThe only way is to be at 9 at turn65+H-1.\n\nWe are at 1 at turn65.\n\nWe need to cover 8 units.\n\nIn H-1 turns, we can cover at most H-1 units.\n\nSo we need H-1>=8 => H>=9.\n\nSo minimal H=9.\n\nThen we must be at 9 at turn65+8=73? No, turn65+H-1 = 65+9-1=73. So we need to be at 9 at turn73.\n\nHow do we achieve that? \n   turn65: start at 1\n   turn66: 2\n   turn67: 3\n   turn68: 4\n   turn69: 5\n   turn70: 6\n   turn71: 7\n   turn72: 8\n   turn73: 9\n\nThen at turn73, we are at 9. So we need to have moved 8 times in 8 turns (from turn65 to turn72), and then at turn73 we are at 9. But we haven't taken an action at turn73 yet.\n\nWith H=9, we take actions at turn65,66,...,73.\n\nThe actions from turn65 to turn72: 8 U's to move from 1 to 9? But then at turn73 we are already at 9. Then the action at turn73 can be S.\n\nSo the sequence: 8 U's and then one S.\n\nAnd then at turn73 (t1+8) we are at 9, and we've taken 9 actions.\n\nAnd turn65+H-1 = 65+9-1=73, and y_{73}=9. Satisfied.\n\nAnd we only need to check freeways from turn65 to turn72, because at turn73 we are at y=9, no freeway.\n\nAt turn65: y=1 -> freeway1: safe\n...\nturn72: y=8 -> freeway8: [49+4*(72-65)=49+4*7=49+28=77, 60+28=88] -> safe.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, with actions: U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,S.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in H=8? Only if we can be at 9 at turn72, which we cannot.\n\nSo we output 9 actions.\n\nLet me write the actions:\n\nTurn 65: U\nTurn 66: U\nTurn 67: U\nTurn 68: U\nTurn 69: U\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: U\nTurn 72: U\nTurn 73: S\n\nBut wait, at turn73 we are at y=9, and we do S, which is allowed and we stay at 9. And then at turn74 we are still at 9, but we don't care because the last state we care about is at turn73.\n\nAnd the condition is met: at turn73 (t1+8) we are at 9.\n\nSo this satisfies the problem's requirement.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 65: U\nTurn 66: U\nTurn 67: U\nTurn 68: U\nTurn 69: U\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: U\nTurn 72: U\nTurn 73: S\n}\n\nBut is the S necessary? Could we not do the action at turn73? \n\nThe problem requires a sequence of H actions. If we only take 8 actions, then H=8, but then the last action is at turn72, and then we are at turn73 at 9, but the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1=65+7=72 we are at 9. But at turn72 we are at 8, not 9.\n\nSo we must take the extra action.\n\nAlternatively, could we reach 9 earlier by taking a different path? For example, by moving down and then up? But that would take more turns, so it would not be minimal.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9.\n\nBut let me confirm if we can be at 9 at an earlier turn by taking a different route. For example, if we could avoid some car by waiting, but in our case the direct route is safe, so there is no need to wait. And we cannot move faster than one per turn.\n\nSo the above is optimal.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 65\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,0) at turn t1=68 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes based on the car's direction and speed.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t1=68, and for future turns, I need to compute where the cars are based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list out all the cars for each freeway at t1=68:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head h=-48, tail τ=-71, direction right, speed s=24. Since it's right-moving, the span at time t is [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)]? Let me check the update rule.\n\nThe update says for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)]\n\nAt T=t1, it should be [τ, h], so yes, for right-moving, head is larger, so span is [tail, head], and it moves right, so positions increase.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: head h=-48, tail τ=-71, so at t1, span is [τ, h] = [-71, -48] for a right-moving car? But it says direction right, and head is -48, tail is -71, so tail is smaller, head is larger? -48 > -71, so yes, head is at -48, tail at -71, so as it moves right, both increase.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 1: car at t1: span [-71, -48], right, s=24\n\nFreeway 2: one car, h=-48, τ=-83, right, s=36 → span [-83, -48] at t1\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? h=-48, τ=-83, right, s=36 → span [-83, -48]\n\nFreeway 4: same, h=-48, τ=-83, right, s=36 → span [-83, -48]\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFor each, at t1:\n\nFirst car: h=48, τ=37, right, s=6 → span [37,48]\n\nSecond car: h=12, τ=1, right, s=6 → span [1,12]\n\nThird car: h=-24, τ=-35, right, s=6 → span [-35,-24]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6) → spans [37,48], [1,12], [-35,-24] at t1\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (48,37,right,12) → h=48, τ=37, right, s=12 → span [37,48] at t1\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (48,37,right,4) → h=48, τ=37, right, s=4 → span [37,48] at t1\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at turn t1=68.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is the top, but freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 might be safe, no cars, I assume.\n\nThe collision is only with cars on freeways y=1 to 8, so at y=0 and y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nBut the player needs to be at (0,9), so y=9 is the target.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of turns, I need to go up as fast as possible, but avoiding collisions when on y=1 to 8 at each turn.\n\nThe collision depends on whether at turn T, for the freeway y_T, there is a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, note that when you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you decide action to go to y_{T+1}. So at the moment of turn T, you are on y_T, and you check collision for freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nBut since you are on y_T at turn T, you only care about cars on y_T at turn T for collision.\n\nThe collision condition is: at turn T, if player is on freeway k (y_T = k), and for that freeway, there exists a car such that 0 is in Span(T) for that car.\n\nSpan(T) is the position interval at time T.\n\nNow, for each freeway and each car, I need to find when 0 is in their span as a function of time.\n\nLet t be the time since t1, so at turn t1 + t, time T = t1 + t, so T - t1 = t.\n\nFor each car, Span at time t (relative) can be found.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1: one car, right-moving, s=24, span at t1: [τ, h] = [-71, -48]\n\nAt time t, Span(t) = [τ + s*t, h + s*t] = [-71 + 24t, -48 + 24t]\n\n0 in span if -71 + 24t <= 0 <= -48 + 24t\n\nSo -71 + 24t <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 24t\n\nFirst: -71 + 24t <= 0 => 24t <= 71 => t <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 24t => 24t >= 48 => t >= 2\n\nSo t >= 2 and t <= 2.958, since t integer, t=2 or t=3? t=2: -48 + 24*2 = -48 + 48 = 0, so 0 <= 0, which is equal, so 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, t=3: -71 + 24*3 = -71 + 72 =1, and -48+72=24, so [1,24], 0 not in.\n\nt=2: [-71+48, -48+48] = [-23, 0], 0 is included since it's <= and >=.\n\nSimilarly, t=1: [-71+24, -48+24] = [-47, -24], 0 not in.\n\nt=0: [-71,-48], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision if player is on y=1 at t=2 or t=3? t is time since t1, so at turn t1+2 or t1+3, but only if on freeway 1.\n\nt=2: turn t1+2, span [-23,0], 0 in.\n\nt=3: turn t1+3, span [1,24], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at turn t1+2, if on freeway 1, collision possible.\n\nNow for freeway 2: car with h=-48, τ=-83, right, s=36\n\nSpan at t: [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-83 + 36t, -48 + 36t]\n\n0 in span: -83 + 36t <= 0 <= -48 + 36t\n\nFirst: -83 + 36t <= 0 => 36t <= 83 => t <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 36t => 36t >= 48 => t >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333\n\nSo t >= 2 (since t integer) and t <= 2.305, so t=2\n\nt=2: -83 + 72 = -11, -48 + 72 = 24, span [-11,24], 0 in.\n\nt=1: -83+36= -47, -48+36= -12, span [-47,-12], 0 not in.\n\nt=3: -83+108=25, -48+108=60, span [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at t=2, collision if on freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2, since same car parameters. So only collision at t=2 if on y=3.\n\nFreeway 4: same, only at t=2 if on y=4.\n\nNow freeway 5: three cars.\n\nFirst car: h=48, τ=37, right, s=6\n\nSpan at t: [37 + 6t, 48 + 6t]\n\n0 in span? 37+6t <= 0 <= 48+6t? 37+6t <=0 only if t negative, but t>=0, min at t=0 is 37>0, so never <=0, so 0 never in span. Safe for this car.\n\nSecond car: h=12, τ=1, right, s=6\n\nSpan: [1 + 6t, 12 + 6t]\n\n1+6t <=0? 1+6t >=1>0, so never <=0, 0 not in span.\n\nThird car: h=-24, τ=-35, right, s=6\n\nSpan: [-35 + 6t, -24 + 6t]\n\n0 in span: -35+6t <=0 <= -24+6t\n\nFirst: -35+6t <=0 => 6t <=35 => t <= 35/6 ≈ 5.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24+6t => 6t >=24 => t >=4\n\nSo t>=4 and t<=5.833, so t=4,5,6? t=4: -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nt=5: -35+30= -5, -24+30=6, span [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nt=6: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for third car, collision if 0 in span at t=4 and t=5.\n\nBut freeway 5 has multiple cars, so collision if any car has 0 in span.\n\nFirst two cars never have 0 in span, only third car has at t=4 and t=5.\n\nSo for freeway 5, collision if player on y=5 at t=4 or t=5 (relative to t1).\n\nt=4: turn t1+4, t=5: turn t1+5.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5, since same cars. So collision on y=6 at t=4 and t=5.\n\nFreeway 7: one car, h=48, τ=37, right, s=12\n\nSpan: [37 + 12t, 48 + 12t]\n\n37+12t >=37>0, so 0 never in span. Safe.\n\nFreeway 8: one car, h=48, τ=37, right, s=4\n\nSpan: [37 + 4t, 48 + 4t]\n\nSimilarly, min 37>0, so never 0 in span. Safe.\n\nSummary of collision times:\n\n- Freeway 1: unsafe at t=2 (turn t1+2)\n\n- Freeway 2: unsafe at t=2\n\n- Freeway 3: unsafe at t=2\n\n- Freeway 4: unsafe at t=2\n\n- Freeway 5: unsafe at t=4 and t=5\n\n- Freeway 6: unsafe at t=4 and t=5\n\n- Freeway 7: always safe\n\n- Freeway 8: always safe\n\nt is time since t1, so at absolute turn:\n\nUnsafe:\n\n- y=1 at turn 70 (t1+2=68+2=70)\n\n- y=2 at turn 70\n\n- y=3 at turn 70\n\n- y=4 at turn 70? Freeway 4 unsafe at t=2, turn 70.\n\nFreeway 4 is y=4.\n\n- y=5 at turn 72 and 73 (t1+4=72, t1+5=73)\n\n- y=6 at turn 72 and 73\n\ny=7 and y=8 always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at turn t1=68.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 asap.\n\nEach move can change y by -1,0,+1.\n\nTo minimize turns, we should go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no freeway.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nThe minimal time to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9 turns if we go up every turn, but we might need to wait or detour to avoid collisions.\n\nSince we can only change by 1 per turn, it takes at least 9 turns to go from 0 to 9.\n\nBut we might have to avoid certain positions at certain times.\n\nNow, the unsafe times are concentrated at turn 70 for y=1,2,3,4 and turns 72,73 for y=5,6.\n\ny=7 and 8 are always safe.\n\nSince we start at turn 68, let's list the turns: turn 68: y=0\n\nTurn 69: after first action\n\nTurn 70: after second action\n\n...\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWe need to set y at each turn.\n\nAt turn T, y_T is position, then we take action a_T to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nBut collision is checked at turn T based on y_T and the cars on that freeway at time T.\n\nFor turn T, position y_T, if y_T between 1 and 8, check if freeway y_T has collision at time T.\n\nTime T is absolute turn number.\n\nt1=68.\n\nSo at turn T, if player is on freeway k, check if for that freeway, at turn T, 0 in some car's span.\n\nNow, from above:\n\nUnsafe positions:\n\n- At turn 70: y=1,2,3,4 are unsafe. Because freeways 1,2,3,4 all unsafe at turn 70.\n\n- At turn 72: y=5 and y=6 unsafe\n\n- At turn 73: y=5 and y=6 unsafe\n\n- Other times, y=1,2,3,4,5,6 may be safe, except at those turns.\n\ny=7 and 8 always safe.\n\nWe start at turn 68, y=0.\n\nTurn 68: y=0, safe, since not on freeway.\n\nWe take action to go to y=1 or stay or down, but down to y=0 or negative? y must be in [0,9], so at y=0, we can go to y=0 or y=1.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, to y=8 or 9.\n\nBut since we want to go up, probably not down.\n\nMinimal path: go up every turn: from y=0 at t=68 to y=1 at t=69, y=2 at t=70, but at t=70, if y=2, which is freeway 2, and turn 70 is unsafe for y=2, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=1 at t=69, then at t=69, y=1, is it safe?\n\nAt turn t=69, relative t=1 (since t1=68, T - t1 =1)\n\nFor freeway 1 at t=1: we had span [-47,-24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 at t=1: span [-47,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nFreeway 3: same, safe.\n\nFreeway 4: at t=1, for freeway 4, which has car with s=36, span at t=1: [-83+36, -48+36] = [-47,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nFreeway 5 at t=1: for third car, span [-35+6, -24+6] = [-29,-18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly all others.\n\nSo at turn 69, all freeways are safe, since no collision times at t=1.\n\nNow, turn 70: t=2, y=2,3,4 unsafe, y=1 also unsafe, as per above.\n\ny=1 unsafe at t=2, turn 70.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nIf we go up each turn:\n\nTurn 68: y=0, safe\n\nAction U to y=1 at turn 69? At turn 68, we take action a_{t1} = a_{68}, which determines y_{69}.\n\nPosition at turn T: y_T.\n\nAt turn 68: y=0, take action a_{68}, then y_{69} = y_{68} + Δy\n\nThen at turn 69, we are at y_{69}, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T if y_T between 1 and 8 and freeway y_T has 0 in span at turn T.\n\nFor the sequence:\n\nStart turn 68: y=0, safe. Take action, say U, then y_{69} =1\n\nTurn 69: y=1, now check collision. Turn 69 is T=69, t=69-68=1, freeway 1 at t=1: span [-47,-24], 0 not in, safe. So no collision.\n\nThen take action, if U, y_{70} =2\n\nTurn 70: y=2, turn T=70, t=2, freeway 2: at t=2, span [-11,24], 0 in, so collision! Not good.\n\nIf at turn 69, after being at y=1, we take S, stay, then y_{70}=1\n\nTurn 70: y=1, turn 70, freeway 1 at t=2: span [-23,0], 0 in, collision.\n\nIf take D, y_{70}=0, then at turn 70, y=0, safe, but we are going down, not towards 9.\n\nSo at turn 70, we cannot be on y=1,2,3,4 because all unsafe.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=1,2,3,4 at turn 70.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 72 and 73, avoid y=5 and y=6.\n\nNow, to go from y=0 to y=9, we need to cross the freeways.\n\nSince turn 70 is problematic for low y, and we start at turn 68, we might delay going up or go up faster to skip.\n\nBut we can only move one step per turn.\n\nLet me list possible y at each turn.\n\nTurn 68: y=0 (fixed)\n\nAfter action at turn 68, y at turn 69.\n\ny_{69} can be 0 or 1.\n\nCase 1: y_{69} =1\n\nThen at turn 69, y=1, which is safe as we saw.\n\nNow, we need to set y_{70} by action at turn 69.\n\nBut y_{70} cannot be 1,2,3,4 because unsafe at turn 70.\n\ny_{70} can be 0, or 5,6,7,8? But from y=1, we can only go to y=0,1,2.\n\nCannot jump to higher y.\n\nSo from y=1, actions: U to y=2, D to y=0, S to y=1.\n\nBut at turn 70, y=1,2 are unsafe, and y=0 is safe.\n\nSo only possible is to go to y=0 at turn 70.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, but we are moving away from goal.\n\nThen from there, we need to go up later.\n\nCase 2: at turn 68, take S or D, but D to y= -1 invalid, so only S, y_{69}=0.\n\nThen turn 69: y=0, safe.\n\nThen take action to y_{70}.\n\ny_{70} can be 0 or 1.\n\nBut at turn 70, y=1 is unsafe, so cannot go to y=1.\n\nThus must stay at y=0 at turn 70.\n\nSo in both cases, whether we go to y=1 at turn 69 or stay at y=0, at turn 70 we must be at y=0 to avoid collision.\n\nIf we go to y=1 at turn 69, then to avoid y=1 at turn 70, we must go down to y=0 at turn 70.\n\nIf we stay at y=0 at turn 69, then at turn 70, to avoid y=1, we must stay at y=0 or go down, but down invalid, so stay at y=0.\n\nSo essentially, at turn 70, we must be at y=0.\n\nNow, after that, we need to go up.\n\nBut we also have unsafe times at turn 72 and 73 for y=5 and y=6.\n\nNow, turn 70: y=0\n\nTurn 71: we can go to y=1 or stay.\n\nFirst, let's see when we can be on which freeway.\n\nTurn 71: T=71, t=71-68=3\n\nNow, check for each freeway if unsafe at t=3.\n\nFreeway 1 at t=3: earlier, span [1,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nFreeway 2: t=3, span [25,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nFreeway 3: same, safe.\n\nFreeway 4: same, safe.\n\nFreeway 5: t=3, for third car, span [-35+18, -24+18] = [-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nFreeway 6: same.\n\nFreeway 7,8 safe.\n\nSo at turn 71, all freeways are safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 72: t=4, which is unsafe for y=5 and y=6.\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe at t=4 and t=5\n\nt=4: turn 72\n\nFreeway 6: same.\n\nOther freeways: freeway 1 at t=4: span [-71+96, -48+96] = [25,48], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, all others safe except y=5 and y=6 at t=4 and t=5.\n\nt=4 and t=5 for relative, absolute turn 72 and 73.\n\nTurn 73: t=5, unsafe for y=5 and y=6.\n\nTurn 74: t=6, for freeway 5, third car span [1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly all safe.\n\nBack to path.\n\nAt turn 70, we are at y=0.\n\nNow, we need to go up.\n\nTo reach y=9 in min turns, we should go up as fast as possible from now.\n\nBut we have to avoid y=5 and y=6 at turns 72 and 73.\n\nNow, let's list the turns from turn 70 onwards.\n\nTurn 70: y=0\n\nWe take action at turn 70 to set y_{71}.\n\ny_{71} can be 0 or 1.\n\nBoth are possible since turn 71 all safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 71: set y_{72}, and so on.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince we start from y=0 at turn 70, to y=9, min 9 turns, so at turn 79, y=9 if we go up every turn from turn 70.\n\nBut we might reach earlier if we were higher, but we are at y=0 turn 70.\n\nTurn 70: y=0\n\nIf we go up every turn:\n\nTurn 70: y=0, take U, y_{71}=1\n\nTurn 71: y=1, take U, y_{72}=2\n\nBut turn 72: y=2, which is freeway 2, and turn 72 is t=4? T=72, t=72-68=4.\n\nFreeway 2 at t=4: for freeway 2, car with s=36, span at t=4: [-83 + 36*4, -48 + 36*4] = [-83 + 144, -48 + 144] = [61,96], 0 not in, so safe. Earlier I said only unsafe at t=2, so at t=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1,3,4 all safe at t=4.\n\nOnly y=5 and y=6 unsafe at t=4 (turn 72).\n\ny=2 is freeway 2, which is safe at turn 72.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 71: y=1, safe\n\nTake U to y_{72}=2\n\nTurn 72: y=2, now freeway 2 at turn 72 (t=4), span as above, 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen take U to y_{73}=3\n\nTurn 73: y=3, freeway 3 at turn 73 (t=5), t=5, freeway 3: car span at t=5: [-83 + 36*5, -48 + 36*5] = [-83+180, -48+180] = [97,132], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen take U to y_{74}=4\n\nTurn 74: y=4, freeway 4 at t=6: span [-83+216, -48+216] = [133,168], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen take U to y_{75}=5\n\nTurn 75: y=5, now freeway 5 at turn 75 (t=7), t=7, third car span [-35 +42, -24+42] = [7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, take U to y_{76}=6\n\nTurn 76: y=6, freeway 6 at t=8, similar, safe.\n\nU to y_{77}=7\n\nU to y_{78}=8\n\nU to y_{79}=9\n\nAt turn 79, y=9, goal.\n\nNow, how many turns? From turn 70 to turn 79 is 10 turns? Let's count.\n\nTurn 70: y=0\n\nAfter actions: we take actions from turn 70 to turn 78 to reach y=9 at turn 79.\n\nThe sequence: actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1 to reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn this case, we start from turn 68.\n\nBut we were forced to be at y=0 at turn 70.\n\nNow, from turn 68 to turn 70: we have two actions.\n\nTurn 68: y=0, take action.\n\nIf we take S, y_{69}=0\n\nThen turn 69: y=0, take S, y_{70}=0\n\nOr take U at turn 68, y_{69}=1\n\nThen turn 69: y=1, take D, y_{70}=0\n\nEither way, at turn 70, y=0.\n\nNow, from there, to reach y=9 at turn 79 as above.\n\nBut turn 79 is t1 + 11? t1=68, turn 79 is 68+11=79, so H=11? Let's see the turns.\n\nPlayer position at turn T:\n\nTurn 68: y=0\n\nTurn 69: y=0 or 1, but we end up at y=0 at turn 70.\n\nIn the path above, from turn 70: y=0\n\nTurn 71: y=1 (after U at turn 70)\n\nTurn 72: y=2\n\nTurn 73: y=3\n\nTurn 74: y=4\n\nTurn 75: y=5\n\nTurn 76: y=6\n\nTurn 77: y=7\n\nTurn 78: y=8\n\nTurn 79: y=9\n\nSo at turn 79, y=9.\n\nNow, actions: to go from y_T to y_{T+1}\n\nAt turn 68: we need to set y_{69}, but we have choices to reach y_{70}=0.\n\nSimilarly, actions from turn 68 to turn 78 to have y_{79}=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 68 to turn 78, that's 11 actions? Turns: actions at turn t affect y_{t+1}.\n\nDefine:\n\nLet S be the turn index.\n\nAt turn S, we are at position y_S, then take action a_S, go to y_{S+1} = y_S + Δy_S.\n\nAt turn S, collision based on y_S.\n\nGoal: for some H, after H actions, at turn t1 + H, y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nt1=68.\n\nSet y_{68} =0.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{68+H} =9.\n\nMin H.\n\nIn the path above, if we reach y=9 at turn 79, then 68 + H =79, so H=11.\n\nBut we might reach faster by avoiding the unsafe zones differently.\n\nFor example, at turn 70, we are at y=0, but if we can be higher earlier, but we cannot because at turn 70 we must be at y=0.\n\nTurn 68 to 70: we can be at y=0 at turn 69 or 70, but at turn 70 must be y=0.\n\nNow, from turn 70 y=0, we go to y=1 at turn 71, etc.\n\nBut we have the issue at turns 72 and 73 with y=5 and y=6 unsafe.\n\nIn the path above, at turn 75 y=5 and turn 76 y=6, which are after turn 73, so safe.\n\nBut can we go faster?\n\nFor example, from y=0 at turn 70, we go up to y=1 turn 71, y=2 turn 72, y=3 turn 73, y=4 turn 74, y=5 turn 75, etc.\n\nAt turn 72, y=2, which is fine, safe.\n\nAt turn 73, y=3, safe.\n\nBut if we want to go faster to y=5, but at turn 72 and 73, y=5 and y=6 are unsafe, so we cannot be there at those turns.\n\nFor example, if we were at higher y earlier, but we are stuck at low y.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 and y=8 are always safe, we could go directly to them if possible, but we can only move one step per turn.\n\nTo reach y=9 faster, we need to start going up earlier, but at turn 70 we are forced to be at y=0.\n\nPerhaps we can go up to y=1 at turn 69, but then at turn 70 we have to go down to y=0, which wastes a turn.\n\nStaying at y=0 also wastes time.\n\nBut it seems necessary.\n\nNow, about the later unsafe times.\n\nIn the path above, we reach y=9 at turn 79 with H=11 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nActions from turn 68 to turn 78.\n\nFirst, to have y_{70}=0.\n\nOption 1: at turn 68, take S, so y_{69}=0\n\nThen at turn 69, take S, y_{70}=0\n\nOption 2: at turn 68, take U, y_{69}=1\n\nThen at turn 69, take D, y_{70}=0\n\nIn both cases, we have two actions to stay at y=0.\n\nThen from turn 70: y=0\n\nTake U, y_{71}=1\n\nTurn 71: y=1, take U, y_{72}=2\n\nTurn 72: y=2, take U, y_{73}=3\n\nTurn 73: y=3, take U, y_{74}=4\n\nTurn 74: y=4, take U, y_{75}=5\n\nTurn 75: y=5, take U, y_{76}=6\n\nTurn 76: y=6, take U, y_{77}=7\n\nTurn 77: y=7, take U, y_{78}=8\n\nTurn 78: y=8, take U, y_{79}=9\n\nNow, at turn 79, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 68 to 78, 11 actions: a68 to a78.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut can we reach faster by not going through y=5 and y=6 at unsafe times, but in this case we avoid them since we are at y=5 at turn 75, after turn 73.\n\nTurn 75 is t=7, which is fine.\n\nBut we have to go through all y, so min 9 steps from y=0 to y=9, but we have two wasted turns at the beginning.\n\nAt turn 68 and 69, we are not moving up.\n\nIn option 1, we take S at 68 and S at 69, so no progress.\n\nIn option 2, we go up to 1 at 69, then down to 0 at 70, so net no progress.\n\nSo we lose two turns.\n\nThen 9 turns to go up, total 11 turns.\n\nBut perhaps we can go up faster later or avoid waiting.\n\nAnother idea: since y=5 and y=6 are unsafe only at turns 72 and 73, we could be at y=5 before or after.\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=4 at turn 72, then go to y=5 at turn 73, but turn 73 y=5 is unsafe, so cannot.\n\ny=5 unsafe at turn 72 and 73.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=5 at turn 72 or 73.\n\nSimilarly for y=6.\n\nTherefore, we must be on y=5 at some turn not 72 or 73.\n\nSimilarly for y=6.\n\nIn the path above, we are on y=5 at turn 75, which is fine.\n\nBut we are starting from y=0 at turn 70.\n\nNow, to reach y=5, from y=0, min 5 turns, so at turn 75 if start from turn 70.\n\nSimilarly, to y=9 at turn 79.\n\nBut if we could be higher than y=0 at turn 70, but we cannot.\n\nUnless we find a way to not be forced to y=0 at turn 70.\n\nBut earlier analysis suggests we must be at y=0 at turn 70 to avoid collision.\n\nPerhaps at turn 69, we go to y=1, and at turn 70, instead of going down, we could go up to y=2, but at turn 70, y=2 is unsafe, collision.\n\nGo to y=3,4, but from y=1, cannot, only to 0,1,2.\n\nSo impossible to be above y=0 at turn 70 safely.\n\nThus, must be at y=0 at turn 70.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's see if we can save time with the later unsafe zones.\n\nFor example, from turn 70 y=0, we go up to y=1 at turn 71, y=2 at turn 72.\n\nNow at turn 72, y=2, safe.\n\nInstead of going to y=3 at turn 73, we could go directly, but we have to go step by step.\n\ny=7 and 8 are safe, so if we can reach them faster.\n\nBut to reach y=7, from y=0, min 7 turns.\n\nFrom turn 70: y=0\n\nTurn 71: y=1\n\nTurn 72: y=2\n\nTurn 73: y=3 (since y=3 at turn 73 is safe, as above)\n\nTurn 74: y=4\n\nTurn 75: y=5\n\nTurn 76: y=6\n\nBut at turn 76, y=6, which is after turn 73, so safe, turn 76 t=8, freeway 6 safe.\n\nThen y=7 turn 77, y=8 turn 78, y=9 turn 79, same as before.\n\nAfter turn 72 y=2, we can go up to y=3 at turn 73, but turn 73 is t=5, y=3 is freeway 3, which is safe, as span [97,132], 0 not in.\n\nThen to y=4 turn 74, y=5 turn 75, etc.\n\nBut at turn 75 y=5, which is fine.\n\nBut we cannot skip y=5 or anything.\n\nPerhaps we can stay at some point to avoid the unsafe times, but in this case, since y=5 and y=6 unsafe only at 72 and 73, and we are not there, no need.\n\nAnother thought: since y=7 and 8 are always safe, we could go to y=7 as soon as possible, but we still have to go through lower levels.\n\nMinimal path is fixed.\n\nBut we have the actions at the beginning.\n\nIn the action sequence, we need to specify the actions from turn 68.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nH=11, with y=9 at turn 79.\n\nNow, about the unsafe times: at turn 72 and 73, y=5 and y=6 are unsafe, but in our path, we are not there, so ok.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have y=5 at turn 75, which is fine.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose at turn 68, we take U, go to y=1 at turn 69.\n\nThen at turn 69, instead of going down, but we have to, because at turn 70, y=1 is unsafe.\n\nUnless we can be at a different y at turn 70.\n\nBut from y=1 at turn 69, we can only be at y=0,1,2 at turn 70, all unsafe except y=0.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nThus, H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see the number of turns.\n\nStart: turn 68, y=0\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 68+H, y=9.\n\nWith H=11, turn 79 y=9.\n\nIs there a way with H=10?\n\nThen at turn 78, y=9.\n\nTurn 78 = 68 +10.\n\ny=9 at turn 78.\n\nThat means we need to reach y=9 at turn 78.\n\nFrom turn 68 to turn 78, 10 steps.\n\ny from 0 to 9, delta 9, so must go up 9 times and no down or stay, so exactly 9 up actions, and one extra action which must be stay or down, but down not useful.\n\nIf we have one stay, then we need 10 actions to gain 9, but at turn 78 y=9.\n\nBut at turn 70, we must be at y=0, which is turn 70 = 68 +2, so after 2 actions, we are at y=0.\n\nFrom turn 68 to turn 70: two actions.\n\nIf both S, or U then D, we are at y=0 at turn 70.\n\nNow, from turn 70 to turn 78: 8 turns.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=9, min 9 steps, but in 8 turns, we can reach at most y=8 if we go up every turn.\n\nTurn 70: y=0\n\nAfter action at turn 70, y71\n\n...\n\nAfter action at turn 77, y78\n\nTo have y78=9, we need to go from y70=0 to y78=9 in 8 steps.\n\nEach step +1 max, so y78 <= y70 + 8 = 8, so y78 <=8, cannot be 9.\n\ny78 is position at turn 78.\n\nAfter 8 actions from turn 70 to 77, y78 = y70 + sum Δy <= 0 + 8 =8 <9, so impossible to reach y=9 at turn 78.\n\nSimilarly, to reach at turn 79, we need 9 actions from turn 70 to 78 to go to y79=9.\n\nWith y70=0, y79=9, requires 9 up actions, no down or stay.\n\nIn the sequence, from turn 70 to 78, we have actions: 70 to 78, 9 actions, all U, to go from y70=0 to y79=9 via y71=1 to y78=8, y79=9.\n\ny at turn: after actions.\n\nTurn 70: y=0\n\na70: U, y71=1\n\na71: U, y72=2\n\n...\n\na77: U, y78=8\n\na78: U, y79=9\n\nYes, 9 actions from turn 70 to 78.\n\nBut we also have actions at turn 68 and 69 to get to y70=0.\n\nWith two actions: a68 and a69.\n\nFor example, a68: S, then y69=0\n\na69: S, y70=0\n\nOr a68: U, y69=1\n\na69: D, y70=0\n\nThen a70 to a78 all U.\n\nTotal actions: a68 to a78, 11 actions.\n\nIf we could reach y70 >0, but we cannot, so H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the beginning, we can choose how to get to y70=0.\n\nFor example, we can take the stay-stay or up-down.\n\nSince we want to minimize time, and both are same, we can choose either.\n\nPerhaps up-down is better because we \"explore\" but no benefit.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, we need to output the actions.\n\nNow, also, for the later part, we need to make sure we don't hit y=5 or y=6 at turns 72 or 73.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 72, y=2, turn 73 y=3, not 5 or 6.\n\nThen y=5 at turn 75, turn 76 y=6, both safe.\n\nTurn 75 is t=7, turn 76 t=8, freeway 5 and 6 safe at those times.\n\nNow, about freeway 5 and 6 at other times, but since we are only there at turn 75 and 76, should be fine.\n\nTo be thorough, let's list the y at each turn and check collision.\n\nTurn | y | Check collision? | Freeway | t relative | Span for that freeway | 0 in span?\n\nt1=68\n\nTurn 68: y=0, no freeway, safe\n\nTurn 69: y=0 or 1, depending on action.\n\nFirst, let's pick a sequence.\n\nFor example, option: at turn 68, take S, so y69=0\n\nThen turn 69: y=0, safe, take S, y70=0\n\nThen turn 70: y=0, safe\n\nTake U, y71=1\n\nTurn 71: y=1, freeway 1, t=3, span [1,24], 0 not in, safe\n\nTake U, y72=2\n\nTurn 72: y=2, freeway 2, t=4, span [61,96], 0 not in, safe\n\nTake U, y73=3\n\nTurn 73: y=3, freeway 3, t=5, span [97,132], 0 not in, safe\n\nTake U, y74=4\n\nTurn 74: y=4, freeway 4, t=6, span [133,168], 0 not in, safe\n\nTake U, y75=5\n\nTurn 75: y=5, freeway 5, t=7, now cars on freeway 5: at t=7, first car span [37+42,48+42]= [79,90], 0 not in; second [1+42,12+42]=[43,54], 0 not; third [-35+42,-24+42]=[7,18], 0 not in, so safe\n\nTake U, y76=6\n\nTurn 76: y=6, freeway 6, t=8, similar, spans [37+48,48+48]=[85,96], [1+48,12+48]=[49,60], [-35+48,-24+48]=[13,24], all >0, 0 not in, safe\n\nTake U, y77=7\n\nTurn 77: y=7, freeway 7, t=9, car span [37+108,48+108]=[145,156], 0 not in, safe\n\nTake U, y78=8\n\nTurn 78: y=8, freeway 8, t=10, car span [37+40,48+40]=[77,88], 0 not in, safe\n\nTake U, y79=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nWith the other option: turn 68 take U, y69=1\n\nTurn 69: y=1, freeway 1, t=1, span [-47,-24], 0 not in, safe\n\nThen take D, y70=0\n\nTurn 70: y=0, safe\n\nThen same as before.\n\nIn this case, at turn 69, we are at y=1, which is fine.\n\nBut in both, we reach at turn 79.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to output actions starting from turn t1=68.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t1: a_{t1}, Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, ..., up to the action before reaching y=9.\n\nSince y_{79}=9 after a78, so actions from a68 to a78.\n\nH=11 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, we have 11 actions.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nWe can choose either beginning sequence.\n\nPerhaps the stay-stay is simpler.\n\nOr up-down, but down might seem counterintuitive, but it works.\n\nIn the context, since we need to avoid, it's fine.\n\nNow, for the minimal H, it is 11.\n\nBut is there a way to avoid the two wasted turns?\n\nSuppose at turn 68, we take U, go to y=1 at turn 69.\n\nThen at turn 69, we take S, stay at y=1 for turn 70? But at turn 70, y=1 is unsafe, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nTake U to y=2 at turn 70, but y=2 unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, output the sequence.\n\nLet me use the first option: all necessary, but with S at beginning.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 68: S  (y69=0)\n\nTurn 69: S  (y70=0)\n\nTurn 70: U  (y71=1)\n\nTurn 71: U  (y72=2)\n\nTurn 72: U  (y73=3)\n\nTurn 73: U  (y74=4)\n\nTurn 74: U  (y75=5)\n\nTurn 75: U  (y76=6)\n\nTurn 76: U  (y77=7)\n\nTurn 77: U  (y78=8)\n\nTurn 78: U  (y79=9)\n\nIn the sequence, actions from turn 68 to turn 78.\n\nTurn 78 action leads to y79=9.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed as Turn t1: a_{t1}, etc.\n\nt1=68.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 68: S\n\nTurn 69: S\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nNow, H=11.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the player reaches (0,9) at turn 79, which is after 11 actions.\n\nSince we need to include up to the action that reaches it.\n\nIn the sequence, after a78, y79=9.\n\nSo the actions are from t=0 to H-1, here t from 0 to 10, H=11.\n\nIn the problem: sequence {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach at turn t1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nReach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, at turn 79, which is t1 + 11, so t1 + H -1 = 68 + H -1 =79, so 68 + H -1 =79, thus H-1=11, H=12? No.\n\nt1 + H -1 =79\n\nt1=68, so 68 + H -1 =79\n\n67 + H =79\n\nH=12? That can't be.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nLet me read the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), avoiding collisions...\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nIn the sequence, actions at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, and after these H actions, the position is at turn t1 + H.\n\nDefine:\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn t1, position y_{t1}\n\nAfter 1 action (a_{t1}), at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t1 + k, position y_{t1 + k}\n\nWe want y_{t1 + k} =9 for some k, and k is the number of actions taken.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, so H actions, reach at turn t1 + H.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nLet me see the text.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd in the answer format: Turn t1: a_{t1}, Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, ..., up to some turn.\n\nAlso, \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nIn the initial: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nYes.\n\nSo reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nIn my earlier, at turn 79, y=9, which is t1 + 11, since 68+11=79.\n\nSo t1 + H -1 =79\n\n68 + H -1 =79\n\n67 + H =79\n\nH=12\n\nBut with H actions, we reach at turn t1 + H.\n\nt1 + H =79, so H=11.\n\nBut according to the text, reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nLet me parse.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1, meaning a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter these H actions, the position is at turn t1 + H.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nPerhaps I misread.\n\nLook: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1 + H, but it says reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nThat would mean that after H-1 actions, we reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nLet's see the index.\n\nSet T = t1 + t for the action index.\n\nActions at time T for T = t1, t1+1, ..., up to t1 + H -1? The sequence is a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1 + H -1}, that's H actions.\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + k} for k=0 to H-1, we go to position at turn (t1 + k) + 1 = t1 + k +1.\n\nAfter all H actions, we are at turn t1 + H.\n\nBut we want position at some turn to be (0,9).\n\nThe reaching turn is when y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, after action a_{t1 + H -1}, we go to position at turn t1 + H.\n\nSo at turn t1 + H, y=9.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nContradiction.\n\nPerhaps H is defined differently.\n\n\"the minimal number of turns H\" — H is the number of turns? But \"turns\" might be ambiguous.\n\nRead carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H\"\n\nAnd \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nAnd \"to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nThis implies that after the actions, we reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nBut with actions from t=0 to H-1, after action at t1 + (H-1), we go to position at (t1 + H-1) +1 = t1 + H.\n\nBut it says reach at turn t1 + H -1, which is before the last action? Confusing.\n\nPerhaps the actions are taken, and at turn t1 + H -1, after the action, we are at (0,9).\n\nLet's see the player update.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position y_T, take action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nSo at turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter taking a_T, we move to y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe sequence of actions a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1} will affect positions from y_{t1+1} to y_{t1+H}.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Start at turn t1, y_{t1} given.\n\n- After a_{t1}, y_{t1+1} set.\n\n- After a_{t1+1}, y_{t1+2} set.\n\n- ...\n\n- After a_{t1+H-1}, y_{t1+H} set.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} =9? But the text says reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nLet me find in the problem.\n\nIn the task: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nBut according to the dynamics, at turn t1 + H -1, we are at position y_{t1 + H -1}, which is set by previous actions, and we take action a_{t1 + H -1} to go to y_{t1 + H}.\n\nIf we reach at turn t1 + H -1, that means y_{t1 + H -1} =9, and then we take action, but we may not care about after.\n\nIn the sequence, the actions include up to a_{t1 + H -1}, which is taken at turn t1 + H -1 to go to y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut if we reach at turn t1 + H -1, y=9, then the action at that turn might move us away, but the reaching is at that turn.\n\nIn the answer format, it lists actions from turn t1 to some turn.\n\nFor example, in this case, we want y_{79} =9.\n\ny_{79} is set after action a_{78}.\n\na_{78} is taken at turn 78 to set y_{79}.\n\nSo to have y_{79}=9, we need actions up to a_{78}, which is at turn t1 + 10, since t1=68, turn 78=68+10.\n\nt1 + t for t=0 to 10? t from 0 to 10 is 11 actions.\n\nBut reach at turn 79 = t1 + 11.\n\nt1 + H -1 =79\n\n68 + H -1 =79\n\nH-1=11, H=12\n\nThen the sequence has H=12 actions, from t=0 to 11, a_{68} to a_{79}? But a_{79} would be at turn 79 to set y_{80}, which is not necessary.\n\nI think there is a confusion in the indexing.\n\nPerhaps \"turns H\" means the number of game turns from start to finish, including the start or not.\n\nTo resolve, let's look at the answer format.\n\n\"Turn t1: a_{t1}\"\n\n\"Turn t1 + 1: a_{t1+1}\"\n\n...\n\nup to the turn where after the action, we reach.\n\nBut the sequence is given for the actions taken at each turn until the reaching turn.\n\nIn the box, it says \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\" etc., and the last action is when we reach.\n\nBut in the text, it says \"reach at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAssume that after the sequence of H actions, we reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, with one action: at turn t1, take a_{t1}, go to y_{t1+1}, so if y_{t1+1}=9, we reach at turn t1+1, which is t1 + 1 = t1 + H -1, so H-1=1, H=2.\n\nH=2 actions to reach at turn t1+1 with one action? Messy.\n\nPerhaps H is the number of actions.\n\nIn this case, to reach at turn 79, which is 11 turns after t1, since t1 to t79 is 11 steps? Turns from 68 to 79 inclusive is 12 turns, but positions.\n\nLet's count the turns.\n\nAt turn 68: start\n\nTurn 69: after one action\n\n...\n\nTurn 79: after 11 actions.\n\nSo after 11 actions, at turn 79, y=9.\n\nThe reaching turn is turn 79.\n\nturn 79 = t1 + 11.\n\nt1 + H -1 =79\n\n68 + H -1 =79\n\nH-1=11\n\nH=12\n\nThen the sequence has H actions from t=0 to H-1, so for H=12, actions from t=0 to 11, a68 to a79.\n\nBut a79 is at turn 79 to set y80, which is not needed.\n\nIf we reach at turn 79, y79=9, then no action needed at turn 79.\n\nThe last action is at turn 78 to set y79.\n\nSo the actions are from turn t1 to the turn before reaching.\n\nIn the sequence, for reaching at turn T, actions from turn t1 to T-1.\n\nHere, reach at turn 79, so actions from turn 68 to 78.\n\nNumber of actions: 11.\n\nH=11 for the number of actions.\n\nBut the text says \"number of turns H\", and \"reach at turn t1 + H -1\".\n\nWith H=11, t1 + H -1 =68+11-1=78, but we reach at turn 79, not 78.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nPerhaps for this problem, we should go by the practical.\n\nI think there might be a mistake in the problem statement or my understanding.\n\nAnother way: \"turns\" might refer to the game turns played.\n\nFrom turn t1 to the reaching turn, there are H turns, including both.\n\nFor example, from turn 68 to 79, that's 12 turns, but at turn 68 we start, and at turn 79 we are at y=9.\n\nBut at turn 68, we are at y=0, not 9.\n\nThe turns where actions are taken are from turn 68 to 78 to reach at turn 79.\n\nThe number of action turns is 11.\n\nBut the problem says \"number of turns H\", which might mean the number of action turns.\n\nIn the sequence, it lists \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\" up to \"Turn t1 + H -1: a_{t1 + H -1}\" for H actions.\n\nThen reach at turn t1 + H.\n\nBut the text says \"at turn t1 + H -1\".\n\nI think it's a typo or misphrasing.\n\nIn many contexts, H is the number of actions.\n\nTo match, in this case, with H=11 actions, reach at turn 79 = t1 + 11.\n\nt1 + H =79.\n\nBut the text says t1 + H -1.\n\nPerhaps for this, we should set H such that t1 + H -1 =79.\n\n68 + H -1 =79, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nThen with H=12, we have 12 actions, but we only need 11.\n\nIf H=12, actions from t=0 to 11, a68 to a79.\n\na79 at turn 79 to set y80, but we don't need to go further.\n\nWe can set a79 to S, but it's unnecessary.\n\nIn the sequence, we can stop when we reach.\n\nBut the format specifies the sequence up to a_{t1 + H -1}, so for H=12, a68 to a79.\n\nBut at turn 79, if we are at y79=9, we can take any action, but the position is already reached.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll assume that H is the number of actions needed, and we list the actions from turn t1 to turn t1 + H -1 to reach at turn t1 + H.\n\nBut the problem says reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nI think for this problem, since it's a grid, we can proceed with H=11 actions.\n\nPerhaps the \"turns H\" includes the starting turn.\n\nLet's look online or standard, but since it's a specific problem, I'll go with the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format, it lists \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\" etc., and the last one is when we take the action to reach.\n\nFor example, in my sequence, last action at turn 78: U to go to y79=9.\n\nSo we list up to turn 78.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 68 to 78, 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nReach at turn 79 = t1 + 11.\n\nBut t1 + H -1 =68+11-1=78, which is the turn we take the last action, but we reach at turn 79.\n\nI think it's consistent if we consider that at turn t1 + H -1, we take the action that causes us to reach at the next turn, but the reaching is at turn t1 + H.\n\nThe problem says \"reach at turn t1 + H -1\", which is confusing.\n\nPerhaps in the context, for this problem, we'll output the sequence as is.\n\nI think I should proceed.\n\nSo for this, with H=11, sequence of 11 actions.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut to be precise, let's see the car state.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 5 and 6, there are multiple cars, but we checked.\n\nAlso, for freeway 7 and 8, always safe.\n\nSo the sequence is fine.\n\nMinimal H is 11.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 68: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 69: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 70: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 71: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 72: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 73: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 74: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 75: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 76: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 77: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 78: U \\end{array} }\n\nWith the other option:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 68: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 69: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 70: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 71: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 72: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 73: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 74: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 75: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 76: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 77: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 78: U \\end{array} }\n\nBoth work.\n\nI think the first one is cleaner, no down action.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 68\\) is 11. This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on an unsafe freeway at the specific turns when collisions can occur.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Summary:\n- At turn 70 (relative turn \\(t = 2\\)), freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3, 4\\) are unsafe due to cars having position 0 within their span.\n- At turns 72 and 73 (relative turns \\(t = 4\\) and \\(t = 5\\)), freeways \\(y = 5\\) and \\(y = 6\\) are unsafe.\n- Freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are always safe.\n- The player must be at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 70 to avoid collision, requiring two initial \"stay\" actions (or an up-down sequence) to remain at \\(y = 0\\) until after the unsafe turn 70.\n\n### Sequence Explanation:\n- **Turns 68 and 69**: The player stays at \\(y = 0\\) (action `S`) to avoid moving to \\(y = 1, 2, 3,\\) or \\(4\\) at turn 70, which would cause a collision.\n- **Turns 70 to 78**: The player moves up (action `U`) every turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 79. This path avoids \\(y = 5\\) and \\(y = 6\\) at turns 72 and 73 (where they are unsafe) by being at \\(y = 2\\) and \\(y = 3\\) instead, which are safe at those turns. The player reaches \\(y = 5\\) at turn 75 and \\(y = 6\\) at turn 76, which are after the unsafe turns 72 and 73, so no collision occurs.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{68 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{10}\\) (for \\(H = 11\\)) is:\n\n- At turn 68, stay (`S`) to remain at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 69.\n- At turn 69, stay (`S`) to remain at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 70.\n- At turn 70, move up (`U`) to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 71.\n- At turn 71, move up (`U`) to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 72.\n- At turn 72, move up (`U`) to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 73.\n- At turn 73, move up (`U`) to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 74.\n- At turn 74, move up (`U`) to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 75.\n- At turn 75, move up (`U`) to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 76.\n- At turn 76, move up (`U`) to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 77.\n- At turn 77, move up (`U`) to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 78.\n- At turn 78, move up (`U`) to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 79.\n\nThe player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 79 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 68 + 11 - 1 = 79\\)).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 68: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 69: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 70: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 71: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 72: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 73: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 74: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 75: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 76: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 77: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 78: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 70. The player is at (0,0) and wants to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8). We can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). Note that we start at y=0 and need to get to y=9. Since we can only move one unit per turn (or stay), we must move up at least 9 times. However, we must avoid the freeways at the exact time when a car is at position x=0 on the row we are on.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if at that turn we are on a freeway (y from 1 to 8) and the car (on that freeway) has a span that includes 0 at that exact turn.\n\nAlso note: when we move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T we are still on y (so we check the car on y at turn T). Then at turn T+1, we are on y+1 (so we check the car on y+1 at turn T+1). \n\nWe are given the state at turn t1=70. For each car on each freeway, we are given (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nLet me interpret the car update:\n\nFor a left-moving car (which we don't have in this problem, all are right-moving? Let me check: all are labeled \"right\"), so for right-moving:\n\nAt turn 70 (current turn), the car's span is [tau, head] (since for right: at t1, span is [tau, head]). Then at a future turn T (T>=70), the car's position is:\n\n  [tau + s*(T-70), head + s*(T-70)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [head - s*(T-70), tau - s*(T-70)] but we don't have any.\n\nNow, collision on freeway k (which is row k) at turn T happens if at that turn, the car on row k has a span that includes 0. That is, for a car on row k (which is a right-moving car) at turn T, we require:\n\n  tau + s*(T-70) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-70)\n\nBut note: the car state for each freeway might have multiple cars? Yes, for freeways 5 and 6, there are three cars.\n\nSo for each freeway and each car on that freeway, we must check at every turn T if the player is on that freeway (i.e., y_T = k) and if at that turn T, that car has 0 in its span.\n\nWe are to find a sequence of actions (U, D, S) that moves the player from y=0 to y=9 in minimal H (number of turns) without ever being in a collision.\n\nWe start at turn 70 at y=0. We are safe at y=0 and y=9 because those are not freeways (freeways are 1 to 8). But note: we start at (0,0) and we are safe. We must end at (0,9) and that is safe.\n\nWe need to go through y=1 to y=8. We can only change by -1,0,+1 per turn. So we must go through each row in order? Not necessarily: we might go up and then down? But that would be inefficient. Since we start at 0 and need to get to 9, and we can only move one step per turn, the minimal number of moves is 9 (if we move up 9 times). However, we might have to wait (stay) on some rows to avoid collisions, so H might be more than 9.\n\nBut note: we can also move down? However, moving down from 0 is not allowed (y remains 0). So we are effectively constrained to nonnegative moves.\n\nSo the minimal H is at least 9. We need to see if we can do it in 9, or if we need more.\n\nWe are to output the sequence of actions for turns 70, 71, ... until we reach 9.\n\nLet me denote the turn relative to 70: let t = 0 be the current turn (turn 70). Then we are at y0 = 0.\n\nAt turn t (relative to 70, so absolute turn = 70+t), we are at y_t. We take action a_t (at turn 70+t) to get to y_{t+1} = y_t + delta, where delta = +1 (U), -1 (D), 0 (S). But note: we cannot go below 0 or above 9. Since we start at 0, we cannot go below 0. Similarly, when we are at 9, we can only stay or go down (but we want to end at 9, so once we get to 9 we stop).\n\nWe are to stop at the first time we are at 9. So if we get to 9 at turn H (relative turn H-1? Let me clarify):\n\nAt turn 70 (t=0): we are at y0=0. We take action a0 (at turn 70) -> then at turn 71 (t=1) we are at y1.\n\nWe need the smallest H such that at the end of turn 70+H-1 we are at 9. Actually, the sequence of actions is from t=0 to t=H-1, and we are at y_H = 9. So the number of turns is H.\n\nWe need to avoid: for each turn t (from 0 to H-1) and for the row we are on at that turn (y_t), we must not have any car on that row (freeway y_t) at that absolute time (70+t) having 0 in its span.\n\nNote: at turn t (relative), absolute time is T = 70+t.\n\nFor freeway k, we have a list of cars. For each car, we have (head, tail, direction, speed). All are right-moving.\n\nSo for a car with (head, tail, direction, speed) = (h, tau, 'right', s) at time 70+t:\n\n  left_end = tau + s * t\n  right_end = h + s * t\n\nand we require that 0 is NOT in [left_end, right_end] for that car.\n\nBut note: the problem says the car update for right-moving: [tau, h] at time 70 becomes [tau + s*t, h + s*t] at time 70+t. So the interval is [tau + s*t, h + s*t]. Since tau <= h (because at time 70 the car is from tau to h, and tau is the tail and h the head? Actually, in the table it is written as (head, tail) but the update rule says for right: [tau, h]. So let me check the table:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24) -> so head = -48, tail = -71? But that would be [ -71, -48 ]? That is a car from -71 to -48? But then at time 70, the car is at positions from -71 to -48? Then at time 70+t, it moves to [-71 + 24*t, -48 + 24*t].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5: we have three cars: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6). So the first car: head=48, tail=37 -> that would be [37,48] at time 70? But that seems backwards because typically we think of head as the front. However, the update rule says: for right-moving, the car moves to the right. So the entire segment moves to the right. The car at time 70 is at [37,48] (so from 37 to 48). Then at time 70+t: [37+6*t, 48+6*t].\n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: [tau, h] -> [tau + s*t, h + s*t]. So in the input, the first number is h (head) and the second is tau (tail). And since the car is right-moving, the tail is the left end and the head is the right end? So the car covers [tau, h]. So the car on freeway 5 at time 70 has three cars: \n  car1: [37,48]\n  car2: [1,12]\n  car3: [-35,-24]   [because tail=-35, head=-24?]\n\nWait, the input says: (-24, -35, right, 6) -> so head=-24, tail=-35. Then the car is from -35 to -24? That's correct: [-35, -24].\n\nBut note: the problem says \"head\" and \"tail\". For a right-moving car, the head is the front (rightmost) and the tail is the rear (leftmost). So the span is [tail, head].\n\nSo for a car (h, tau, d, s) in the table, the initial (at t1=70) span is [tau, h] for right-moving.\n\nNow, we need to check for each freeway and each car, at a given absolute time T = 70+t, if 0 is in [tau + s*t, h + s*t]? \n\nBut note: the freeway k is fixed. So if the player is on freeway k at time 70+t, then we must check all cars on that freeway at that time.\n\nWe are to simulate the player's path and avoid any collision.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and a sequence of actions.\n\nMinimal H: at least 9. We try to see if we can do it in 9 turns: moving up 9 times.\n\nBut we must avoid collisions at rows 1 to 8 at the exact time we are on them.\n\nLet's simulate for each row and each turn when we would be on that row if we move up every turn.\n\nIf we move up every turn (a_t = U for t=0 to 8), then:\n\n  t=0 (turn70): at y0=0 -> safe (not a freeway)\n  t=1 (turn71): at y1=1 -> check freeway1 at time71 (t=1 in relative time)\n  t=2: y2=2 -> freeway2 at time72 (t=2)\n  t=3: y3=3 -> freeway3 at time73 (t=3)\n  t=4: y4=4 -> freeway4 at time74 (t=4)\n  t=5: y5=5 -> freeway5 at time75 (t=5)\n  t=6: y6=6 -> freeway6 at time76 (t=6)\n  t=7: y7=7 -> freeway7 at time77 (t=7)\n  t=8: y8=8 -> freeway8 at time78 (t=8)\n  t=9: y9=9 -> safe\n\nSo we need to check for each of these freeways at the specified time.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway k at the time when we would be there (if we go straight up) whether there is a car that covers 0.\n\nFreeway 1 at time71 (t=1, relative time 1):\n  Car: (-48, -71, right, 24) -> \n    left_end = tau + s*t = -71 + 24*1 = -47\n    right_end = head + s*t = -48 + 24*1 = -24\n    So the car is from -47 to -24? But wait: \n        at t=0: [-71, -48] -> then at t=1: [-71+24, -48+24] = [-47, -24]. \n    So 0 is not in [-47,-24] -> safe.\n\nFreeway 2 at time72 (t=2):\n  Car: (-48, -83, right, 36) -> \n    left_end = -83 + 36*2 = -83 + 72 = -11\n    right_end = -48 + 36*2 = -48+72 = 24\n    So the car is from -11 to 24. 0 is in [-11,24] -> collision! \n\nSo if we go straight up, at turn72 (absolute) when we are on freeway2, we collide.\n\nTherefore, we cannot go straight up. We must wait at some point.\n\nWe need to adjust: we might wait (stay) at some row to let the car pass.\n\nWe are at row1 at turn71. Then at turn72 we would normally go to row2, but row2 has a car covering 0 at turn72. So we might stay at row1 at turn72? Then at turn73 we would go to row2? But then at turn73, we check row2 at time73.\n\nFreeway2 at time73 (t=3):\n  left_end = -83 + 36*3 = -83 + 108 = 25\n  right_end = -48 + 36*3 = -48+108 = 60\n  So the car is at [25,60] -> 0 not in there -> safe.\n\nSo if we do:\n  turn70: U -> to y=1 at turn71 (t=1)\n  turn71: S -> stay at y=1 at turn72 (t=2) -> but at turn72 we are on freeway1? Actually, no: at turn71 we are at y=1 (freeway1) and we take action S at turn71 (which is at absolute time71) and then at turn72 we are still at y=1? \n\nWait: \n  At turn70 (t=0): we are at y0=0. We take action a0=U -> so at turn71 (t=1) we are at y1=1.\n  Then at turn71 (t=1): we take action a1=S -> so at turn72 (t=2) we are at y2=1 (still).\n\nBut note: at turn71 (t=1) we were at y=1 (freeway1) and we did not collide because we checked freeway1 at time71: as above, safe.\n\nAt turn72 (t=2): we are still at y=1. Now we check freeway1 at time72 (t=2):\n\n  Freeway1: car (-48,-71,right,24) at t=2:\n      left_end = -71 + 24*2 = -71+48 = -23\n      right_end = -48 + 24*2 = -48+48 = 0\n      So the car is at [-23,0]. 0 is included? The interval is [-23,0] -> 0 is in it. Collision!\n\nSo if we stay at y=1 at time72, we collide.\n\nTherefore, we cannot stay at y=1 at time72. We must move either up or down? But down to 0? Then we are safe at 0, but then we have to come back.\n\nAlternatively, we might leave y=1 at the next turn: so at turn71 we move up to y=2? But then at turn72 we are at y=2 and we check freeway2 at time72 -> which we know has a car that covers 0 (as above) -> collision.\n\nSo what can we do?\n\nWe might delay going to row1? But we start at row0 at time70. We can stay at row0 at time70? But then at time70 we are safe (row0). Then at time71, we can go to row1? Then we are at row1 at time71 -> freeway1 at time71: safe (as above). Then at time71, we must choose: if we go up to row2 at time72, then at time72 we are at row2 -> collision (as above). If we stay, then at time72 we are at row1 -> collision (as above). If we go down? Then at time72 we go back to row0 -> safe. But then we are back to row0 and we haven't made progress.\n\nSo we need to wait at row0 for one turn? Then:\n\n  turn70: S -> stay at y=0 (safe) at turn71? Actually, at turn70 we are at y0=0. We take S -> then at turn71 we are still at y=0. Then at turn71 we can move up to y=1 at turn72.\n\nThen at turn72: we are at y=1. Check freeway1 at time72 (t=2): as above, car is at [-23,0] -> 0 in the interval -> collision.\n\nSo same problem.\n\nHow about wait two turns at row0? Then:\n\n  turn70: S -> at turn71: y=0\n  turn71: S -> at turn72: y=0\n  turn72: U -> at turn73: y=1\n\nNow, at turn73 (t=3): check freeway1 at time73 (absolute 70+3=73):\n  freeway1: t=3 -> [-71+24*3, -48+24*3] = [-71+72, -48+72] = [1,24] -> 0 not in [1,24] -> safe.\n\nThen we are at row1 at time73. Now, we want to go to row2. When? At time74 we can go to row2.\n\nAt time74 (t=4): we are at row2. Check freeway2 at time74 (t=4):\n  freeway2: (-48,-83,right,36) -> [-83+36*4, -48+36*4] = [-83+144, -48+144] = [61,96] -> safe.\n\nThen we can continue up? But we need to check the next freeways.\n\nSo far, we have used 4 turns to get to row2 (from row0 at time70 to row2 at time74: 4 turns? Let me count:\n\n  t0 (turn70): start at 0, take S -> at t1: 0\n  t1 (turn71): at0, take S -> at t2:0\n  t2 (turn72): at0, take U -> at t3:1 (at time73)\n  t3 (turn73): at1, take U -> at t4:2 (at time74)\n\nSo at time74 we are at row2.\n\nNow, we can move up to row3 at time75? Then we are at row3 at time75 (t=5). Check freeway3 at time75 (t=5):\n  freeway3: same as freeway2? The car is (-48,-83,right,36) -> \n      left_end = -83 + 36*5 = -83+180=97\n      right_end = -48+180=132 -> safe.\n\nThen row4 at time76 (t=6): freeway4: same car? (-48,-83,right,36) -> \n      [-83+36*6, -48+36*6] = [-83+216, -48+216] = [133,168] -> safe.\n\nThen row5 at time77 (t=7): freeway5 has three cars. We must check each.\n\nAt time77 (t=7) for freeway5:\n  car1: (48,37,right,6) -> [37+6*7, 48+6*7] = [37+42,48+42]=[79,90] -> safe (0 not in)\n  car2: (12,1,right,6) -> [1+42,12+42]=[43,54] -> safe\n  car3: (-24,-35,right,6) -> [-35+42, -24+42]=[7,18] -> safe\n\nThen row6 at time78 (t=8): freeway6: same cars as freeway5? The table says freeway6 has the same three cars: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6). So at time78 (t=8):\n  car1: [37+6*8,48+48]= [37+48,48+48]=[85,96]\n  car2: [1+48,12+48]=[49,60]\n  car3: [-35+48,-24+48]=[13,24] -> all safe.\n\nThen row7 at time79 (t=9): freeway7: (48,37,right,12) -> \n  [37+12*9, 48+12*9] = [37+108,48+108]=[145,156] -> safe.\n\nThen row8 at time80 (t=10): freeway8: (48,37,right,4) -> \n  [37+4*10,48+4*10]=[37+40,48+40]=[77,88] -> safe.\n\nThen at time81 (t=11): we go to row9? But we are at row8 at time80, and we take U at time80 to go to row9 at time81.\n\nBut we started at time70 (t=0) and we are at row0. We have:\n\n  t0: S -> t1:0\n  t1: S -> t2:0\n  t2: U -> t3:1\n  t3: U -> t4:2\n  t4: U -> t5:3\n  t5: U -> t6:4\n  t6: U -> t7:5\n  t7: U -> t8:6\n  t8: U -> t9:7\n  t9: U -> t10:8\n  t10: U -> t11:9\n\nSo H=11 turns? But we can do better? We had to wait two turns at the beginning.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid waiting that long by going up to row1 at a different time.\n\nBut we saw that if we go to row1 at time71,72,73: \n  time71: safe for row1\n  time72: unsafe for row1 (if we stay) and unsafe for row2 (if we go up)\n  time73: safe for row1 (as we saw) and then we can go to row2 at time74: safe for row2.\n\nBut we had to wait at row0 for two turns. \n\nCan we do with one wait? Let me try:\n\nOption: wait at row0 for one turn, then go to row1 at time72? \n  Then at time72: row1 -> check freeway1 at time72: [-23,0] -> collision.\n\nWait at row0 for two turns: as above, then go to row1 at time73: safe.\n\nThen we proceed. So we have to wait two turns.\n\nBut what if we go to row1 at time71 (safe) and then immediately go back to row0 at time72? Then at time72 we are at row0 (safe). Then at time72 we are at row0 and we can go to row1 at time73? Then at time73: row1 -> safe (as above). Then we can go to row2 at time74: safe. But this also takes two extra turns: we did two moves: up then down, then up again. That's three moves to get to row1? \n\nActually:\n  turn70: U -> to row1 at time71 (safe)\n  turn71: D -> to row0 at time72 (safe) \n  turn72: U -> to row1 at time73 (safe) \n  turn73: U -> to row2 at time74 (safe)\n\nSo we get to row2 at time74, same as the previous plan. But we used 4 turns to get to row2? And in the previous plan we also used 4 turns (two stays at 0, then two ups). So same H.\n\nBut in the previous plan we had two S and two U to get to row2. In this plan we have U, D, U, U. So the sequence is different but same number of turns.\n\nHowever, we might avoid the two extra turns by waiting at a higher row? But we have to pass row2 at a time when the car is not at 0. The car on row2 is only unsafe at time72? Actually, we saw:\n\n  row2 at time72: unsafe (t=2: [-11,24])\n  row2 at time73: safe (t=3: [25,60])\n  row2 at time74: safe (t=4: [61,96])\n\nSo we can be at row2 at time73 or 74. But we have to get there from row1. \n\nWe can be at row1 at time72? But we saw that row1 at time72 is unsafe. So we cannot be at row1 at time72. Therefore, we cannot be at row2 at time73? Because to be at row2 at time73, we must have been at row1 at time72 and then moved up. But we cannot be at row1 at time72.\n\nThe only way to be at row2 is at time74 (by being at row1 at time73 and then moving up at time73 to be at row2 at time74) or later.\n\nSo the minimal time to be at row2 is time74. And we start at row0 at time70. So we must use 4 turns to get to row2? (since from time70 to time74: 4 turns).\n\nTherefore, the minimal H for the entire journey? We have 9 rows to cover (0 to 8, then 9). From row0 to row2 takes 4 turns. Then from row2 to row9: 7 moves (if we go straight up). So total turns: 4 + 7 = 11? \n\nBut let's check the other freeways: we already did and they were safe at the times we pass.\n\nBut note: we are passing row5 at time77? But we have to check the cars at row5 at time77: we did and they were safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut wait: we are at row2 at time74. Then:\n\n  time74: at row2 -> safe\n  time74: take U -> at time75: row3 -> check freeway3 at time75: as above, safe\n  time75: take U -> at time76: row4 -> safe\n  time76: take U -> at time77: row5 -> safe\n  time77: take U -> at time78: row6 -> safe\n  time78: take U -> at time79: row7 -> safe\n  time79: take U -> at time80: row8 -> safe\n  time80: take U -> at time81: row9 -> safe\n\nSo we end at time81 (absolute) which is turn70+11? Because we started at turn70 (t0) and then we have actions at t0 to t10 (11 actions) and then at the end of t10 we are at row9.\n\nBut we must output the actions for turns 70 to 70+10 (since H=11, we have 11 actions: t=0 to 10).\n\nIn the sequence I described first (with two waits at start):\n\n  turn70: S\n  turn71: S\n  turn72: U\n  turn73: U\n  turn74: U -> row3? Actually, we were at row2 at time74? Then we go up again at time74 to row3 at time75.\n\nBut wait, at time74 we are at row2, then we take U at turn74 (absolute turn 70+4=74) to go to row3 at time75.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\n  Turn70: S\n  Turn71: S\n  Turn72: U\n  Turn73: U -> now at row2 at time74? Actually, at turn73 (absolute 73) we take U, so at time74 we are at row3? \n\nLet me clarify the timeline:\n\n  Absolute turn | relative t | action at this turn | resulting y at next turn\n  70           | t0         | a0                  | y1 = y0 + delta(a0)\n  71           | t1         | a1                  | y2\n  ...\n\nSo:\n\n  At turn70 (t0): we take a0=S -> so y1 = 0 (at turn71)\n  At turn71 (t1): we take a1=S -> so y2 = 0 (at turn72)\n  At turn72 (t2): we take a2=U -> so y3 = 0+1 = 1 (at turn73)\n  At turn73 (t3): we take a3=U -> so y4 = 1+1 = 2 (at turn74)\n  At turn74 (t4): we take a4=U -> so y5 = 2+1 = 3 (at turn75)\n  ... and so on.\n\nBut we want to be at row2 at time74? But at time74 (absolute) we are at y5? That doesn't match.\n\nI think I messed up the indexing.\n\nRecall: \n  At the start of turn70, we are at (0,0). Then we choose an action for turn70. After the action, we update to the next state at turn71.\n\nSo the position at the start of turn70: y0=0.\nAfter action a70 (at turn70), at the start of turn71: y1 = y0 + delta(a70).\n\nSimilarly, at the start of turn71: y1, then we take a71 -> at start of turn72: y2 = y1 + delta(a71).\n\nWe are concerned about the row at the start of the turn? But the collision condition says: collision occurs at turn T if at that turn (meaning at the start of turn T?) we are on a freeway and the car covers 0 at that turn.\n\nBut note: the car update is given for turn T. And we are at y_T at the start of turn T? Then we take an action and move to y_{T+1} at the start of turn T+1.\n\nThe problem says: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". And y_T is the player's position at turn T (start of turn).\n\nSo at the start of turn70: we are at (0,0) -> safe (not freeway).\nThen we take an action at turn70: which moves us to the next position at the start of turn71.\n\nAt the start of turn71: we are at y71. Then we check for collision: if y71 is in [1,8], then check the cars on that freeway at time71.\n\nSo in our simulation, the time we check for row k is the turn at which we are at row k at the start of that turn.\n\nNow, in the sequence:\n\nOption 1 (two waits at start):\n\n  Start turn70: y70=0 -> safe (no freeway)\n    action: S -> then at turn71: y71=0 -> safe\n\n  Start turn71: y71=0 -> safe\n    action: S -> then at turn72: y72=0 -> safe\n\n  Start turn72: y72=0 -> safe\n    action: U -> then at turn73: y73=1\n\n  Start turn73: y73=1 -> freeway1 at time73: we computed [1,24] -> 0 not in -> safe\n    action: U -> then at turn74: y74=2\n\n  Start turn74: y74=2 -> freeway2 at time74: [61,96] -> safe\n    action: U -> then at turn75: y75=3\n\n  Start turn75: y75=3 -> freeway3 at time75: [97,132] -> safe\n    action: U -> then at turn76: y76=4\n\n  Start turn76: y76=4 -> freeway4 at time76: [133,168] -> safe\n    action: U -> then at turn77: y77=5\n\n  Start turn77: y77=5 -> freeway5 at time77: \n        car1: [79,90] -> safe\n        car2: [43,54] -> safe\n        car3: [7,18] -> 7 to 18: 0 not in -> safe\n    action: U -> then at turn78: y78=6\n\n  Start turn78: y78=6 -> freeway6 at time78: \n        car1: [85,96]\n        car2: [49,60]\n        car3: [13,24] -> all safe\n    action: U -> then at turn79: y79=7\n\n  Start turn79: y79=7 -> freeway7 at time79: \n        car: [37+12*(79-70)=37+12*9=37+108=145, 48+108=156] -> safe\n    action: U -> then at turn80: y80=8\n\n  Start turn80: y80=8 -> freeway8 at time80: \n        car: [37+4*(80-70)=37+4*10=77, 48+40=88] -> safe\n    action: U -> then at turn81: y81=9 -> safe and we are done.\n\nSo we reach y=9 at the start of turn81. The last action is at turn80 (which is the 11th action: actions at turns 70,71,...,80). \n\nNumber of turns: from turn70 to turn80: 11 actions. H=11.\n\nThe sequence of actions:\n\n  Turn70: S\n  Turn71: S\n  Turn72: U\n  Turn73: U\n  Turn74: U\n  Turn75: U\n  Turn76: U\n  Turn77: U\n  Turn78: U\n  Turn79: U\n  Turn80: U\n\nBut we can write the absolute turns.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to see if we can do it in 10 turns? That is, reach at turn80? \n\nWe need to be at row9 at the start of turn80. That means we must be at row8 at the start of turn79? and then take U at turn79 to get to row9 at turn80.\n\nSo we need to be at row8 at turn79. Then we must have been at row7 at turn78, row6 at turn77, etc.\n\nSo the entire path: we must be at row0 at turn70, then row1 at turn71, row2 at turn72, ... row8 at turn78, then row9 at turn79? But that requires 9 moves (all U) but we know we collide at row2 at turn72.\n\nAlternatively, we can skip some rows by moving faster? But we cannot: we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo the minimal time to go from row0 to row9 is 9 moves? But we have to avoid collisions. The problem is we have to wait at the beginning.\n\nIs there a way to avoid waiting two turns? \n\nWe could try to go to row1 at turn71 (safe) and then at turn71 we go to row2? But then at turn72 we are at row2 -> unsafe.\n\nOr we could go to row1 at turn71 (safe) and then at turn71 we go down? Then at turn72 we are at row0. Then at turn72 we go up to row1 at turn73 (safe). Then at turn73 we go to row2 at turn74 (safe). Then we are at row2 at turn74, same as before. Then we proceed. So we are still at row2 at turn74, and then we go to row9 at turn74+7=81? same as 11 turns.\n\nAlternatively, we might wait at a later row? But the problem is only at row1 and row2 at the beginning? The other rows are safe at the times we pass.\n\nBut note: we have to pass row1 and row2 at safe times. The safe time for row1: at time73 we are safe, at time71 we are safe? But at time72 we are unsafe. And for row2: unsafe at time72, safe at time73 and later? But to be at row2 at time73, we must have been at row1 at time72 (to move up at time72) but row1 at time72 is unsafe. So we cannot be at row2 at time73.\n\nTherefore, the earliest we can be at row2 is time74. Therefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nSo we output:\n\nTurn70: S\nTurn71: S\nTurn72: U\nTurn73: U\nTurn74: U\nTurn75: U\nTurn76: U\nTurn77: U\nTurn78: U\nTurn79: U\nTurn80: U\n\nBut wait, we have 11 actions? And we end at turn81? But the problem says: the sequence is for t_1 to t_1+H-1, and we are to have H turns? \n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning actions at turns t_1, t_1+1, ... t_1+H-1. And then at the end of these H actions, we are at (0,9). \n\nIn our case, we start at turn70 (t1=70). We do actions at turn70,71,...,80 (which are 11 turns: from 70 to 80 inclusive). Then at the start of turn81 we are at y=9. So H=11.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 70: S\nTurn 71: S\nTurn 72: U\nTurn 73: U\nTurn 74: U\nTurn 75: U\nTurn 76: U\nTurn 77: U\nTurn 78: U\nTurn 79: U\nTurn 80: U\n}\n\nBut let me double-check freeway5 at time77: \n  Absolute time77: relative t = 77-70 = 7.\n  freeway5 cars:\n    car1: (48,37,right,6) -> [37+6*7, 48+6*7] = [37+42,48+42]=[79,90] -> safe\n    car2: (12,1,right,6) -> [1+42,12+42]=[43,54] -> safe\n    car3: (-24,-35,right,6) -> [-35+42, -24+42] = [7,18] -> safe\n\nSimilarly, freeway6 at time78: t=8\n    car1: [37+48,48+48]=[85,96]\n    car2: [1+48,12+48]=[49,60]\n    car3: [-35+48,-24+48]=[13,24] -> safe\n\nfreeway7 at time79: t=9\n    [37+12*9,48+12*9]=[37+108,48+108]=[145,156] -> safe\n\nfreeway8 at time80: t=10\n    [37+4*10,48+40]=[77,88] -> safe\n\nAnd we never are on a freeway at a time when a car covers 0.\n\nNote: at turn70: we are at y70=0 -> safe\nturn71: y71=0 -> safe\nturn72: y72=0 -> safe\nturn73: y73=1 -> safe (freeway1: [1,24])\nturn74: y74=2 -> safe (freeway2: [61,96])\nturn75: y75=3 -> safe (freeway3: [97,132])\nturn76: y76=4 -> safe (freeway4: [133,168])\nturn77: y77=5 -> safe (freeway5: as above)\nturn78: y78=6 -> safe (freeway6: as above)\nturn79: y79=7 -> safe (freeway7: [145,156])\nturn80: y80=8 -> safe (freeway8: [77,88])\nturn81: y81=9 -> safe (not a freeway)\n\nSo no collisions.\n\nTherefore, this is a valid solution and minimal H? Since we have to wait for two turns at the beginning, and then move up 9 times, total 11 moves.\n\nBut can we do it in 10? We need to be at row9 at turn80. That means we must be at row8 at turn79. Then row7 at turn78, row6 at turn77, row5 at turn76, row4 at turn75, row3 at turn74, row2 at turn73, row1 at turn72, row0 at turn71? But we start at row0 at turn70. \n\nTo be at row1 at turn72: we must have taken two moves: from row0 to row0 (wait) then to row1? Then at turn72 we are at row1. But row1 at turn72 is unsafe. \n\nAlternatively: at turn70: U -> to row1 at turn71 (safe). Then at turn71: we can't go to row2 (because then at turn72 we are at row2 -> unsafe). And if we stay at row1 at turn71: then at turn72 we are at row1 -> unsafe. If we go down: then at turn72 we are at row0. Then at turn72: we go up to row1 at turn73 (safe). Then at turn73: we go to row2 at turn74 (safe). Then we have to go from row2 at turn74 to row8 at turn78? That would be 5 moves? So at turn78 we are at row7? Then at turn78: we go to row8 at turn79. Then at turn79: we go to row9 at turn80. \n\nBut then we are at row9 at turn80? So we have:\n\n  turn70: U -> to row1 at turn71 (safe)\n  turn71: D -> to row0 at turn72 (safe)\n  turn72: U -> to row1 at turn73 (safe)\n  turn73: U -> to row2 at turn74 (safe)\n  turn74: U -> to row3 at turn75\n  turn75: U -> to row4 at turn76\n  turn76: U -> to row5 at turn77\n  turn77: U -> to row6 at turn78\n  turn78: U -> to row7 at turn79\n  turn79: U -> to row8 at turn80? But we need to be at row8 at turn79? \n\nWait: we want to be at row9 at turn80. So we must be at row8 at turn79? But in this sequence:\n\n  At turn79: we are at row8? \n\nActually:\n\n  turn70: U -> at turn71: row1\n  turn71: D -> at turn72: row0\n  turn72: U -> at turn73: row1\n  turn73: U -> at turn74: row2\n  turn74: U -> at turn75: row3\n  turn75: U -> at turn76: row4\n  turn76: U -> at turn77: row5\n  turn77: U -> at turn78: row6\n  turn78: U -> at turn79: row7\n  turn79: U -> at turn80: row8\n\nThen we are at row8 at turn80. We are not done: we need one more move to row9 at turn81. So H=11 again.\n\nTo be at row8 at turn79, we must have been at row7 at turn78. So we need to get to row7 at turn78. Then:\n\n  ... we must get to row2 at turn73? But we cannot be at row2 at turn73 because we cannot be at row1 at turn72.\n\nSo it seems 11 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the sequence above.\n\nBut note: in the sequence we have two S at the beginning, then 9 U's. But in the output, we have:\n\nTurn70: S\nTurn71: S\nTurn72: U\nTurn73: U\n...\nTurn80: U\n\nThat's 11 actions.\n\nBut we can write the absolute turns.\n\nSo the final answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 70, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), is 11. The sequence of actions is determined as follows:\n\n- At turn 70, staying at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not a freeway) avoids the collision on freeway 1 at turn 72.\n- At turn 71, staying at \\(y = 0\\) again ensures safety.\n- At turn 72, moving up to \\(y = 1\\) is safe because at turn 73, freeway 1 is clear: the car spans \\([1, 24]\\), not including 0.\n- From turn 73 to turn 80, moving up each turn reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 81. All intermediate freeways are checked and safe:\n  - Freeway 2 at turn 74: car spans \\([61, 96]\\), safe.\n  - Freeway 3 at turn 75: car spans \\([97, 132]\\), safe.\n  - Freeway 4 at turn 76: car spans \\([133, 168]\\), safe.\n  - Freeway 5 at turn 77: cars span \\([79, 90]\\), \\([43, 54]\\), \\([7, 18]\\), all safe.\n  - Freeway 6 at turn 78: cars span \\([85, 96]\\), \\([49, 60]\\), \\([13, 24]\\), all safe.\n  - Freeway 7 at turn 79: car spans \\([145, 156]\\), safe.\n  - Freeway 8 at turn 80: car spans \\([77, 88]\\), safe.\n\nThis sequence achieves \\(y = 9\\) in 11 turns (turns 70 to 80) with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 70: S\nTurn 71: S\nTurn 72: U\nTurn 73: U\nTurn 74: U\nTurn 75: U\nTurn 76: U\nTurn 77: U\nTurn 78: U\nTurn 79: U\nTurn 80: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are starting at turn t1 = 72, at position (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8).\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway k (which is the same as the y-coordinate) and the car's span at that turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate where the player is).\n\nNote: The player moves at the same time as the cars. The player's movement is vertical (changing y-coordinate), and the cars move horizontally (changing x-coordinate).\n\nPlayer update:\n- At each turn, the player chooses an action: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), or S (stay, y same). The y-coordinate is clamped between 0 and 9.\n\nCar update:\n- For a car on a freeway, we are given its state at turn t1 (72). We can compute the car's span at any future turn T (>=72) by:\n  - Left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]   [note: in the problem, for left-moving, the head is at h and tail at tau, and they move left so both decrease]\n  - Right-moving: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]   [note: for right-moving, the head is at h and tail at tau? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\" meaning that the car extends from tau to h, and then at T: [tau+s*(T-t1), h+s*(T-t1)]]\n\nBut note: in the given state, for freeways 1 to 8, we have:\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24) -> but wait, the problem says for right-moving: the span is given as [tau, h]? Actually, the input is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nLooking at the input for freeway 5: \n  (48,37,right,6) -> head=48, tail=37? But then the span would be [37,48]? But the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\" meaning the tail is the left end and head is the right end? \n\nHowever, note the example for right-moving: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\" and then moves to [tau+s*(T-t1), h+s*(T-t1)]. So in the input, the first number is the head (which is the front of the car) and the second is the tail? But for a right-moving car, the head should be the rightmost? \n\nActually, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning that the car's head is at h (which is greater than tau) and tail at tau. So when moving right, both h and tau increase. Similarly, for left-moving, the head is at h (which is the leftmost?) and tail at tau (which is even more left? because the car moves left). \n\nBut wait: the left-moving car: the update is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. This implies that at t1, the car spans from h to tau? and h > tau? because subtracting s*(T-t1) makes both decrease and the head becomes h - s*(T-t1) which is less than h? Actually, no: if the car is moving left, then the head is the leading part, so if moving left, the head is the leftmost? Then the tail would be to the right? That doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me reinterpret the problem:\n\nFor a left-moving car: the head is at a smaller x than the tail? Actually, the problem doesn't specify which is left or right. Instead, we have:\n\n- Left-moving: the entire car moves left. So the head (the front) is at h, and the tail (the back) is at tau. Since it's moving left, the head is the leftmost? Actually, no: if the car is moving left, then the front is the leftmost. So the head should be the leftmost, and the tail is the rightmost? Then the span is [h, tau] with h < tau? But then when moving left, the head moves to h - s*(T-t1) and the tail moves to tau - s*(T-t1). So the entire segment shifts left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: the head is the front, which is the rightmost? Then the tail is the leftmost. So the span is [tail, head] = [tau, h] with tau <= h? Then moving right: becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h+s*(T-t1)].\n\nIn the input, we are given (head, tail, direction, speed). So:\n\n- For a right-moving car: head is the rightmost, tail is the leftmost. So the car spans from tail to head: [tail, head] (with tail <= head).\n- For a left-moving car: head is the leftmost, tail is the rightmost? But the input for freeway1: (-48, -71, right, 24). Here, head=-48, tail=-71. Since it's right-moving, the car should span from tail (-71) to head (-48). But note: -71 < -48, so that makes sense: the car is from x=-71 to x=-48 (so the tail is at -71, the head at -48). \n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car, we would have head < tail? Actually, we don't have any left-moving car in this input.\n\nSo all cars in this input are right-moving.\n\nTherefore, for a car with (head, tail, direction, speed) at turn t1, at turn T (>=t1):\n\n  if direction is right: \n      new_tail = tail + s*(T-t1)\n      new_head = head + s*(T-t1)\n      the car spans [new_tail, new_head] (inclusive)\n\n  if direction is left (none in this problem):\n      new_head = head - s*(T-t1)\n      new_tail = tail - s*(T-t1)\n      the car spans [new_head, new_tail] (if new_head <= new_tail) but note: for left-moving, the head is the leftmost so the span is [head, tail] (which would be from a lower x to a higher x) but wait: that would be the same as right? \n\nActually, the problem states for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" and then becomes [h-s*(T-t1), tau-s*(T-t1)]. So if h < tau, then after subtracting, the entire segment moves left. But if h > tau, then the segment is [h, tau] and h-s*(T-t1) < tau-s*(T-t1) so the segment becomes [h-s*(T-t1), tau-s*(T-t1)] which is still increasing? But the car is moving left so the head (which is at h) moves to the left? Then the head should be the front? So if the car is moving left, the head is the leftmost? Then we must have h < tau? Actually, no: the head is the front, so if moving left, the front is at a smaller x than the back? \n\nBut in the problem, the input for a left-moving car is not given, so we don't have to worry. We have only right-moving.\n\nNow, the collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (so y_T = k, which is between 1 and 8) and the player is at (0, k), then we check if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nImportant note: The player is on the freeway k at turn T if the y-coordinate at the start of turn T is k? Actually, the movement happens during the turn. The problem says:\n\n- Player update: at turn t, we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta.\n\nBut the collision condition: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\".\n\nWhat is y_T? It is the player's y-coordinate at turn T. Note that the player starts at turn t1 (72) at (0,0). Then at turn 72, the player is at y=0. But freeways are from y=1 to 8, so at y=0 we are safe (no cars). Similarly, at the goal y=9, there are no cars.\n\nAt turn T, the player is at (0, y_T). And we check the cars on freeway y_T. So if at turn T, the player is at y_T = 1, then we check the cars on freeway 1 at turn T.\n\nAlso note: the problem says: if at turn T you move to y_{T+1} != y_T, then you are not considered to be on freeway y_{T+1} at turn T. So at turn T, you are only on the freeway corresponding to y_T (the starting y of that turn). \n\nTherefore, during the entire turn T, the player is on freeway y_T. And we require that at that turn T, no car on freeway y_T has 0 in its span.\n\nOur goal: start at (0,0) at turn 72, and we want to get to (0,9) as quickly as possible. The minimal number of turns H is at least 9 (because we have to go from y=0 to y=9, and each step we can move at most 1). But we might have to wait (by staying or moving down then up) to avoid cars.\n\nSo we need to plan a path from y=0 to y=9 in the grid of freeways (rows 0 to 9) over time. The cars are moving and we must avoid being at freeway k at a turn when a car on freeway k has 0 in its span.\n\nWe are to output the sequence of actions from turn 72 (t1) until the turn when we first reach y=9.\n\nLet t0 = 72.\n\nWe are at:\n  t0: y=0\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each turn T (>=72) the set of times when the freeway k is safe (i.e., no car on freeway k at turn T has 0 in its span).\n\nBut note: each freeway k may have multiple cars. For each car, we can compute the time intervals when the car covers x=0.\n\nFor a car on freeway k at turn T, the car will cover x=0 at time T if:\n  new_tail <= 0 <= new_head\n\nFor a right-moving car: \n  new_tail = tail + s*(T-t0)\n  new_head = head + s*(T-t0)\n\nSo condition: \n  tail + s*(T-t0) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-t0)\n\nSimilarly for left-moving (none here).\n\nTherefore, for a car (tail, head, s) (and direction right, as given), the car covers 0 at T if:\n  T >= t0 + ceil( ( - head ) / s )   ??? Let me solve:\n\n  tail + s*(T-t0) <= 0  => T >= t0 + ceil( ( - tail ) / s )   [if s>0, and we are increasing]\n  and \n  0 <= head + s*(T-t0) => T >= t0 + ceil( ( - head ) / s )   ??? Actually, no:\n\n  Actually, the condition is:\n      tail + s*(T-t0) <= 0   => T >= t0 + ceil( ( - tail ) / s )   [if s>0, then we require T such that tail + s*(T-t0) <=0]\n  and\n      0 <= head + s*(T-t0)   => T >= t0 + ceil( ( - head ) / s )   ??? But note: head is greater than tail? Actually, we have:\n\n      Condition: tail + s*(T-t0) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-t0)\n\n  This is equivalent to:\n      - head <= s*(T-t0) <= - tail\n\n  So we require:\n      (- head) / s <= (T-t0) <= (- tail) / s\n\n  But note: since the car is moving right, and tail < head (and both are negative initially? or positive?).\n\nIn our input, we have:\n\nFreeway 1: tail=-71, head=-48, s=24, right.\n  Condition: - head = 48, - tail = 71\n  So: 48 <= 24*(T-t0) <= 71\n  => 48/24 <= (T-t0) <= 71/24\n  => 2 <= (T-t0) <= 71/24 = 2.958...\n\n  So (T-t0) must be in [2, 2.958...]. Since T is integer, T-t0 = 2.\n\n  Therefore, at T = t0+2 = 74, freeway1 is unsafe.\n\nFreeway 2: (-48, -83, right, 36) -> tail=-83, head=-48, s=36.\n  Condition: - head = 48, - tail = 83\n  => 48 <= 36*(T-t0) <= 83\n  => 48/36=1.333... <= (T-t0) <= 83/36≈2.305\n  So (T-t0) must be 2? because integer: 2 is in [1.333, 2.305] -> yes.\n\n  Therefore, freeway2 is unsafe at T= t0+2 = 74.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway2: unsafe at T=74.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway2: unsafe at T=74.\n\nFreeway 5: has three cars: \n  car1: (48,37,right,6) -> tail=37, head=48, s=6.\n    Condition: -48 <= 6*(T-t0) <= -37   -> wait, note: we require:\n        tail + s*(T-t0) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-t0)\n        => 37 + 6*(T-t0) <= 0 and 0 <= 48 + 6*(T-t0)\n\n    But 37+6*(T-t0)<=0 => 6*(T-t0)<=-37 -> (T-t0) <= -37/6 ≈ -6.166 -> impossible? because T>=t0.\n    Similarly, 48+6*(T-t0)>=0 => T-t0>=-8 -> always true for T>=t0.\n\n    So the condition becomes: 37+6*(T-t0)<=0 -> T-t0<=-37/6 -> no solution. So this car never covers 0.\n\n  car2: (12,1,right,6) -> tail=1, head=12, s=6.\n    Condition: 1+6*(T-t0)<=0 and 0<=12+6*(T-t0)\n    The second inequality: 12+6*(T-t0)>=0 -> T-t0>=-2 -> always true for T>=t0.\n    The first: 1+6*(T-t0)<=0 -> T-t0<=-1/6 -> impossible.\n\n    So safe.\n\n  car3: (-24,-35,right,6) -> tail=-35, head=-24, s=6.\n    Condition: -35+6*(T-t0)<=0<=-24+6*(T-t0)\n    => 6*(T-t0)<=35 and 6*(T-t0)>=24\n    => 24/6=4 <= (T-t0) <= 35/6≈5.833\n    So (T-t0)=4,5.\n\n    Therefore, freeway5 is unsafe at T= t0+4=76 and t0+5=77.\n\nFreeway6: same cars as freeway5 -> unsafe at T=76,77.\n\nFreeway7: (48,37,right,12) -> tail=37, head=48, s=12.\n    Condition: 37+12*(T-t0)<=0 -> 12*(T-t0)<=-37 -> impossible? \n    and 0<=48+12*(T-t0) -> always true for T>=t0.\n\n    So safe.\n\nFreeway8: (48,37,right,4) -> tail=37, head=48, s=4.\n    Condition: 37+4*(T-t0)<=0 -> 4*(T-t0)<=-37 -> impossible? \n    and 0<=48+4*(T-t0) -> always true.\n\n    So safe.\n\nSummary of unsafe times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway1: unsafe at T=72+2=74\nFreeway2: unsafe at T=74\nFreeway3: unsafe at T=74\nFreeway4: unsafe at T=74\nFreeway5: unsafe at T=76,77\nFreeway6: unsafe at T=76,77\nFreeway7: safe always\nFreeway8: safe always\n\nNote: freeway7 and 8 are always safe.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=0 at t0=72 to y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nThe minimal time is 9 turns (if we go up every turn: 0->1->2->...->9). But we must avoid the unsafe times.\n\nLet's simulate:\n\nWe are at turn 72 (t0): y=0 -> safe (no freeway at y=0)\n\nAt turn 72, we choose an action. We want to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut note: we must avoid being at an unsafe freeway at the same turn.\n\nConsider:\n\nTurn 72: we are at y0=0. We choose a72. Then at turn 73, we will be at y1 = y0 + Delta(a72).\n\nAt turn 73, we are at y1 and we check if that freeway (if y1 in [1,8]) is unsafe at turn 73.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 74, we are at y2 and we check for turn 74, etc.\n\nWe must avoid:\n\n- At turn 73: we might be at freeway k, which must be safe at turn 73.\n- At turn 74: we must be safe at the freeway we are on at turn 74.\n\nWe note the unsafe freeways at the following turns:\n\nTurn 73: \n  Freeway1: safe? we computed unsafe only at 74 -> safe at 73.\n  Freeway2: safe at 73? yes, because unsafe only at 74.\n  Similarly, freeways 3,4,5,6: safe at 73.\n\nTurn 74: \n  Freeway1: unsafe (at 74)\n  Freeway2: unsafe\n  Freeway3: unsafe\n  Freeway4: unsafe\n  Freeway5: safe (unsafe at 76,77)\n  Freeway6: safe\n  Freeway7: safe\n  Freeway8: safe\n\nTurn 75: \n  All freeways safe? \n    Freeway1: only unsafe at 74 -> safe at 75.\n    Similarly, freeway2,3,4: safe at 75.\n    Freeway5: unsafe at 76,77 -> safe at 75.\n    Freeway6: safe at 75.\n\nTurn 76:\n  Freeway5: unsafe\n  Freeway6: unsafe\n  Others safe.\n\nTurn 77:\n  Freeway5: unsafe\n  Freeway6: unsafe\n  Others safe.\n\nTurn 78: all safe.\n\nNow, we want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible. The minimal turns is 9, so we aim to be at y=9 at turn 72+8 = 80? \n\nWait: if we start at turn 72 at y0=0, and we take 9 moves (each U) then at the 9th move we will be at y=9 at turn 72+9? \n\nActually, at turn 72: we are at y=0.\nAfter 1st action (at turn72): we move to y=1 at turn73.\nAfter 2nd action (at turn73): we move to y=2 at turn74.\n...\nAfter 8th action (at turn79): we move to y=8 at turn80.\nAfter 9th action (at turn80): we move to y=9 at turn81.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at the last action. So at turn81, we are at (0,9). So H=9 actions? But the sequence is from t1 (72) to t1+H-1 = 72+8=80? \n\nActually, the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1, and after H actions we are at (0,9). So the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then at the next turn (t1+H) the position becomes 9.\n\nBut the problem says: we are to output the actions for turns: t1, t1+1, ... until the last action that leads to (0,9). And the minimal H is the number of actions.\n\nWe want to minimize H.\n\nThe minimal H is 9 (since we have to increase by 9). But we might have to wait sometimes, so H might be more.\n\nHowever, let's see if we can do H=9:\n\nWe need to go from y=0 to y=9 in 9 moves, so we must use 9 U's? Actually, we can also use D or S to wait, but that would increase H. So to minimize H, we want to use as many U's as possible.\n\nBut we must avoid being at an unsafe freeway at any turn.\n\nThe path would be:\n\n  Turn 72: at y=0 -> safe (no freeway)\n  Turn 73: at y=1 -> freeway1: safe (since unsafe only at turn74)\n  Turn 74: at y=2 -> freeway2: unsafe at turn74 -> cannot be at freeway2 at turn74.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=2 at turn74.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being at freeway2 at turn74. Since we are at y=1 at turn73, if we use U at turn73 we go to y=2 at turn74 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must not go up from y=1 at turn73. We can either stay or go down.\n\nBut if we stay at y=1 at turn73 (so at turn74 we are still at y=1) -> but freeway1 is unsafe at turn74 -> so at turn74 we would be at freeway1 -> unsafe.\n\nAlternatively, if we go down at turn73: from y=1 to y=0 at turn74 -> then at turn74 we are at y=0 -> safe (no freeway). But then we have lost progress.\n\nSo at turn73, we cannot go up (because then at turn74 we are at y=2 -> unsafe) and we cannot stay (because then at turn74 we are at y=1 -> unsafe) and we cannot go down (because then we are back at y=0 and then we have to redo). \n\nTherefore, we must avoid being at freeways 1,2,3,4 at turn74. And we are at y=1 at turn73. How?\n\nWe must not be at freeway1,2,3,4 at turn74. So we must be either at y=0, or y>=5 at turn74.\n\nBut at turn73 we are at y=1. We can only move one step per turn. So at turn74 we can be at y=0,1, or 2.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, y=1 is unsafe (freeway1 at turn74), y=2 is unsafe (freeway2 at turn74). So the only safe option at turn74 from y=1 is to go down to y=0.\n\nBut then we are back at y=0 at turn74. Then we have to go up again. This will take more than 9 turns.\n\nAlternatively, we might try to wait at y=0 for one turn? But at turn72 we are at y=0. If we do S at turn72: then at turn73 we are still at y=0 -> safe. Then at turn73 we can go up to y=1 -> safe (freeway1 safe at turn73). Then at turn74, we are at y=1 -> unsafe? because freeway1 is unsafe at turn74. So same problem.\n\nSo we must avoid being at freeway1 at turn74. Therefore, we must be at y!=1 at turn74. Similarly, we must avoid freeway2,3,4 at turn74. So we must be at y=0 or y>=5 at turn74.\n\nBut how to get to y>=5 at turn74? \n\nWe start at turn72: y=0.\nAt turn72: we can do U -> then at turn73: y=1.\nAt turn73: we can do U -> then at turn74: y=2 -> unsafe.\n\nAt turn72: we do U -> turn73: y=1.\nAt turn73: we do nothing (S) -> turn74: y=1 -> unsafe.\n\nAt turn72: we do U -> turn73: y=1.\nAt turn73: we do D -> turn74: y=0 -> safe.\n\nBut then we are back at 0.\n\nAlternatively, we try to go faster? We can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo we cannot reach y>=5 by turn74.\n\nTherefore, the only safe place at turn74 is y=0.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 at turn74.\n\nHow? \n  Option 1: \n      turn72: at y=0 -> do S -> turn73: y=0.\n      turn73: do U -> turn74: y=1 -> unsafe.\n\n  Option 2:\n      turn72: U -> turn73: y=1.\n      turn73: D -> turn74: y=0.\n\nSo we do: \n  72: U -> then at turn73: y=1.\n  73: D -> then at turn74: y=0.\n\nThen at turn74: we are at y=0 -> safe.\n\nNow, at turn74, we are at y=0. Then we can start going up.\n\nBut we have to avoid freeway5 and 6 at turn76 and 77.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as fast as possible. \n\nWe are at turn74: y=0.\n\nWe need to go from 0 to 9: 9 steps. So the earliest we can be at y=9 is at turn74+9 = 83? \n\nBut note: we are at turn74: we are about to take an action at turn74 that will determine y at turn75.\n\nWe must avoid:\n\n  turn76: freeway5 and 6 unsafe -> so at turn76, we must not be at y=5 or 6.\n  turn77: same.\n\nAlso, we must avoid being at freeway1,2,3,4 at turn74? but we are at y=0 at turn74 -> safe.\n\nNow, we plan:\n\n  turn74: at y=0 -> safe. We do U -> turn75: y=1 -> safe? \n      turn75: freeway1 is safe (only unsafe at 74) -> safe.\n\n  turn75: we do U -> turn76: y=2 -> safe? \n      at turn76: freeway2 is safe? because unsafe only at 74 -> safe.\n\n  turn76: we do U -> turn77: y=3 -> safe? freeway3 safe at 76? yes.\n\n  turn77: we do U -> turn78: y=4 -> safe? freeway4 safe at 78? (was unsafe only at 74) -> safe.\n\n  turn78: we do U -> turn79: y=5 -> but freeway5 is unsafe at turn78? \n      We computed freeway5 unsafe at turn76 and 77. At turn78, freeway5 is safe? \n          For freeway5, the unsafe times are T=76,77 -> so at T=78, safe.\n\n  So at turn79: we are at y=5 -> freeway5 at turn79: safe? \n      We computed freeway5 unsafe only at 76,77 -> safe at 79.\n\n  Then we can continue:\n\n      turn79: U -> turn80: y=6 -> freeway6 at turn80: safe? (unsafe only at 76,77) -> safe.\n      turn80: U -> turn81: y=7 -> freeway7 safe.\n      turn81: U -> turn82: y=8 -> freeway8 safe.\n      turn82: U -> turn83: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo total turns: from turn72 to turn82 (for the actions) and then at turn83 we are at y=9.\n\nBut the actions: \n  72: U\n  73: D\n  74: U\n  75: U\n  76: U\n  77: U\n  78: U\n  79: U\n  80: U\n  81: U\n  82: U\n\nThat's 11 actions.\n\nBut we might do better? \n\nAlternatively, after turn74 (at y=0), we might try to go up faster? but we can only go one step per turn.\n\nBut note: at turn74 we are at y=0. We have to avoid being at freeway5 and 6 at turn76 and 77? \n\nAt turn76: we are at the freeway corresponding to the y at turn76. How many steps can we take from turn74 to turn76?\n\n  turn74: at y=0 -> action at turn74: we choose U -> turn75: y=1.\n  turn75: action: U -> turn76: y=2.\n\nSo at turn76, we are at y=2 -> safe (freeway2 unsafe only at 74).\n\nSimilarly, at turn77: we would be at y=3 (if we go up at turn76) -> safe.\n\nSo we don't need to worry about freeway5 and 6 because we are not at y=5 or 6 at turn76 or 77.\n\nBut then we can go straight up:\n\n  turn74: U -> turn75: y=1\n  turn75: U -> turn76: y=2\n  turn76: U -> turn77: y=3\n  turn77: U -> turn78: y=4\n  turn78: U -> turn79: y=5 -> safe? yes (freeway5 unsafe only at 76,77 -> safe at 79)\n  turn79: U -> turn80: y=6 -> safe? freeway6 unsafe only at 76,77 -> safe at 80.\n  turn80: U -> turn81: y=7\n  turn81: U -> turn82: y=8\n  turn82: U -> turn83: y=9.\n\nSame as above: 11 actions.\n\nBut wait, we started at turn72 and we did two actions (U and D) to get to turn74 at y=0. Then from turn74 to turn83: 9 actions? Actually:\n\n  Actions at: \n      72: U\n      73: D\n      74: U\n      75: U\n      76: U\n      77: U\n      78: U\n      79: U\n      80: U\n      81: U\n      82: U\n\nTotal 11 actions. The last action is at turn82, and then at turn83 we are at y=9.\n\nBut is there a way to avoid the two extra moves?\n\nWe have to avoid the unsafe freeways at turn74. We are forced to be at y=0 at turn74. So we have to do the U and then D.\n\nAlternatively, we might try to go to a safe freeway at turn74 that is not 0? But we saw that at turn74, the only safe freeway is y=0 and y>=5? but we cannot reach y>=5 by turn74.\n\nSo we must have at least two extra moves? \n\nBut wait: what if we skip freeway2 at turn74 by being at freeway1 at turn73 and then at turn74 we are at freeway0? That's what we did: we were at freeway1 at turn73 and then we went down to freeway0 at turn74.\n\nTotal moves: 11. But minimal H is 11? \n\nBut note: we could consider waiting at y=0 for two turns? \n\nAt turn72: we do S -> turn73: y=0 -> safe.\nAt turn73: we do S -> turn74: y=0 -> safe.\nThen at turn74: we start going up.\n\nThen we can go:\n\n  turn74: U -> turn75: y=1\n  turn75: U -> turn76: y=2\n  turn76: U -> turn77: y=3\n  turn77: U -> turn78: y=4\n  turn78: U -> turn79: y=5\n  turn79: U -> turn80: y=6\n  turn80: U -> turn81: y=7\n  turn81: U -> turn82: y=8\n  turn82: U -> turn83: y=9\n\nThat's 10 actions: \n  72: S\n  73: S\n  74: U\n  75: U\n  ... \n  82: U\n\nTotal 10 actions? But we started at turn72 and the last action is at turn82, and we are at y=9 at turn83.\n\nBut wait: we avoided the two moves (U and D) by two S's. But we still have two extra moves? \n\nCompared to the minimal 9? \n\nIn this plan, we used 10 actions. The minimal is 9? but we had to avoid the unsafe turn74 by staying at y=0 for two extra turns? \n\nBut actually, we only needed to avoid turn74? So we could have:\n\n  turn72: U -> then at turn73: y=1 -> safe (since freeway1 safe at73)\n  turn73: we cannot be at y=1 at turn74 -> unsafe. So we must leave freeway1 at turn74. We can only go to y=0 or y=2? \n      But if we go to y=2 at turn74, that's unsafe (freeway2). \n      So we must go to y=0 at turn74.\n\n  So we must do: \n        turn72: U\n        turn73: D\n\n  That's two moves to end at y=0 at turn74.\n\nAlternatively, if we do nothing at turn72 and turn73, we end at y=0 at turn74 with two moves: \n        turn72: S\n        turn73: S\n\n  Then we start going up.\n\nSo both ways use two moves to be at y=0 at turn74. \n\nBut the second way (with two S's) uses 10 actions to get to y=9? Actually, from turn74 to turn83: 9 actions (from y=0 to y=9). So total actions: 2 (at turn72 and 73) + 9 (from 74 to 82) = 11? \n\nWait: \n  Actions:\n      turn72: S  -> then at turn73: y=0\n      turn73: S  -> then at turn74: y=0\n      turn74: U  -> then at turn75: y=1\n      turn75: U  -> then at turn76: y=2\n      turn76: U  -> then at turn77: y=3\n      turn77: U  -> then at turn78: y=4\n      turn78: U  -> then at turn79: y=5\n      turn79: U  -> then at turn80: y=6\n      turn80: U  -> then at turn81: y=7\n      turn81: U  -> then at turn82: y=8\n      turn82: U  -> then at turn83: y=9\n\nSo we have 11 actions: from turn72 to turn82.\n\nBut the first way (U then D) also had 11 actions.\n\nSo both ways take 11 actions.\n\nBut wait: in the second way, we have two S's at the beginning. Then we do 9 U's. Total 11 actions.\n\nIs there a way to do 10 actions? \n\nWe want to be at y=9 at turn72+10 = 82? \n\nAt turn82: we are at y=9? That would require that the last action (at turn81) moves us to y=9. \n\nSo we must be at y=8 at turn81. Then at turn81 we do U -> y=9 at turn82.\n\nSo we must be at y=8 at turn81.\n\nHow many steps from y=0 at turn72 to y=8 at turn81? \n  That's 8 steps in 9 turns? \n      turn72: start at y0=0.\n      turn73: y1\n      ...\n      turn81: y9 = we require 8? \n\nBut we have 9 moves (from turn72 to turn80) to get from 0 to 8. \n\nBut we have to avoid being at unsafe positions.\n\nWe must avoid being at freeways 1,2,3,4 at turn74. So we must be at y=0 at turn74.\n\nSo:\n\n  turn72: we do ... then at turn73: y? and turn74: y=0.\n\n  How to be at y=0 at turn74? \n      We start at turn72: y=0. \n      Then we can do: \n          turn72: S -> turn73: y=0\n          turn73: S -> turn74: y=0\n\n      Or:\n          turn72: U -> turn73: y=1\n          turn73: D -> turn74: y=0\n\n  Both ways: we are at y=0 at turn74.\n\nThen from turn74 to turn81: 7 moves? We need to go from y=0 to y=8? That's 8 steps. But we have 7 moves? \n      turn74: action -> turn75: y?\n      ...\n      turn80: action -> turn81: y?\n\n  We have 7 actions: turn74 to turn80 -> 7 moves. We can go at most 7 steps. So we can only get to y=7 at turn81.\n\n  Then at turn81 we do U -> turn82: y=8 -> not 9.\n\n  Then we need another move at turn81: U -> turn82: y=8 -> then at turn82: U -> turn83: y=9.\n\n  So total 10 moves? \n\n  But wait: \n      Actions at: \n        turn72: S (or U) \n        turn73: S (or D) \n        turn74: U \n        turn75: U \n        turn76: U \n        turn77: U \n        turn78: U \n        turn79: U \n        turn80: U -> then at turn81: y=7? \n        turn81: U -> turn82: y=8\n        turn82: U -> turn83: y=9\n\n  That's 10 moves? But we did 10 moves? Actually:\n\n        turn72: one move\n        turn73: one move\n        turn74: one move\n        ...\n        turn82: one move -> total 11 moves.\n\n  Because from turn72 to turn82: 11 turns -> 11 moves.\n\nTo get to y=9 at turn83, we must have 11 moves? \n\nBut we want to minimize the number of moves H. \n\nIs there a way to get to y=9 in 10 moves? That would be: \n      at turn72: start at y=0\n      after 10 moves: we are at y=9 at turn72+10 = 82.\n\nHow? \n      We must be at y=9 at turn82. So we must be at y=8 at turn81? \n\nHow to be at y=8 at turn81? \n\nWe must avoid:\n\n  At turn74: we must be at y=0 (to avoid freeways 1-4 at turn74).\n\nSo from turn72 to turn74: we must end at y=0 at turn74.\n\nThen from turn74 to turn81: we have 7 moves (turn74 to turn80) to go from y=0 to y=8? That requires 8 moves -> impossible.\n\nTherefore, minimal moves is 11.\n\nBut wait: what if we don't go to y=0 at turn74? We must avoid freeways 1,2,3,4 at turn74. We are forced to be at y=0 or y>=5? and we cannot get to y>=5 by turn74. So we must be at y=0 at turn74.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, we have two strategies:\n\nStrategy A:\n  72: U\n  73: D\n  74: U\n  75: U\n  76: U\n  77: U\n  78: U\n  79: U\n  80: U\n  81: U\n  82: U\n\nStrategy B:\n  72: S\n  73: S\n  74: U\n  75: U\n  76: U\n  77: U\n  78: U\n  79: U\n  80: U\n  81: U\n  82: U\n\nBut note: in strategy A, at turn73 we are at y=1 -> which is safe (freeway1 safe at turn73). Then at turn74 we go to y=0 -> safe.\n\nIn strategy B, we stay at y=0 for two turns.\n\nBoth are 11 moves.\n\nBut we also have to avoid freeway5 and 6 at turn76 and 77? \n\nIn both strategies, we are at:\n\n  turn76: we are at y=2 (if we started going up at turn74) -> safe (freeway2 safe at76).\n  turn77: y=3 -> safe.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nWe can choose either. Let's choose strategy A: because we at least tried to go up at the beginning.\n\nBut wait: is there a way to save a move? \n\nWhat if we can skip one move by being at a safe freeway at turn74 that we haven't considered? \n\nWe computed that freeways 1,2,3,4 are unsafe at turn74. But what about freeway5? \n  At turn74: freeway5: we computed unsafe at 76,77 -> safe at 74.\n\nBut how to get to freeway5 at turn74? \n  We start at y=0 at turn72.\n  We need to get to y=5 at turn74: that requires 5 steps in 2 moves -> impossible.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6,7,8: \n  freeway6: safe at 74? yes (unsafe only at 76,77)\n  freeway7: safe\n  freeway8: safe\n\nBut we cannot get to y=6,7,8 by turn74.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y=0 at turn74.\n\nSo we output:\n\nTurn 72: U\nTurn 73: D\nTurn 74: U\nTurn 75: U\nTurn 76: U\nTurn 77: U\nTurn 78: U\nTurn 79: U\nTurn 80: U\nTurn 81: U\nTurn 82: U\n\nBut wait: at turn82, after the last U, we are at y=9 at turn83. \n\nIs there any other unsafe freeway we haven't considered? \n\nWe have to check the entire path:\n\n  Turn72: y0=0 -> safe\n  Turn73: y1=1 -> freeway1: safe at turn73? yes (unsafe only at74)\n  Turn74: y2=0 -> safe (y0)\n  Turn75: y3=1 -> freeway1: safe at75? yes (only unsafe at74)\n  Turn76: y4=2 -> freeway2: safe at76? yes (only unsafe at74)\n  Turn77: y5=3 -> freeway3: safe at77? yes\n  Turn78: y6=4 -> freeway4: safe at78? yes\n  Turn79: y7=5 -> freeway5: safe at79? (unsafe at76,77) -> safe\n  Turn80: y8=6 -> freeway6: safe at80? (unsafe at76,77) -> safe\n  Turn81: y9=7 -> freeway7: safe\n  Turn82: y10=8 -> freeway8: safe\n  Then at turn83: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo safe.\n\nBut note: at turn82 we are at y=8, and we do U -> then at turn83 we are at y=9. So the last action is at turn82.\n\nTherefore, the sequence has 11 actions: from turn72 to turn82.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and H is the minimal number of turns.\n\nWe have H=11.\n\nBut let me count the turns:\n\n  t1 = 72: action0 (U)\n  t1+1=73: action1 (D)\n  t1+2=74: action2 (U)\n  ...\n  t1+10=82: action10 (U)\n\nSo t from 0 to 10 -> 11 actions.\n\nNow, the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 72: U\nTurn 73: D\nTurn 74: U\nTurn 75: U\nTurn 76: U\nTurn 77: U\nTurn 78: U\nTurn 79: U\nTurn 80: U\nTurn 81: U\nTurn 82: U\n}\n\nBut we have 11 lines.\n\nIs there a shorter path? \n\nWhat if we go up to freeway7 or 8 and then wait? But we are in a hurry to go up.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid freeway5 and 6 at turn76 and 77 by being at a different freeway? \n\nIn our current plan, we are at freeway2 at turn76 and freeway3 at turn77 -> safe. So no need.\n\nBut if we were to be at freeway5 at turn76, that would be unsafe. But we are not.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the above sequence.\n\nBut note: we have freeway5 and 6 with unsafe times 76 and 77. We are at y=2 at turn76 and y=3 at turn77 -> not 5 or 6, so safe.\n\nSo we are good.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nTo reach the goal position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn 72, the minimal number of turns required is 11, considering the need to avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The unsafe conditions are:\n\n- Freeways 1, 2, 3, and 4 are unsafe at turn 74 (t₁ + 2 = 72 + 2 = 74).\n- Freeways 5 and 6 are unsafe at turns 76 and 77 (t₁ + 4 = 76 and t₁ + 5 = 77).\n\nThe player must be at y=0 at turn 74 to avoid collisions on freeways 1-4. Starting from y=0 at turn 72:\n- At turn 72, moving up to y=1 is safe (freeway 1 is safe at turn 73).\n- At turn 73, moving down to y=0 is necessary to avoid freeway 1 at turn 74 (unsafe) and freeway 2 at turn 74 (if moving up).\n- At turn 74, the player is at y=0 (safe), and then moves up consecutively to reach y=9.\n\nThe path avoids collisions:\n- Turn 76: y=2 (freeway 2 safe, unsafe only at turn 74).\n- Turn 77: y=3 (freeway 3 safe, unsafe only at turn 74).\n- Turn 79: y=5 (freeway 5 safe, unsafe only at turns 76-77).\n- Turn 80: y=6 (freeway 6 safe, unsafe only at turns 76-77).\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 72: U\nTurn 73: D\nTurn 74: U\nTurn 75: U\nTurn 76: U\nTurn 77: U\nTurn 78: U\nTurn 79: U\nTurn 80: U\nTurn 81: U\nTurn 82: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get the player from (0,0) at turn 74 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 through y=8. The player moves vertically with actions U (up), D (down), or S (stay), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, given its position at turn 74, I need to find where it is at future turns to avoid being on the same freeway when the car spans x=0.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. Importantly, when I move to a new freeway, I'm not on it until the next turn. So if I move up from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is the top, and since y=0 is the bottom, and freeways are from 1 to 8, y=9 might be safe, but I need to check if there are cars there. y=9 is not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 should be clear of cars, I think. The problem says \"freeways y=1, ..., 8\", so y=9 is not a freeway, so no cars there. Similarly, y=0 might be safe, but I start at y=0, and I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are probably safe zones with no cars. The collision avoidance is only for freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nNow, at turn 74, player is at (0,0). I need to go to (0,9).\n\nThe minimal number of turns to just move up without any cars would be 9 actions: U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U to go from 0 to 9 in 9 steps. But with cars, I might need to wait or go down sometimes to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, I need to model where the cars are at each future turn.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t1=74.\n\nFor each car, I have head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nFor left-moving cars, span moves left, so h and τ decrease by s per turn.\n\nFor right-moving cars, span moves right, so h and τ increase by s per turn.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (h, τ, d, s), but for left-moving, h should be greater than τ since it's moving left, so span is from h to τ with h > τ? Let's see the update.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut for left-moving, if it's moving left, the head should be on the left or right? I think I need to interpret the span.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, span becomes [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], and for right-moving, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], no.\n\nLook:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\n\nRight-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\n\nIn the initial state, for left-moving, it's given as (h, τ, left, s), and span is [h, τ], which I assume h and τ are such that for left-moving, h is the left end or right end?\n\nThe notation is a bit ambiguous.\n\nFor example, in freeway 1: (0, -23, right, 24)\n\nDirection is right, so for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h]? From the update.\n\nGeneral: for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] and at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ] and at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nIn the input, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but for left-moving, head is the leading part, I think.\n\nIn freeway 1: (0, -23, right, 24)\n\nDirection right, so at t1, span is [τ, h] = [-23, 0] because it says for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h]? No.\n\nFrom the update rule: for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\"\n\nBut in the car state, it's listed as (h, τ, d, s), so for freeway 1: (0, -23, right, 24), so h=0, τ=-23, d=right, s=24.\n\nFor right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-23, 0]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, if it were, span at t1 is [h, τ].\n\nIn this case, all cars seem to be right-moving except possibly some, but let's list all.\n\nFreeway 1: (0, -23, right, 24) → span at t1: [τ, h] = [-23, 0]\n\nFreeway 2: (24, -11, right, 36) → span at t1: [τ, h] = [-11, 24]\n\nFreeway 3: (24, -11, right, 36) → same as above, [ -11, 24]\n\nFreeway 4: (24, -11, right, 36) → [ -11, 24]\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nFor each, span at t1: for first: [49,60]? τ=49, h=60? (h,τ) given, so for right-moving, span is [τ,h]\n\nFirst car: h=60, τ=49, d=right, s=6, so span at t1: [τ,h] = [49,60]\n\nSimilarly, second: h=24, τ=13, d=right, s=6, span [13,24]\n\nThird: h=-12, τ=-23, d=right, s=6, span [-23,-12]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5: (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6) so spans [49,60], [13,24], [-23,-12]\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-59,right,12) → h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=12, span [τ,h] = [-59,-48]\n\nFreeway 8: (56,45,right,4) → h=56, τ=45, d=right, s=4, span [45,56]\n\nAll cars are right-moving; no left-moving mentioned.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if player is on freeway y_T and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nThat is, for freeway k at turn T, if y_T = k, and min_span <= 0 <= max_span for some car on that freeway.\n\nSince all spans are intervals, we need 0 in [low, high] for some car on row y_T at time T.\n\nNow, player starts at y=0, turn 74.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nSince freeways are 1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up as fast as possible, but I need to avoid the rows when a car is at x=0.\n\nSince cars move, I need to find times when it's safe to be on each row.\n\nLet ΔT = T - t1 = T - 74.\n\nFor each freeway, and for each car, the span at time T is:\n\nFor right-moving car, span at T: [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT]\n\nAnd 0 is in span if τ + s ΔT <= 0 <= h + s ΔT\n\nSimilarly for left, but all right here.\n\nSo for each car, we can find when 0 is covered.\n\nBut for a given freeway, we need if at time T, there is any car on that freeway covering 0.\n\nThen, for the player to be on that freeway at time T, it must be that no car covers 0 at that time.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars and when 0 is covered.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: only one car: at t1, span [-23,0], s=24, right-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [-23 + 24 ΔT, 0 + 24 ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -23 + 24 ΔT <= 0 <= 0 + 24 ΔT\n\nSince h + s ΔT = 0 + 24 ΔT\n\nτ + s ΔT = -23 + 24 ΔT\n\nSo 0 in span if:\n\n-23 + 24 ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= 24 ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -23 + 24 ΔT <= 0 => 24 ΔT <= 23 => ΔT <= 23/24\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 24 ΔT => ΔT >= 0\n\nBut since ΔT = T - 74, T >= 74, so ΔT >= 0.\n\nNow, 0 <= 24 ΔT is always true for ΔT >= 0, since 24 ΔT >=0.\n\n0 <= 24 ΔT implies ΔT >=0, which is true.\n\nBut -23 + 24 ΔT <= 0 implies ΔT <= 23/24 ≈ 0.958\n\nSo for ΔT <= 23/24, 0 is covered.\n\nΔT is integer? Turns are discrete, so ΔT integer >=0.\n\nT is turn number, integer.\n\nSo ΔT integer >=0.\n\nFor freeway 1, car covers 0 when:\n\n-23 + 24 ΔT <= 0 <= 24 ΔT\n\n0 <= 24 ΔT: since ΔT >=0, 24 ΔT >=0, so 0 <= 24 ΔT always true for ΔT >=0.\n\n-23 + 24 ΔT <= 0: 24 ΔT <= 23, ΔT <= 23/24 < 1, so for ΔT =0, it holds.\n\nΔT=0: -23 +0 <=0 <=0? -23 <=0 <=0, 0<=0 true, but -23<=0 true, so yes.\n\nAt ΔT=0, 0 is covered? Span at T=74 is [-23,0], so x=0 is included, since it's the head.\n\n[ -23, 0 ] includes 0.\n\nSo at T=74, for freeway 1, car is at [-23,0], so x=0 is covered.\n\nNow, for ΔT=1: span [-23 +24, 0+24] = [1,24], which is from 1 to 24, so 0 not in [1,24], so not covered.\n\nSimilarly, for ΔT>0, span [ -23 +24ΔT, 24ΔT ], since min is increasing, for ΔT>=1, min >=1 >0, so 0 not covered.\n\nOnly at ΔT=0, 0 is covered.\n\nBut at T=74, which is now, player is at y=0, not on freeway 1, so no collision at start.\n\nPlayer is at (0,0) at turn 74, which is y=0, not a freeway, so safe.\n\nNow for freeway 1: unsafe when 0 covered, which is only at ΔT=0, T=74.\n\nBut at T=74, if player were on y=1, it would be collision, but player is at y=0.\n\nFor future turns, on freeway 1, unsafe only at T=74, but since T=74 is past, for T>74, ΔT>=1, span min >=1, so 0 not covered, so freeway 1 is always safe for T>74? ΔT>=1.\n\nT=75, ΔT=1, span [1,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly for later, safe.\n\nBut is there only one car? Yes, freeway 1 has one car.\n\nSo for freeway 1, safe at all times except T=74, but T=74 is not future for player movement.\n\nPlayer starts at T=74, y=0, and will move at turns T=75,76,etc.\n\nSo for freeway 1, since only unsafe at T=74, and for T>74, safe, so player can be on freeway 1 at any turn T>74 without problem.\n\nNow freeway 2: cars: one car (24,-11,right,36) → at t1, span [τ,h] = [-11,24]\n\ns=36\n\nSpan at T: [-11 + 36 ΔT, 24 + 36 ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -11 +36 ΔT <= 0 <= 24 +36 ΔT\n\nFirst, 0 <= 24 +36 ΔT always true since ΔT>=0.\n\n-11 +36 ΔT <= 0 => 36 ΔT <= 11 => ΔT <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so only for ΔT=0.\n\nAt ΔT=0, -11 <=0 <=24 true.\n\nFor ΔT=1, min= -11+36=25>0, so 0 not covered.\n\nSo similarly, only unsafe at T=74, safe for T>74.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2, (24,-11,right,36), so same, unsafe only at T=74, safe after.\n\nFreeway 4: same, unsafe only at T=74, safe after.\n\nNow freeway 5: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,6) → h=60, τ=49, so span at t1 [49,60]\n\ns=6\n\nSpan at T: [49 + 6 ΔT, 60 + 6 ΔT]\n\n0 in this? min=49 +6ΔT >=49 >0 for ΔT>=0, so always min>0, 0 never covered by this car.\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,6) → h=24, τ=13, span [13,24] at t1\n\ns=6\n\nSpan at T: [13 +6ΔT, 24+6ΔT] min=13+6ΔT >=13>0, so 0 never covered.\n\nThird car: (-12,-23,right,6) → h=-12, τ=-23, span [ -23, -12] at t1\n\ns=6\n\nSpan at T: [ -23 +6ΔT, -12 +6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -23 +6ΔT <= 0 <= -12 +6ΔT\n\nNow, 0 <= -12 +6ΔT => 6ΔT >=12 => ΔT >=2\n\nAnd -23 +6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=23 => ΔT <= 23/6 ≈ 3.833, so ΔT <=3 since integer.\n\nThus, for ΔT=2,3\n\nAt ΔT=2: span [ -23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] , so -11<=0<=0? 0<=0 true, -11<=0 true, so yes, 0 covered.\n\nAt ΔT=3: span [ -23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6], -5<=0<=6 true.\n\nAt ΔT=1: span [ -23+6, -12+6] = [-17,-6], min=-17, max=-6, both <0, 0 not in.\n\nAt ΔT=4: span [ -23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], min>0, 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 5, third car covers 0 at ΔT=2 and 3, i.e., T=76 and 77.\n\nNow, are there other cars? First and second don't cover 0, so only unsafe when third car covers 0, at T=76 and 77.\n\nT=76: ΔT=76-74=2, T=77: ΔT=3.\n\nNow freeway 6: same cars as freeway 5: (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nSo identical to freeway 5, so unsafe at T=76 and 77.\n\nNow freeway 7: one car (-48,-59,right,12) → h=-48, τ=-59, span at t1 [τ,h] = [-59,-48]\n\ns=12\n\nSpan at T: [ -59 +12 ΔT, -48 +12 ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -59 +12 ΔT <= 0 <= -48 +12 ΔT\n\nFirst, 0 <= -48 +12 ΔT => 12 ΔT >=48 => ΔT >=4\n\nSecond, -59 +12 ΔT <=0 => 12 ΔT <=59 => ΔT <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so ΔT <=4\n\nΔT >=4 and ΔT <=4, so only at ΔT=4.\n\nAt ΔT=4: span [ -59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], so -11<=0<=0 true.\n\nAt ΔT=3: [ -59+36, -48+36] = [-23,-12], min=-23<0, max=-12<0, 0 not in.\n\nAt ΔT=5: [ -59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], min>0, 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe only at T=78 (ΔT=4).\n\nT=74 + ΔT, ΔT=4, T=78.\n\nNow freeway 8: one car (56,45,right,4) → h=56, τ=45, span at t1 [45,56]\n\ns=4\n\nSpan at T: [45 +4ΔT, 56 +4ΔT]\n\nmin=45+4ΔT >=45>0, so 0 never covered. Always safe.\n\nSummary of unsafe times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: unsafe only at T=74, safe after\n\n- y=2: unsafe only at T=74, safe after\n\n- y=3: unsafe only at T=74, safe after\n\n- y=4: unsafe only at T=74, safe after\n\n- y=5: unsafe at T=76 and T=77\n\n- y=6: unsafe at T=76 and T=77\n\n- y=7: unsafe at T=78\n\n- y=8: always safe\n\nPlayer needs to be on each row at some point to move up, but can stay or move down.\n\nThe path must go from y=0 to y=9, so through y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, but not necessarily in order, and can revisit rows.\n\nSince we want minimal turns, probably go up as much as possible, avoiding unsafe times.\n\nPlayer starts at T=74, y=0.\n\nAt each turn, choose action to change y or stay.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, and no freeway above.\n\nNow, the unsafe periods:\n\ny=5 and y=6 are both unsafe at T=76 and 77.\n\ny=7 unsafe at T=78.\n\nOthers are safe except at T=74, which is past.\n\nFor y=1 to 4 and y=8, always safe for T>74.\n\ny=5 and y=6 unsafe at T=76,77.\n\ny=7 unsafe at T=78.\n\nNow, let's think about the timeline.\n\nPlayer at T=74: y=0\n\nT=75: can be y=0 or y=1 (by S or U)\n\nT=76: y=0,1, or 2 (depending on previous)\n\netc.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=5 or y=6 at T=76 or T=77.\n\nSimilarly, avoid y=7 at T=78.\n\nNow, since y=5 and y=6 are both unsafe at same times, and adjacent, might be tricky.\n\nAlso, y=7 unsafe only at T=78.\n\nNow, to go from y=0 to y=9, minimal steps is 9, but with constraints.\n\nFirst, let's see the critical times.\n\nT=76 and 77: y=5 and y=6 unsafe.\n\nT=78: y=7 unsafe.\n\nAt other times, all rows are safe.\n\nSo, for example, if I can be above y=6 by T=76, or below y=5, but since I start from 0, I need to go up.\n\nLet me denote the player's y at each turn T.\n\nT=74: y=0\n\nNow, possible actions.\n\nI need to plan the sequence.\n\nSince the constraints are only at specific times, I can avoid those rows at those times.\n\nFirst, at T=76, I should not be on y=5 or y=6.\n\nSimilarly at T=77, not on y=5 or y=6.\n\nAt T=78, not on y=7.\n\nNow, y=5 and y=6 are unsafe only at those times, so I can be on them at other times.\n\nSimilarly for y=7.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should go up as fast as possible, except avoid being on forbidden rows at forbidden times.\n\nLet me see how high I can be by each turn.\n\nStart T=74, y=0.\n\nT=75: I can go to y=1 (U) or stay y=0 (S). Going down to y=-1 not possible, y min=0, so only U or S, but S keeps y=0, which might be useful if I need to wait.\n\nBut since I need to go up, probably U is better, but let's see.\n\nAssume I go up when possible.\n\nT=75: if U, y=1\n\nNow T=76: from y=1, I can go to y=0,1,2 (D,S,U)\n\nBut at T=76, I need to avoid y=5 and y=6. Since I am at y=1, I can only reach y=0,1,2, so no problem, y=5 and 6 are far away.\n\nSimilarly, T=77: from wherever I am, if I am low, I might be able to go up.\n\nBut I need to reach high quickly to avoid the unsafe times later.\n\ny=7 is unsafe at T=78, so I should not be on y=7 at T=78.\n\nNow, let's think about when I can be on y=5,6,7.\n\nFor y=5: I can be on it except at T=76 and 77.\n\nSimilarly y=6 except T=76,77.\n\ny=7 except T=78.\n\nNow, to go from y=4 to y=5, I need to be at y=4 at some T, then move to y=5 at T+1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nThe critical part is around T=76-78.\n\nList possible y at each T.\n\nT=74: y=0\n\nT=75: y=0 or 1\n\nNow, if I go to y=1 at T=75, then T=76 I can be y=0,1,2\n\nIf I stay at y=0 at T=75, T=76 I can be y=0 or 1.\n\nBut at T=76, y=5 and 6 are unsafe, but since I am low, it's ok.\n\nT=77: from T=76.\n\nSuppose I want to be above y=6 by T=76.\n\nAt T=76, if I am y=7 or higher, but I start from y=0 at T=74.\n\nT=74: y=0\n\nAfter one move, T=75: max y=1\n\nAfter two moves, T=76: max y=2\n\nAt T=76, I can be at most y=2, so y=5 and 6 are unreachable, so no problem at T=76 for me since I am below.\n\nSimilarly, at T=77: if I moved up fast.\n\nFrom T=74 to T=77: 3 moves, can reach y=3 if all U.\n\nT=74: y=0\n\nT=75: y=1 (U)\n\nT=76: y=2 (U)\n\nT=77: from y=2, can go to y=1,2,3\n\nAt T=77, y=5 and 6 are unsafe, but I am at y=2 or 3, so not on them, safe.\n\nNow T=78: from previous, if at T=77 y=3, then T=78 can be y=2,3,4\n\nBut at T=78, y=7 is unsafe, but I am at y=4 max, so not on y=7.\n\nT=79: from y=4, can go to y=3,4,5\n\nNow y=5 is safe at T=79, since unsafe only at 76,77.\n\nSimilarly, I can proceed up.\n\nBut let's see when I reach y=9.\n\nIf I go all up:\n\nT=74: y=0\n\na=U, T=75: y=1\n\na=U, T=76: y=2\n\na=U, T=77: y=3\n\na=U, T=78: y=4\n\na=U, T=79: y=5\n\na=U, T=80: y=6\n\na=U, T=81: y=7\n\na=U, T=82: y=8\n\na=U, T=83: y=9\n\nNow, at T=81, y=7, but y=7 is unsafe only at T=78, which is earlier, so at T=81 it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at T=79, unsafe at 76,77, safe now.\n\ny=6 at T=80, safe.\n\nBut is there any collision? In this path, I never on y=5,6 at T=76,77, and not on y=7 at T=78, so should be fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the unsafe times.\n\ny=5 unsafe at T=76,77; I am on y=5 at T=79, which is after, safe.\n\ny=6 at T=80, after unsafe period.\n\ny=7 unsafe at T=78; I am on y=7 at T=81, which is after, safe.\n\ny=8 always safe.\n\nAnd I reach y=9 at T=83.\n\nBut is this minimal? 9 moves from y=0 to y=9, but I start at T=74 y=0, after H actions, at turn T=74 + H -1? Let's see the turn indexing.\n\nThe sequence: actions from t= t1 to t1 + H -1, so at turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + t} at turn t1+t, position at turn t1+t+1? Let's clarify.\n\nPlayer position: at turn t, position is (0, y_t)\n\nAction a_t is taken at turn t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, based on a_t.\n\nGiven: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy depends on a_t at time t.\n\nSo at turn t, after action, position at turn t+1.\n\nStart: turn t1=74, position y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{74} at turn 74, position at turn 75: y_75 = y_74 + Δy_{74}\n\nSimilarly, after a_{75} at turn 75, y_76 = y_75 + Δy_{75}, and so on.\n\nWe need position at turn T to be on y_T for collision, and we need to reach y=9 at some turn, say at turn T_final, with y_{T_final} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=74 to t=74 + H -1, so H actions, leading to position at turn 74 + H =9.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{74 + H} =9.\n\nTurns: after 0 actions, at turn 74, y=0\n\nAfter 1 action (at turn 74), at turn 75, y= y_75\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 74 + k.\n\nWe need at turn 74 + H, y=9.\n\nSo after H actions.\n\nIn the sequence, actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, meaning a_{74}, a_{75}, ..., a_{74 + H -1}\n\nThen y_{74 + H} =9.\n\nCollision at turn T if when position y_T, and for freeway y_T, 0 in car span at T.\n\nIn the path above, with all U:\n\nAction at t=74: U, then at t=75: y=1\n\nAction at t=75: U, then at t=76: y=2\n\nAction at t=76: U, then at t=77: y=3\n\nAction at t=77: U, then at t=78: y=4\n\nAction at t=78: U, then at t=79: y=5\n\nAction at t=79: U, then at t=80: y=6\n\nAction at t=80: U, then at t=81: y=7\n\nAction at t=81: U, then at t=82: y=8\n\nAction at t=82: U, then at t=83: y=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt each turn T, position y_T.\n\nT=75: y=1, freeway 1, which is safe for T>74, as we said.\n\nT=76: y=2, freeway 2, safe for T>74.\n\nT=77: y=3, freeway 3, safe for T>74.\n\nT=78: y=4, freeway 4, safe for T>74.\n\nT=79: y=5, freeway 5, unsafe at T=76,77, but T=79>77, so safe? T=79 is later, not 76 or 77.\n\nSimilarly, T=80: y=6, freeway 6, unsafe at 76,77, T=80 safe.\n\nT=81: y=7, freeway 7, unsafe only at T=78, T=81>78, safe.\n\nT=82: y=8, freeway 8, always safe.\n\nT=83: y=9, not a freeway, safe.\n\nSo no collision, and H=9 actions, reaching at turn 83.\n\nBut is it possible in fewer than 9? From y=0 to y=9, minimum 9 moves up, since each U increases by 1, and no diagonal, so yes, 9 is minimum possible, since we start at 0, end at 9, must have 9 up moves, and possibly some down or stay, but down or stay would increase H, so to minimize H, we should not have down or stay, only up, if possible.\n\nIn this case, it seems possible with all up, no problem.\n\nBut earlier I thought about unsafe times, but in this path, I am never on the unsafe rows at unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at T=76, I am on y=2, not y=5 or 6.\n\nAt T=77, y=3, not 5 or 6.\n\nAt T=78, y=4, not y=7.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 5 at T=79.\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe at T=76 and 77.\n\nAt T=79, ΔT=79-74=5.\n\nFor the third car: span at T: [-23 +6*5, -12 +6*5] = [-23+30, -12+30] = [7,18], min=7>0, so 0 not covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=80, y=6, freeway 6 same, ΔT=6, span [ -23+36, -12+36] = [13,24], min=13>0, safe.\n\ny=7 at T=81, ΔT=7, freeway 7 car: span [ -59 +12*7, -48 +12*7] = [-59+84, -48+84] = [25,36], min=25>0, safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut the player position at T=79 is y=5, and freeway 5, no car covers 0, so ok.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut in freeway 5, there are multiple cars, but only one could cover, but in this case not.\n\nSo H=9 should work.\n\nBut the problem is to output the action sequence.\n\nBut let me see if I can do faster? No, because from 0 to 9, must have 9 up moves, each action changes y by at most 1, so minimum 9 actions.\n\nWith down or stay, it would take more turns to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, if I stay or go down, I need more moves to compensate, so H increases.\n\nThus, minimal H is 9.\n\nAnd with all U, it works as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions start from t=74.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nThen at turn 83, y=9.\n\nH=9 actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be listed as actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSo turn 74 to 82.\n\nBut let me write.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nAnother thing: when moving, at turn T, when I take action to move to new y, at that turn T, I am still on current y.\n\nIn collision, at turn T, position y_T, and I am on freeway y_T.\n\nWhen I take action at T to go to y_{T+1}, at turn T I am on y_T.\n\nIn the path, at each turn, I am on the row.\n\nIn the sequence above, all seems fine.\n\nPerhaps I can start later, but that would increase H, not decrease.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 for some turns, then I need more actions to reach y=9.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down, worse.\n\nSo all up is best.\n\nBut let me see the cars again.\n\nFreeway 5 has cars, but at T=79, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier if I skip some rows, but no, I have to go through each integer y, since moves are vertical only.\n\ny must change by 0, +1, -1, so I have to visit each y between min and max, but not necessarily, I could go from y=3 to y=5 directly? No, because Δy only ±1 or 0, so y changes by at most 1 per turn, so to go from 0 to 9, I must pass through each integer y from 0 to 9, in some order, but since I start at 0 and end at 9, and move step by step, the path must include all y from 0 to 9, but not necessarily in order if I go down, but to minimize time, no down or stay.\n\nIn terms of position, I must be at each y between min and max at some point, but since I start low and end high, with only up moves, I go through each y sequentially.\n\nWith down moves, I might skip some or revisit, but that takes more time.\n\nSo minimal path is direct up in 9 moves.\n\nAnd in this case, it works.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 5 and 6, they are unsafe at T=76,77, but I am not there.\n\nSimilarly y=7 at T=78, not there.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nBut let me check if at some point I might be forced to be unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, but always safe.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 78, I am at y=4, which is safe.\n\nThen go to y=5 at T=79.\n\nNow, but y=5 and y=6 are both unsafe at T=76,77, but I am at T=79,80.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut is there a car on y=5 at other times? No, only those times.\n\nIn freeway 5, only unsafe at T=76,77.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nBut let me see the initial car positions.\n\nFor example, freeway 1 at T=75: if I were on y=1 at T=75, is it safe?\n\nAt T=75, ΔT=1, span [ -23+24, 0+24] = [1,24], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, with all U actions.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut in the output, it should be for turns starting from t1.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nThen at turn 83, position y=9.\n\nBut H=9, and the last action is at turn 82.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t=74 to 74+8=82.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but let me confirm the collision when moving.\n\nFor example, at turn 78, I am at y=4, take action U, so at turn 78, I am on y=4, which is freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4: at T=78, ΔT=4, but freeway 4 has car at t1, (24,-11,right,36)\n\nSpan at T: [ -11 + 36*4, 24 + 36*4] = [ -11+144, 24+144] = [133,168], min=133>0, so 0 not covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at other points.\n\nAt turn 79, y=5, freeway 5, as above, span of cars: first car [49+30,60+30]=[79,90] min=79>0, second [13+30,24+30]=[43,54]>0, third [-23+30, -12+30]? ΔT=79-74=5, [ -23+30, -12+30]=[7,18]>0, all min>0, safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", and H=9.\n\nBut is it possible in less? I don't think so.\n\nUnless I can move faster, but no, each action only changes y by 1.\n\nSo H=9 is minimal.\n\nAnd sequence is U for each turn from 74 to 82.\n\nBut let me write the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5 and 6, it has multiple cars, but we considered.\n\nPerhaps I should output.\n\nBut the answer format.\n\nSo \\boxed{ Turn 74: U \\\\ Turn 75: U \\\\ Turn 76: U \\\\ Turn 77: U \\\\ Turn 78: U \\\\ Turn 79: U \\\\ Turn 80: U \\\\ Turn 81: U \\\\ Turn 82: U }\n\nBut I think that's it.\n\nBut the player is at (0,0) at turn 74, and after action, at turn 75 y=1, etc.\n\nAnd no collision.\n\nPerhaps I can be faster by starting from different action, but no.\n\nAnother thing: at the beginning, if I stay at y=0, then I can be at y=0 at T=75, but then I need to go up later, so it would take at least 10 turns to reach y=9, since I wasted a move.\n\nFor example, if S at 74, then y=0 at 75, then U at 75, y=1 at 76, etc., reach y=9 at turn 84, with 10 actions.\n\nWorse.\n\nSimilarly, any down move would require extra up moves.\n\nSo indeed, all up is best.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 9 with the sequence above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) is 9, with the sequence of actions consisting entirely of \"U\" (up) moves. This sequence avoids all collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) because the player is not on any unsafe freeway at the unsafe times.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Justification:\n- **Unsafe Times for Freeways**:\n  - Freeways \\(y = 5\\) and \\(y = 6\\) are unsafe at turns \\(T = 76\\) and \\(T = 77\\) due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\).\n  - Freeway \\(y = 7\\) is unsafe at turn \\(T = 78\\) due to a car covering \\(x = 0\\).\n  - All other freeways (\\(y = 1, 2, 3, 4, 8\\)) are safe for all turns after \\(T = 74\\), as they are only unsafe at \\(T = 74\\) (which is the starting turn, and the player is not on these freeways at that time).\n\n- **Player Path**:\n  - At turn 75, \\(y = 1\\): Freeway 1 is safe for \\(T > 74\\).\n  - At turn 76, \\(y = 2\\): Freeway 2 is safe for \\(T > 74\\), and \\(y = 2\\) is not unsafe at \\(T = 76\\).\n  - At turn 77, \\(y = 3\\): Freeway 3 is safe for \\(T > 74\\), and \\(y = 3\\) is not unsafe at \\(T = 77\\).\n  - At turn 78, \\(y = 4\\): Freeway 4 is safe for \\(T > 74\\), and \\(y = 4\\) is not unsafe at \\(T = 78\\).\n  - At turn 79, \\(y = 5\\): Freeway 5 is unsafe only at \\(T = 76\\) and \\(T = 77\\), so \\(T = 79\\) is safe.\n  - At turn 80, \\(y = 6\\): Freeway 6 is unsafe only at \\(T = 76\\) and \\(T = 77\\), so \\(T = 80\\) is safe.\n  - At turn 81, \\(y = 7\\): Freeway 7 is unsafe only at \\(T = 78\\), so \\(T = 81\\) is safe.\n  - At turn 82, \\(y = 8\\): Freeway 8 is always safe.\n  - At turn 83, \\(y = 9\\): Not a freeway, so no cars and safe.\n\nThe sequence of 9 \"U\" actions moves the player from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 9\\) in the minimum possible turns, as each \"U\" action increases \\(y\\) by exactly 1, and no fewer actions can achieve a net increase of 9. Any deviation (e.g., \"S\" or \"D\") would increase \\(H\\), so this sequence is optimal.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe actions are applied at turns \\(t_1 + t\\) for \\(t = 0\\) to \\(H-1\\), where \\(t_1 = 74\\) and \\(H = 9\\), resulting in the player reaching \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 83.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 74: U \\\\\nTurn 75: U \\\\\nTurn 76: U \\\\\nTurn 77: U \\\\\nTurn 78: U \\\\\nTurn 79: U \\\\\nTurn 80: U \\\\\nTurn 81: U \\\\\nTurn 82: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,0) at turn t1=80 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn T. The note says that when you move to a new y, you're not considered on that new y until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and you arrive at y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nThe car spans move based on their direction and speed. Left-moving cars decrease their positions, right-moving increase. But looking at the car states, all cars here seem to be right-moving, since direction is \"right\" for all. Let me confirm:\n\n- Freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24) — head at -48, tail at -71? That seems odd because usually head is the front, but for right-moving, if head is at -48 and tail at -71, that means the car is from -71 to -48, so as it moves right, head increases.\n\nIn the span definition: for right-moving, span is [tail, head] with tail < head, I think. Let me read carefully.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSo for right-moving, at t1, span is [τ, h], with τ being the left end, h the right end, so τ < h.\n\nIn the table, for example, freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24). But -48 > -71, so if it's (head, tail) or what? It says \"head h, tail τ\", but for right-moving, span is [τ, h], so τ should be less than h.\n\nHere, for freeway 1: head h = -48, tail τ = -71. Since -48 > -71, so τ = -71, h = -48, so span [τ, h] = [-71, -48]. Then as it moves right, positions increase.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, all cars are right-moving, so their positions increase over time.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if player is on freeway y at turn T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is within its span at time T.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at turn 80. y=0 is not a freeway, I think freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0, no cars, so safe. Similarly, y=9 is the goal, no cars.\n\nSo we need to move up through y=1 to y=8 to reach y=9.\n\nEach action changes y at the next turn. Let's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, player position is y_t. Action a_t is taken, which determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, position is y_{t+1}, and we check for collision on freeway y_{t+1} if y_{t+1} is between 1 and 8.\n\nThe collision condition is: at turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, and 0 is in the span of some car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nWhen we move, at turn T, we are on y_T, and we choose action a_T, which affects y_{T+1}, but at turn T, we are still on y_T.\n\nFor example, at turn 80, player is at (0,0). If I take action U, then at turn 81, y=1. At turn 80, I'm on y=0, no car, safe. At turn 81, I'm on y=1, and I need to check if at turn 81, for freeway 1, 0 is in any car's span.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay at turn 80, y remains 0, still safe, but I need to move up eventually.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9, so I need to get to a point where at some turn, y_t=9.\n\nSince we start at y=0 and need to go to y=9, minimum turns would be 9 actions of U, but we might need to wait or avoid cars.\n\nBut with cars, we might need to time the movements to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at position 0.\n\nNow, the cars are moving right, so their spans are shifting to the right over time.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find times when position 0 is not covered by any car on that freeway.\n\nThen, when moving to a freeway, I need to be there only when it's safe.\n\nAlso, since we move step by step, we need to consider the sequence.\n\nFirst, let's define the time relative to t1=80. Set t=0 as the current turn, so turn index τ = t - 80.\n\nAt τ=0, turn 80, position y=0.\n\nWe take actions a_τ for τ=0 to H-1, and at τ=H-1, y should be 9? Let's see.\n\nAfter H actions, we have H steps, so from τ=0 to τ=H, position y_τ.\n\nAt time τ, position y_τ.\n\nAfter action at τ, y_{τ+1} is set.\n\nWe start at τ=0, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_0, at τ=1, y=y_1, and so on, up to after action a_{H-1}, at τ=H, y_H.\n\nWe want y_H =9 for some H.\n\nSince we start at y=0, and each U increases y by 1, to reach y=9, we need at least 9 Up actions. With S or D, it takes more turns, so minimal H would be at least 9, but we might need to wait, so H could be more.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so we should use as few S or D as possible, ideally all U, but avoid collisions.\n\nNow, for each freeway, we need to find the times when it is safe to be on that freeway, meaning that at that turn, no car has 0 in its span.\n\nSince the player must pass through each y from 1 to 8 at some point, but not necessarily in order; we can go up and down, but that might take more turns, so for minimal H, it's best to go directly up, only U actions, and wait when necessary by staying or moving down, but moving down would increase H, so staying is better to wait without changing position.\n\nBut staying keeps y the same, so if we are on a freeway, we need to ensure it's safe to stay multiple turns if we wait.\n\nBut since cars move, the safe times change.\n\nFirst, for each freeway, let's compute the times when position 0 is occupied by a car.\n\nFor a given freeway k, at time τ (relative to t1=80, so absolute turn t = 80 + τ).\n\nAt time τ, for a car on freeway k, the span is as given, but with s and direction.\n\nAll cars are right-moving, so for a car with initial head h, tail τ (but in the table, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), so let's use the notation.\n\nFor a car, at t1=80, it has span [τ, h] for right-moving, with τ the left end, h the right end.\n\nThen at time T = 80 + τ, the span is [τ + s * τ, h + s * τ] because T - t1 = τ.\n\nSet Δt = T - t1 = τ, time offset.\n\nSo for a car, at time offset τ, span is:\n\nFor right-moving: [τ_left + s * τ, h_right + s * τ]\n\nWhere τ_left and h_right are at τ=0.\n\nIn the table, for each car, it's given (head, tail, dir, speed). But dir is right, so span at τ=0 is [tail, head], since tail is left, head is right.\n\nConfirm with the update: right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt], and at Δt=0, it's [τ, h], so τ is the tail (left), h is the head (right).\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: head = -48, tail = -71, so tail = -71, head = -48, so left end τ = -71, right end h = -48.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nPosition 0 is in the span at time τ if:\n\nτ_left + s * τ ≤ 0 ≤ h_right + s * τ\n\nThat is, 0 is between the left and right ends inclusive.\n\nSo for each car, we can find the τ where this inequality holds.\n\nThe car blocks position 0 when min_left + s τ ≤ 0 ≤ max_right + s τ, but for each car separately, since multiple cars on same freeway, but we need that for some car, 0 is in span, then unsafe.\n\nFor a freeway to be safe at time τ, we need that for all cars on that freeway, 0 is not in their span at that τ.\n\nThat is, for every car, either 0 < left + s τ or 0 > right + s τ.\n\nSince left + s τ ≤ right + s τ always.\n\nNow, for each freeway, let's list the cars and find the intervals where it is unsafe.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: only one car: tail τ = -71, head h = -48, speed s=24, right-moving.\n\nSpan at τ: [ -71 + 24τ, -48 + 24τ ]\n\n0 in span if -71 + 24τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 24τ\n\nSo -71 + 24τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 24τ\n\nFirst inequality: -71 + 24τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 24τ ≤ 71 ⇒ τ ≤ 71/24 ≈ 2.958\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -48 + 24τ ⇒ 48 ≤ 24τ ⇒ τ ≥ 48/24 = 2\n\nSo τ between 2 and 2.958, approximately.\n\nSince τ is integer (turns), τ from 2 to 2 inclusive? τ min 2, τ max floor(71/24)? 71/24=2.958, so τ ≤ 2 since 24*2=48<71? Let's calculate exactly.\n\n-71 + 24τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 24τ ≤ 71 ⇒ τ ≤ 71/24 = 2.958..., so τ ≤ 2 since τ integer? τ ≤ floor(2.958) =2? But at τ=2, -71 + 24*2 = -71 + 48 = -23 ≤ 0, true.\n\n0 ≤ -48 + 24τ ⇒ at τ=2, -48 + 48=0, so 0≤0 true.\n\nAt τ=3, -48 + 24*3= -48+72=24>0, so 0 ≤ 24 true, but first inequality: -71 + 72=1 >0, so -71+24τ >0, so 0 not ≤ left, so not in span.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=1, -71+24= -47 ≤0, and 0 ≤ -48+24= -24? 0 ≤ -24 false, so not.\n\nSo only at τ=2, 0 is in span? τ=2: left = -71+48= -23, right= -48+48=0, so span [-23,0], so 0 is included.\n\nAt τ=3, left= -71+72=1, right= -48+72=24, span [1,24], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe only at τ=2 (absolute turn 82).\n\nτ is time offset from t1=80, so at τ=2, turn 82.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car: head=-48? tail=-83, head=-48? Table says: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nhead h=-48, tail τ=-83? So tail τ=-83, head h=-48, speed s=36.\n\nSpan at τ: [ -83 + 36τ, -48 + 36τ ]\n\n0 in span if -83 + 36τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 36τ\n\nFirst: -83 + 36τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 36τ ≤ 83 ⇒ τ ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.3055\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 + 36τ ⇒ 48 ≤ 36τ ⇒ τ ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333\n\nSo τ from ceil(1.333) to floor(2.3055), τ=2 since τ integer.\n\nAt τ=1: -83+36= -47 ≤0, 0 ≤ -48+36= -12? 0≤-12 false.\n\nAt τ=2: -83+72= -11 ≤0, 0≤ -48+72=24 true, so yes.\n\nAt τ=3: -83+108=25>0, not ≤0, so no.\n\nSo unsafe only at τ=2 (turn 82).\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Table: (-48, -83, right, 36) same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 3: (-48, -83, right, 36) identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nSo freeways 2,3,4 all have same car? Or separate? But since different freeways, we consider each separately.\n\nFor freeway 2, unsafe at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly for 3 and 4.\n\nBut freeway 1 also unsafe at τ=2.\n\nNow freeway 5: multiple cars. Cars: (48, 37, right, 6), (12, 1, right, 6), (-24, -35, right, 6)\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37? Tail τ=37, head h=48, speed s=6.\n\nSpan at τ: [37 + 6τ, 48 + 6τ]\n\n0 in span? 37 + 6τ ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 6τ? But 37 + 6τ ≥ 37 >0 for τ≥0, so left >0, 0 cannot be ≤ left since left>0, so 0 not in span. Similarly for all τ, since min left is 37>0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12, 1, right, 6) head=12, tail=1, so tail τ=1, head=12, speed=6.\n\nSpan [1 + 6τ, 12 + 6τ], all positive for τ≥0, so 0 not in span.\n\nThird car: (-24, -35, right, 6) head=-24, tail=-35? Tail τ=-35, head h=-24, speed=6.\n\nSpan at τ: [ -35 + 6τ, -24 + 6τ ]\n\n0 in span if -35 + 6τ ≤ 0 ≤ -24 + 6τ\n\nFirst: -35 + 6τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 6τ ≤ 35 ⇒ τ ≤ 35/6 ≈ 5.833\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -24 + 6τ ⇒ 24 ≤ 6τ ⇒ τ ≥ 4\n\nSo τ from 4 to 5 inclusive.\n\nAt τ=4: left= -35+24= -11 ≤0, right= -24+24=0, so 0≤0 true.\n\nAt τ=5: left= -35+30= -5 ≤0, right= -24+30=6, 0≤6 true.\n\nAt τ=6: left= -35+36=1>0, not ≤0.\n\nSo unsafe at τ=4 and τ=5.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5? Table: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6) identical to freeway 5.\n\nSo unsafe at τ=4 and 5.\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (48,37,right,12) head=48, tail=37? Tail τ=37, head=48, speed=12.\n\nSpan [37 + 12τ, 48 + 12τ], all >0, so 0 never in span. Safe at all times.\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (48,37,right,4) head=48, tail=37, speed=4.\n\nSpan [37 + 4τ, 48 + 4τ], all >0, safe at all times.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway, unsafe times:\n\n- y=1: unsafe at τ=2\n\n- y=2: unsafe at τ=2\n\n- y=3: unsafe at τ=2 (since same car)\n\n- y=4: unsafe at τ=2\n\n- y=5: unsafe at τ=4 and 5\n\n- y=6: unsafe at τ=4 and 5\n\n- y=7: always safe\n\n- y=8: always safe\n\ny=7 and y=8 have no cars that cover 0, so always safe.\n\nNow, the player needs to go from y=0 to y=9, passing through each y=1 to 8 at some turn.\n\nBut since we can stay or move vertically, we need to be on each freeway only when it's safe.\n\nFor minimal turns, we should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a freeway at unsafe times.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=0.\n\nAt τ=0, we can take action.\n\nIf we take U, at τ=1, y=1.\n\nBut at τ=1, is y=1 safe? From above, y=1 is unsafe only at τ=2, so at τ=1, it should be safe.\n\nFor y=1, unsafe at τ=2 only.\n\nAt τ=1, for freeway 1: at τ=1, span [-71+24, -48+24] = [-47, -24], all negative, so 0 not in span, safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nSo at τ=1, if we are on y=1, it is safe.\n\nThen we can go to y=2 at τ=2, but at τ=2, y=2 is unsafe? If we are on y=2 at τ=2.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nWe need to define the position at each τ.\n\nAt τ=0: y=0, no action yet? At τ=0, we take action a_0, which determines y_1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=y_1, and we check for collision if y_1 between 1-8.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=2, y=y_2, and so on.\n\nTo reach y=9, since we start from y=0, after k Ups, we are at y=k.\n\nBut with possible S or D.\n\nMinimal H: if all U, we reach y=9 at τ=9.\n\nBut need to check if at each step when on freeway, it is safe.\n\nFor example:\n\nSuppose we go all U:\n\nAt τ=0: take a_0 = U, then at τ=1, y=1.\n\nCheck y=1 at τ=1: as above, safe.\n\nAt τ=1, take a_1 = U, then at τ=2, y=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=2, which is freeway 2, and at τ=2, y=2 is unsafe, as per above.\n\ny=2 unsafe at τ=2, so collision.\n\nCannot be on y=2 at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=1 at τ=1, then at τ=2, if we go to y=2, we are on y=2 at τ=2, collision.\n\nAt τ=1, we could stay or move down, but moving down is bad, staying might be ok.\n\nAt τ=1, if we take S, then at τ=2, y=1 still.\n\nAt τ=2, y=1: freeway 1, and at τ=2, it is unsafe, as per earlier, collision.\n\nIf we take D at τ=1, then at τ=2, y=0, but y=0 safe, but we are going down, which is away from goal.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo for y=1, at τ=1 it is safe, but at τ=2 it is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways at τ=2.\n\nNow, at τ=0, we could delay moving up.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, take S, then at τ=1, y=0, safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, take U, to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nBut at τ=2, y=1 is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf we take S at τ=0 and τ=1, then at τ=2, y=0, take U to y=1 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=1: freeway 1, at τ=3, span [-71+72, -48+72] = [1,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 at τ=3: freeway 2, at τ=3, span [-83+108, -48+108]? For y=2 car: tail -83, head -48, s=36, at τ=3: [-83+108, -48+108] = [25,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly all lower freeways safe at τ=3 except possibly others.\n\ny=5 and 6 unsafe at τ=4,5, but not at τ=3.\n\nSo we can start moving later.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so we should go as fast as possible but avoid unsafe times.\n\nThe unsafe times are at τ=2 for y=1,2,3,4 and τ=4,5 for y=5,6.\n\ny=7 and 8 always safe.\n\nWe need to be on y=1 at some τ not 2, on y=2 at τ not 2, etc.\n\nSince we move sequentially, we need to assign a time for each y from 1 to 8 when we are on it.\n\nAt the time we are on a freeway, it must be safe for that y.\n\nFor y=1, we must be on it at τ ≠ 2, so τ=1,3,4,... but since we start from below, probably early or late.\n\nSimilarly for y=2,3,4, must avoid τ=2.\n\nFor y=5 and 6, avoid τ=4 and 5.\n\ny=7 and 8 no restriction.\n\nTo minimize time, we should go up quickly except when we hit unsafe times.\n\nOne way is to go directly up but skip the unsafe times by waiting.\n\nSince y=1 to 4 all unsafe at τ=2, if we can be not on any of them at τ=2, but we might be between or something.\n\nFor example, if we are at y=0 at τ=2, or y=5, but y=5 is unsafe at τ=4,5 not at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, if we are at y=0 or y=5 or above, but y=5 at τ=2 might be safe? y=5 unsafe only at τ=4,5.\n\nLet's list possible paths.\n\nFirst, the earliest we can be at y=1 is τ=1.\n\nBut if at y=1 at τ=1, then we need to go to y=2, but at τ=2, y=2 is unsafe, so we cannot go to y=2 at τ=2.\n\nSo at τ=1, if we are at y=1, we should not stay or go up to τ=2 because both lead to collision: if stay, at τ=2 y=1 unsafe; if go up, at τ=2 y=2 unsafe.\n\nSo at τ=1, if at y=1, we must go down to y=0 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=0, safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, we can go up to y=1 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=1 safe, as we saw.\n\nThen we can continue up.\n\nBut we lost time by going down and up.\n\nSimilarly, for higher freeways.\n\nWe can delay the start.\n\nFor example, start by staying at y=0 for some turns.\n\nAt τ=0, take S, so at τ=1, y=0.\n\nThen at τ=1, take U, to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nBut at τ=2, y=1 unsafe, collision. Not good.\n\nAt τ=0, take S, at τ=1, y=0.\n\nAt τ=1, take S, at τ=2, y=0.\n\nThen at τ=2, take U, to y=1 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=1 safe.\n\nThen we can go up.\n\nNow, from y=1 at τ=3, we can go to y=2 at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=4, if y=2, is it safe? y=2 unsafe only at τ=2, so at τ=4, should be safe.\n\nFor y=2 at τ=4: car span [-83 + 36*4, -48 + 36*4] = [-83+144, -48+144] = [61,96], all positive, safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can go to y=3 at τ=5.\n\ny=3 at τ=5: similar, safe.\n\ny=4 at τ=6.\n\nBut we have to worry about y=5 and 6 unsafe at τ=4 and 5.\n\nCurrently, at τ=3, y=1\n\nTake U to y=2 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=2, safe as above.\n\nThen take U to y=3 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5, y=3, should be safe? y=3 unsafe only at τ=2, so at τ=5, safe.\n\nThen take U to y=4 at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=6, y=4, safe.\n\nNow take U to y=5 at τ=7.\n\nBut y=5 unsafe at τ=4 and 5, not at τ=7, so should be safe.\n\nAt τ=7, y=5: freeway 5, cars: the one that matters is the third car, at τ=7, span [-35 + 6*7, -24 + 6*7] = [-35+42, -24+42] = [7,18], 0 not in, safe. Other cars not cover 0.\n\nSimilarly, then to y=6 at τ=8.\n\ny=6 at τ=8: similar, span for the car [-35+48, -24+48]=[13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen to y=7 at τ=9.\n\ny=7 always safe.\n\nTo y=8 at τ=10.\n\ny=8 always safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at τ=11.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9, so at τ=11, y=9.\n\nH is the number of actions? Let's see the turns.\n\nWe took actions from τ=0 to τ=10? Sequence:\n\nAt τ=0: we took S? In this scenario, we stayed at τ=0 and τ=1.\n\nStart:\n\nτ=0: action? We need to specify.\n\nIn the path above: to avoid τ=2, we stayed at y=0 for τ=0 and τ=1.\n\nThen:\n\nτ=0: take S, so at τ=1, y=0\n\nτ=1: take S, at τ=2, y=0\n\nτ=2: take U, at τ=3, y=1\n\nτ=3: take U, at τ=4, y=2\n\nτ=4: take U, at τ=5, y=3\n\nτ=5: take U, at τ=6, y=4\n\nτ=6: take U, at τ=7, y=5\n\nτ=7: take U, at τ=8, y=6\n\nτ=8: take U, at τ=9, y=7\n\nτ=9: take U, at τ=10, y=8\n\nτ=10: take U, at τ=11, y=9\n\nSo at τ=11, y=9, so we reached after 11 actions? τ from 0 to 10, 11 actions, but H is the number of turns from start to end? Let's clarify.\n\nAt τ=0 (turn 80), position y=0.\n\nAfter first action a_0, at τ=1, y_1.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{k}, at τ=k+1, y_{k+1}.\n\nWe want y_H =9 for some H.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at time τ=H with y_H.\n\nTo have y_H=9, since start from y=0, we need exactly 9 Up actions, and possibly some S or D, but D would require more U, so minimal actions are 9 Ups, but with waits.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have 2 S and 9 U, total 11 actions, to reach y=9 at τ=11.\n\nBut we can reduce the waiting.\n\nFor example, instead of staying twice at start, we could go up earlier but avoid the collision point.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=1 at τ=1, which is safe, but then at τ=1, instead of going up or staying, go down to avoid τ=2 on y=1.\n\nAt τ=0: take U, to y=1 at τ=1 (safe)\n\nAt τ=1: take D, to y=0 at τ=2 (safe, y=0)\n\nAt τ=2: take U, to y=1 at τ=3 (safe, as before)\n\nThen continue as before: U to y=2 at τ=4, etc.\n\nBut from τ=3 y=1 to τ=4 y=2, then to y=3 at τ=5, y=4 at τ=6, y=5 at τ=7, y=6 at τ=8, y=7 at τ=9, y=8 at τ=10, y=9 at τ=11.\n\nSame as before, 11 actions: one U, one D, then U from τ=2 to τ=10, but actions: a_0=U, a_1=D, a_2=U, a_3=U, ..., up to a_10=U? Let's count:\n\nActions:\n\nτ=0: U → y1=1\n\nτ=1: D → y2=0\n\nτ=2: U → y3=1\n\nτ=3: U → y4=2\n\nτ=4: U → y5=3\n\nτ=5: U → y6=4\n\nτ=6: U → y7=5\n\nτ=7: U → y8=6\n\nτ=8: U → y9=7\n\nτ=9: U → y10=8\n\nτ=10: U → y11=9\n\nSo y11=9 at τ=11, after 11 actions.\n\nBut in the first plan, with two S at start, we had a_0=S, a_1=S, a_2=U, ..., a_10=U, also 11 actions to y11=9.\n\nNow, can we reach faster?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=5 or above by τ=4, but y=5 and 6 unsafe at τ=4 and 5.\n\nAt τ=4, if we are on y=5 or y=6, unsafe.\n\nBut if we are at y=4 or below, or y=7 above.\n\ny=7 always safe.\n\nBut to reach y=7, we need to pass through lower freeways.\n\nThe minimal time to reach y=k is τ=k, with all U.\n\nBut at τ=2, all y=1,2,3,4 are unsafe, so we cannot be on any of them at τ=2.\n\nTherefore, at τ=2, we must be at y=0 or y=5 or above.\n\ny=5 at τ=2: is it safe? y=5 unsafe only at τ=4,5, so at τ=2, should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at τ=2 safe.\n\nBut to be at y=5 at τ=2, we need to have gone up 5 times by τ=2, which requires starting at τ=0 with U to y=1 at τ=1, then U to y=2 at τ=2, but at τ=2 y=2 unsafe, collision, impossible to be at y=5 at τ=2 with only two actions.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be above y=4 at τ=2 with all U, since y_τ ≤ τ.\n\nAt τ=2, y <=2 if we start from 0 with U or S.\n\nMax y at τ=2 is 2, with U,U.\n\nBut y=2 at τ=2 unsafe.\n\nSo at τ=2, we must be at y=0 or y=1, but y=1 unsafe at τ=2, so only possible to be at y=0 at τ=2.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y=0 at τ=2.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nTo be at y=0 at τ=2, we can:\n\n- At τ=0: take S or D, but D not good.\n\nTake S at τ=0, to y=0 at τ=1? At τ=0 action a_0, to y at τ=1.\n\nIf a_0=S, then at τ=1, y=0\n\nThen at τ=1, if we take S, to at τ=2 y=0\n\nOr take U, to at τ=2 y=1, but unsafe.\n\nSo to have y=0 at τ=2, we need at τ=1 take S or D, but D to y=-1 not possible, y min 0, so take S at τ=1 to keep y=0.\n\nThus, from τ=0:\n\nOption: a_0 = S, then at τ=1 y=0\n\nThen a_1 = S, then at τ=2 y=0\n\nNow at τ=2, y=0, we take a_2 = U, to at τ=3 y=1\n\nAs before.\n\nWe could take a_0 = U to y=1 at τ=1 (safe), then a_1 = D to y=0 at τ=2 (safe), then same as above.\n\nEither way, we reach y=1 at τ=3.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom y=1 at τ=3, we can go U each turn to y=2 at τ=4, y=3 at τ=5, y=4 at τ=6, y=5 at τ=7, y=6 at τ=8, y=7 at τ=9, y=8 at τ=10, y=9 at τ=11.\n\nBut at τ=5, y=3, safe, but y=5 and 6 unsafe at τ=4 and 5, but we are on y=3 at τ=5, not on y=5 or 6, so safe.\n\nAt τ=4, we are on y=2, safe.\n\nThe problem is at τ=4 and τ=5, y=5 and 6 are unsafe, but if we are not on them, ok.\n\nIn this path, we are on y=2 at τ=4, y=3 at τ=5, both safe since not y=5 or 6.\n\nThen at τ=6 y=4, τ=7 y=5, but at τ=7 y=5: τ=7 >5, so safe, as earlier.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nCan we go faster? For example, from y=0 at τ=2, go U to y=1 at τ=3, then instead of going step by step, but we have to, since each move changes y by at most 1.\n\nUnless we stay sometimes, but staying would slow down.\n\nAnother point: at τ=4 and τ=5, y=5 and 6 are unsafe, but we can be on other y or skip.\n\nBut in the sequence above, we are not on y=5 or 6 at τ=4 or 5, since at τ=4 we are at y=2, τ=5 at y=3.\n\nThen we go to y=5 at τ=7, which is after τ=5, safe.\n\nBut we could reach y=5 earlier? For example, if we could be at y=5 at τ=3 or something, but impossible because min time to y=5 is τ=5 with all U, but at τ=5, y=5 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=4, y=4 is safe, but y=5 unsafe at τ=4.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=5 at τ=4 or 5.\n\nTherefore, the earliest we can be at y=5 is τ=6, but with waiting.\n\nFor example, to be at y=5 at τ=6: we need to have taken 5 Up actions by τ=6.\n\nBut from start, we are at y=0 at τ=0.\n\nTo be at y=5 at τ=6, we can have, for example, one S or D, but with S, we can be at y=5 at τ=6 if we have 5 U and one S in first 6 actions.\n\nBut we have to avoid the unsafe times for lower y.\n\nIn particular, we must be at y=0 at τ=2, as established.\n\nSo from τ=0 to τ=2: we must end at y=0 at τ=2.\n\nThen from τ=2, we go up.\n\nAt τ=2, y=0, take U to y=1 at τ=3\n\nThen U to y=2 at τ=4\n\nU to y=3 at τ=5\n\nNow at τ=5, y=3, but we want to go to y=5, but at τ=5, if we take U to y=4 at τ=6, then to y=5 at τ=7.\n\nBut at τ=5, we are at y=3, which is safe.\n\nCan we go directly to higher y? No.\n\nAt τ=5, we could stay or something, but not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 and 8 are always safe, we can go faster through them, but we have to pass through y=5 and 6.\n\ny=5 and 6 unsafe at τ=4 and 5, so we must be on y=5 at τ ≠4,5, similarly for y=6.\n\nEarliest at τ=3 or τ=6 or later.\n\nBut to be at y=5 at τ=3: need to go from y=0 to y=5 in 3 actions, impossible since max y at τ=3 is 3.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=4: y<=4, but y=4 safe at τ=4, but we are at y=4 not y=5.\n\nAt τ=5: y<=5, but y=5 unsafe.\n\nSo earliest possible to be on y=5 is τ=6.\n\nSimilarly for y=6.\n\nNow, to be at y=5 at τ=6, we need y=5 at τ=6.\n\nWhich means we took 5 Up actions in the first 6 steps? Let's see the position.\n\nAt τ=6, y_6 = number of U minus number of D in actions from 0 to 5.\n\nSince start y=0.\n\ny_t after t actions.\n\nAt time τ, after τ actions, y_τ.\n\nTo have y_6 =5, we need net +5 in y, so 5 more U than D, and some S.\n\nMinimal actions: 5 U and one S, for example.\n\nBut we have constraints at each step.\n\nSpecifically, we must be at y=0 at τ=2.\n\nNow, let's list the sequence from τ=0.\n\nWe need y_2 =0.\n\nAt τ=0: action a_0, to y_1\n\nτ=1: a_1, to y_2\n\ny_2 must be 0.\n\nThen τ=2: a_2, to y_3\n\n...\n\nUp to y_H=9.\n\ny_2=0.\n\nNow, y_2=0 can be achieved by:\n\n- a_0 = S, y_1=0; a_1 = S, y_2=0\n\n- or a_0 = U, y_1=1; a_1 = D, y_2=0\n\nBoth require two actions to have y_2=0.\n\nThen from there, we go up.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly, we should go up as fast as possible after τ=2.\n\nSo from y_2=0, take U to y_3=1\n\nThen U to y_4=2\n\nU to y_5=3\n\nU to y_6=4\n\nAt y_6=4, but we want to be at y=5 at τ=6? y_6=4.\n\nIf we take U at τ=5, to y_6=4? Let's index.\n\nAt τ=5, action a_5, to y_6.\n\nIf at τ=5, we are at y_5, take a_5, to y_6.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAfter y_2=0 at τ=2.\n\nτ=2: take a_2=U, to y_3=1 at τ=3\n\nτ=3: take a_3=U, to y_4=2 at τ=4\n\nτ=4: take a_4=U, to y_5=3 at τ=5\n\nτ=5: take a_5=U, to y_6=4 at τ=6\n\nNow at τ=6, y=4.\n\nWe need to go to y=5.\n\nTake U at τ=6 to y_7=5 at τ=7\n\nBut we wanted to be at y=5 at τ=6, but it's not possible because from y_5=3 at τ=5, we go to y_6=4 at τ=6, not to 5.\n\nTo have y_6=5, we need y_5=4 or 5 or 6, but at τ=5, we are at y_5=3, so y_5=3, then a_5=U to y_6=4, cannot jump to 5.\n\nSo y_6=4 minimum in this path.\n\nThen y_7=5 at τ=7.\n\nThen continue to y_8=6 at τ=8, y_9=7 at τ=9, y_10=8 at τ=10, y_11=9 at τ=11.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut at τ=7, y_7=5, which is safe since τ=7>5.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nCan we reach y=5 earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be at higher y earlier, but we have to pass through y=1 to 4.\n\nSince y=1 to 4 are only unsafe at τ=2, and we are not on them at τ=2, we can be on them at other times.\n\nIn the sequence above, we are on y=1 at τ=3, y=2 at τ=4, y=3 at τ=5, y=4 at τ=6, all safe except that at τ=5, y=3 is safe, but we are on it, and y=5 is unsafe at τ=5, but we are not on it.\n\nThe issue is that to reach y=5 faster, we need to have more Ups earlier.\n\nBut at τ=2, we are at y=0, so we start from there.\n\nFor example, if we take U at τ=2 to y_3=1, then at τ=3, if we take U to y_4=2, but y_4=2 at τ=4, safe.\n\nThen at τ=4, take U to y_5=3 at τ=5.\n\ny_5=3 at τ=5, safe.\n\nThen at τ=5, take U to y_6=4 at τ=6.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf at τ=3, after y_3=1, we take another U immediately to y_4=2 at τ=4, etc.\n\nNo faster.\n\nAfter τ=2, we have to go through each step.\n\nAnother thought: since y=7 and 8 are always safe, we could go directly to them if possible, but we have to go through y=5 and 6 first.\n\ny=5 must be visited at some safe time, earliest τ=6.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 in 9 turns but with waiting, but impossible because of the unsafe times.\n\nMinimal H: since we must have at least 9 Ups, and we have at least 2 extra actions to waste at start to avoid τ=2, so minimal H=11.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can do with H=10.\n\nSuppose we reach y=9 at τ=10.\n\nThen y_10=9.\n\nSince start y=0, we need net +9, so 9 Ups and possibly some S or D, but D would require more Ups, so minimal is 9 Ups and no D, but with some S if we wait.\n\nBut with 9 Ups and one S, we can reach y=9 at τ=10, for example.\n\ny_10=9 with 9 Ups and one S in 10 actions.\n\nBut we need to satisfy the path.\n\nNow, we must have y_2=0.\n\nIn the first two actions, to have y_2=0, we need either two S, or one U and one D, or other combinations.\n\nIf two S: a_0=S, y_1=0; a_1=S, y_2=0.\n\nThen we have 8 actions left to go from y=0 to y=9, which requires 9 Ups, but we only have 8 actions? From τ=2 to τ=10, we have actions a_2 to a_9, 8 actions, to reach y_10=9.\n\ny_10 depends on actions a_0 to a_9.\n\nAfter 10 actions, at τ=10.\n\ny_10 = number of U minus number of D in a_0 to a_9.\n\nSince start y=0.\n\nTo have y_10=9, we need exactly 9 Ups and one other action, which could be S or D.\n\nIf D, we need 10 Ups to compensate, but with 10 actions, if one D, we need 10 Ups to have y=9, but only 10 actions, so possible with all U except one D, but y=9 requires net +9, so if one D, we need 10 Ups to have net +9, but 10 Ups and one D is 11 actions, contradiction.\n\nWith 10 actions, to have y_10=9, we need exactly 9 Ups and one S, or 10 Ups and one D, but one D and 10 Ups is 11 actions, impossible with 10 actions.\n\nActions: a_0 to a_9, 10 actions.\n\nEach U: +1, D: -1, S: 0.\n\ny_10 = sum of Δy from t=0 to 9.\n\nTo have y_10 =9, since y_0=0, so sum_{k=0}^9 Δy_k =9.\n\nEach Δy is +1, -1, or 0.\n\nSo sum = number of U minus number of D =9.\n\nLet N_U, N_D, N_S, with N_U + N_D + N_S =10.\n\nN_U - N_D =9.\n\nThen from N_U - N_D =9, N_U + N_D + N_S=10.\n\nAdd: 2 N_U + N_S =19, so N_U <=9, but 2*9 + N_S=18 + N_S=19, so N_S=1, N_U=9.\n\nThen from N_U - N_D=9, 9 - N_D=9, so N_D=0.\n\nThus, exactly 9 Ups and one Stay in 10 actions.\n\nNow, with y_2=0.\n\nAt τ=2, y_2 must be 0.\n\ny_2 = sum of Δy_0 and Δy_1.\n\nΔy_0 and Δy_1: each can be +1, -1, 0.\n\ny_2 = Δy_0 + Δy_1.\n\nMust be 0.\n\nPossible: both S: (0,0) sum=0\n\nOr U and D: (1,-1) sum=0\n\nOr S and S: (0,0)\n\nOr D and U: same as U and D.\n\nNot both U or both D, etc.\n\nIn the actions, we have one S and nine U.\n\nNow, y_2=0.\n\nCase 1: the extra S is in the first two actions.\n\nFor example, a_0=S, Δy_0=0, y_1=0\n\na_1=S, Δy_1=0, y_2=0\n\nThen actions a_2 to a_9 must be all U, since we need 9 U in total, and no S left, so a_2 to a_9: 8 U, but we need 9 U, contradiction.\n\na_0 to a_9: 10 actions.\n\nIf a_0 and a_1 are both S, then y_2=0.\n\nThen a_2 to a_9 are 8 actions, all must be U to have 9 U? But we have only 8 actions from a_2 to a_9, but we need 9 U in total, so impossible because a_0 and a_1 are S, so only 8 actions left for U, but need 9 U, contradiction.\n\nSimilarly, if a_0 and a_1 include U and D, for example a_0=U, Δy_0=1, y_1=1\n\na_1=D, Δy_1=-1, y_2=0\n\nThen we have used one U and one D.\n\nNow, we need total 9 U and one S, but we have used one U and one D, so remaining 8 actions must include 8 U and no S? But we need total N_U=9, so remaining 8 actions must have 8 U, and N_S=1, but S must be somewhere, but if we have 8 U in a_2 to a_9, then total N_U=1 +8=9, N_D=1 (from a_1), but we need N_D=0, contradiction.\n\ny_10=9 requires N_U - N_D =9, and N_D=0 as above.\n\nIn this case, if a_0=U, a_1=D, then N_U=1, N_D=1 for first two.\n\nThen remaining a_2 to a_9: 8 actions, must provide N_U=8 and N_S=0 to have total N_U=9, N_D=1, but N_U - N_D =8, not 9, and y_10= y_0 + sum Δy =0 + (N_U - N_D) = 0 + (9 -1) =8 if N_D=1, not 9.\n\nTo have y_10=9 with N_U - N_D=9, and N_D must be 0, so no D at all.\n\nThus, only possibility is one S and nine U, no D.\n\nNow, with y_2=0.\n\ny_2 = Δy_0 + Δy_1 =0.\n\nSince no D, Δy cannot be -1, so both Δy_0 and Δy_1 must be 0, so a_0=S and a_1=S.\n\nThen y_2=0.\n\nNow, actions a_2 to a_9: 8 actions, must all be U to have 9 U? But a_0 and a_1 are S, so we have only 8 actions left, but we need 9 U, so with 8 U, we have only 8 Ups, so y_10 = 0 + 8 =8, not 9.\n\nImpossible to have y_10=9 with only 10 actions when we need to waste two actions at start to have y_2=0.\n\nSpecifically, to have y_2=0 with no D, we must have two S in first two actions, but then only 8 actions left for U, so y_10 <=8.\n\nIf we have one U and one D in first two, but D is not allowed since N_D must be 0.\n\nThus, it is impossible to reach y=9 in 10 turns; we need at least 11 turns.\n\nMinimal H=11.\n\nWith H=11 actions, we can reach y_11=9.\n\nFor example, as before: two S at start, then nine U.\n\nOr U then D then nine U, etc.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, we need to output the actions for turn t1=80 onwards.\n\nNow, for the cars, we also have y=5 and 6 unsafe at τ=4 and 5, but in the path above, we are not on them at those times, so it should be fine.\n\nIn the sequence I had earlier: with two S at start.\n\nActions:\n\nAt turn t1=80 (τ=0): S\n\nThen at τ=1 (turn 81): S\n\nThen τ=2 (turn 82): U → to y=1 at τ=3 (turn 83)\n\nτ=3 (turn 83): U → to y=2 at τ=4 (turn 84)\n\nτ=4 (turn 84): U → to y=3 at τ=5 (turn 85)\n\nτ=5 (turn 85): U → to y=4 at τ=6 (turn 86)\n\nτ=6 (turn 86): U → to y=5 at τ=7 (turn 87)\n\nAt τ=7, y=5: freeway 5, at turn 87, time offset τ=7.\n\nCars on y=5: at τ=7, the critical car span [-35 + 6*7, -24 + 6*7] = [-35+42, -24+42] = [7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, τ=7 (turn 87): U → to y=6 at τ=8 (turn 88)\n\ny=6 at τ=8: car span [-35+48, -24+48]=[13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nτ=8 (turn 88): U → to y=7 at τ=9 (turn 89)\n\ny=7 always safe.\n\nτ=9 (turn 89): U → to y=8 at τ=10 (turn 90)\n\ny=8 always safe.\n\nτ=10 (turn 90): U → to y=9 at τ=11 (turn 91)\n\ny=9, goal.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions from turn 80:\n\nTurn 80: S\n\nTurn 81: S\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nBut this is 11 actions, from turn 80 to 90, and at turn 90 action, to y=9 at turn 91.\n\nBut turn 91 is after 11 actions.\n\nThe problem says: sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and after that, at turn t1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn this case, t1=80, actions from t=0 to H-1, so a_{80} to a_{80+H-1}, and at turn 80+H, position (0,9).\n\nHere, H=11, actions a_{80} to a_{90}, and at turn 91, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 90 action U, to y=9 at turn 91.\n\nWe can start with U then D.\n\nBut both take 11 turns.\n\nIn the first part, at τ=5, we are at y=3, which is freeway 3, at turn 85 (τ=5).\n\ny=3 unsafe only at τ=2, so at τ=5, should be safe.\n\nCar on y=3: at τ=5, span [-83 + 36*5, -48 + 36*5] = [-83+180, -48+180] = [97,132], far positive, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSince y=7 and 8 are always safe, and we have no delay there, it should be minimal.\n\nBut in the action sequence, I have nine U and two S, total 11 actions.\n\nWith U then D: a_{80}=U, a_{81}=D, then a_{82}=U, a_{83}=U, ..., up to a_{90}=U, same 11 actions.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut in the sequence, I need to specify for each turn.\n\nAlso, for freeway 5 and 6, we have multiple cars, but only one could cover 0, but we checked.\n\nNow, output format.\n\nSo minimal H=11.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 80: S\n\nTurn 81: S\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nAfter turn 90 action, at turn 91, position (0,9).\n\nBut the action at turn 90 is the last one, a_{90}.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions from turn 80 to 90, which is 11 turns.\n\nSince we start at turn 80, and take actions up to turn 90, to reach at turn 91.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so t from 0 to H-1, so for H=11, t=0 to 10, actions at t1 + t = 80 to 90.\n\nAnd after H actions, at turn t1 + H = 80 + 11 = 91, position should be (0,9).\n\nYes.\n\nWe can have the other sequence with U and D.\n\nBut S might be better, no movement.\n\nNow, but in the beginning, with U and D: turn 80: U, turn 81: D, turn 82: U, then same U up to turn 90: U.\n\nBut at turn 81, after D, y=0, same as before.\n\nBut with S, we don't move, so perhaps same.\n\nNow, I think this is fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the car states at the times we are on freeways.\n\nFor example, at turn 83 (τ=3), y=1: freeway 1, car span at τ=3: [-71+24*3, -48+24*3] = [-71+72, -48+72] = [1,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt turn 84 (τ=4), y=2: freeway 2, car at τ=4: [-83+36*4, -48+36*4] = [-83+144, -48+144] = [61,96], safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 85 (τ=5), y=3: freeway 3, similar, safe.\n\nTurn 86 (τ=6), y=4: freeway 4, car at τ=6: [-83+36*6, -48+36*6] = [-83+216, -48+216] = [133,168], safe? Freeway 4 has car same as 2 and 3, but different freeway.\n\ny=4 car: (-48,-83,right,36) same, at τ=6: [-83+216, -48+216] = [133,168], 0 not in.\n\nThen turn 87 (τ=7), y=5: freeway 5, cars: we have three, but only the third one could be near, span [-35+42, -24+42]=[7,18], safe.\n\nTurn 88 (τ=8), y=6: similar, span [-35+48,-24+48]=[13,24], safe.\n\nTurn 89 (τ=9), y=7: no car covers 0, safe.\n\nTurn 90 (τ=10), y=8: safe.\n\nThen to y=9.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo minimal H=11.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the action sequence.\n\nSince the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the box, it seems to only show the sequence, but H is implied.\n\nIn the answer format, it shows the actions.\n\nSo I think:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 80: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 81: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 82: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 83: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 84: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 85: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 86: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 87: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 88: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 89: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 90: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut to save space, perhaps write in a block.\n\nSince it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nIn the format: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nWith U and D: turn 80: U, turn 81: D, then same U from 82 to 90.\n\nBut that has a down action, which might be unnecessary, but same number.\n\nI think S is fine.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 80\\) is 11, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is designed to:\n- Avoid being on freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3, 4\\) at turn \\(t = 82\\) (time offset \\(\\tau = 2\\)), as these are unsafe due to cars covering position 0.\n- Avoid being on freeways \\(y = 5, 6\\) at turns \\(t = 84\\) and \\(t = 85\\) (\\(\\tau = 4, 5\\)), as these are unsafe.\n- Freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are always safe, allowing direct upward movement.\n\nThe sequence begins with two \"Stay\" (S) actions at turns 80 and 81 to remain at \\(y = 0\\), ensuring safety at \\(\\tau = 2\\). Then, nine consecutive \"Up\" (U) actions are taken from turn 82 to 90, moving the player to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 91.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- At turn 80 (\\(\\tau = 0\\)), action S: Player stays at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no freeway).\n- At turn 81 (\\(\\tau = 1\\)), action S: Player stays at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no freeway).\n- At turn 82 (\\(\\tau = 2\\)), action U: Player moves to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 83.

At turn 84 (\\(\\tau = 4\\)), \\(y = 2\\) is safe (car span on freeway 2: \\([-83 + 36 \\times 4, -48 + 36 \\times 4] = [61, 96]\\), 0 not in span).\n- At turn 84 (\\(\\tau = 4\\)), action U: Player moves to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 85.

At turn 86 (\\(\\tau = 6\\)), \\(y = 4\\) is safe (car span on freeway 4: \\([-83 + 36 \\times 6, -48 + 36 \\times 6] = [133, 168]\\), 0 not in span).\n- At turn 86 (\\(\\tau = 6\\)), action U: Player moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 87. At turn 87 (\\(\\tau = 7\\)), \\(y = 5\\) is safe (car spans on freeway 5: third car \\([-35 + 6 \\times 7, -24 + 6 \\times 7] = [7, 18]\\), 0 not in span; other cars do not cover 0).\n- At turn 87 (\\(\\tau = 7\\)), action U: Player moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 88. At turn 88 (\\(\\tau = 8\\)), \\(y = 6\\) is safe (car spans on freeway 6: third car \\([-35 + 6 \\times 8, -24 + 6 \\times 8] = [13, 24]\\), 0 not in span; other cars do not cover 0).\n- At turn 88 (\\(\\tau = 8\\)), action U: Player moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 89. At turn 89 (\\(\\tau = 9\\)), \\(y = 7\\) is safe (no car covers 0 on freeway 7).\n- At turn 89 (\\(\\tau = 9\\)), action U: Player moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 90.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 86, and the player is at (0,0). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if at that turn the player is on a freeway y (which is from 1 to 8) and at that same turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nNote: When the player moves (U, D, or S), the y-position changes at the next turn. Specifically, at turn T, the player is at y_T. Then we choose an action a_T which determines y_{T+1}. However, note that during turn T, the player is on freeway y_T. So when we check for collision at turn T, we look at the cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nThe car spans move with time. For a car given at turn t1 (current turn) with head h, tail tau, direction d, and speed s, then at a future turn T (>= t1), the span is:\n\n- If left-moving (which would be d = left): [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]   [Note: head and tail are given at t1, and the car moves left so the entire span shifts left by s*(T-t1)]\n- If right-moving (d = right): [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]   [But wait, the given representation for right-moving is (head, tail) and then the span at t1 is [tau, head]? Actually, the problem states for right-moving: at t1 the span is [tau, head] and then at T it becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n\nHowever, note the representation in the table:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24) -> at turn t1=86, the head is -48? But for right-moving, the head should be the rightmost? Actually, the problem says for a right-moving car: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning the tail is at the left and head at the right. So in the data, the first two numbers are (head, tail) but then the span is [tail, head] for right? Or is it [head, tail] but that wouldn't make sense for right because then head is less than tail? Let me see:\n\nThe example for right: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\". So the tail is the left end and the head is the right end. Therefore, for a right-moving car, the car is from tail (left) to head (right). So in the data, the first number is the head (right end) and the second is the tail (left end). But note: in the problem's description for right-moving, they write: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\". So the tail is the left and head is the right.\n\nTherefore, for freeway 1: head = -48, tail = -71, right, speed=24. But wait: if tail = -71 and head = -48, then at t1=86, the car is from -71 to -48? And it's moving right. Then at a future time T, the car will be from -71 + 24*(T-86) to -48 + 24*(T-86).\n\nBut note: the problem says for right: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, we don't have any in this problem.\n\nNow, the collision condition: at turn T, if the player is at freeway k (which is between 1 and 8) and at that turn, the player's x=0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe start at turn 86 at y=0. We are not on any freeway (since freeways are y=1..8) so we are safe at turn 86.\n\nOur goal is to get to y=9. We can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: y stays). But note: we are at y=0 at turn 86. If we move up, then at turn 87 we will be at y=1. Then we are on freeway 1 at turn 87.\n\nWe must avoid collisions at every turn from 86 onward. However, note that at turn 86 we are at y=0 (safe) and at the goal (0,9) we are at y=9 (also safe because freeways are 1-8). So we only worry about freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway and each future turn T (>=86) the positions of the cars and then check if when the player is on that freeway at that turn, is 0 inside the car's span?\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and a sequence of actions from turn 86 to turn 86+H-1 such that at turn 86+H-1, the player is at y=9.\n\nLet t = T - 86, so t=0 is turn 86, t=1 is turn 87, etc.\n\nWe are at y_0 = 0.\n\nWe choose a sequence of actions a_86, a_87, ..., a_{86+H-1} (each in {U, D, S}) such that:\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, with Delta as defined.\n\nConstraints: \n- y_t must be integer between 0 and 9.\n- At each turn t (from t=0 to t=H-1), the player is at y_t. We must check: if y_t is in {1,2,...,8} (i.e., a freeway) then for every car on freeway k=y_t at turn T=86+t, the x=0 must not lie in the car's span at that turn.\n\nNote: at turn T=86+t, the cars on freeway k are as given, and we compute their spans at turn T.\n\nWe need to compute the span for each car on each freeway at turn T = 86 + t.\n\nWe are given the state at turn t1=86.\n\nLet's list all the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=-48, tail=-71, direction=right, speed=24)\nFreeway 2: one car: (head=-48, tail=-83, direction=right, speed=36)\nFreeway 3: one car: (head=-48, tail=-83, direction=right, speed=36)\nFreeway 4: one car: (head=-48, tail=-83, direction=right, speed=36)\nFreeway 5: three cars: \n   car1: (48, 37, right, 6) -> head=48, tail=37? But for right, the span is [tail, head] = [37,48] at t1=86? But wait, the problem says: for right, span(t1)=[tau, head]. So tail is the left and head the right. So this car is from 37 to 48 at t1=86. But note: the representation in the table: the first number is head? and the second is tail? Then yes: head=48, tail=37 -> [37,48] at t1=86.\n   car2: (12, 1, right, 6) -> [1,12] at t1=86.\n   car3: (-24, -35, right, 6) -> [-35, -24] at t1=86.\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5: three cars: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\nFreeway 7: one car: (48,37,right,12) -> [37,48] at t1=86, speed=12.\nFreeway 8: one car: (48,37,right,4) -> [37,48] at t1=86, speed=4.\n\nNow, for a future turn T = 86 + t (where t>=0), the car on freeway k:\n\nFor a right-moving car with head=h, tail=tau, speed=s, at T=86+t:\n   left_end = tau + s * t\n   right_end = h + s * t\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving (none in this problem).\n\nWe must check for each freeway k and for each time t (starting at t=0) whether if the player is on freeway k at time t (i.e., y_t = k) then 0 is not in [left_end, right_end] for any car on that freeway.\n\nOur plan: we want to go from y=0 to y=9. The minimal number of turns in terms of vertical moves is 9 moves up (if we could go without any car). But we have to avoid the freeways when cars are at x=0.\n\nWe can also move down? But we are at 0 and we cannot go below 0. So at y=0, we can only go up or stay. Similarly, at y=9, we can only go down or stay. But our goal is to reach (0,9). So we must end at y=9.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each time t (starting from t=0) the condition: is there a car on freeway k at time t such that 0 is in the span?\n\nBut note: the cars move continuously, so we need to check for every integer t (which is the offset from turn 86) the positions.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k and for each time t (from 0 to, say, a safe upper bound) the safety: safe if no car on k at time t has a span covering 0.\n\nBut note: at a given freeway k, there might be multiple cars. We must check all of them.\n\nLet's compute for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: tau=-71, h=-48, s=24, right-moving.\n   At time t (after 86), the car is at [ -71 + 24*t, -48 + 24*t ]\n   We require that 0 is not in [ -71+24t, -48+24t ].\n\n   Condition: \n        -71+24t <= 0 <= -48+24t   -> this interval must not contain 0.\n\n   Solve for t: \n        -71+24t <= 0 -> 24t <= 71 -> t <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958 -> t <= 2 (since t integer) for the left inequality to hold? Actually, we require that either 0 < -71+24t or 0 > -48+24t.\n\n   Actually, we want 0 to be outside [A, B] where A=-71+24t, B=-48+24t.\n\n   So: either 0 < A  OR  0 > B.\n\n   Case 1: 0 < -71+24t  => 24t > 71 => t >= ceil(71/24) = ceil(2.958) = 3.\n   Case 2: 0 > -48+24t => 24t < 48 => t < 2.\n\n   So for t < 2 OR t>=3, the freeway 1 is safe at time t.\n\n   At t=0: A=-71, B=-48 -> 0 is not in [-71,-48] -> safe.\n   t=1: A=-71+24=-47, B=-48+24=-24 -> 0 is not in [-47,-24] -> safe.\n   t=2: A=-71+48=-23, B=-48+48=0 -> now 0 is at the right endpoint. Is 0 in the interval? Yes, because [A,B] is inclusive. So collision at t=2? \n        But note: the problem says the span is [left_end, right_end] and the car occupies that entire segment. So 0 is included at t=2? \n        However, note: the car is from -23 to 0 at t=2. So if the player is at freeway 1 at time t=2 (which is turn 86+2=88), then collision.\n\n   Therefore, freeway 1 is unsafe at t=2.\n\n   So freeway 1: safe at t=0,1,3,4,... but unsafe at t=2.\n\nFreeway 2: one car: tau=-83, h=-48, s=36, right.\n   Span at t: [ -83 + 36t, -48 + 36t ]\n\n   Condition for collision: 0 in [ -83+36t, -48+36t ]\n\n   Solve:\n        -83+36t <= 0 <= -48+36t\n\n        => 36t <= 83 -> t <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305 -> t<=2\n        and 36t >= 48 -> t>=48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333 -> t>=2 (since t integer, t>=2)\n\n        So t must be in [2,2]? Because t<=2 and t>=2 -> t=2.\n\n        Check: \n          t=2: [ -83+72 = -11, -48+72=24 ] -> 0 is in [-11,24] -> unsafe.\n\n        t=0: [-83, -48] -> safe.\n        t=1: [-83+36=-47, -48+36=-12] -> safe? because 0 is not in [-47,-12].\n        t=2: unsafe.\n        t=3: [ -83+108=25, -48+108=60 ] -> safe.\n\n        So freeway 2: unsafe at t=2, safe otherwise.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? \n   Car: (head=-48, tail=-83, right, 36) -> same as freeway 2.\n   So also unsafe at t=2.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 2 and 3 -> unsafe at t=2.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars. We must check each one.\n\n   Car1: (head=48, tail=37, right, 6) -> [37+6t, 48+6t]\n        We require 0 not in [37+6t,48+6t]. \n        Since 37+6t >= 37 (for t>=0) and 37>0, so always positive -> safe.\n\n   Car2: (head=12, tail=1, right, 6) -> [1+6t,12+6t]\n        Similarly, 1+6t >=1>0 -> always positive -> safe.\n\n   Car3: (head=-24, tail=-35, right, 6) -> [-35+6t, -24+6t]\n        Condition: 0 in [ -35+6t, -24+6t ]?\n        => -35+6t <=0 and -24+6t>=0\n        => 6t<=35 -> t<=35/6≈5.833, and 6t>=24 -> t>=4.\n\n        So for t in [4,5]? \n        t=4: [-35+24=-11, -24+24=0] -> 0 is at the endpoint -> unsafe.\n        t=5: [-35+30=-5, -24+30=6] -> 0 is in [-5,6] -> unsafe.\n        t=6: [-35+36=1, -24+36=12] -> safe.\n\n        So car3: unsafe at t=4,5.\n\n        Therefore, freeway 5: \n            safe for t not in {4,5}? But note: the other cars are always safe. So overall, freeway 5 is unsafe at t=4 and t=5.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5 -> unsafe at t=4 and t=5.\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (head=48, tail=37, right, 12) -> [37+12t, 48+12t]\n        Always positive -> safe for all t.\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (head=48, tail=37, right, 4) -> [37+4t, 48+4t]\n        Always positive -> safe for all t.\n\nSummary of unsafe freeways at time t (relative to t0=86, so t=0 is turn86, t=1 is turn87, etc):\n\nt=0: \n   freeway 1: safe\n   freeway 2: safe\n   freeway 3: safe\n   freeway 4: safe\n   freeway 5: safe (because 4,5 are in the future)\n   freeway 6: safe\n   freeway 7: safe\n   freeway 8: safe\n\nt=1:\n   same as t=0? \n   freeway1: safe (as computed: t=1: [-47,-24] -> safe)\n   freeway2: safe (t=1: [-47,-12] -> safe)\n   freeway3: safe\n   freeway4: safe\n   freeway5: safe\n   freeway6: safe\n   freeway7: safe\n   freeway8: safe\n\nt=2:\n   freeway1: unsafe (car covers [-23,0])\n   freeway2: unsafe\n   freeway3: unsafe\n   freeway4: unsafe\n   freeway5: safe (because unsafe at t=4,5)\n   freeway6: safe\n   freeway7: safe\n   freeway8: safe\n\n   So at t=2, freeways 1,2,3,4 are unsafe. Freeways 5,6,7,8 are safe.\n\nt=3:\n   freeway1: safe (as computed: t=3: [-71+72=1, -48+72=24] -> safe)\n   freeway2: safe (t=3: [-83+108=25, -48+108=60] -> safe)\n   freeway3: safe\n   freeway4: safe\n   freeway5: safe (t=3: car3: [-35+18=-17, -24+18=-6] -> safe)\n   freeway6: safe\n   freeway7: safe\n   freeway8: safe\n\nt=4:\n   freeway1: safe\n   freeway2: safe\n   freeway3: safe\n   freeway4: safe\n   freeway5: unsafe (car3: [-35+24=-11, -24+24=0] -> unsafe)\n   freeway6: unsafe (same as freeway5)\n   freeway7: safe\n   freeway8: safe\n\nt=5:\n   freeway5: unsafe (car3: [-35+30=-5, -24+30=6] -> includes 0)\n   freeway6: unsafe\n   others safe.\n\nt=6 and beyond: \n   freeway5: safe (car3: [1,12] at t=6 -> safe)\n   freeway6: safe\n   others safe.\n\nNow, we are at turn86 (t=0): y0=0 (safe).\n\nWe want to get to y=9. The minimal number of moves is 9 moves up (if we go up every turn, then at turn86+9 we are at y=9). But we must avoid being on an unsafe freeway at an unsafe time.\n\nThe sequence of y positions:\n\nAt turn86: y0=0\nAt turn87: y1 = y0 + a0 -> we choose a0: U -> y1=1, or S -> y1=0, or D -> invalid (since y0=0, D would make y1=-1 -> not allowed) so we can only U or S.\n\nSimilarly, at any time, we can only move within [0,9].\n\nWe want to minimize H, the total turns. So we start by trying H=9 (9 moves: 9 Ups) and see if we can avoid the unsafe states.\n\nBut note: the goal is to be at y=9 at the last turn. So we must be at y=9 at turn86+H-1.\n\nWith 9 Ups: we would have:\n\nt=0 (turn86): y0=0 (safe)\nt=1 (turn87): y1=1 -> freeway1. At t=1, freeway1 is safe -> safe.\nt=2 (turn88): y2=2 -> freeway2. At t=2, freeway2 is unsafe! So we cannot be at freeway2 at t=2.\n\nTherefore, we cannot go straight up at t=2 to freeway2.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeways 1,2,3,4 at t=2 and freeways 5,6 at t=4 and t=5.\n\nWe can try to delay the movement? Or move down? But we are at y=0 at t=0. We can only go up.\n\nAlternatively, we can stay at y=0 for one turn? Then:\n\nOption: \n  t0: S -> y0=0 -> safe.\n  t1: U -> y1=1 -> at t1 (which is turn87) we are at freeway1 -> safe (since at t1 freeway1 is safe).\n  t2: we are at y1=1. Then we can choose: \n        U -> y2=2 -> freeway2 at t2: unsafe -> not allowed.\n        D -> y2=0 -> then we are at y=0 at t2 -> safe (because not a freeway).\n        S -> y2=1 -> freeway1 at t2: unsafe (freeway1 at t2 is unsafe) -> not allowed.\n\nSo at t2, if we are at freeway1, we must move down to avoid collision? Then:\n\n  t0: S (stay at 0)\n  t1: U (to 1)\n  t2: D (back to 0)\n\nThen at t2, we are at y2=0 -> safe.\n\nBut then we are back at 0. We lost progress.\n\nAlternatively, we might try to go faster? But we can only move one step per turn.\n\nOr we might skip the unsafe freeways at the unsafe times by timing differently.\n\nWe note that the unsafe times for freeways 1-4 are only at t=2, and for freeways 5-6 at t=4 and t=5.\n\nSo if we can arrange our path so that we are not on freeways 1-4 at t=2 and not on freeways 5-6 at t=4 and t=5, then we can go through.\n\nWe start at y=0 at t0.\n\nWe must go to y=9. The minimal steps is 9, so we need at least 9 moves up. But we can also move down to avoid being at an unsafe freeway at an unsafe time, but that would cost extra turns.\n\nWe try to plan:\n\nWe have to cover 9 units up. We need to avoid:\n\n- At t=2: we cannot be on freeways 1,2,3,4. So we can be on freeway5,6,7,8? But at t=2, we are only at the beginning. How high can we be at t=2?\n\nAt t0: y0=0\nt1: we can go to 1 (if we choose U) or stay at 0 (S) or go down? but down from 0 is invalid. So only U or S.\n\nIf we go U at t0: then at t1: y1=1 -> freeway1 -> safe (t1: safe for freeway1)\nThen at t1: we are at y=1. Then at t2: we can only go to y=0,1,2.\n\nBut if we go to y=2 at t2: then we are at freeway2 at t2 -> unsafe.\n\nIf we go to y=0 at t2: then we are safe (y=0) but then we have to climb again.\n\nIf we stay at y=1 at t2: then we are at freeway1 at t2 -> unsafe.\n\nSo from y=1 at t1, we must move down to y=0 at t2 to avoid collision.\n\nThen at t2: y2=0.\n\nThen at t3: we can go up to y=1.\n\nBut at t3: freeway1 is safe (as we computed) -> so we can go to 1 at t3.\n\nThen at t4: we can go to 2.\n\nBut at t4: freeway2 is safe? yes, because unsafe only at t=2. But note: at t4, we are going to freeway2? freeway2 is safe at t4. However, we also have to worry about freeways 5 and 6 at t4 and t5.\n\nBut we are at y=2 at t4, which is freeway2 -> safe (freeway2 is safe at t4). Then we can continue:\n\nt4: y4=2 -> safe.\n\nt5: we can go to 3 -> freeway3 at t5: safe? freeway3 is safe at t5 (only unsafe at t=2). So safe.\n\nt6: to 4 -> freeway4 at t6: safe (only unsafe at t=2).\n\nt7: to 5 -> freeway5 at t7: but at t7, freeway5 is safe? We computed freeway5 unsafe at t=4 and t=5. t7 is beyond 5 -> safe.\n\nBut wait, we are at t7: we are at freeway5 at t7 -> safe.\n\nThen we can continue: t8: to 6 -> freeway6 at t8: safe? freeway6 unsafe at t4 and t5, t8 is beyond -> safe.\n\nt9: to 7 -> freeway7: safe at any time.\n\nt10: to 8 -> freeway8: safe.\n\nt11: to 9 -> goal.\n\nBut we started at t0=86, then we have:\n\nt0: y0=0\nt1: y1=1 (action: U at turn86)\nt2: y2=0 (action: D at turn87) -> but wait, we are at y=1 at t1 (turn87) and then we do D at turn87 to go to y2=0 at t2 (turn88). \nt3: y3=1 (U at turn88) -> turn89: y=1\nt4: y4=2 (U at turn89) -> turn90: y=2\nt5: y5=3 (U at turn90) -> turn91: y=3\nt6: y6=4 (U at turn91) -> turn92: y=4\nt7: y7=5 (U at turn92) -> turn93: y=5\nt8: y8=6 (U at turn93) -> turn94: y=6\nt9: y9=7 (U at turn94) -> turn95: y=7\nt10: y10=8 (U at turn95) -> turn96: y=8\nt11: y11=9 (U at turn96) -> turn97: y=9 -> goal.\n\nTotal turns: from turn86 to turn97 -> H = 12 turns? Because we have 11 actions? Actually, we have actions from turn86 to turn96 (11 actions) and then at turn97 we are at the goal? But the last action is at turn96 and we are at y=9 at turn97.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\" and the sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1? Actually, we have:\n\nThe game starts at turn t1=86. We are at (0,0) at the beginning of turn86.\n\nWe choose actions for turns: 86, 87, ... until the last action that leads to the goal.\n\nThe problem: we need to be at (0,9) at turn (86 + H - 1). \n\nIn our sequence:\n\nAt the end of turn86 (after action at turn86): we are at y1 (which is the position at turn87) = 1.\nAt the end of turn87: we are at y2=0 (after D at turn87).\n...\nAt the end of turn96: we are at y11=9 (after U at turn96).\n\nSo the turn at which we are at (0,9) is turn97? But note: the turn index: after H actions (over H turns) we have moved H steps and the position is at turn86+H.\n\nBut the problem says: we are to find H such that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nLet me clarify: \n- At turn t1 (turn86), we are at (0,0). \n- Then we choose an action at turn86, which leads to the position at turn87 (which is turn86+1).\n- We choose actions for turn86, turn87, ... until we are at (0,9) at the turn after the last action.\n\nThe problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to H-1, so we have H actions: at t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1.\n\nThen the position at turn t1+H is the state after H actions.\n\nWe require that at turn t1+H-1? Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nBut note: after the last action (the H-th action, which is at turn t1+H-1), the player's position is updated to the next turn. So at turn t1+H, the player is at y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut the problem says: \"at turn t1+H-1\" we are at (0,9). \n\nWait, let me read: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nThis is confusing. \n\nThe problem states: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nBut note: the position at turn t1 is (0, y_{t1}) = (0,0). Then after the first action (at turn t1) we get to turn t1+1 with position y_{t1+1}. \n\nSo to be at (0,9) at a specific turn T, that means at the beginning of turn T, the player is at (0,9). \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". So at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). \n\nHowever, note that the actions are taken at the beginning of the turn? Actually, the game dynamics: \n  - The action a_t is taken at turn t, and then the position at turn t+1 is updated.\n\nTherefore, the position at turn t is the state at the beginning of turn t.\n\nSo we start at turn t1: (0,0). \nWe take an action at turn t1, which determines the position at turn t1+1.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut note: after H-1 actions (taken at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-2) we get the position at turn t1+H-1.\n\nTherefore, we need H-1 actions to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut the problem asks for H and the sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1. That would be H actions. \n\nBut then the position at turn t1+H (after the last action) would be the next state. \n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nLooking back: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nBut if we take H actions (from t1 to t1+H-1), then we update the position H times, so the position at turn t1+H is updated. But we require the position at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThis implies that the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, which updates the position from turn t1+H-1 to turn t1+H. But we want the position at turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9). \n\nSo the actions taken at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2 will have already set the position at turn t1+H-1 to (0,9). And the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken, but it doesn't affect the position at turn t1+H-1 (which is already set). \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take an action at turn t to update the position for the next turn. So to have the position at turn T, we have taken actions at turns t1 to T-1.\n\nTherefore, to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, we must have taken actions at turns t1 to t1+H-2. That is, H-1 actions.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and a sequence of H actions: from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSo if we take H actions, then we update the position H times, and the last update is to turn t1+H. But we require the position at turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9). \n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nLet me re-read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" -> that's H actions: for t1+0, t1+1, ... t1+H-1.\n\nThen the position at the end of these actions is at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nPerhaps there's a misunderstanding. Let me see the problem statement: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nAnd the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1: so a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ... a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nBut then the position at turn t1+H is updated by the last action. \n\nTo have the position at turn t1+H-1 be (0,9), we must have that the action at turn t1+H-1 does not change the position? Or the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken but then the position at turn t1+H is updated, but we don't care as long as at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9).\n\nBut that means we are already at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action at turn t1+H-1 (which might move us away, but we don't care because the condition is only that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9)).\n\nBut then why take the action? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be that we take actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and then at the turn after the last action (turn t1+H) we are at the goal? But the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nI think there might be an off-by-one confusion.\n\nLooking at the example in the problem? There is no example.\n\nAnother possibility: \"turns\" H means the number of turns we play actions, and then at the turn after the last action we are at the goal. But the problem explicitly says \"reach at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nLet me check the indices:\n\nAt turn t1, we start at (0,0). We take an action at turn t1 that updates to turn t1+1.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at turn T. \n\nThe turn T is t1+H-1.\n\nThe last action we take is at turn t1+H-2, because that action updates the position to turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1? That would be H actions. But the last action at turn t1+H-1 would update to turn t1+H, which is beyond T.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem intends that the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H we are at the goal. But the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of turns H is defined as the number of turns from t1 to the goal turn. And the goal turn is t1+H-1.\n\nBut then the number of actions is H-1.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" -> that's H actions.\n\nSo to have the goal at turn t1+H-1, we need to take actions at turns t1 to t1+H-2, which is H-1 actions. But the sequence has H actions. So we are including an extra action.\n\nThis is very confusing.\n\nI think there is a mistake in the problem statement. In many such problems, if we start at turn0, and we take actions at turn0, turn1, ... turn_{H-1} then we are at the goal state at turn H.\n\nHere, they say we start at turn t1, and we want to be at the goal at turn t1+H-1, after taking actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1? That doesn't add up.\n\nPerhaps the indexing is such that the first action is at turn t1, and then the state at turn t1 is updated by the action to turn t1+1, and we want to be at turn t1+H-1 = the goal.\n\nThen the number of actions is (t1+H-1 - t1) = H-1 actions.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence has H actions.\n\nI think the safest is to assume that we must be at (0,9) at the turn after the last action. In other words, after the last action in the sequence, the player is at (0,9) at the next turn. And the last action is the (H-1)-th action in the sequence.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\", and the actions are for turns from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSo if we have actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, then the position at turn t1+H-1 is the state BEFORE the action at turn t1+H-1. Then the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken, and then the position at turn t1+H is updated.\n\nTherefore, to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, we must have that the player is at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action at turn t1+H-1 (which may move us away, but we don't care because the requirement is only at that turn).\n\nBut then the action at turn t1+H-1 is not necessary for reaching (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, but we are forced to provide it because the sequence must have H actions.\n\nSo we can choose any action for the last one? But that might cause collision? We don't care about after turn t1+H-1.\n\nOr we can choose S (stay) at turn t1+H-1, then we stay at (0,9) for the next turn, but that doesn't affect the requirement.\n\nSo in our planning, we must ensure that at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9), and then the last action (at turn t1+H-1) can be arbitrary? But the problem asks for the sequence to reach, so we only care up to being at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. The last action is just to fill the sequence.\n\nHowever, the last action might cause a collision at turn t1+H-1? No, because collision at a turn depends on the freeway at that turn and the cars at that turn. At turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9) which is not a freeway, so safe. Then we can choose any action.\n\nSo we can set the last action to S, for example.\n\nTherefore, in our plan, we must have the player at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nNow, in the earlier plan, we had:\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at turn T = t1+H-1.\n\nIn our earlier 12-turn example (actions from turn86 to turn96, 11 actions) we reached y=9 at turn97.\n\nSo T = 97 = 86 + H - 1 -> 86+H-1=97 -> H=12.\n\nThen the sequence has 12 actions: from turn86 to turn97? But turn97 is the turn at which we are at the goal, so the last action should be at turn97? But then the sequence would be a_{86} to a_{97} (12 actions) and then at turn98 we are at the state after the last action. But we want to be at (0,9) at turn86+12-1=97.\n\nSo in the sequence, the last action is at turn97, and then at turn97 (before the action) we are at (0,9). But the action at turn97 will then update to turn98.\n\nSo how do we ensure that at the beginning of turn97 we are at (0,9)? \n\nWe must have reached (0,9) by the action at turn96, which updates the position to turn97. \n\nTherefore, the action at turn96 should move the player to y=9 at turn97.\n\nThen the action at turn97 is not needed for reaching, but we have to include it because the sequence has H=12 actions.\n\nSo we can do:\n\nActions from turn86 to turn96: 11 actions that get us to (0,9) at turn97.\n\nThen at turn97, we do an action (say S) to fill the sequence.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and H=12, so turns 86 to 86+11=97.\n\nSo we need an action at turn97.\n\nAnd at the beginning of turn97, we are at (0,9) (safe), and then we do S (or any action) at turn97, which updates to turn98: \n   if we do S, then we stay at (0,9) for turn98.\n\nBut the requirement is only for turn97.\n\nSo it's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, in our plan, we need to reach (0,9) at turn97 (which is t1+H-1 = 86+12-1=97) by actions from turn86 to turn96.\n\nBut in the plan I described earlier, we reached at turn97 (after 11 actions) to (0,9). Then we add one more action at turn97 (S) to make 12 actions.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nWe had to go down at turn87 to avoid the unsafe freeway1 at turn88 (which is t=2). That cost us two extra turns (because we went down and then had to go up again).\n\nCan we do it in fewer than 12 turns?\n\nLet's try to see if we can be at y=5 or y=6 at t=4 and t=5 to avoid the unsafe freeways 5 and 6? But freeways 5 and 6 are unsafe at t=4 and t=5, so we must not be on freeway5 or 6 at turns 86+4=90 and 86+5=91.\n\nWe are at y=0 at t0 (turn86).\n\nWe need to cover 9 units up.\n\nLet me try a path that goes faster initially:\n\nOption: at turn86 (t0): U -> y1=1 (at turn87, t1=1) -> safe.\nThen at turn87 (t1): U -> y2=2 (at turn88, t2=2) -> but freeway2 at t2 is unsafe! -> not allowed.\n\nSo we cannot go to 2 at t2.\n\nAlternative: at turn86: U (->1 at t1)\n         turn87: S (->1 at t2) -> but freeway1 at t2 is unsafe -> not allowed.\n\nSo we must move away from freeway1 at t2: either down to 0 or up to 2. But up to 2 is unsafe, so only down to 0.\n\nThen we are at 0 at t2.\n\nThen we have to make up for the lost progress.\n\nAlternatively, can we stay at 0 at turn86? \n\n  turn86: S -> then at turn87 (t1): y=0.\n  turn87: U -> at turn88 (t2): y=1 -> freeway1 at t2: unsafe! -> not allowed.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway1 at t2 either.\n\nSo the only safe option at t2 is to be at y=0 or y>=5? Because freeways 5,6,7,8 are safe at t2.\n\nBut we are at y=0 or y=1 at t1. How to get to y>=5 by t2?\n\nAt t0: y0=0.\nt0: action U -> y1=1 at t1.\nt1: action U -> y2=2 at t2: unsafe.\nt1: action U is the only way to go up, but then we are at 2 at t2: unsafe.\n\nWe can only move one step per turn. So at t2, we can be at most at y=2 (if we do two Ups) or y=0 (if we do U then D) or y=1 (if we do U then S or S then U) but we saw that y=1 and y=2 are unsafe at t2.\n\nAnd y=0 is safe, but then we are behind.\n\nSo the only safe at t2 is y=0.\n\nThen at t2: y=0.\n\nThen at t2: we can start moving up.\n\nAt t2 (turn88): we are at y=0.\nWe can do: \n  turn88: U -> y=1 at t3 (turn89) -> freeway1 at t3: safe? yes, because at t3, freeway1 is safe.\n  turn89: U -> y=2 at t4 (turn90) -> freeway2 at t4: safe? yes, because freeway2 is only unsafe at t2.\n  turn90: U -> y=3 at t5 (turn91) -> freeway3 at t5: safe.\n  turn91: U -> y=4 at t6 (turn92) -> freeway4 at t6: safe.\n  turn92: U -> y=5 at t7 (turn93) -> freeway5 at t7: safe? at t7, freeway5 is safe (unsafe at t4,t5) -> safe.\n  turn93: U -> y=6 at t8 (turn94) -> freeway6 at t8: safe.\n  turn94: U -> y=7 at t9 (turn95) -> freeway7: safe.\n  turn95: U -> y=8 at t10 (turn96) -> freeway8: safe.\n  turn96: U -> y=9 at t11 (turn97) -> goal.\n\nThen we need to provide an action for turn97 to make H=12? But we are at y=9 at turn97, so we can do S at turn97.\n\nThe actions are:\n\n  turn86: U  (to y=1 at turn87)\n  turn87: D  (to y=0 at turn88)\n  turn88: U  (to y=1 at turn89)\n  turn89: U  (to y=2 at turn90)\n  turn90: U  (to y=3 at turn91)\n  turn91: U  (to y=4 at turn92)\n  turn92: U  (to y=5 at turn93)\n  turn93: U  (to y=6 at turn94)\n  turn94: U  (to y=7 at turn95)\n  turn95: U  (to y=8 at turn96)\n  turn96: U  (to y=9 at turn97)\n  turn97: S  (we are at y=9 at turn98, but we only care up to turn97)\n\nBut wait, at the beginning of turn97, we are at y=9. Then we do S at turn97, which doesn't change the position at turn98.\n\nBut the requirement is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 = 86+12-1=97. We are there.\n\nTotal actions: 12.\n\nBut can we avoid the extra action? The minimal H might be less if we can be at y=9 at an earlier turn.\n\nWe are at turn97 with this plan. We want to be at y=9 at an earlier turn? The earliest possible is turn86+9=95 (with 9 Ups) but we saw we can't because of the unsafe freeways.\n\nLet me see if we can be at y=9 by turn95 (which is t=9).\n\nThat would require that we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn95.\n\nThen we need to have taken 9 up actions by turn94.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on freeways 1-4 at t=2 (turn88) and freeways 5-6 at t=4 (turn90) and t=5 (turn91).\n\nThe moves:\n\nt0: turn86: start at 0.\nt1: turn87: y1 = ? \nt2: turn88: y2 = ? must be 0 or >=5? because freeways1-4 are unsafe at t2.\n\nBut from 0, we can only go to 1 at t1. Then at t2, from 1 we can go to 0,1,2. But 1 and 2 are unsafe. So only 0.\n\nSo at t2, we are at 0.\n\nThen we have to get to 9 by t9 (turn95) which is 9 units up in 7 moves? (from turn88 to turn94: 7 actions) -> that's 7 moves, we can only get to 7 at best.\n\nSo we need at least 9 moves up, and we have to account for the down move. Total moves: 10 up moves and one down move? But we only need 9 up moves, but we did one down move, so total net 8 up moves? Then we are at 8 at some point, and then we need one more up.\n\nWith the down move, we have:\n\nAt turn86: U (to1)\n turn87: D (to0)  -> net 0 progress.\nThen from turn88 to turn94: 7 ups -> to 7.\nThen turn95: U to8.\nThen turn96: U to9.\n\nThen at turn97: we are at9.\n\nWe cannot get to9 earlier.\n\nAlternatively, can we do more than one down move? That would make it worse.\n\nOr can we avoid the down move by being at a safe freeway at t2? We saw only freeways5,6,7,8 are safe at t2, but we can't reach them in two moves.\n\nSo the minimal H is 12.\n\nNow, we must check that in the entire path we avoid collisions.\n\nWe'll write the sequence and check for each turn the freeway and the cars.\n\nTurn86 (t0): y=0 (safe, not freeway)\nAction: U -> next state: y=1 at turn87.\n\nTurn87 (t1): y=1 -> freeway1. Check freeway1 at t1: \n   car: [ -71+24*1, -48+24*1 ] = [-47, -24] -> 0 not in -> safe.\nAction: D -> next state: y=0 at turn88.\n\nTurn88 (t2): y=0 (safe)\nAction: U -> next state: y=1 at turn89.\n\nTurn89 (t3): y=1 -> freeway1. Check at t3: [ -71+24*3, -48+24*3 ] = [-71+72=1, -48+72=24] -> 0 not in -> safe.\nAction: U -> next state: y=2 at turn90.\n\nTurn90 (t4): y=2 -> freeway2. Check at t4: freeway2 car: [ -83+36*4, -48+36*4 ] = [-83+144=61, -48+144=96] -> 0 not in -> safe.\nBut note: at t4, freeway5 and 6 are unsafe, but we are on freeway2 -> safe.\nAction: U -> next state: y=3 at turn91.\n\nTurn91 (t5): y=3 -> freeway3. Check at t5: freeway3 car: same as freeway2: [ -83+36*5, -48+36*5 ] = [-83+180=97, -48+180=132] -> safe.\nBut also, freeway5 and 6 are unsafe at t5, but we are on freeway3 -> safe.\nAction: U -> next state: y=4 at turn92.\n\nTurn92 (t6): y=4 -> freeway4. Check: [ -83+36*6, -48+36*6] = [-83+216=133, -48+216=168] -> safe.\nAction: U -> next state: y=5 at turn93.\n\nTurn93 (t7): y=5 -> freeway5. Check: \n   car1: [37+6*7,48+6*7]=[37+42=79,48+42=90] -> safe.\n   car2: [1+6*7,12+6*7]=[43,54] -> safe.\n   car3: [-35+6*7, -24+6*7] = [-35+42=7, -24+42=18] -> safe (0 not in).\n   So safe.\nAction: U -> next state: y=6 at turn94.\n\nTurn94 (t8): y=6 -> freeway6. Check: same as freeway5 at t8? \n   car3: [-35+6*8, -24+6*8] = [-35+48=13, -24+48=24] -> safe.\n   others safe.\nAction: U -> next state: y=7 at turn95.\n\nTurn95 (t9): y=7 -> freeway7. Check: [37+12*9, 48+12*9]=[37+108=145,48+108=156] -> safe.\nAction: U -> next state: y=8 at turn96.\n\nTurn96 (t10): y=8 -> freeway8. Check: [37+4*10,48+4*10]=[37+40=77,48+40=88] -> safe.\nAction: U -> next state: y=9 at turn97.\n\nNow, we are at turn97 (t11) and we are at y=9 (safe). We need to provide an action for turn97 to complete the sequence of 12 actions.\n\nAt turn97: we are at y=9. We can do S, U, or D? \n   U: would go to 10 -> invalid? but the constraint is y in [0,9]. So we cannot do U.\n   D: to 8 -> but then we leave the goal? \n   S: stay at 9.\n\nBut the problem only requires to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 = 86+12-1=97. We are there. The action at turn97 can be S (since we are at 9, we can stay).\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 86: U\nTurn 87: D\nTurn 88: U\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: U\nTurn 93: U\nTurn 94: U\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: U\nTurn 97: S\n\nBut wait, the action at turn97 is after we are already at the goal at the beginning of turn97. And then we do S, which leaves us at 9 at turn98.\n\nBut the requirement is only for turn97.\n\nIs there a way to do it in 11 actions? Then H=11, and we want to be at (0,9) at turn 86+11-1=96.\n\nSo we need to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn96.\n\nThen we need to have taken 10 actions (from turn86 to turn95) that get us to (0,9) at turn96.\n\nBut in our path, we were at (0,8) at turn96 and then we went to 9 at turn97.\n\nCan we rearrange to be at 9 at turn96?\n\nWe need to gain 9 in 10 moves? But we have the down move, so net 8 moves up? Then we would be at 8 at turn96.\n\nWithout the down move, we cannot pass the t2 constraint.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid the down move by waiting at a safe place at t2.\n\nBut at t2, the only safe freeways are 5,6,7,8. Can we be at one of these at t2?\n\nWe start at 0 at t0.\nt0: U -> 1 at t1.\nt1: we must be at 5,6,7, or 8 at t2? How? We can only move one step per turn. From 1 at t1, we can go to 0,1,2 at t2. None of these are in {5,6,7,8}. \n\nSo impossible.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 12.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 86: U\nTurn 87: D\nTurn 88: U\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: U\nTurn 93: U\nTurn 94: U\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: U\nTurn 97: S\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on. So we start at turn86.\n\nWe write:\n\nTurn 86: U\nTurn 87: D\nTurn 88: U\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: U\nTurn 93: U\nTurn 94: U\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: U\nTurn 97: S\n\nThis is 12 actions.\n\nBut let me double-check the turn indices: \n  The sequence is for turns: 86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97.\n\nAnd we are at (0,9) at turn97 (which is 86+12-1=97) at the beginning of the turn? \n\nAt the beginning of turn97, we are at y=9 (because the action at turn96 was U, which moved us from y=8 at turn96 to y=9 at turn97).\n\nThen we do S at turn97, which means we stay at 9 for turn98.\n\nSo yes.\n\nWe could avoid the last S if the problem allowed H=11, but we cannot.\n\nBut note: the problem requires to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. With H=11, that would be turn 86+11-1=96. But at the beginning of turn96, we were at y=8 (from the action at turn95: U from 7 to 8). So we are not at 9.\n\nTherefore, we must have H=12.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 86\\) while avoiding collisions with cars is 12.

The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal number of turns without colliding with any car on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nPlayer movement:\n  U: y increases by 1 (if not at 9)\n  D: y decreases by 1 (if not at 0)\n  S: stay\n\nCollision condition: at turn T, if the player is at freeway k (so y_T = k, which must be between 1 and 8) and at that same turn T, the position x=0 is covered by a car on that freeway k.\n\nImportant note: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on freeway y_T during turn T. So if at turn T the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} (which is different from y_T), then at turn T the player is only on freeway y_T. Therefore, we only check the car on the freeway corresponding to the current y at that turn.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1 (88). For each car, we have (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the representation:\n\n- For a right-moving car: the car is from tail to head, and tail < head. The car moves to the right (increasing x) as time passes.\n- For a left-moving car: the car is from head to tail? Actually, the example shows for left-moving: \"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\". But note the example in the car state table: all cars in this problem are right-moving? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFreeway 1: (0, -23, right, 24) -> right-moving, so at time t1=88, the car spans from -23 to 0? But wait: for a right-moving car, the representation is (head, tail, direction, speed). Since it's right-moving, the head is the front (rightmost) and tail is the leftmost? Actually, the update rule for right-moving says: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. But the initial state is given as (head, tail). So for a right-moving car, the head is the right end and tail is the left end? Then the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [-23, 0]. Similarly, for a left-moving car, the head would be the left end and tail the right end? But in this problem, all cars are right-moving (direction is 'right' for all).\n\nTherefore, for each car, the span at time t1 is [tail, head] (with tail <= head) and at time T (>=t1), the span becomes [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: the car state table for freeway 5 and 6 have multiple cars? Yes, each freeway can have multiple cars. So we must check all cars on the freeway at the time the player is on that freeway.\n\nThe goal: we start at y0 = 0 at turn t1=88. We need to get to y=9 (which is the top, and note that freeways are only from y=1 to y=8). So when we are at y=0 or y=9, we are safe (no cars). However, to get to y=9, we must pass through freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) that moves the player from y=0 to y=9 without being at a freeway k (1<=k<=8) at a turn T when there is any car on freeway k that covers x=0 at that turn T.\n\nWe are to minimize H (the number of turns).\n\nSince we start at y=0 and we want to get to y=9, we must go upward. But we might have to wait (by using S) or even move down to avoid collisions.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t0 = 88.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway k (from 1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, the set of times (turns) T at which the car covers x=0.\n\nFor a car on freeway k at initial time t0=88 with (head, tail, direction, speed) = (h, τ, d, s) [all right-moving, so d='right'].\n\nThe span at time T (>=t0) is [τ + s*(T-t0), h + s*(T-t0)].\n\nThe car covers x=0 at time T if:\n  τ + s*(T-t0) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-t0)\n\nSolve for T:\n\n  τ + s*(T-t0) <= 0  => T <= ( - τ ) / s + t0\n  0 <= h + s*(T-t0)  => T >= ( - h ) / s + t0\n\nBut note: because the car is moving to the right, the entire segment is shifting to the right. So the condition is:\n\n  τ + s*(T-t0) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-t0)\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n\n  T >= t0 + ceil( (-h) / s )   ??? Actually, we must be cautious because T is integer.\n\nWe can write:\n\n  Let A = τ + s*(T-t0) <= 0\n      => T <= t0 - τ/s\n\n  and B = 0 <= h + s*(T-t0)\n      => T >= t0 - h/s\n\nBut since T must be integer, we can compute the range of T for which the car blocks freeway k at x=0.\n\nActually, the condition is:\n\n  τ + s*(T-t0) <= 0   => T <= t0 + floor( ( - τ - 1e-9 ) / s )? \n\nAlternatively, we can compute:\n\n  The car covers 0 at time T if and only if:\n      τ + s*(T-t0) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-t0)\n\n  =>   -h <= s*(T-t0) <= -τ\n\n  =>   (-h)/s <= (T-t0) <= (-τ)/s\n\nBut note: since the car is moving continuously but we are sampling at integer times, we must consider the real line. However, because the car's position is linear, the set of T for which 0 is in the interval is a contiguous set of integers? Not necessarily: because the endpoints move by s per turn, so the interval of T might be contiguous.\n\nBut note: s is integer? The speeds: 24, 36, 6, 12, 4 -> all integers. And τ and h are integers. So:\n\n  T-t0 must be an integer, say dt = T - t0.\n\n  Then we require:\n      τ + s*dt <= 0\n      and\n      0 <= h + s*dt\n\n  =>   -h <= s*dt <= -τ\n\n  =>   dt_min = ceil(-h / s)   [because dt must be at least ceil(-h/s) to satisfy 0<=h+s*dt? Actually, 0<=h+s*dt => dt >= ceil(-h/s) ???]\n\nWait: \n  h + s*dt >= 0  => s*dt >= -h  => dt >= ceil(-h/s)   [if s>0, which it is]\n\nSimilarly, \n  τ + s*dt <= 0  => s*dt <= -τ  => dt <= floor(-τ/s)\n\nBut note: if s*dt <= -τ, then dt <= floor(-τ/s) because dt must be integer and s*dt is integer? Actually, s and τ are integers, so s*dt is integer. Therefore:\n\n  dt must satisfy:\n      ceil(-h/s) <= dt <= floor(-τ/s)\n\nBut wait: let me test with freeway 1: (h, τ) = (0, -23), s=24.\n\n  Condition: \n      h + s*dt >= 0 -> 0 + 24*dt >= 0 -> always true for dt>=0? \n      τ + s*dt <= 0 -> -23 + 24*dt <= 0 -> dt <= 23/24 -> dt <= 0.958... -> so dt<=0.\n\n  Therefore, dt_min = ceil(-0/24)=ceil(0)=0, and dt_max = floor(23/24)=0? So only at dt=0? \n\nBut at dt=0 (T=t0=88): \n  span = [ -23 + 24*0, 0 + 24*0] = [-23,0]. So 0 is included? Yes.\n\nAt dt=1: \n  [ -23 + 24, 0 + 24] = [1,24] -> 0 not included.\n\nSo for freeway 1, the car blocks at T=88 (only).\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: (24, -11, right, 36)\n  Condition: \n      h+s*dt >=0 -> 24+36*dt>=0 -> always true for dt>=0.\n      τ+s*dt<=0 -> -11+36*dt<=0 -> dt<=11/36 -> dt<=0.305 -> dt<=0.\n\n  So only at T=88? \n      at dt=0: [-11,24] -> includes 0? yes.\n\nAt dt=1: [ -11+36, 24+36] = [25,60] -> doesn't include 0.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (24, -11, right, 36) -> same, so only blocked at T=88.\n\nFreeway 4: same -> blocked at T=88.\n\nFreeway 5: has three cars: (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nWe need to check each car:\n\nCar1: (60,49,right,6)\n  Condition: \n      49 + 6*dt <= 0? -> 49+6dt<=0 -> dt<= -49/6 -> negative -> no solution? \n      and 60+6*dt>=0 -> always true for dt>=0.\n\n  So this car never blocks at x=0? Because the entire car is at positive x at t0: [49,60] at t0, then moves right. So 0 is never in the interval.\n\nCar2: (24,13,right,6)\n  Condition: \n      13+6*dt<=0 -> dt<=-13/6 -> no nonnegative dt -> never blocks.\n\nCar3: (-12,-23,right,6)\n  Condition: \n      -23+6*dt<=0 -> 6dt<=23 -> dt<=23/6 -> dt<=3.83 -> dt<=3\n      and -12+6*dt>=0 -> 6dt>=12 -> dt>=2.\n\n  So for dt in [2,3] (so T = t0+2=90, t0+3=91)\n\n  Check: \n      dt=2: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> includes 0? yes.\n      dt=3: [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6] -> includes 0? yes.\n\nSo freeway 5 is blocked at T=90 and T=91.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5? The table says the same cars. So also blocked at T=90,91.\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-59,right,12)\n  Condition:\n      -59+12*dt<=0 -> 12dt<=59 -> dt<=59/12=4.916 -> dt<=4\n      -48+12*dt>=0 -> 12dt>=48 -> dt>=4.\n\n  So only at dt=4: T=88+4=92.\n\n  Check: \n      at dt=4: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> includes 0.\n\nFreeway 8: (56,45,right,4)\n  Condition:\n      45+4*dt<=0 -> dt<=-45/4 -> no nonnegative dt -> never blocks.\n\nSummary of dangerous times (for each freeway, the turns at which x=0 is blocked):\n\nFreeway 1: [88]   (only turn 88)\nFreeway 2: [88]\nFreeway 3: [88]\nFreeway 4: [88]\nFreeway 5: [90,91]  (turns 90 and 91)\nFreeway 6: [90,91]\nFreeway 7: [92] \nFreeway 8: [] (never)\n\nNow, note that the player must avoid being on a freeway k at a turn when that freeway is blocked at x=0.\n\nWe start at (0,0) at turn 88. Since y=0 is safe (no cars), we are safe at turn 88.\n\nOur goal is to reach y=9. We can only change y by at most 1 per turn. So we must go through y=1,2,...,8.\n\nWe need to plan the moves so that when we are on freeway k at turn T, then T is not in the set of dangerous times for k.\n\nWe start at turn 88 at y=0.\n\nWe can choose actions: U (move up to y=1), D (stay at y=0? but we are at y=0, D would stay at 0? Actually D at y=0: y_{t+1} = y_t -1 -> but y_t=0, then y_{t+1} = max(0, 0-1)=0. So D and S at y=0 are the same: stay at 0. Similarly at y=9, U and S are the same: stay at 9.\n\nWe must eventually go up.\n\nBut note: at turn 88, if we go up to y=1 at turn 89, then at turn 89 we are at y=1. But freeway 1 is only blocked at turn 88? At turn 89, freeway 1 is not blocked (as we computed: only 88). So we can be at y=1 at turn 89 safely.\n\nSimilarly, we can then proceed upward? But we must avoid freeway 5 and 6 at turns 90 and 91, and freeway 7 at turn 92.\n\nWe have:\n\nTurn 88: y=0 (safe) -> we can do U to go to y=1 at turn 89.\n\nTurn 89: at y=1 -> is freeway 1 blocked at turn 89? No, only at 88. So safe.\n\nWe can then do U again to go to y=2 at turn 90.\n\nBut at turn 90, we would be at y=2. Freeway 2: blocked at turn 88? but not at turn 90. So safe? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 90, we are at y=2. Then we can go to y=3 at turn 91.\n\nBut at turn 91, we are at y=3. Freeway 3: blocked only at turn 88 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn 91, we go to y=4 at turn 92.\n\nBut at turn 92, we are at y=4. Freeway 4: blocked only at turn 88 -> safe.\n\nThen we can continue: \n  turn 92: at y=4, then U -> y=5 at turn 93.\n  turn 93: at y=5 -> but freeway 5 is blocked at turns 90 and 91? turn 93 is safe? yes.\n  turn 94: at y=6 -> freeway 6 is blocked at 90,91 -> safe at 94.\n  turn 95: at y=7 -> freeway 7 is blocked at 92? turn 95 is safe.\n  turn 96: at y=8 -> freeway 8 is never blocked -> safe.\n  turn 97: U to y=9 -> goal.\n\nBut wait, we started at turn 88 at y=0.\n\nTurn 88: at y=0 -> we do U -> then at turn 89 we are at y=1.\nTurn 89: U -> turn 90: y=2.\nTurn 90: U -> turn 91: y=3.\nTurn 91: U -> turn 92: y=4.\nTurn 92: U -> turn 93: y=5.\nTurn 93: U -> turn 94: y=6.\nTurn 94: U -> turn 95: y=7.\nTurn 95: U -> turn 96: y=8.\nTurn 96: U -> turn 97: y=9.\n\nTotal turns: from turn 88 to turn 97: 10 turns? But H is the number of turns in the sequence? The problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} that leads to y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo we start at t1=88, and we take H actions: from t=0 to H-1, so the state after H actions is at turn t1+H.\n\nBut note: the player position is updated at the end of the turn. So at turn 88 (current state), we are at (0,0). Then we choose an action for turn 88. After the action, at the next turn (turn 89) we are at a new position.\n\nTherefore, after H actions, we are at turn t1+H, and the position at that turn is (0,9).\n\nSo we want the minimal H such that we are at (0,9) at turn 88+H.\n\nIn the above plan:\n\n  Turn 88: action U -> at turn 89: y=1.\n  ...\n  Turn 96: action U -> at turn 97: y=9.\n\nSo we have taken 9 actions (H=9): from t=88 to t=96, and at turn 97 we are at y=9.\n\nBut wait: the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1: \n  t=0: turn 88\n  t=1: turn 89\n  ...\n  t=8: turn 96.\n\nThen the position at the end of turn 96 is y=9? Actually, after the last action (at turn 96) we move to y=9 at the beginning of turn 97? \n\nThe problem says: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nWait, the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nBut note the indexing: \n  At turn t1 (88), we start. Then we take action a_{t1} at turn 88, which leads to the state at turn 89: y_{89} = y_{88} + Delta y_{88}.\n\nSo the state after an action at turn t is the state at turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, after the sequence of H actions (from turn 88 to turn 88+H-1), we will be at turn 88+H, and the position at that turn is y_{88+H}.\n\nBut the problem requires: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nLet me re-read: \n  \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nIt says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nBut note: the sequence is for actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the state after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is the state at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). \n\nWait, that doesn't match because the action at turn t1+H-1 would update the position to turn t1+H.\n\nI think there is a discrepancy in the indexing.\n\nLooking back:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0, 9)\"\n\nand then in the answer format, we write actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... until the last action.\n\nBut note: the player update: \n   y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we apply action a_t and then the next state (at turn t+1) is updated.\n\nTherefore, to be at (0,9) at a specific turn T, we must have applied an action at turn T-1 that led to y_T=9.\n\nIn the problem, we start at turn t1=88 at position (0,0). We want to be at (0,9) at turn T. We are free to choose T.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". What is H? It is the number of actions? The length of the sequence.\n\nAnd we require that after the last action (which is at turn t1+H-1) we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H? But the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nLooking at the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nSo the state at the turn immediately after the last action is at turn t1+H-1? That would be inconsistent with the update rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state at the beginning of turn t1 is given, and then we take an action at turn t1, which leads to state at turn t1+1. Then we take an action at turn t1+1, which leads to state at turn t1+2, ... until we take the last action at turn t1+H-1, and then the state at turn t1+H is the result. \n\nBut the problem says: we require y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nThat would mean that at the turn we take the last action (turn t1+H-1) we are already at y=9? Then we don't need to take that last action? Or we take an action at that turn? \n\nWait: the state at turn t is the state at the beginning of the turn? Then we take an action at that turn, and then the state updates for the next turn.\n\nBut the problem says: the initial position is at turn t1: (0, y_{t1}) = (0,0). \n\nSo at the beginning of turn t1, we are at (0,0). Then we choose an action a_{t1}. Then the state at the beginning of turn t1+1 is updated.\n\nTherefore, the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is the state after H-2 actions? \n\nTo clarify:\n\n- At the beginning of turn t1: state is (0,0).\n- We take action a_{t1} -> then at the beginning of turn t1+1, we are at (0, y_{t1+1}).\n- ...\n- We take action a_{t1+H-1} at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 -> then at the beginning of turn t1+H, we are at (0, y_{t1+H}).\n\nBut the problem requires that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). \n\nThat means that we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action (which would be the last action, the (H-1)-th action) at that turn? But then we might move away? \n\nBut the requirement is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So we don't care what happens after? But we want to be at (0,9) at that turn.\n\nSo we must have y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nAnd we take actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2? \n\nBut the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1: so a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}. That is H actions.\n\nBut the state at the beginning of turn t1 is given, and then we take H actions: one at each turn from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThen the state at the beginning of turn t1+H is the state after the last action.\n\nBut we require the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9). \n\nThat is, we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). How did we get there? By the actions taken at turns t1 to t1+H-2.\n\nThen at turn t1+H-1, we take an action (the last one, a_{t1+H-1}) but we don't care about the next state? The problem only says we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo the last action might be taken at turn t1+H-1, but we are already at (0,9) at the beginning of that turn. Then we can do S (stay) to remain at 9? But we are required to be at 9 at the beginning of that turn, so we can do any action? But if we do U, we might go to 10? But y is capped at 9: \n  y_{t+1} = min( max( y_t + Delta, 0 ), 9)\n\nSo at y=9, U and S: remain at 9.\n\nTherefore, we can do S at turn t1+H-1 to stay at 9.\n\nBut the requirement is satisfied as long as at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nSo the minimal H is the minimal number of actions we need to take to first get to y=9 at the beginning of a turn.\n\nWe start at turn t1=88: y=0.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn T (for some T>=t1).\n\nThe minimal T is 88+8 = 96? Because we need at least 8 upward moves to go from 0 to 9. But we can take more turns if we wait.\n\nSo minimal H: the sequence of actions must cover until we first reach y=9 at the beginning of a turn. But note: we can reach earlier if we do only U's? \n\nWith 8 U's: \n  Turn 88: begin at 0 -> take U -> turn 89: at 1.\n  ...\n  Turn 95: begin at 8 -> take U -> turn 96: at 9.\n\nBut we are required to be at 9 at the beginning of turn T. Here at the beginning of turn 96 we are at 9? \n\nWait: at the beginning of turn 88: at 0.\nAfter action at turn 88: at turn 89 we are at 1.\n...\nAfter action at turn 95: at turn 96 we are at 9.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn 96, we are at 9.\n\nTherefore, we need to take actions at turns 88,89,...,95: that is 8 actions? Then H=8, and the turn at which we are at 9 is t1+8 = 96, and we require that at turn t1+H-1 = 88+8-1 = 95 we are at 9? \n\nBut at the beginning of turn 95, we are at 8, not 9.\n\nSo that does not satisfy.\n\nWe must be at 9 at the beginning of turn T. With the above, we are at 9 at the beginning of turn 96. So we require T = 96.\n\nThen the condition is: y_{t1+H-1} = 9 -> 88+H-1 = 96? -> H-1 = 8 -> H=9.\n\nAnd we take 9 actions: from turn 88 to turn 96 (inclusive)? But the last action is at turn 96, and then at the beginning of turn 97 we are at 9? \n\nBut we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn 96? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nI think the problem must mean: we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut in the minimal scenario, we get to 9 at the beginning of turn 96 (which is t1+8). So we require t1+H-1 = 96 -> 88+H-1=96 -> H=9.\n\nThen the sequence of actions is for 9 turns: from turn 88 to 96.\n\nAnd at the beginning of turn 96 (which is the turn we take the last action) we are at 9? \n\nBut in reality, we get to 9 at the beginning of turn 96 only by the action taken at turn 95. Then at turn 96 we are at 9, and we take an action at turn 96? But we are already at 9. So we can take S at turn 96 to stay at 9.\n\nBut the condition is that at the beginning of turn 96 we are at 9. So we are. Then the last action (at turn 96) is taken when we are at 9, and then we update to turn 97: still at 9.\n\nBut the problem only requires that we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 = 88+9-1=96.\n\nSo it is satisfied.\n\nTherefore, in the minimal scenario without obstacles, we would do:\n\n  Turn 88: U -> to y=1 at turn 89.\n  Turn 89: U -> to y=2 at turn 90.\n  Turn 90: U -> to y=3 at turn 91.\n  Turn 91: U -> to y=4 at turn 92.\n  Turn 92: U -> to y=5 at turn 93.\n  Turn 93: U -> to y=6 at turn 94.\n  Turn 94: U -> to y=7 at turn 95.\n  Turn 95: U -> to y=8 at turn 96? \n  Then at the beginning of turn 96: we are at y=8, not 9.\n\nSo we need one more:\n\n  Turn 96: U -> to y=9 at turn 97.\n\nBut then at the beginning of turn 96: we are at 8, not 9. And at the beginning of turn 97: we are at 9.\n\nWe require to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 88+H-1.\n\nSet 88+H-1 = 97 -> H-1=9 -> H=10.\n\nBut that doesn't match our initial thought.\n\nAlternatively, if we do 8 U's starting at turn 88:\n\n  Action at turn 88: U -> turn 89: y=1\n  turn 89: U -> turn 90: y=2\n  turn 90: U -> turn 91: y=3\n  turn 91: U -> turn 92: y=4\n  turn 92: U -> turn 93: y=5\n  turn 93: U -> turn 94: y=6\n  turn 94: U -> turn 95: y=7\n  turn 95: U -> turn 96: y=8 -> not 9.\n\nWe need one more U at turn 96 to get to y=9 at turn 97.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn 97, we need 9 U's: from turn 88 to 96.\n\nThen H=9 actions, and we are at 9 at the beginning of turn 97 = 88+9.\n\nThen we require y_{t1+H-1}=9 -> y_{88+9-1}=y_{96}=9? But we are at 9 at turn 97, not 96.\n\nThis indicates that the indexing in the problem might be that the state after an action is associated with the same turn? But the update rule clearly says y_{t+1}=...\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding.\n\nLet me re-read the problem: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0, 9)\"\n\nand then \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nThis suggests that after taking the sequence of H actions (the last action being at turn t1+H-1), the state at turn t1+H-1 is (0,9).\n\nBut the update rule says that the action at turn t affects the state at turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, if we take an action at turn t, the state at turn t remains unchanged until the action is taken? But the problem says the state at turn t is the state before taking the action? Then after taking the action, we immediately update to the next state? \n\nBut then the state at turn t is the state at the beginning of the turn, and the action taken at turn t updates to the state at the beginning of turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, the state at turn t does not change during the turn.\n\nSo to be at (0,9) at turn T, we must have been moved there by the action taken at turn T-1.\n\nTherefore, we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn T if and only if the action taken at turn T-1 caused us to move to 9.\n\nThe requirement is that at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). That means the action that caused us to be there was taken at turn t1+H-2.\n\nSo we must have a sequence of actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2 that gets us to (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1: that is H actions.\n\nThe last action (at turn t1+H-1) is taken when we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we update to turn t1+H, but we don't care as long as we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo the minimal number of actions is 8 if we can be at 9 at turn 88+8-1=95? That is, at turn 95 we are at 9.\n\nBut to be at 9 at turn 95, we must have gotten there by an action at turn 94.\n\nWith 8 actions: from turn 88 to 95? But then the state at turn 95 is after the action at turn 94. So we need to move from 0 to 9 in 7 steps? Impossible.\n\n Let's count the turns for the state:\n\n  Turn 88: y=0 (given)\n  Turn 89: y = y88 + Delta(a88) -> at least 1.\n  ...\n  Turn 96: after 8 actions: we can be at 8 (if we did 8 U's) or at 9 if we did something else? But we can only move one step per action.\n\n To be at y=9 at turn 96, we need at least 8 upward moves, and we must have taken those moves in the 8 actions from turn 88 to 95, so that at turn 96 we are at 9.\n\n Therefore, we are at 9 at turn 96, which is t1+8.\n\n We require y_{t1+H-1}=9 -> 88+H-1 = 96 -> H-1=8 -> H=9.\n\n So we take 9 actions: from turn 88 to 96.\n\n The state at the beginning of turn 88: y=0.\n After action at turn 88: state at turn 89: y=1.\n ...\n After action at turn 95: state at turn 96: y=8 -> but we want to be at 9 at turn 96.\n\n This doesn't work.\n\n We need to be at 9 at turn 96, so we must have taken an action at turn 95 that moved us from 8 to 9.\n\n Therefore, the state at turn 96 is 9.\n\n But the requirement is for turn t1+H-1 = 88+H-1.\n\n We want 88+H-1 = 96 -> H=9.\n\n So we require that at turn 96 (t1+8) we are at 9.\n\n This means we need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn 96.\n\n How do we achieve that? \n   At turn 95, we are at 8, then we take U at turn 95, and that updates us to 9 at turn 96.\n\n Therefore, the sequence of 9 actions is:\n\n   turn 88: U -> turn 89:1\n   turn 89: U -> turn 90:2\n   turn 90: U -> turn 91:3\n   turn 91: U -> turn 92:4\n   turn 92: U -> turn 93:5\n   turn 93: U -> turn 94:6\n   turn 94: U -> turn 95:7\n   turn 95: U -> turn 96:8 -> wait, this only gets to 8 at turn 96.\n\n I see the mistake: from 0 to 1: 1 step -> turn 89:1.\n from 1 to 2: turn 90:2.\n ...\n from 7 to 8: turn 96:8.\n\n We need an additional step to get from 8 to 9: turn 96: U -> turn 97:9.\n\n So to be at 9 at turn 97, we need 9 U's starting at turn 88, and then at turn 97 we are at 9.\n\n So we require turn 97 = 88+H-1 -> 88+H-1=97 -> H=10.\n\n Therefore, minimal H without obstacles is 10.\n\n But is that minimal? We have to go from 0 to 9, which requires 9 steps upward. And we can do nothing else. So we need 9 actions of U, and that will take us from turn 88 to turn 96 (9 actions) and then at turn 97 we are at 9.\n\n So to be at 9 at turn 97, we require 88+H-1=97 -> H=10.\n\n The sequence would be 10 actions: turns 88 to 97.\n\n But at the beginning of turn 97, we are at 9. The last action (at turn 96) is U, which moved us from 8 to 9.\n\n So the actions are:\n   turn 88: U\n   turn 89: U\n   ...\n   turn 96: U\n\n That's 9 actions? From 88 to 96 inclusive is 9 turns.\n\n Let me count: \n   actions at: 88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96 -> 9 actions.\n\n Then the state at turn 97 is 9.\n\n But the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1=88+9-1=96, we are at 9.\n\n But at turn 96, we are at 8 (because the action at turn 95 moved us to 8 at turn 96, and then at turn 96 we take U to move to 9 at turn 97).\n\n So at the beginning of turn 96, we are at 8.\n\n Therefore, we are not at 9 at turn 96.\n\n This is very confusing.\n\n I think the only logical way is to assume that the state at the turn when we take the action is the state before the action. Then after taking the action, the state for the next turn is updated.\n\n Therefore, to have the state at turn T be 9, we must have taken an action at turn T-1 that moved us to 9.\n\n So for turn T to have y_T=9, we must have done U at turn T-1 when we were at 8.\n\n The earliest we can be at 8 is turn 96 (if we do 8 U's from turn 88 to 95: then at turn 96 we are at 8). Then at turn 96, we do U, and then at turn 97 we are at 9.\n\n Therefore, the earliest turn at which we are at 9 is 97.\n\n So to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we set t1+H-1=97 -> 88+H-1=97 -> H=10.\n\n Then the sequence has 10 actions: from turn 88 to 97.\n\n But the last action (at turn 97) we are at 9 at the beginning of turn 97, and we take an action (say S) to stay at 9 for turn 98, but we only require to be at 9 at turn 97.\n\n So we can do:\n\n   turn 88: U\n   turn 89: U\n   ...\n   turn 96: U  (8 actions so far? Let's count: 88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96 -> that's 9 actions) \n   then at turn 97: we are at 9, and then we do S at turn 97.\n\n So actions: 9 U's and then one S? But that would be 10 actions.\n\n But the 9 U's would get us to 9 at turn 97, and then at turn 97 we do S.\n\n However, we are required to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1=88+H-1.\n\n If H=10, then turn=88+10-1=97. At the beginning of turn 97, we are at 9 (because of the action at turn 96: U from 8 to 9).\n\n So it satisfies.\n\n Therefore, the minimal H without obstacles is 10.\n\n But in the presence of obstacles, we might need to wait sometimes, so H might be greater.\n\n However, in our earlier plan we saw that if we go up continuously, we avoid the obstacles because the dangerous times are at turns 88,90,91,92 for freeways 1-4,5,6,7 respectively, and we are not on those freeways at those turns in a continuous upward move.\n\n Let's simulate the continuous upward move:\n\n   Turn 88: at y=0 (safe) -> action U.\n   Turn 89: at y=1. Is freeway 1 safe at turn 89? We computed freeway 1 only blocked at 88 -> safe.\n   Turn 90: at y=2. Freeway 2: only blocked at 88 -> safe.\n   Turn 91: at y=3. Freeway 3: only at 88 -> safe.\n   Turn 92: at y=4. Freeway 4: only at 88 -> safe.\n   Turn 93: at y=5. Freeway 5: blocked at 90 and 91. Turn 93 is safe.\n   Turn 94: at y=6. Freeway 6: blocked at 90,91 -> safe at 94.\n   Turn 95: at y=7. Freeway 7: blocked at 92. Turn 95 is safe.\n   Turn 96: at y=8. Freeway 8: never blocked -> safe.\n   Turn 97: at y=9. (goal)\n\n So with 9 actions of U (at turns 88 to 96) we get to y=9 at turn 97.\n\n But we need to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1 = 88+H-1.\n\n We want 88+H-1 = 97 -> H=10.\n\n So we need one more action. We can do at turn 97: S (since we are at 9, we can stay).\n\n Therefore, the sequence for 10 actions:\n\n   turn 88: U\n   turn 89: U\n   turn 90: U\n   turn 91: U\n   turn 92: U\n   turn 93: U\n   turn 94: U\n   turn 95: U\n   turn 96: U   -> this gets us to y=9 at turn 97.\n   turn 97: S   -> we are still at 9 at turn 98, but we only care about being at 9 at turn 97.\n\n But wait, the requirement is to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 88+10-1 = 97.\n\n At the beginning of turn 97, we are at 9 (because of the U at turn 96). So we are at 9 at turn 97.\n\n Then the action at turn 97 is taken (S) and we move to turn 98 at 9, but that's beyond the requirement.\n\n So this satisfies.\n\n But is there a shorter sequence? \n\n We are required to make at least 9 upward moves. The minimal number of turns for the state to become 9 is 9 actions of U (covering turns 88 to 96) and then we are at 9 at turn 97. So we need to include turn 97 in our action sequence to have the turn 97 be part of the sequence? \n\n But the requirement is to have the state at turn 88+H-1=97 be 9, and we have that, and we have taken actions from 88 to 97 (10 actions). \n\n However, can we avoid the last action? \n\n The problem requires a sequence of actions of length H, and the state at turn 88+H-1 is 9.\n\n If we only take 9 actions (88 to 96), then the state at turn 88+9-1=96 is 8, not 9.\n\n Therefore, we must take at least 10 actions.\n\n So minimal H is 10.\n\n Now, in the continuous upward move, we avoid all obstacles. So we can use:\n\n   a88 = U\n   a89 = U\n   a90 = U\n   a91 = U\n   a92 = U\n   a93 = U\n   a94 = U\n   a95 = U\n   a96 = U\n   a97 = S   (or U, but at 9, U does nothing)\n\n But note: at turn 97, we are at 9, so we can do S.\n\n But is there a problem? Let me double-check the moves:\n\n   turn 88: start at y=0 -> U -> turn 89: y=1.\n   turn 89: at y=1 -> U -> turn 90: y=2.\n   turn 90: at y=2 -> U -> turn 91: y=3.\n   turn 91: at y=3 -> U -> turn 92: y=4.\n   turn 92: at y=4 -> U -> turn 93: y=5.\n   turn 93: at y=5 -> U -> turn 94: y=6.\n   turn 94: at y=6 -> U -> turn 95: y=7.\n   turn 95: at y=7 -> U -> turn 96: y=8.\n   turn 96: at y=8 -> U -> turn 97: y=9.\n   turn 97: at y=9 -> S -> turn 98: y=9.\n\n At turn 89: y=1 -> freeway 1: not blocked at 89 (only 88) -> safe.\n At turn 90: y=2 -> freeway 2: only blocked at 88 -> safe.\n At turn 91: y=3 -> freeway 3: only at 88 -> safe.\n At turn 92: y=4 -> freeway 4: only at 88 -> safe.\n At turn 93: y=5 -> freeway 5: blocked at 90,91 -> 93 is safe.\n At turn 94: y=6 -> freeway 6: blocked at 90,91 -> 94 safe.\n At turn 95: y=7 -> freeway 7: blocked at 92 -> 95 safe.\n At turn 96: y=8 -> freeway 8: never blocked -> safe.\n At turn 97: y=9 -> safe.\n\n So the entire path is safe.\n\n Therefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\n But can we do it in 10 actions? We did: 9 U's and 1 S, total 10 actions.\n\n However, note that at turn 97, we are already at 9, and we are required to be at 9 at turn 97, so we could do any action? But we did S. \n\n But is there a way to do it in 9 actions? Only if we can be at 9 at turn 96 (88+9-1=96). \n\n That would require that at turn 96 we are at 9. To be at 9 at turn 96, we must have been at 8 at turn 95 and done U at turn 95. \n\n But to be at 8 at turn 95, we would need to have done 8 U's in the first 8 actions (turns 88 to 95). \n\n Then the state at the turns:\n\n   turn 88:0 -> after action U at 88: turn 89:1\n   ...\n   turn 95: after action at turn 94: at turn 95:8 -> then at turn 95 we do U: -> turn 96:9.\n\n So then at turn 96: we are at 9.\n\n Then the sequence has 9 actions: turns 88 to 96.\n\n Then H=9, and we are at 9 at turn 88+9-1=96.\n\n This is better! \n\n Why didn't I see that? \n\n In this plan, we are at 9 at turn 96, and we only used 9 actions.\n\n Let me verify the obstacle avoidance with this timing:\n\n   turn 88: start at 0, action U -> at turn 89: y=1.  [freeway 1: safe at 89]\n   turn 89: U -> turn 90: y=2. [freeway 2: safe at 90? But freeway 2 is only blocked at 88 -> safe]\n   turn 90: U -> turn 91: y=3. [freeway 3: safe (only 88)]\n   turn 91: U -> turn 92: y=4. [freeway 4: safe (only 88)]\n   turn 92: U -> turn 93: y=5. [freeway 5: blocked at 90,91 -> 93 is safe]\n   turn 93: U -> turn 94: y=6. [freeway 6: blocked at 90,91 -> 94 safe]\n   turn 94: U -> turn 95: y=7. [freeway 7: blocked at 92 -> 95 safe?]\n        freeway 7 is blocked at 92: so at turn 95, is freeway 7 safe? \n        We computed freeway 7 is blocked only at turn 92 -> safe at 95.\n   turn 95: U -> turn 96: y=8. [freeway 8: safe]\n   turn 96: we are at y=8 at the beginning of turn 96, then we do U -> turn 97: y=9.\n\n But wait, we require to be at y=9 at turn 96? We are at 8 at the beginning of turn 96, and after the action U at turn 96, we are at 9 at turn 97.\n\n So at the beginning of turn 96, we are at 8, not 9.\n\n Therefore, we are not at 9 at turn 96.\n\n So this plan has only 9 actions, but we are at 9 at turn 97, not 96.\n\n To be at 9 at turn 96, we must have been at 8 at turn 95 and then done nothing? But we have to do U to get to 9.\n\n Or if we are at 9 at turn 95, then we could stay, but we can't be at 9 at turn 95 because that would require 9 upward moves in 7 actions (from turn 88 to 94) -> impossible.\n\n Therefore, it is impossible to be at 9 at turn 96.\n\n The earliest we can be at 9 is turn 97.\n\n So we must have H such that 88+H-1>=97 -> H>=10.\n\n Therefore, minimal H is 10.\n\n And the plan with 10 actions: 9 U's and 1 S (at the end) works.\n\n But note: the last action (at turn 97) can be anything because we are already at 9. We choose S.\n\n Now, is there any possibility to do it in 10 actions but avoid the obstacles with a different timing? \n\n In this plan, we are safe. \n\n However, let me check freeway 7 at turn 95: \n   We are at y=7 at turn 95. Freeway 7 is only blocked at turn 92 -> safe.\n\n So the plan is safe.\n\n Therefore, the answer is:\n\n Turn t1: U   (at turn 88)\n Turn t1+1: U (89)\n Turn t1+2: U (90)\n Turn t1+3: U (91)\n Turn t1+4: U (92)\n Turn t1+5: U (93)\n Turn t1+6: U (94)\n Turn t1+7: U (95)\n Turn t1+8: U (96)   -> at turn 97: at 9.\n Turn t1+9: S (97)   -> we are at 9 at turn 97, and then we stay.\n\n But the last action is at turn 97, and we are at 9 at the beginning of turn 97 (before the action). Then we do S, and we are at 9 at turn 98.\n\n The requirement is to be at 9 at turn 88+10-1=97.\n\n At the beginning of turn 97, we are at 9 (because of the action at turn 96: U from 8 to 9). \n Then we do action S at turn 97, but that doesn't change the fact that at the beginning of turn 97 we are at 9.\n\n Therefore, it satisfies.\n\n So the sequence is:\n\n   Turn 88: U\n   Turn 89: U\n   Turn 90: U\n   Turn 91: U\n   Turn 92: U\n   Turn 93: U\n   Turn 94: U\n   Turn 95: U\n   Turn 96: U\n   Turn 97: S\n\n But wait, the actions are for turns 88 to 97, which is 10 actions.\n\n However, note that after the action at turn 97, we are at turn 98. But we don't care.\n\n We only require to be at 9 at turn 97.\n\n This is valid.\n\n But is there a shorter sequence? We argued that we need at least 10 actions.\n\n However, let me see if we can do it without the last S. \n\n The problem requires a sequence of actions that gets us to 9 at turn 97. The action at turn 97 is not necessary for being at 9 at turn 97, but the requirement is to output a sequence of exactly H actions, and we set H=10.\n\n But can we set H=9? Then we would only output actions for turns 88 to 96, and then at turn 97 we are at 9, but the requirement is for the state at turn 88+9-1=96 to be 9. But at turn 96 we are at 8.\n\n Therefore, we cannot.\n\n So the minimal H is 10.\n\n But note: in the action at turn 97, we are already at 9, so we could output an action that is not necessary, but it's required to output a sequence of H actions.\n\n We could perhaps not move on the last action? But we have to output an action for turn 97.\n\n Alternatively, can we reach 9 earlier by moving faster? No, because we can only move one step per turn.\n\n Or by waiting sometimes and then moving? That might allow us to be at 9 at an earlier turn? \n\n For example, if we could be at 9 at turn 96, then we would only need 9 actions. But we saw that is impossible.\n\n Or at turn 97 with 9 actions? Only if we are at 9 at turn 97 after 9 actions, but then the state at turn 96 (which is the last state of the sequence) is 8, not 9.\n\n Therefore, we must have H=10.\n\n But is there a way to be at 9 at turn 97 with only 9 actions? That would require that the 9 actions are the moves that get us to 9 at turn 97. But then the state at turn 96 (after 8 actions) is 8, and then the 9th action (at turn 96) is U. So at turn 97: 9.\n\n Then the sequence of 9 actions: turns 88 to 96. The state at turn 88+9-1=96 is 8, not 9.\n\n So it doesn't satisfy.\n\n Therefore, we must have the 10th action to \"cover\" turn 97.\n\n So the answer is the 10-action sequence above.\n\n But note: we could do the action at turn 97 as U or D? But at y=9, U and D are clamped. \n\n Since we are at 9, if we do U or D, we stay at 9. So we can do U as well.\n\n But S is also valid.\n\n We'll do S for clarity.\n\n Therefore, the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 88: U\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: U\nTurn 93: U\nTurn 94: U\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: U\nTurn 97: S\n}\n\n But the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\n So we write:\n\nTurn 88: U\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: U\nTurn 93: U\nTurn 94: U\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: U\nTurn 97: S\n\nBut is this the minimal? We could try to see if we can do it in 10 actions but with some waiting to avoid obstacles? But in this plan we avoided obstacles, so it's safe.\n\nWhat if there is a problem at turn 92? We are at y=4 at turn 92. Freeway 4 is only blocked at turn 88 -> safe.\n\nBut what about freeway 7 at turn 95: we are at y=7. We said freeway 7 is blocked at turn 92 -> safe.\n\nAnd freeway 5 and 6 at turns 90 and 91: we are at y=2 at turn 90 and y=3 at turn 91, not at y=5 or 6.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\n Therefore, this is a valid plan.\n\n But is there a plan with H=10 that is not this? For example, could we wait at some turn to have a shorter overall time? But we are already at 9 at turn 97, and we need to be at 9 at turn 97, so we cannot be there earlier.\n\n So this is minimal.\n\n However, note that we could possibly use a different route that takes the same or less time? For example, going up then down then up? But that would take more actions.\n\n So we believe the continuous upward move is optimal.\n\n Final answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 88: U\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: U\nTurn 93: U\nTurn 94: U\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: U\nTurn 97: S\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=10.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10 but with a different sequence that arrives at 9 at an earlier turn? No, because we cannot be at 9 before turn 97.\n\n Therefore, we output the above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 88\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 10. The sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 88, the player is at \\((0, 0)\\). Moving up (U) avoids collisions as \\(y = 0\\) has no cars, and the move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 89 is safe since freeway 1 is only blocked at turn 88.\n- At turn 89, moving up (U) to \\(y = 2\\) is safe as freeway 2 is only blocked at turn 88.\n- At turn 90, moving up (U) to \\(y = 3\\) is safe as freeway 3 is only blocked at turn 88.\n- At turn 91, moving up (U) to \\(y = 4\\) is safe as freeway 4 is only blocked at turn 88.\n- At turn 92, moving up (U) to \\(y = 5\\) is safe as freeway 5 is blocked at turns 90 and 91, but not at turn 93 (player is at \\(y = 5\\) at turn 93).\n- At turn 93, moving up (U) to \\(y = 6\\) is safe as freeway 6 is blocked at turns 90 and 91, but not at turn 94 (player is at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 94).\n- At turn 94, moving up (U) to \\(y = 7\\) is safe as freeway 7 is blocked at turn 92, but not at turn 95 (player is at \\(y = 7\\) at turn 95).\n- At turn 95, moving up (U) to \\(y = 8\\) is safe as freeway 8 is never blocked.\n- At turn 96, moving up (U) to \\(y = 9\\) reaches the goal at turn 97.\n- At turn 97, staying (S) is chosen as the player is already at \\(y = 9\\), satisfying the condition of being at \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 97 (since \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 88 + 10 - 1 = 97\\)).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) in the minimal \\(H = 10\\) turns, avoiding all car collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 88\\!: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 89\\!: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 90\\!: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 91\\!: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 92\\!: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 93\\!: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 94\\!: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 95\\!: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 96\\!: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 97\\!: \\text{ S}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 92, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe player moves in the y-direction only (vertical). The grid has y from 0 to 9. At each turn, the player can choose to move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: y remains). The player cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway k (which is the y-coordinate at that turn) and there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nImportant: when the player moves from y to y' at turn T, at the moment of turn T, the player is still on y (so we check freeway y for collision at turn T). Then at the next turn (T+1), the player will be on y' and we check freeway y' at turn T+1.\n\nGiven the car update rules:\n\nFor a car on freeway i (which we note is fixed for that car) at turn t1 (current turn) with head h, tail tau, direction d, and speed s:\n\n- If the car is left-moving (d = left), then at turn T (>=t1), the span becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n- If the car is right-moving (d = right), then at turn T, the span becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the problem states:\n  Left-moving: Span(t1)=[h, tau] -> Span(T)=[h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  Right-moving: Span(t1)=[tau, h] -> Span(T)=[tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nWait, for right-moving, the initial span is given as (head h, tail tau) but then it says \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\". This implies that for a right-moving car, the head is the larger coordinate? Actually, the problem says: for right-moving, the span is [tau, h] meaning from tail (smaller) to head (larger). Similarly, for left-moving, it's [h, tau] but note that if the car is moving left, then the head would be at the left (so a larger x at t1) and then decreases? Actually, let's clarify:\n\nIn the problem, the initial state for a car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nFor a right-moving car, the head is the front of the car (which is at the rightmost position) and the tail is the rear (leftmost). So at time t1, the car spans from tail (left) to head (right): [tail, head]. Then at time T, it moves right: tail_new = tail + s*(T-t1), head_new = head + s*(T-t1). So the span becomes [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car, the head is the front (leftmost) and the tail is the rear (rightmost). But note the problem says: \"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" meaning from head (left) to tail (right). Then at time T, it moves left: head_new = head - s*(T-t1), tail_new = tau - s*(T-t1). So the span becomes [head - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: the problem states the initial state as (head, tail) without specifying which is left/right. However, from the update, we can deduce:\n\n- For right-moving: the head is the right end and tail is the left end. So at t1: [tail, head] (and as time increases, the entire car moves right).\n- For left-moving: the head is the left end and tail is the right end. So at t1: [head, tail] (and as time increases, the entire car moves left).\n\nHowever, in the given data, all cars are right-moving. So we only need to handle right-moving cars.\n\nGiven:\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24) -> This is a right-moving car. But note: if it's right-moving, then the head should be the right end and tail the left. But here head=-48 and tail=-71. Since -48 > -71, that makes sense: the car spans from -71 (left) to -48 (right). So at time T, the car will be at [ -71 + 24*(T-92), -48 + 24*(T-92) ].\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-48, -83, right, 36) -> [ -83 + 36*(T-92), -48 + 36*(T-92) ]\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same as 2.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: \n   (48, 37, right, 6) -> head=48, tail=37? But 48>37, so it's [37,48] at t1. Then at T: [37+6*(T-92), 48+6*(T-92)]\n   (12,1,right,6) -> [1+6*(T-92), 12+6*(T-92)]\n   (-24,-35,right,6) -> [-35+6*(T-92), -24+6*(T-92)]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5.\n\nFreeway 7: (48,37,right,12) -> [37+12*(T-92), 48+12*(T-92)]\n\nFreeway 8: (48,37,right,4) -> [37+4*(T-92), 48+4*(T-92)]\n\nOur goal: we start at turn 92 at y=0. We must avoid freeways 1 to 8 when we are on them and at that turn, the car's span covers 0.\n\nWe are allowed to change y only by one per turn (or stay). We must reach y=9.\n\nNote: the player starts at y=0 (which is the bottom, and not a freeway with cars). The freeways are y=1 to y=8. So when we are on y=0 or y=9, we don't have to worry about cars. However, we start at y=0 and we need to end at y=9.\n\nWe must plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) that moves the player from y=0 to y=9 in minimal turns without colliding.\n\nSince we can only move one step at a time, the minimal number of turns without any obstacles would be 9 (if we move up 9 times). But we have obstacles (cars) on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe need to simulate the movement and check for collisions at each turn.\n\nWe are at turn 92 at y=0.\n\nWe are going to consider turns: 92, 93, 94, ... until we get to y=9.\n\nAt each turn T (starting at T=92), the player is at a y-coordinate. Then we choose an action (U, D, S) that leads to the next y.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k (from 1 to 8) at turn T if at that turn, there is a car on freeway k such that 0 is in the car's span.\n\nSince we are at (0, y) at turn T, we check freeway k = y (if y is between 1 and 8) and then check each car on that freeway: if 0 is in [L(T), R(T)] for that car, then collision.\n\nHow to compute the car's span at turn T for a car given at t1=92?\n\nFor a car on freeway k, with (h, tau, d, s) at t1=92, then at turn T:\n  if d = right: L(T) = tau + s*(T-92), R(T) = h + s*(T-92)\n\nWe need to check for each freeway k we step on, at the turn we are on that freeway, that 0 is not in any of the car spans on that freeway.\n\nWe can try to move as fast as possible (always up) and see if we can avoid collisions. But we might have to wait (stay) or even move down to avoid a collision.\n\nWe'll compute the positions of the cars at each turn for the freeways we care about.\n\nBut note: the cars move continuously and we are only concerned when we are on a freeway at a particular turn.\n\nWe are going to simulate turn by turn.\n\nLet T0 = 92.\n\nWe start at y0 = 0 (turn 92).\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions.\n\nWe are going to try to find the minimal H. Since we must go from 0 to 9, the minimal H without obstacles is 9. But obstacles might force us to take more turns (by staying or moving down).\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) over states (turn, y) but note that the turn can be arbitrarily large? However, we can bound the turn because the cars are moving and eventually the cars will pass and we can always wait until they pass.\n\nBut note: we want minimal H, so we are looking for the shortest path.\n\nThe state is (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at 92) and y is the current position (0..9). We start at (92,0) and we want to reach (t,9) for some t.\n\nThe actions: U, D, S. But note that we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe also have to check the collision condition: at state (t, y), if y is between 1 and 8, then we must check that at turn t, on freeway y, no car has a span that includes 0.\n\nHow to check for a given (t, y): we look at the car list for freeway y and for each car, compute the span at turn t.\n\nThen we check if 0 is in [L, R] for that car.\n\nWe'll simulate from turn 92 onward.\n\nWe note that the cars move linearly and periodically? Actually, the spans are linear in time.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k and for each car on k, the times when the car covers 0? But note multiple cars per freeway (like freeway 5 and 6 have three cars). And we need to avoid if any car covers 0 at the turn we are on that freeway.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute for each freeway k, the set of turns T (>=92) for which 0 is covered by a car on freeway k. Then we know that we cannot be on freeway k at turn T.\n\nBut note: the cars are moving continuously, so the intervals of danger on a freeway might be periodic? Actually, for a fixed freeway, each car produces a time interval during which 0 is in its span.\n\nBut the cars might have different speeds and initial positions.\n\nLet's compute for each freeway the dangerous turns.\n\nWe'll define for freeway k, the set of turns T (>=92) such that at least one car on k has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nBut note: the cars on a freeway are independent. So we can compute the union of the dangerous intervals for the cars on that freeway.\n\nHow to compute for one car (right-moving) with tail tau, head h, speed s:\n\nAt turn T, the car spans [L, R] = [tau + s*(T-92), h + s*(T-92)]\n\nWe require L <= 0 <= R.\n\nSo: tau + s*(T-92) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-92)\n\nSolve for T:\n\nFrom the first inequality: T >= ( -tau ) / s + 92   [if s>0, which it is]\n\nBut note: tau is negative? In our data, for freeway1: tau=-71, so -tau=71.\n\nSimilarly, from the second: T <= ( -h ) / s + 92? Actually:\n\n0 <= h + s*(T-92)  => s*(T-92) >= -h  => T-92 >= -h/s  => T >= 92 - h/s\n\nBut note: h is negative? For freeway1: h=-48, so -h=48.\n\nBut let's write:\n\nCondition 1: tau + s*(T-92) <= 0  => T-92 <= -tau/s  => T <= 92 - tau/s\n\nCondition 2: h + s*(T-92) >= 0  => T-92 >= -h/s  => T >= 92 - h/s\n\nSo the dangerous interval for one car is:\n\n  T in [ ceil(92 - h/s), floor(92 - tau/s) ]\n\nBut note: since T is integer, we need to take the integer T that satisfy:\n\n  T_min = ceil(92 - h/s)\n  T_max = floor(92 - tau/s)\n\nThen if T_min <= T_max, then T in [T_min, T_max] is dangerous.\n\nBut note: we must be cautious because of the inequalities.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the exact interval:\n\nWe have:\n   tau + s*(T-92) <= 0   -> T <= 92 - tau/s\n   h + s*(T-92) >= 0    -> T >= 92 - h/s\n\nSo the real interval is [92 - h/s, 92 - tau/s]. Then the integer T in [ceil(92 - h/s), floor(92 - tau/s)].\n\nBut note: since the car moves continuously, the interval of T is continuous, but T is integer.\n\nExample: freeway1 car: h=-48, tau=-71, s=24.\n\nThen:\n  T_min = ceil(92 - (-48)/24) = ceil(92 + 48/24) = ceil(92+2)=94\n  T_max = floor(92 - (-71)/24) = floor(92 + 71/24) = 92 + 2.958... -> floor(94.958)=94\n\nSo T_min=94, T_max=94 -> only T=94 is dangerous for freeway1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2: h=-48, tau=-83, s=36.\n  T_min = ceil(92 - (-48)/36) = ceil(92 + 48/36) = ceil(92 + 1.333) = 93.333 -> ceil=94\n  T_max = floor(92 - (-83)/36) = floor(92 + 83/36) = 92 + 2.3055 -> 94.3055 -> floor=94\n  So T=94.\n\nFreeway3: same as 2 -> T=94.\n\nFreeway4: same as 2 -> T=94.\n\nFreeway5: three cars.\n\nCar1: (48,37,right,6): h=48, tau=37, s=6.\n  T_min = ceil(92 - 48/6) = ceil(92-8)=84 -> but we start at 92, so we consider T>=92. Since 84<92, we take T_min=92.\n  T_max = floor(92 - 37/6) = floor(92 - 6.166) = floor(85.833)=85 -> but 85<92? Then the interval [84,85] is before 92 -> not dangerous at T>=92.\n\nCar2: (12,1,right,6): h=12, tau=1, s=6.\n  T_min = ceil(92 - 12/6)=ceil(92-2)=90 -> but we start at 92, so we take 92? Actually, the condition T_min=90, but we are only concerned T>=92. Then we need to check: \n      Condition: T>=92 and T>=90 -> T>=92, and T<= floor(92-1/6)=floor(91.833)=91 -> so no T>=92 satisfies? \n      Actually: T_min = ceil(92 - h/s) = ceil(92-12/6)=ceil(90)=90\n      T_max = floor(92 - tau/s)=floor(92-1/6)=91.833 -> 91\n      So the interval is [90,91]. Since we start at 92, no danger.\n\nCar3: (-24,-35,right,6): h=-24, tau=-35, s=6.\n  T_min = ceil(92 - (-24)/6)=ceil(92+4)=96\n  T_max = floor(92 - (-35)/6)=floor(92+35/6)=floor(92+5.833)=97.833 -> 97\n  So interval [96,97]. So T=96 and 97.\n\nTherefore, freeway5 is dangerous at T=96 and T=97.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6: same as freeway5 -> dangerous at T=96,97.\n\nFreeway7: (48,37,right,12): \n  Car1: T_min = ceil(92-48/12)=ceil(92-4)=88 -> then T_max=floor(92-37/12)=floor(92-3.083)=88.916 -> 88 -> so interval [88,88] -> T=88, which is before 92 -> safe.\n\nFreeway8: (48,37,right,4):\n  Car1: T_min = ceil(92-48/4)=ceil(92-12)=80 -> T_max=floor(92-37/4)=floor(92-9.25)=82.75 ->82 -> so before 92 -> safe.\n\nBut wait: freeway7 has only one car? And freeway8 one car? And they are safe for T>=92.\n\nBut note: freeway5 and 6 have three cars: we found only the third car is dangerous at T=96,97.\n\nSo to summarize the dangerous turns for each freeway:\n\nFreeway1: T=94\nFreeway2: T=94\nFreeway3: T=94\nFreeway4: T=94\nFreeway5: T=96,97\nFreeway6: T=96,97\nFreeway7: safe for T>=92\nFreeway8: safe for T>=92\n\nSo we must avoid:\n  Being on freeway1,2,3,4 at turn 94.\n  Being on freeway5,6 at turns 96 and 97.\n\nNow, we start at turn 92 at y=0.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nWe can simulate:\n\nWe must avoid:\n  At turn 94: cannot be on freeways 1,2,3,4 -> so if we are at y=1,2,3,4 at turn 94, we collide.\n\n  At turn 96 and 97: cannot be on freeways 5,6 -> so if we are at y=5 or 6 at turn 96 or 97, we collide.\n\nWe have to plan a path that in 9 moves (minimal) would be:\n\nTurn 92: start at y=0 -> action U: y=1 at turn 93? \nWait: note the state transition:\n\nAt turn 92: we are at y0=0. We choose an action for turn 92. Then at the end of turn 92, we update the position and the cars move? But the collision condition is at the turn: when we are at turn T, we are at y_T and we check the cars at turn T.\n\nSo:\n\nAt turn 92: we are at y=0 -> no collision (since freeways start at 1). We choose an action a92.\n\nThen at turn 93: we are at y93 = y92 + delta(a92). And we check collision at turn 93: if y93 is between 1 and 8, then we check the cars on that freeway at turn 93.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 94: we are at y94 and check collision.\n\nWe want to avoid:\n  At turn 94: being in y=1,2,3,4.\n  At turn 96: being in y=5,6.\n  At turn 97: being in y=5,6.\n\nWe also have to avoid collisions at other turns.\n\nBut note: freeways 1-4 are only dangerous at turn 94? Actually, we computed that freeway1 is only dangerous at T=94. Similarly for 2,3,4. But what about other turns? For freeway1, we computed only T=94 is dangerous. Similarly for freeway5 and 6, only T=96 and 97.\n\nBut freeways 7 and 8 are safe.\n\nSo the only dangerous turns are 94 (for freeways 1-4) and 96,97 (for freeways 5-6). At other turns, we can be on any freeway without danger? Yes, because we computed that only those turns are dangerous.\n\nBut wait: we must check if there are multiple dangerous intervals? For example, freeway5: we only found T=96,97. But what about later? The cars are moving, so after T=97, the car that caused the danger at 96,97 (the third car) will have moved beyond 0? And then it might come back? But note the cars are moving continuously and linearly. The car at freeway5, third car: at T=96: \n   L = -35 + 6*(96-92) = -35 + 6*4 = -35+24 = -11\n   R = -24 + 6*4 = 0 -> so at T=96, the car covers [-11,0] -> so 0 is at the right edge? But note: the condition is L<=0<=R: -11<=0<=0 -> true? Actually, at T=96: R=0, so 0 is included.\n\nAt T=97: \n   L = -35 + 6*5 = -35+30=-5\n   R = -24+30=6 -> so 0 is in [-5,6] -> included.\n\nAt T=98: \n   L = -35+6*6 = -35+36=1\n   R = -24+36=12 -> 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, the other cars on freeway5 were safe for T>=92.\n\nSo indeed, only T=96 and 97 are dangerous for freeway5 and 6.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway1: at T=94: \n   L = -71 + 24*(94-92) = -71+48 = -23\n   R = -48+48=0 -> so 0 is included.\n\nAt T=95: \n   L = -71+24*3 = -71+72=1\n   R = -48+72=24 -> 0 not included.\n\nSo only T=94.\n\nNow, we plan:\n\nWe start at turn92: y=0.\n\nWe must avoid being on y=1,2,3,4 at turn94.\nWe must avoid being on y=5,6 at turn96 and turn97.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nLet me try a minimal path: 9 moves (all up) would get us to y=9 at turn101? \n\nWait: \n  turn92: start at y0=0 -> we choose an action for turn92. Then at turn93, we move to y1 = y0 + delta(a92).\n\nTo get to y=9 in 9 moves, we must leave 0 at turn92 and then 9 moves up: so we would be at:\n\nturn92: y=0 (after action, we are still at 0 for the collision check? Actually, at turn92 we are at y=0 and we choose an action. Then at turn93, we are at the new y.\n\nSo if we do 9 consecutive U:\n\n  turn92: at y=0 -> no collision. Action: U -> then at turn93: y=1.\n  turn93: at y=1 -> check freeway1 at turn93: is it dangerous? We computed that freeway1 is dangerous only at turn94. So at turn93, freeway1 is safe? \n        For freeway1 at turn93: \n          L = -71 + 24*(93-92)= -71+24=-47\n          R = -48+24=-24 -> 0 is not in [-47,-24] -> safe.\n\n  turn93: action U -> turn94: y=2.\n  turn94: at y=2 -> freeway2. But freeway2 is dangerous at turn94: we computed T=94 for freeway2 -> so collision? \n        Check: freeway2 car: h=-48, tau=-83, s=36.\n        At T=94: L = -83+36*2 = -83+72=-11, R=-48+72=24 -> 0 is in [-11,24] -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=2 at turn94.\n\nThus the direct 9-move plan fails.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeways 1-4 at turn94. So at turn94, we must be at y=0 or y>=5.\n\nSimilarly, at turn96 and 97, we must avoid y=5,6 -> so we must be at y<5 or y>6.\n\nWe have to plan the sequence.\n\nWe start at y=0 at turn92.\n\nWe can consider:\n\nOption: stay at y=0 for some turns? Or move down? But we are at 0, we cannot go below 0.\n\nWe must move up eventually.\n\nWe can try:\n\nAt turn92: we are at y=0. We can choose to stay (S) or go up (U).\n\nIf we go up at turn92: then at turn93, we are at y=1.\n\nAt turn93: we can choose to go up again: then at turn94 we are at y=2 -> collision (as above) -> not allowed.\n\nAt turn93: we can choose to stay: then at turn94 we are at y=1 -> freeway1 at turn94: dangerous? \n        Freeway1 at turn94: as above, 0 in the car span -> collision.\n\nAt turn93: we can choose to go down: then at turn94 we are at y=0 -> safe (since y=0 not a freeway).\n\nSo one possibility:\n\n  turn92: U -> to y=1 at turn93.\n  turn93: D -> back to y=0 at turn94.\n\nBut then we are at y=0 at turn94. Then we have to start again.\n\nWe can then at turn94: U -> to y=1 at turn95.\n\nAt turn95: we can go to y=2? \n        Check freeway2 at turn95: \n          freeway2: at T=95: L = -83+36*(95-92)= -83+108=25, R=-48+108=60 -> 0 not in [25,60] -> safe.\n        So we can go to y=2 at turn95.\n\nThen we can go to y=3 at turn96? \n        But turn96: we must avoid freeways 5,6 -> but we are at y=3 -> freeway3. \n        Check freeway3: we computed only dangerous at T=94 -> so at turn96, freeway3 is safe? \n        Compute: freeway3: same as freeway2: at T=96: \n            L = -83+36*(96-92)= -83+144=61, R=-48+144=96 -> safe.\n\nBut wait, we are at turn96: we are at y=3 -> freeway3. But we only computed freeway3 dangerous at T=94? Yes, so safe.\n\nThen at turn96: we are at y=3. We can go up to y=4 at turn97.\n\nAt turn97: we are at y=4 -> freeway4. \n        freeway4: same as freeway2: at T=97: \n            L = -83+36*5= -83+180=97, R=-48+180=132 -> safe.\n\nThen we can continue: \n  turn97: U -> y=5 at turn98.\n        But at turn98: freeway5 -> we computed dangerous only at T=96,97 -> so at T=98, safe? \n        Check freeway5: third car: at T=98: L = -35+6*(98-92)= -35+36=1, R=-24+36=12 -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nThen we can go to y=6 at turn99, then y=7 at turn100, y=8 at turn101, y=9 at turn102.\n\nBut we must check each freeway we step on at the turn we are on.\n\nSo let's list:\n\nTurn92: y=0 -> safe.\n  Action: U -> then at turn93: y=1.\n\nTurn93: y=1 -> freeway1. Check freeway1 at turn93: \n        L = -71+24*(93-92)= -71+24=-47, R=-48+24=-24 -> 0 not in [-47,-24] -> safe.\n  Action: D -> then at turn94: y=0.\n\nTurn94: y=0 -> safe.\n  Action: U -> then at turn95: y=1.\n\nTurn95: y=1 -> freeway1. Check at turn95: \n        L = -71+24*3 = -71+72=1, R=-48+72=24 -> 0 not in [1,24] -> safe.\n  Action: U -> then at turn96: y=2.\n\nTurn96: y=2 -> freeway2. Check at turn96: \n        L = -83+36*(96-92)= -83+144=61, R=-48+144=96 -> safe (0 not in [61,96]).\n  Action: U -> then at turn97: y=3.\n\nTurn97: y=3 -> freeway3. Check at turn97: \n        L = -83+36*5 = -83+180=97, R=-48+180=132 -> safe.\n  Action: U -> then at turn98: y=4.\n\nTurn98: y=4 -> freeway4. Check at turn98: \n        L = -83+36*6= -83+216=133, R=-48+216=168 -> safe.\n  Action: U -> then at turn99: y=5.\n\nTurn99: y=5 -> freeway5. Check at turn99: \n        We computed freeway5 dangerous at 96,97 -> safe at 99? \n        We can compute: \n          Car3: at T=99: L = -35+6*(99-92)= -35+42=7, R=-24+42=18 -> 0 not in [7,18] -> safe.\n        Also check other cars? \n          Car1: at T=99: L=37+6*(7)=37+42=79, R=48+42=90 -> safe.\n          Car2: L=1+42=43, R=12+42=54 -> safe.\n        So safe.\n  Action: U -> then at turn100: y=6.\n\nTurn100: y=6 -> freeway6. Check at turn100: \n        Same as freeway5? Actually, freeway6 has the same cars as freeway5? \n        Yes, the data for freeway6 is same as freeway5: three cars with same parameters.\n        So at T=100: \n          Car3: L=-35+6*8= -35+48=13, R=-24+48=24 -> safe.\n        So safe.\n  Action: U -> then at turn101: y=7.\n\nTurn101: y=7 -> freeway7. We computed freeway7 safe for T>=92? \n        Check: the car on freeway7: (48,37,right,12) at T=101:\n          L = 37+12*(101-92)=37+108=145, R=48+108=156 -> safe.\n  Action: U -> then at turn102: y=8.\n\nTurn102: y=8 -> freeway8: \n        Car: (48,37,right,4) at T=102:\n          L = 37+4*10=37+40=77, R=48+40=88 -> safe.\n  Action: U -> then at turn103: y=9 -> goal.\n\nBut wait, we reached y=9 at turn103? Actually, after the last action at turn102 (U), we are at y=9 at turn103. But we are required to be at (0,9) at the last turn. So we are at turn103: y=9 -> goal.\n\nBut the sequence of actions: we started at turn92 and did actions until turn102 (11 actions) and reached at turn103.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" such that after H actions, we are at y=9. \n\nWe take H actions: from t=0 to t=H-1. Then the last state is at turn t1 + H.\n\nWe started at turn t1=92. After H actions, we are at turn 92+H.\n\nWe require that at turn 92+H, we are at y=9.\n\nIn our plan: \n  We did 11 actions: from turn92 to turn102 (inclusive) -> H=11.\n  Then at turn92+11 = 103, we are at y=9.\n\nBut we want minimal H. Is there a shorter path?\n\nWe did 11 moves. The minimal without obstacles is 9. But we had to go down once and then go up, so that added two moves? Actually, we did one down and then continued up. But we also had to wait at y=0 for one turn? Actually, we were at y=0 at turn94 and then started moving up.\n\nBut note: we did:\n\n  turn92: U -> y=1 at turn93.\n  turn93: D -> y=0 at turn94.\n  turn94: U -> y=1 at turn95.\n\nSo we wasted two moves (U then D) to avoid the collision at turn94.\n\nCan we do better?\n\nAlternative: at turn92: stay at y=0. Then at turn93: still at y=0.\n\nThen at turn93: U -> to y=1 at turn94. But at turn94: y=1 -> freeway1 -> dangerous? Yes, because freeway1 at turn94: 0 in the span -> collision.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nAt turn92: U to y=1 at turn93.\nAt turn93: stay at y=1. Then at turn94: still at y=1 -> collision.\n\nSo we must not be at y=1 at turn94 either.\n\nTherefore, the only safe option at turn94 is to be at y=0 or y>=5.\n\nBut we start at y=0. To get to y>=5 by turn94, we need to move up 5 times in 2 moves? Impossible.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 at turn94.\n\nThen we have to start moving up after turn94.\n\nWe already did that and it took 11 moves.\n\nBut wait, after turn94, we are at y=0. Then we have 9 moves to go up? So that would be 9 moves, total turns: from turn94 to turn94+9=103? But we start moving at turn94: then at turn94: we are at y=0, then we do 9 moves: \n  turn94: U -> y1 at turn95\n  ...\n  turn102: U -> y9 at turn103.\n\nSo that's 9 moves and we end at turn103.\n\nBut we already had two moves (turn92 and 93) to get to y=0 at turn94. So total moves: 2 (for the first two turns) + 9 = 11.\n\nBut note: we did:\n\n  turn92: U (1 move) -> then turn93: D (2nd move) -> then we are at y=0 at turn94.\n\nThen from turn94 to turn102: 9 moves (U repeatedly) -> total 11 moves.\n\nIs there a way to avoid the down move? \n\nAlternative: we could have stayed at turn92: S -> then at turn93: still at y=0.\nThen at turn93: S again -> then at turn94: y=0 -> safe.\n\nThen we start moving at turn94: U -> turn95: y=1, then U at turn95: y2 at turn96, ...\n\nBut at turn96: we are at y=2? Then we must avoid being at y=5 or 6 at turn96 and 97.\n\nBut we are at y=2 at turn96. Then we can go to y=3 at turn97, then y=4 at turn98, then y=5 at turn99 -> which is safe for freeway5 at turn99.\n\nBut what about freeway2 at turn96? \n        At turn96: we are at y=2 -> freeway2. Check: \n          freeway2: at T=96: L=-83+36*(96-92)= -83+144=61, R=-48+144=96 -> safe.\n\nAt turn97: we are at y=3 -> freeway3: same as above -> safe.\n\nThen we can go to y=4 at turn98, y=5 at turn99, y=6 at turn100, y=7 at turn101, y=8 at turn102, y=9 at turn103.\n\nBut wait: at turn96: we are at y=2, then at turn97: we go to y=3 -> so at turn96: we are at y=2, and at turn97: we are at y=3.\n\nNow, we must avoid being at y=5 or 6 at turn96 and 97: we are not.\n\nBut note: we are at y=5 at turn99 and y=6 at turn100 -> both after turn97, so safe.\n\nThis plan:\n\n  turn92: S -> stay at y=0 (turn93: y=0)\n  turn93: S -> stay at y=0 (turn94: y=0) -> safe.\n  turn94: U -> y=1 at turn95.\n        Check freeway1 at turn95: \n            L=-71+24*3=1, R=-48+72=24 -> safe (0 not in [1,24])\n  turn95: U -> y=2 at turn96.\n        Check freeway2 at turn96: safe (as above)\n  turn96: U -> y=3 at turn97.\n        freeway3 at turn97: safe.\n  turn97: U -> y=4 at turn98.\n        freeway4 at turn98: safe.\n  turn98: U -> y=5 at turn99.\n        freeway5 at turn99: safe (as above)\n  turn99: U -> y=6 at turn100.\n        freeway6 at turn100: safe.\n  turn100: U -> y=7 at turn101.\n        freeway7 at turn101: safe.\n  turn101: U -> y=8 at turn102.\n        freeway8 at turn102: safe.\n  turn102: U -> y=9 at turn103.\n\nTotal moves: 11 moves (from turn92 to turn102) and we reach at turn103.\n\nSame number of moves.\n\nBut we avoided the down move? Actually, we did two stays at the beginning.\n\nBut the minimal H is 11 in both cases.\n\nBut note: we might be able to go faster by not having to go all the way? \n\nAlternatively, can we be at y=5 at turn94? That would require moving up 5 times in 2 moves: impossible.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 at turn94.\n\nThen we have to do at least 9 moves to go from y=0 to y=9, so total moves: at least 9 plus the moves we did before turn94. But before turn94 (turns 92 and 93) we did two moves. So total 11.\n\nBut wait, we could have done:\n\nAt turn92: U -> y=1 at turn93.\nAt turn93: U -> but then at turn94 we are at y=2 -> collision? So we cannot.\n\nOr:\n\nAt turn92: S -> y=0 at turn93.\nAt turn93: U -> y=1 at turn94 -> collision (freeway1 at turn94).\n\nSo the only safe option at turn94 is y=0.\n\nTherefore, we must have two moves that leave us at y=0 at turn94. The moves that do that are:\n\nOption1: \n  turn92: U -> turn93: y=1\n  turn93: D -> turn94: y=0\n\nOption2:\n  turn92: S -> turn93: y=0\n  turn93: S -> turn94: y=0\n\nBoth take two moves and leave us at y=0 at turn94.\n\nThen from turn94 onward, we need 9 moves to go from y=0 to y=9: so total moves: 2 + 9 = 11.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, we can choose either sequence. Let's pick the one without going down (the two stays).\n\nBut note: in the two-stays sequence, we did:\n\n  turn92: S\n  turn93: S\n  turn94: U\n  ... until turn102: U\n\nBut we must check the freeways at every step. We already did for the two-stays sequence and it was safe.\n\nAlternatively, the first sequence (with down) is also safe.\n\nWe'll output the two-stays sequence to avoid going down.\n\nBut the problem says minimal number of turns H: both have H=11.\n\nSo we can choose.\n\nBut let me write the sequence for the two-stays:\n\nTurn 92: S\nTurn 93: S\nTurn 94: U\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: U\nTurn 97: U\nTurn 98: U\nTurn 99: U\nTurn 100: U\nTurn 101: U\nTurn 102: U\n\nBut wait, after turn102: U, we are at y=9 at turn103. And we did 11 actions.\n\nBut note: we start at turn92. The actions are for turns: 92,93,94,...,102.\n\nWe must write:\n\nTurn 92: S\nTurn 93: S\nTurn 94: U\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: U\nTurn 97: U\nTurn 98: U\nTurn 99: U\nTurn 100: U\nTurn 101: U\nTurn 102: U\n\nBut let me verify the positions:\n\nTurn92: start at (0,0). Action S -> stays at (0,0) for the next state? Actually, the update is: after the action, we update the position for the next turn.\n\nAt the beginning of turn92: we are at (0,0). We choose action S. Then at the end of turn92, we are still at (0,0). Then at the beginning of turn93, we are at (0,0).\n\nSimilarly, at turn93: choose S -> at turn94, we are at (0,0).\n\nThen at turn94: choose U -> at turn95, we are at (0,1).\n\nThen at turn95: choose U -> at turn96: (0,2)\n\nThen at turn96: U -> turn97: (0,3)\n\nThen turn97: U -> turn98: (0,4)\n\nThen turn98: U -> turn99: (0,5)\n\nThen turn99: U -> turn100: (0,6)\n\nThen turn100: U -> turn101: (0,7)\n\nThen turn101: U -> turn102: (0,8)\n\nThen turn102: U -> turn103: (0,9) -> goal.\n\nAnd we checked all the freeways at the turns we were on: safe.\n\nTherefore, we have a sequence of 11 actions.\n\nBut note: we must be sure that at every step when we are on freeway 1-8, we are safe.\n\nWe already checked the dangerous turns (94,96,97) and we were not on the dangerous freeways at those turns.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt turn94: we are at y=0 -> safe.\nAt turn96: we are at y=2 -> freeway2: but we computed freeway2 at turn96: safe.\nAt turn97: we are at y=3 -> freeway3: safe.\n\nAnd at other turns, the freeways we step on are safe because we only have danger at the specific turns we avoided.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 92: S\nTurn 93: S\nTurn 94: U\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: U\nTurn 97: U\nTurn 98: U\nTurn 99: U\nTurn 100: U\nTurn 101: U\nTurn 102: U\n}\n\nBut wait: we have 11 actions, but we are writing from turn92 to turn102: that's 11 lines.\n\nWe can also consider if we can reach in fewer than 11 moves? We argued that we must be at y=0 at turn94, and then we need 9 moves to go to y=9. So 11 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, this is the minimal H.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 92\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a dangerous freeway at the specific turns when collisions would occur.\n\n- At turn 94, freeways 1, 2, 3, and 4 are dangerous. The player is at \\(y = 0\\) (safe) by staying at turn 92 and turn 93.\n- At turns 96 and 97, freeways 5 and 6 are dangerous. The player is at \\(y = 2\\) at turn 96 and \\(y = 3\\) at turn 97, avoiding these freeways.\n- All other freeway positions during the sequence are safe, as cars are only dangerous at the specified turns.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 92: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 93: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 94: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 95: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 96: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 97: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 98: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 99: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 100: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 101: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 102: \\text{ U}\n}\n\nThis sequence results in the player reaching \\((0, 9)\\) at turn \\(92 + 11 = 103\\). The actions are:\n- **S** (Stay) at turns 92 and 93 to remain at \\(y = 0\\) and avoid danger at turn 94.\n- **U** (Up) at each subsequent turn to move vertically to \\(y = 9\\) while avoiding dangerous freeways at turns 96 and 97.",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: up, down, or stay, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, staying within 0 to 9. Cars move horizontally on their freeways, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway where a car spans x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe key point is that at turn T, I'm on freeway y_T, and I collide if for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at turn T. When I move to y_{T+1} at turn T, I'm not on y_{T+1} until the next turn, so I only care about the freeway I'm currently on for collision.\n\nI start at turn t_1 = 94, position (0,0), which is not a freeway, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 is safe, no cars. Similarly, y=9 is the goal, no cars. So I only need to worry about y=1 to 8 during the journey.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions to get to y=9 quickly, avoiding collisions.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. Each car has a head and tail, and direction, and speed. The span is given, and for left-moving, it's [h, τ], and for right-moving, it's [τ, h], but in the update, for left-moving: span at T is [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)], and for right-moving: [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)].\n\nIn the car state table, for each freeway, it lists cars with (head, tail, direction, speed). But for freeways 1 to 4 and 7-8, there's only one car, but for 5 and 6, there are three cars each.\n\nLet me list all cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: h=-48, τ=-71, d=right, s=24\n\nFreeway 2: one car: h=-48, τ=-83, d=right, s=36\n\nFreeway 3: one car: h=-48, τ=-83, d=right, s=36\n\nFreeway 4: one car: h=-48, τ=-83, d=right, s=36\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: three cars: same as freeway 5: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (48,37,right,4)\n\nAll cars are right-moving, except I think all are right, no left? Direction is \"right\" for all, so all moving to the right.\n\nIn the span definition, for right-moving, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nAnd collision if 0 is in [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] for some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSince head and tail, for right-moving, I think head is the front, so when moving right, head is larger x, tail smaller, so span should be [tail, head] or [head, tail]? In the update, it says for right-moving: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], and since it says [τ, h] initially, with τ tail, h head, so for right-moving, head is greater than tail, so [τ, h] is increasing, and moves to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nSimilarly for left, but here all right.\n\nNow, for freeway k, at turn T, I need to know if for any car on k, 0 is between τ + s(T-t_1) and h + s(T-t_1).\n\nSince s and positions, we can find when the car covers x=0.\n\nt_1 is 94, so ΔT = T - 94.\n\nSet t_1 = 94, so for turn T, ΔT = T - 94.\n\nThen for a car, the left end at T is τ + s ΔT (for right-moving), right end is h + s ΔT.\n\nCollision if left_end <= 0 <= right_end.\n\nSince all cars right-moving, left_end = τ + s ΔT, right_end = h + s ΔT.\n\nCollision if τ + s ΔT <= 0 <= h + s ΔT.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find the times when it's unsafe, i.e., when some car on that row has 0 in its span.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway for 5 and 6, I need to consider all.\n\nAlso, for freeways with one car, it's simpler.\n\nFirst, let's handle the freeways with one car.\n\nFreeway 1: car: h=-48, τ=-71, d=right, s=24\n\nSo left_end = τ + s ΔT = -71 + 24 ΔT\n\nright_end = h + s ΔT = -48 + 24 ΔT\n\nCollision if -71 + 24 ΔT <= 0 <= -48 + 24 ΔT\n\nSolve:\n\n-71 + 24 ΔT <= 0 => 24 ΔT <= 71 => ΔT <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so ΔT <= 2 since integer? ΔT is integer, T turn, so ΔT integer.\n\nT is turn number, so ΔT = T - 94, integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -48 + 24 ΔT => 24 ΔT >= 48 => ΔT >= 2\n\nAnd -71 + 24 ΔT <= 0 => 24 ΔT <= 71 => ΔT <= 71/24 = 2.958, so since ΔT integer, ΔT <= 2\n\nΔT <= 2 and ΔT >= 2, so ΔT = 2.\n\nΔT >= 2 and ΔT <= 2, so only at ΔT=2.\n\nCheck:\n\nIf ΔT=2, left_end = -71 + 24*2 = -71 + 48 = -23\n\nright_end = -48 + 48 = 0? -48 + 24*2 = -48 + 48 = 0\n\nSo span [-23, 0], so 0 is included, yes collision.\n\nFor ΔT=1: left_end = -71 + 24 = -47, right_end = -48 + 24 = -24, both negative, 0 not in [-47,-24]\n\nΔT=3: left_end = -71 + 72 = 1, right_end = -48 + 72 = 24, so [1,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSo freeway 1 unsafe only at ΔT=2, i.e., turn T=94 + 2 = 96.\n\nt_1=94, ΔT=0 is T=94, but ΔT=T-t_1.\n\nAt T=94, ΔT=0: left_end = -71 +0 = -71, right_end=-48, span [-71,-48], 0 not in.\n\nSafe at T=94.\n\nUnsafe at T=96 only.\n\nT=95: ΔT=1, as above, safe.\n\nT=96: unsafe.\n\nT=97: safe.\n\nFreeway 2: car h=-48, τ=-83, d=right, s=36\n\nleft_end = τ + s ΔT = -83 + 36 ΔT\n\nright_end = h + s ΔT = -48 + 36 ΔT\n\nCollision if -83 + 36 ΔT <= 0 <= -48 + 36 ΔT\n\nSo:\n\n-83 + 36 ΔT <= 0 => 36 ΔT <= 83 => ΔT <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so ΔT <= 2\n\n0 <= -48 + 36 ΔT => 36 ΔT >= 48 => ΔT >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so ΔT >= 2 since integer.\n\nΔT >= 2 and ΔT <= 2, so ΔT=2.\n\nAt ΔT=2: left_end = -83 + 72 = -11, right_end = -48 + 72 = 24, span [-11,24], 0 in, unsafe.\n\nΔT=1: left_end=-83+36=-47, right_end=-48+36=-12, [-47,-12], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=3: left_end=-83+108=25, right_end=-48+108=60, [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe only at T=96.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, h=-48, τ=-83, s=36, so same, unsafe only at T=96.\n\nFreeway 4: also same, one car identical, unsafe at T=96.\n\nNow freeway 7: one car (48,37,right,12)\n\nh=48, τ=37? Head and tail.\n\nIn the table, it says (48,37,right,12), so I think h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=12.\n\nFor right-moving, head should be larger, 48>37, yes.\n\nSo left_end = τ + s ΔT = 37 + 12 ΔT\n\nright_end = h + s ΔT = 48 + 12 ΔT\n\nCollision if 37 + 12 ΔT <= 0 <= 48 + 12 ΔT\n\nBut 37 + 12 ΔT <=0? Since ΔT >=0, 37+12ΔT >=37>0, so left_end >0, so 0 <= left_end only if left_end >=0, which it is, but 0 <= left_end? Collision if left_end <= 0 <= right_end.\n\nHere left_end =37+12ΔT >=37>0, so 0 < left_end <= right_end, so 0 is not <= left_end and >=, 0 is less than left_end, so not in [left_end, right_end] since left_end >0.\n\nSo for all ΔT, left_end >=37>0, so 0 not in span, always safe for freeway 7.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: (48,37,right,4)\n\nh=48, τ=37, s=4\n\nleft_end =37 +4 ΔT >=37>0, similarly, always greater than 0, so never collision, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 5: three cars, all with s=6.\n\nCars: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFor each, find when 0 in span.\n\nFirst car: h=48, τ=37, s=6\n\nleft_end =37 +6ΔT >=37>0, always >0, so 0 not in span, safe always for this car.\n\nSecond car: h=12, τ=1, s=6\n\nleft_end =1 +6ΔT >=1>0, always >0, safe always.\n\nThird car: h=-24, τ=-35, s=6\n\nleft_end = τ + s ΔT = -35 +6 ΔT\n\nright_end = h + s ΔT = -24 +6 ΔT\n\nCollision if -35 +6 ΔT <= 0 <= -24 +6 ΔT\n\nSo:\n\n-35 +6 ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=35 => ΔT <= 35/6 ≈5.833, so ΔT <=5\n\n0 <= -24 +6 ΔT => 6ΔT >=24 => ΔT >=4\n\nSo ΔT from 4 to 5 inclusive.\n\nΔT=4: left_end = -35 +24 = -11, right_end = -24 +24=0, span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔT=5: left_end = -35 +30 = -5, right_end = -24 +30=6, span [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nΔT=3: left_end=-35+18=-17, right_end=-24+18=-6, [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=6: left_end=-35+36=1, right_end=-24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe for freeway 5 when ΔT=4 or 5, i.e., T=94+4=98 and T=94+5=99.\n\nT=98 and 99 unsafe.\n\nBut other cars are always safe, so freeway 5 unsafe only at T=98 and 99.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same cars, identical to freeway 5, so unsafe at T=98 and 99.\n\nNow freeway 7 and 8 always safe, as above.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3,4 unsafe only at T=96.\n\nFreeway 1 at T=96 only.\n\n2,3,4 at T=96 only.\n\n5 and 6 at T=98 and 99.\n\nNow, I start at turn t_1=94, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1, so minimum turns to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9 moves up, but I can stay or go down, but to minimize turns, I should only go up or stay, but staying increases turns, so to minimize, I should go up as much as possible.\n\nBut I need to avoid collisions when on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nAt turn T, when I am on y_T, if y_T between 1 and 8, and it's unsafe at that turn, I collide.\n\nSince I start at y=0 at T=94, which is safe.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe position is (0,y_t), and at turn T, I am on row y_T.\n\nTo reach (0,9), I need y_{t_1 + H-1} =9 for some H.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so actions at t_1 to t_1 + H-1, position after action.\n\nAt turn t_1, I am at (0,y_{t_1}) = (0,0).\n\nThen I choose action a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nAfter action at t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at time t, after action, I move to y_{t+1}.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, I am at position (0, y_t).\n\nThen I choose action a_t, which changes y to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t, I am on freeway y_t, and I check collision for freeway y_t at turn t.\n\nAfter moving to y_{t+1}, at turn t+1, I am on y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nThe collision check is at turn T for the freeway I am on at that turn, y_T.\n\nIn the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nBut since at turn T, I am on y_T, not y_{T+1}, so I only care about y_T at turn T for collision.\n\nWhen I am on a freeway at turn T, I collide if that freeway has a car at x=0 at turn T.\n\nI start at turn t_1=94, y=0, which is not a freeway, so no collision possible.\n\nI need to end at y=9, also not a freeway.\n\nNow, the unsafe turns for each freeway:\n\ny=1: unsafe only at T=96\n\ny=2: unsafe at T=96\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=96\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=96\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=98 and 99\n\ny=6: unsafe at T=98 and 99\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: always safe\n\ny=7 and 8 have no cars that cover x=0, so always safe.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9 in min turns.\n\nEach up move increases y by 1, down by -1, stay 0.\n\nTo minimize time, I should go up as much as possible, but I need to avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nSpecifically, I should not be on y=1,2,3,4 at T=96, and not on y=5 or 6 at T=98 or 99.\n\ny=7 and 8 always safe, so I can be there anytime.\n\nNow, since I start at T=94, y=0.\n\nI need to plan the sequence.\n\nLet me denote the turn and y position.\n\nAt T=94, y=0 (safe)\n\nI choose action, which sets y for T=95.\n\nAfter action at T=94, y_{95} is set.\n\nThen at T=95, I am on y_{95}, and so on.\n\nThe freeway I am on at turn T is y_T.\n\nFor example, at T=94, y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nAfter action a_{94}, y_{95} is determined.\n\nThen at T=95, I am on y_{95}, if between 1-8, check collision for that freeway at T=95.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, I can be there.\n\nMinimal H: if no cars, I can go up each turn, so from y=0 to y=9 in 9 moves: actions at t=94 to 102, y from 0 to 9 at T=103? Let's see.\n\nAt T=94, y=0\n\nAfter a_{94}, y_{95} = y_{94} + Δy, but y_{94}=0.\n\nSet t=0 relative to t_1.\n\nSet τ = t - t_1, so at τ=0, T=t_1=94, y=0\n\nAfter action at τ, y_{τ+1} is set.\n\nAt turn T = t_1 + τ, position y_{t_1 + τ}\n\nFor simplicity, let me work with τ from 0.\n\nAt τ=0 (T=94), y=0\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + τ}, y at τ+1 is set.\n\nAt turn τ, I am on y_τ.\n\nCollision depends on freeway y_τ at turn τ (absolute T=t_1 + τ)\n\nBut since t_1 fixed, we can think in terms of τ.\n\nDefine y(τ) as position at turn t_1 + τ.\n\nSo y(0) = 0\n\nAfter action at time τ, y(τ+1) = y(τ) + Δy_τ\n\nAt turn τ, I am on freeway y(τ), and collision if y(τ) between 1-8 and unsafe at time τ.\n\nUnsafe times:\n\nFor freeway k, unsafe at τ when?\n\nτ = T - t_1 = T - 94\n\nSo for y=1: unsafe at τ=2 (since T=96, τ=2)\n\nSimilarly y=2,3,4: unsafe at τ=2\n\ny=5 and 6: unsafe at τ=4 and τ=5 (T=98,99; τ=4,5)\n\ny=7 and 8: always safe\n\ny=0 and 9: no freeway, safe\n\nI need to find actions from τ=0 to H-1 such that after H actions, y(H) =9.\n\ny(τ) for τ=0 to H.\n\nAt τ=0, y(0)=0\n\nAfter H actions, y(H) =9\n\nThe sequence of actions determines y(1) to y(H).\n\ny(H) = y(0) + sum_{i=0}^{H-1} Δy_i\n\nSince y(0)=0, y(H) = sum of changes.\n\nEach Δy_i = -1,0,+1\n\nTo have y(H)=9, the sum must be +9.\n\nMinimal H is when all changes are +1, so H=9, y(9)=9.\n\nBut I may need to stay or go down to avoid collisions, which would increase H.\n\nI need to check if H=9 is possible with no collision.\n\nWith H=9, from τ=0 to τ=8, actions, y from 0 to 9 at τ=9.\n\ny(τ) for τ=0 to 9.\n\nAt each τ, y(τ) must be safe.\n\ny(0)=0, safe\n\ny(1) to y(8) could be 1-8, need safe at that τ.\n\ny(9)=9, safe.\n\nNow, with min moves, I go up every time, so y(τ) = τ for τ=0 to 9.\n\ny(0)=0, y(1)=1, y(2)=2, ..., y(9)=9.\n\nNow, check safety at each τ:\n\nAt τ=0: y=0, safe\n\nτ=1: y=1, freeway 1. Is it unsafe at τ=1? Earlier, freeway 1 unsafe only at τ=2, so at τ=1, safe.\n\nτ=2: y=2, freeway 2. Unsafe at τ=2? Freeway 2 unsafe at τ=2, yes, collision.\n\ny=2 at τ=2, which is unsafe, so collision.\n\nSo cannot go straight up.\n\nNeed to avoid being on y=2 at τ=2, or y=1,3,4 at τ=2? y=1,2,3,4 all unsafe at τ=2.\n\nIn this path, at τ=2, y=2, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, even if I go slower, at τ=2, if I am on y=1,2,3, or 4, all unsafe.\n\ny=1 at τ=2: freeway 1 unsafe at τ=2, yes.\n\ny=3 at τ=2: freeway 3 unsafe at τ=2.\n\ny=4 at τ=2: freeway 4 unsafe at τ=2.\n\nSo I must not be on freeways 1,2,3,4 at τ=2.\n\nThat means at turn τ=2, I should be on y=0, or y=5,6,7,8, or 9, but y=9 is later.\n\ny(2) must not be 1,2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly, later, at τ=4 and τ=5, I must not be on y=5 or 6.\n\ny=5 and 6 unsafe at τ=4 and 5.\n\nNow, since y=7 and 8 always safe, I can be there.\n\ny=0 and 9 safe.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I need to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nOne way is to delay or advance to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at τ=2, I need y(2) not in {1,2,3,4}.\n\nPossible: y(2) =0, or 5,6,7,8.\n\nBut y(0)=0, so if I stay at y=0 for first few turns.\n\ny(1) = y(0) + Δy_0\n\ny(2) = y(1) + Δy_1\n\nI need y(2) not in {1,2,3,4}\n\nSimilarly, for τ=4 and 5, y(4) and y(5) not in {5,6}\n\nNow, let's list possible y(τ) over time.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe critical points are τ=2 and τ=4,5.\n\nFirst, for τ=2: I must have y(2) <=0 or y(2) >=5.\n\nBut y(0)=0, so y(2) can be from 0 to 2 if I go up, or less if down, but down might not help.\n\ny(2) = y(0) + Δy_0 + Δy_1\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1, so y(2) can be -2 to 2, but y in 0-9, so y(2) >=0.\n\nSo y(2) = 0,1,2 possible, or if I go down, but y=0 min, so y(2) can be 0,1,2.\n\nBut I need y(2) not in {1,2,3,4}, so from above, only possible y(2)=0 or y(2)>=5, but y(2) max 2 if I go up, so y(2) <=2, so only possible y(2)=0 to avoid being in 1,2,3,4.\n\ny(2) must be 0, because if y(2)=1 or 2, it is in {1,2,3,4} and unsafe at τ=2.\n\ny(2)=0 is safe.\n\ny(2)=3 or 4 also unsafe, but I can't reach y=3 or 4 by τ=2 since y(0)=0, max y(2)=2.\n\nSo only options: y(2)=0,1,2.\n\nBut y(2)=1 or 2 unsafe, so must have y(2)=0.\n\nTherefore, I must be at y=0 at τ=2.\n\nThat means I don't move up for the first two actions.\n\nSo at τ=0, action S or D, but D to y=-1 not possible, y min 0, so must stay or go up? y(1) = y(0) + Δy_0\n\nIf I go up at τ=0, y(1)=1\n\nThen at τ=1, if I go down, y(2)=0, or stay y(2)=1, or up y(2)=2.\n\nBut if y(1)=1, then to have y(2)=0, I need to go down at τ=1.\n\nIf I stay at τ=0, y(1)=0, then at τ=1, if I stay, y(2)=0, or up y(2)=1, or down impossible.\n\nTo have y(2)=0, I need:\n\n- Either stay at τ=0 and stay at τ=1\n\n- Or go up at τ=0 and down at τ=1\n\nBut going down might not be efficient, but let's see.\n\nFirst option: stay at τ=0 and τ=1: then y(1)=0, y(2)=0, safe.\n\nSecond option: up at τ=0, y(1)=1; then down at τ=1, y(2)=0.\n\nBut at τ=1, y(1)=1, which is freeway 1, and at τ=1, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 1 unsafe only at τ=2, not at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, T=95, freeway 1: earlier, at ΔT=1, span [-47,-24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSo y(1)=1 at τ=1 is safe.\n\nThen down to y(2)=0, safe.\n\nBut this wastes actions: I go up and down, net zero progress.\n\nWhereas staying twice, also net zero.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need +9 net, so extra actions cost.\n\nMinimal H might be larger than 9.\n\nFirst, I must have y(2)=0.\n\nNow, similarly, for later times.\n\nAlso, at τ=4 and τ=5, I must not be on y=5 or 6.\n\nThat is, y(4) not 5 or 6, and y(5) not 5 or 6.\n\nNow, y(4) and y(5) must not be in {5,6} at those times.\n\nNow, let's plan the path.\n\nI start at τ=0, y=0.\n\nTo have y(2)=0, I can choose:\n\nOption A: stay at τ=0 and stay at τ=1: then y(1)=0, y(2)=0\n\nOption B: up at τ=0, y(1)=1; then down at τ=1, y(2)=0\n\nIn option B, I am at y=1 at τ=1, which is safe, but I don't gain anything, and I use two actions to stay at 0.\n\nIn option A, same, but no move.\n\nFor efficiency, since I need to go up, better to stay at start or something.\n\nBut let's see the next constraints.\n\nAfter τ=2, I need to go up to 9.\n\nBut there is another problem at τ=4 and 5.\n\nτ=4 is T=98, τ=5 is T=99.\n\ny must not be 5 or 6 at τ=4 and not at τ=5.\n\ny(4) not in {5,6}, y(5) not in {5,6}.\n\ny(4) and y(5) can be other values.\n\nNow, from τ=2, y=0, I need to reach high y.\n\ny(2)=0.\n\nThen at τ=2, I choose action, which affects y(3).\n\nThen y(3), y(4), etc.\n\nI need to be careful around τ=4 and 5.\n\nAlso, y=7 and 8 are always safe, so I can go to them early or late.\n\nTo minimize time, I should go up as fast as possible except when avoiding unsafe times.\n\nSince I have to spend at least two turns to stay at y=0 until τ=2, I start moving up from there.\n\ny(2)=0.\n\nThen I can go up each turn, but let's see the values.\n\nSuppose I go up every turn from τ=2 onwards.\n\nThen y(2)=0\n\na_τ=2: U, y(3)=1\n\nτ=3: U, y(4)=2\n\nτ=4: U, y(5)=3\n\nτ=5: U, y(6)=4\n\nτ=6: U, y(7)=5\n\nτ=7: U, y(8)=6\n\nτ=8: U, y(9)=7\n\nτ=9: U, y(10)=8\n\nτ=10: U, y(11)=9\n\nThen y(11)=9, so H=11 actions from τ=0 to 10, y from 0 to 9 at τ=11.\n\nBut we need to check safety.\n\nAt τ=2, y=0, safe.\n\nτ=3, y=1, freeway 1 at τ=3.\n\nτ=3, T=97, freeway 1: at ΔT=3, span [1,24]? Earlier, left_end= -71 +24*3= -71+72=1, right_end=-48+72=24, so [1,24], 0 not in, safe. Yes.\n\nτ=4, y=2, freeway 2 at τ=4.\n\nτ=4, T=98, ΔT=4.\n\nFreeway 2: car h=-48, τ=-83, s=36\n\nleft_end = -83 + 36*4 = -83 + 144 = 61\n\nright_end = -48 + 144 = 96\n\n[61,96], 0 not in, safe. Similarly for other freeways, but at τ=4, y=2, freeway 2, safe since unsafe only at τ=2.\n\nNow τ=4, y=2, but we need to check for τ=4 and y=5 or 6, but here y=2, not 5 or 6.\n\nIn this path, at τ=4, y=2, which is fine.\n\nBut at τ=4, we need y(4) not 5 or 6, which is satisfied.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=5, y=3, freeway 3 at τ=5.\n\nτ=5, T=99, ΔT=5.\n\nFreeway 3: similar, left_end = -83 + 36*5 = -83+180=97, right_end=-48+180=132, [97,132], safe.\n\ny=3 not 5 or 6.\n\nNow, but later, at τ=6, y=4? Let's list:\n\nAfter y(5)=3 at τ=5\n\nThen τ=5 action U, y(6)=4\n\nAt τ=6, y=4, freeway 4.\n\nτ=6, T=100, ΔT=6.\n\nFreeway 4: car h=-48, τ=-83, s=36, left_end=-83+216=133, right_end=-48+216=168, safe.\n\ny(6)=4\n\nτ=6 action U, y(7)=5\n\nAt τ=7, y=5, freeway 5 at τ=7.\n\nτ=7, T=101, ΔT=7.\n\nFreeway 5: we need to check if unsafe.\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe at τ=4 and 5 only? Earlier τ=4 and 5, T=98,99.\n\nAt τ=7, ΔT=7, freeway 5 cars:\n\nFirst car: always safe\n\nSecond car: always safe\n\nThird car: unsafe when ΔT=4 or 5, so τ=4,5.\n\nAt τ=7, ΔT=7, left_end = -35 +6*7 = -35+42=7, right_end=-24+42=18, [7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 same.\n\nSo at τ=7, y=5, safe.\n\nThen τ=7 action U, y(8)=6\n\nAt τ=8, y=6, freeway 6 at τ=8.\n\nτ=8, T=102, ΔT=8.\n\nFreeway 6 similar, safe, as above.\n\nThen τ=8 U, y(9)=7\n\nAt τ=9, y=7, freeway 7, always safe.\n\nτ=9 U, y(10)=8\n\nτ=10 U, y(11)=9\n\ny(11)=9, so reached at τ=11.\n\nBut H is the number of turns for actions, from τ=0 to τ=10, that's 11 actions? Indices.\n\nAt time τ, action a_{t_1 + τ} determines y(τ+1)\n\nAfter H actions, y(H) =9.\n\nActions at τ=0 to H-1, y from y(0) to y(H).\n\nSo for y(H)=9, with H actions.\n\nIn above, from y(0)=0 to y(11)=9, so H=11 actions: τ=0 to 10.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nI have to have y(2)=0, so I wasted two turns not moving up.\n\nIn the sequence above, from τ=2 to τ=11, I went from y=0 to y=9 in 9 actions? y(2)=0, then after actions at τ=2 to τ=10, y(3) to y(11), that's 9 actions to go from 0 to 9? y(2)=0, y(3)=1, ..., y(11)=9, yes, 9 actions from τ=2 to τ=10.\n\nBut total actions from τ=0 to τ=10, 11 actions, with y(0) to y(11).\n\nSince y(0)=0, and I need to reach y=9, min actions if no delay is 9, but I have delay at start.\n\nIn this case, with y(2)=0, and then up each turn to y(11)=9, total 11 turns.\n\nBut can I reach faster?\n\nPerhaps I can go to higher y earlier to avoid the τ=4,5 issue, but in this case, at τ=4 and 5, in the above path, y(4)=2 and y(5)=3, which are not 5 or 6, so safe, no issue.\n\nBut y(4) and y(5) need to not be 5 or 6, which they are not.\n\nNow, but I have to spend two turns at beginning to stay at 0.\n\nIn option B, I could go up and down, but same net.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=5 or higher before τ=4.\n\nBut to reach high y, I need to move up.\n\ny(2)=0.\n\nThen at τ=2, I go up, y(3)=1\n\nIf I go up again at τ=3, y(4)=2, as before.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=2, which is fine.\n\nIf I go faster, but I can only increase by 1 per turn.\n\nFrom y(2)=0, min to y=9 is 9 actions, y(11)=9.\n\ny(2)=0, after k actions, y(2+k) <= k, but to reach 9, need at least 9 actions, so y(11)=9.\n\nSimilarly, if I start moving earlier, but I must have y(2)=0, so I cannot be higher than 0 at τ=2.\n\nSo minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can reach earlier by going to safe zones.\n\nFor example, y=7 or 8 are always safe, so if I can reach them quickly.\n\nBut from y(2)=0, I need to go to y=7, which takes at least 7 actions, to y(9)=7, for example.\n\nThen to y=9, two more, y(11)=9 same.\n\nAt τ=4 and 5, I need to not be on y=5 or 6.\n\nIn the above path, I am on lower y, so no problem.\n\nBut suppose at τ=4, I am on y=5, which is unsafe, but I can avoid.\n\nBut in min time path, I am not on y=5 or 6 at τ=4 or 5.\n\nAnother thing: at τ=4 and τ=5, if I am on y=7 or 8, safe, or lower.\n\nBut to be on y=7 at τ=4, I need y(4)=7.\n\ny(2)=0, so from τ=2 to τ=4, two actions, y(4) <= y(2) +2 =2, so y(4) <=2, cannot be 7.\n\nSimilarly, y(5) <= y(2) +3 =3, since three actions: τ=2,3,4 to set y(3),y(4),y(5).\n\ny(5) = y(2) + Δy_2 + Δy_3 + Δy_4\n\nEach Δy <=1, so y(5) <= 0 +1+1+1=3\n\nSimilarly, y(5) >=0, but min y(5)=0 if all down, but not useful.\n\nSo y(5) <=3, so cannot be 5 or 6 anyway.\n\nSimilarly, y(4) <=2, cannot be 5 or 6.\n\nSo in fact, for τ=4 and τ=5, since y(4) <=2 and y(5)<=3, both less than 5, so I am never on y=5 or 6 at τ=4 or 5, because I can't reach there by then.\n\nTherefore, the only constraint is at τ=2, I must be at y=0.\n\nOtherwise, no other constraints from cars.\n\ny=7 and 8 always safe.\n\nSo the minimal H is 11, with y(2)=0, and then up every turn to y(11)=9.\n\nIn terms of actions.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to have y(2)=0.\n\nI can do this in two ways:\n\n1. Stay at τ=0 and stay at τ=1: so actions S at t_1 +0 and S at t_1 +1\n\nThen at τ=2, y=0\n\nThen U at τ=2, y(3)=1\n\nU at τ=3, y(4)=2\n\nU at τ=4, y(5)=3\n\nU at τ=5, y(6)=4\n\nU at τ=6, y(7)=5\n\nU at τ=7, y(8)=6\n\nU at τ=8, y(9)=7\n\nU at τ=9, y(10)=8\n\nU at τ=10, y(11)=9\n\nAfter 11 actions, y=9.\n\nH=11, actions from τ=0 to τ=10.\n\nAbsolute turns: t_1=94, so actions at t=94 to 104, y=9 at t=105? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T, after action, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nAt turn T=94, I am at y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{94}, y_{95} is set.\n\nAfter action a_{95}, y_{96} set, and so on.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn T, I specify action a_T.\n\nThen after a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nTo reach y_{T_final} =9 for some T_final.\n\nIn this case, with above, at T=94, y=0\n\nAction: for example, S at T=94, then y_{95} = y_{94} +0 =0 (since S)\n\nIn the action, if a_t = S, Δy=0, so y_{t+1} = y_t\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSet T=94:\n\nAction a_{94}: S, then y_{95} = 0 + 0 =0\n\na_{95}: S, then y_{96} =0 +0 =0\n\nAt τ=2, T=96, y=0.\n\nThen a_{96}: U, y_{97} =0 +1 =1\n\na_{97}: U, y_{98} =1 +1 =2\n\na_{98}: U, y_{99} =2 +1 =3\n\na_{99}: U, y_{100} =3 +1 =4\n\na_{100}: U, y_{101} =4 +1 =5\n\na_{101}: U, y_{102} =5 +1 =6\n\na_{102}: U, y_{103} =6 +1 =7\n\na_{103}: U, y_{104} =7 +1 =8\n\na_{104}: U, y_{105} =8 +1 =9\n\nSo at T=105, y=9.\n\nActions from T=94 to 104, that's 11 actions.\n\nH=11 turns.\n\nWith the other option: a_{94}: U, then y_{95} =0+1=1\n\na_{95}: D, then y_{96} =1 + (-1) =0\n\nThen same as before, a_{96}: U, etc., but I have an extra down action, which is worse, since I go to y=1 and back, but same number of actions to reach y=9, but with unnecessary move.\n\nBetter to stay twice.\n\nNow, but in the stay option, at T=94, action S, y_{95}=0\n\nAt T=95, action S, y_{96}=0\n\nNow, at T=95, y=0, safe.\n\nIs there a way to reach faster?\n\nSuppose I don't stay, but go to y=5 or something, but I must not be on y=1-4 at T=96.\n\nT=96 is τ=2.\n\nAt T=96, I must not be on y=1,2,3,4.\n\nBut at T=96, y_{96} must not be 1,2,3,4.\n\ny_{96} is the position after action at T=95? Let's clarify.\n\nAt time T, before action, position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nThen at turn T, I am on freeway y_T.\n\nFor T=96, I am on y_{96}, and it must not be in {1,2,3,4} for collision at that turn.\n\ny_{96} is the position at the beginning of turn T=96.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nFrom start: T=94, y_{94}=0\n\nAfter a_{94}, y_{95} = y_{94} + Δy\n\nThen at T=95, I am on y_{95}\n\nAfter a_{95}, y_{96} = y_{95} + Δy\n\nThen at T=96, I am on y_{96}\n\nWe need y_{96} not in {1,2,3,4}\n\ny_{96} = y_{95} + Δy_{95}\n\ny_{95} = y_{94} + Δy_{94} = 0 + Δy_{94}\n\nΔy_{94} can be -1,0,1, but y min 0, so if Δy_{94} = -1, y_{95} = -1 not possible, so y_{95} >=0, similarly.\n\nSo y_{95} = Δy_{94}, since y_{94}=0, so y_{95} = 0,1, or if down, but down not possible, so y_{95} = 0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly, y_{96} = y_{95} + Δy_{95}\n\nIf y_{95}=0, y_{96} = -1,0,1 but y>=0, so 0 or 1\n\nIf y_{95}=1, y_{96} = 0,1,2\n\nNow, y_{96} must not be 1,2,3,4.\n\nBut possible y_{96}: 0 or 1 (if y_{95}=0) or 0,1,2 (if y_{95}=1)\n\nSo y_{96} can be 0,1,2.\n\nMust not be 1,2,3,4, so only y_{96}=0 is possible to avoid collision.\n\nThus y_{96} must be 0.\n\nTherefore, as before.\n\nNo choice.\n\nSo must have y_{96}=0.\n\nThen proceed as above.\n\nIn the sequence, with all up after, it works.\n\nBut in the sequence I have, at T=101, y_{101}=5? In my earlier:\n\nT=100, y_{100}=4 (after a_{99} U)\n\na_{100}: U, y_{101}=5\n\nAt T=101, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nIs it safe? T=101, t_1=94, ΔT=7, as before, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut freeway 5 unsafe only at T=98 and 99, which are earlier.\n\nSimilarly for y=6.\n\nIn the path, I am on y=5 at T=101, safe.\n\ny=6 at T=102, safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=11.\n\nBut can I reach in fewer than 11 actions?\n\nSuppose I go up immediately, but I have to be at y=0 at T=96, so I must delay.\n\nFor example, if I stay only once, but let's see.\n\nSuppose a_{94}: S, y_{95}=0\n\nThen at T=95, y=0, safe.\n\nThen a_{95}: ? If I go up, a_{95}: U, y_{96}=1\n\nBut at T=96, y=1, which is freeway 1, unsafe, collision.\n\nIf I stay, a_{95}: S, y_{96}=0, safe.\n\nBut same as before.\n\nIf I go down at a_{95}, but y_{95}=0, down not possible, or if I went up earlier.\n\na_{94}: U, y_{95}=1\n\nAt T=95, y=1, which is safe, as established.\n\nThen a_{95}: if I go down, y_{96}=0, then at T=96, y=0, safe.\n\nBut I have y_{96}=0 same as before.\n\nThen from there, same path.\n\nBut now, from y_{96}=0, I go up, but I have an extra up and down, so to reach y=9, it will take more actions.\n\nFor example, y_{96}=0\n\nThen a_{96}: U, y_{97}=1\n\n...\n\nUp to y_{105}=9, same as before, but I used two actions: up and down at start, net zero, so y_{105}=9 with actions from 94 to 104, same 11 actions.\n\nBut with down action, which is not necessary.\n\nSo better to stay twice.\n\nThus, minimal sequence: stay at T=94 and T=95, then up each turn to T=104.\n\nNow, actions: T=94: S, T=95: S, T=96: U, T=97: U, T=98: U, T=99: U, T=100: U, T=101: U, T=102: U, T=103: U, T=104: U\n\nThen y at T=105 is 9.\n\nNumber of actions: from T=94 to T=104 inclusive, that's 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be the sequence of actions.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, at T=98, what is y?\n\nT=98, y_{98}?\n\nFrom above: after a_{97} U, y_{98} = y_{97} +1, and y_{97}=1 (after a_{96} U), so y_{98}=2\n\nAt T=98, y=2, freeway 2.\n\nNow, is it safe? T=98, τ=4, freeway 2: as before, at ΔT=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=99, y=3, freeway 3, safe.\n\nNo issue with y=5 or 6, since I am below.\n\nAt T=101, y=5, freeway 5, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster to higher y, but I can't because of the initial delay.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 and 8 are safe, if I can reach y=7 earlier and stay, but I have to go through lower y.\n\nFor example, from y(2)=0, if I go up faster, but I can only increase one per turn.\n\nMinimal is 9 up moves from y=0 to y=9, but I have two stays at start, so 11 actions.\n\nThe two stays are necessary to be at y=0 at T=96.\n\nTherefore, H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence.\n\nIn the answer, it should be for turns starting from t_1.\n\nt_1=94.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 94: S\n\nTurn 95: S\n\nTurn 96: U\n\nTurn 97: U\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nTurn 100: U\n\nTurn 101: U\n\nTurn 102: U\n\nTurn 103: U\n\nTurn 104: U\n\nAfter action at 104, y_{105} = y_{104} +1, and y_{104}=8, so y_{105}=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, I have 11 actions, from turn 94 to 104.\n\nBut H is the number, so H=11.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision at other points.\n\nFor example, at turn T=98, y=2, freeway 2, as above, safe.\n\nT=99, y=3, freeway 3, safe.\n\nT=100, y=4, freeway 4, at T=100, ΔT=6, safe as before.\n\nT=101, y=5, freeway 5, at ΔT=7, safe.\n\nT=102, y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nT=103, y=7, freeway 7, always safe.\n\nT=104, y=8, freeway 8, always safe.\n\nAfter action at 104, to y=9.\n\nNo collision.\n\nAnd I reached in 11 turns.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10?\n\nSuppose with H=10 actions, y(10)=9.\n\ny(10) = sum of Δy from τ=0 to 9.\n\nSince y(0)=0, y(10)=9, so sum of Δy =9, so I must have 9 up and one other action, but since I need exactly 9 up, and one action must be S or D, but if S, I have a stay, which means I didn't progress, so to reach y=9, I need at least 9 up actions, and possibly stays or downs, but downs would require more up, so minimal actions is 9, but with constraints, I have extra stays.\n\nWith H=10, y(10)=9, so sum Δy=9 over 10 actions, so one action must be S or D.\n\nIf S, I have a stay, so I must have been at some y multiple times.\n\nBut in particular, I need y(2)=0.\n\nAt τ=2, y(2) must be 0.\n\ny(2) = Δy_0 + Δy_1, since y(0)=0.\n\nΔy_0 and Δy_1 each -1,0,1, but y(2) >=0.\n\nTo have y(2)=0, Δy_0 + Δy_1 =0, so either both S, or U and D, or D and U, but D at τ=0 not possible, so only both S or U and D.\n\nIn either case, I have two actions that give net zero.\n\nThen from τ=2 to τ=9, I need to go from y(2)=0 to y(10)=9.\n\ny(10) = y(2) + sum_{i=2 to 9} Δy_i = 0 + sum_{i=2 to 9} Δy_i =9\n\nNow, from τ=2 to τ=9 inclusive, that's 8 actions: i=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\n8 actions to increase y by 9, impossible since each at most +1, max y(10) = y(2) +8 =8, cannot reach 9.\n\ny(10) = y(2) + Δy_2 + Δy_3 + ... + Δy_9\n\nΔy for τ=2 to τ=9, that's 8 actions: indices τ=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nAfter 8 actions, y(10) = y(2) + sum of 8 Δy.\n\ny(2)=0, so y(10) <= 0 +8 =8 <9, cannot reach 9.\n\nIf I include the actions, from τ=0 to τ=9, 10 actions.\n\ny(10) = y(0) + sum_{i=0 to 9} Δy_i = 0 + sum_{i=0 to 9} Δy_i\n\nSet to 9.\n\nBut y(2) = y(0) + Δy_0 + Δy_1 = Δy_0 + Δy_1 =0\n\nSo Δy_0 + Δy_1 =0\n\nThen sum_{i=0 to 9} Δy_i = (Δy_0 + Δy_1) + sum_{i=2 to 9} Δy_i = 0 + sum_{i=2 to 9} Δy_i\n\nsum_{i=2 to 9} is 8 terms, each <=1, so sum <=8, so y(10) <=8 <9, impossible.\n\nTherefore, with H=10, cannot reach y=9 because I must have net zero for first two actions to set y(2)=0, then only 8 actions left to gain up to 8, but need 9, impossible.\n\nWith H=11, y(11) = sum_{i=0 to 10} Δy_i =9\n\ny(2) = Δy_0 + Δy_1 =0\n\nThen sum_{i=2 to 10} Δy_i =9\n\nNow, from i=2 to 10, that's 9 actions (τ=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10), so 9 up actions possible.\n\nThus H=11 is minimal.\n\nAnd the sequence as above.\n\nIn the action list, for the answer.\n\nNow, absolute turns.\n\nt_1=94.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 94: S\n\nTurn 95: S\n\nTurn 96: U\n\nTurn 97: U\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nTurn 100: U\n\nTurn 101: U\n\nTurn 102: U\n\nTurn 103: U\n\nTurn 104: U\n\nIn the sequence, after Turn 104: U, y=9.\n\nNow, H=11.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write in the format.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for freeway 5 and 6, I think I handled.\n\nBut just to be thorough, at T=101, y=5, freeway 5, ΔT=7, cars: the third car has span [ -35+42, -24+42] = [7,18], not include 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 94\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the player must account for the unsafe times on certain freeways. The analysis shows that freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3, 4\\) are unsafe only at turn \\(T = 96\\) (relative turn \\(\\tau = 2\\)), and freeways \\(y = 5, 6\\) are unsafe at turns \\(T = 98\\) and \\(T = 99\\) (\\(\\tau = 4, 5\\)). Freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are always safe. The goal is to minimize the number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe player must be at \\(y = 0\\) at turn \\(T = 96\\) (\\(\\tau = 2\\)) to avoid collision, as \\(y = 1, 2, 3, 4\\) are unsafe at that turn. This requires two initial \"stay\" actions at turns 94 and 95 to remain at \\(y = 0\\). After that, moving up every turn reaches \\(y = 9\\) in 11 turns total.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n- At turn 94, stay (\\(S\\)) to keep \\(y = 0\\).\n- At turn 95, stay (\\(S\\)) to keep \\(y = 0\\) and avoid being on unsafe freeways at \\(T = 96\\).\n- From turn 96 to turn 104, move up (\\(U\\)) each turn to increase \\(y\\) by 1 per turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) after the action at turn 104.\n\nThis sequence ensures:\n- At \\(T = 96\\) (\\(\\tau = 2\\)), \\(y = 0\\), which is safe.\n- At \\(T = 98\\) and \\(T = 99\\) (\\(\\tau = 4, 5\\)), \\(y = 2\\) and \\(y = 3\\) respectively, which are below \\(y = 5\\) and thus avoid the unsafe freeways 5 and 6.\n- All other positions during the sequence are safe, as verified by the car positions and spans at each turn.\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11, with actions from turn 94 to turn 104.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 94: S \\\\\nTurn 95: S \\\\\nTurn 96: U \\\\\nTurn 97: U \\\\\nTurn 98: U \\\\\nTurn 99: U \\\\\nTurn 100: U \\\\\nTurn 101: U \\\\\nTurn 102: U \\\\\nTurn 103: U \\\\\nTurn 104: U\n}",
