When you eat, the new segment is added at the tail end, so positions become: [new head, previous head, previous tail] or something.\n> \n> Standard snake: positions are list, head first.

(3,4) has no food, it's tail), so tail moves forward. Tail was at (3,4), and it moves to where? The tail segment is removed, so new positions: head at (3,4), and the body is only one segment, but since length 2, after moving head to (3,4), and no food, tail is removed, so snake is now [(3,4)], length 1 again? That can't be right.\n> \n> I think I confused.\n> \n> Initial: positions list [(3,5), (3,4)] head at (3,5), tail at (3,4).\n> \n> Now, I move head to new position, say to (3,4). But (3,4) is the current tail position.\n> \n> But in the grid, the cell (3,4) is occupied by the tail.\n> \n> When moving, head moves to a new cell. If that cell is not food, and not wall, etc., then the tail is removed from its current position.\n> \n> So if head moves to (3,4), which is the tail position, but since tail is there, it might be considered a collision? No, typically in snake, moving to the tail cell is allowed because the tail moves away immediately after.\n> \n> Let me think carefully.\n> \n> Standard rule: collision occurs if head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment except the tail, because the tail will move.\n> \n> But if head moves to the tail cell, it is not a collision since tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, from [(3,5), (3,4)], if I move down to (3,4), head moves to (3,4). Now, (3,4) was occupied by tail, but since head moves there, and tail is still there for a moment, but in terms of collision, it's usually not considered collision because after the move, the tail is removed or moved.\n> \n> After head moves to (3,4), the cell (3,4) is now head, and since no food eaten, the tail is removed, so the cell is freed, and snake becomes [(3,4)] only, because the tail segment is gone.\n> \n> Positions: before move: [head: (3,5), body: (3,4)] so two cells.\n> \n> After moving head to (3,4): new head at (3,4), but (3,4) was the previous tail, so now the snake should be just [(3,4)] because the tail was removed. But that means the snake shortened to length 1, which is incorrect.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell. If that cell is not food, then the tail is removed from the list, so the snake moves forward, length same.\n> \n> In this case, from positions [(3,5), (3,4)], if head moves to (3,4), but (3,4) is already occupied by the tail, so moving to (3,4) would mean head and tail are on the same cell, but in the list, it's different.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think that the positions are a list of cells, with head first.\n> \n> When moving, new head position is added to the front, and if no food, the last element (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So for move to (3,4): new head position is (3,4), added to front. But (3,4) is already in the list as tail? No, in the list, (3,4) is the tail, so when we add new head to (3,4), the list becomes [(3,4), (3,5), (3,4)]? No.\n> \n> Positions list: index 0: head, index 1: body, etc., last is tail.\n> \n> So for length 2: [ (3,5), (3,4) ] head (3,5), tail (3,4).\n> \n> Move head to new position P.\n> \n> If P is not food, then new positions: [P, (3,5)] and remove tail, so tail (3,4) is removed, so new list [P, (3,5)]\n> \n> In this case, P = (3,4), so new positions: [(3,4), (3,5)]\n> \n> Then the snake is at (3,4) and (3,5), with head at (3,4), tail at (3,5).\n> \n> Previously head was at (3,5), now head at (3,4), tail at (3,5).\n> \n> And (3,4) was the old tail position, but now it's head, and (3,5) is new tail.\n> \n> No problem.\n> \n> Similarly, if I eat food, no remove tail.\n> \n> Back to the point.\n> \n> For turn 0, I have choices.\n> \n> Let's list the food:\n> \n> - (2,2): close, can reach in 2 turns: turn 0 D to (3,2), turn 1 L to (2,2) eat.\n> \n> - (3,5): can reach in 2 turns: turn 0 U to (3,4), turn 1 U to (3,5) eat.\n> \n> - (1,2): farther, need at least 3 turns: e.g., turn 0 L to (2,3), then turn 1 D to (2,2), turn 2 L to (1,2) eat, but (2,2) has food, so if I go to (2,2) on turn 1, I eat it, then to (1,2) later.\n> \n> But let's plan a sequence.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, the internal obstacle at (4,6), but I'm at (3,3), so not immediately relevant.\n> \n> Since all food has life span 10, no urgency, but eating early might be good to grow.\n> \n> But with length 1, no risk of body collision, so I can go for food.\n> \n> But after eating, I need to be careful.\n> \n> Let's consider going for (3,5) first.\n> \n> Turn 0: move U to (3,4)\n> \n> Now snake at (3,4), direction U.\n> \n> Turn 1: move U to (3,5), eat food at (3,5).

It's turn 2, and the grid has walls and obstacles. The borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid. Walls are at the borders and one internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> The snake is at positions: head at (2,2), and body at (2,3). Since the head direction is down, that means the snake is moving downward. The head is at (2,2), and the body is at (2,3), which is directly below it, so moving down makes sense because (2,3) is south of (2,2) if we consider y increasing upwards or downwards? I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> In the movement constraints, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). So if U increases y, that means y increases upwards, I assume. So (2,2) to (2,3) with direction D: D is (x,y-1), so from (2,2) moving down would go to (2,1), but here the body is at (2,3), which has a higher y, so if y increases upwards, (2,3) is above (2,2). But the head direction is D, down, which should decrease y.\n> \n> Inconsistency here. Let me read carefully.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(2,2), (2,3)] with head direction D.\n> \n> If head is at (2,2) and moving down (D: y-1), then next position would be (2,1), but the body is at (2,3), which is above it. So the snake must have moved from above to below.

Since it moved down to (2,2), the previous position was (2,3) for head, I think. Snake positions: [(2,2), (2,3)] means head is (2,2), and the next segment is (2,3), so the snake is from (2,2) to (2,3), with head at (2,2). Since direction is D, down, that means it was moving down, so from some point above to (2,2), with tail at (2,3).\n> \n> But (2,3) has higher y, so if U is y+1, higher y is up, so (2,3) is above (2,2).

Let's see.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be there for L more turns, including turn t. So it disappears at turn t + L - 1? Example: if at turn t, life span N, then after this turn, countdown is N-1, and it disappears when countdown reaches 0. So it is present for turns t to t + N - 1, inclusive? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, at turn when food is spawned or when we see it, life_span is given. After each turn, life_span decreases by 1.

So available turns 2 to 10 inclusive? Turn 10: countdown=1 before turn, so available during turn 10.\n> \n> Standard: at the beginning of turn t, if life_span >0, food is present.

Positions: before move: head (2,2), body (2,3)\n> \n> After move: if head moves to (2,3), and since no food eaten, snake doesn't grow, so the tail should move to where the head was or something. Standard snake mechanics: when head moves to a new cell, if not eating, tail moves forward, so the segment that was tail is removed.\n> \n> So positions: before: [(2,2), (2,3)] head and body.\n> \n> After moving head to (2,3): new head at (2,3), and the body was (2,3) which is now the new head, so the tail (2,3) is gone, and the new body is... since only two segments, after head moves to (2,3), the body becomes (2,2) or something? Let's think.\n> \n> Typically, in snake, the body follows: when head moves to new position, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So from [(2,2) head, (2,3) body/tail]\n> \n> If head moves to (2,3), then new positions: head is now at (2,3), and the body moves to where head was, (2,2). But (2,3) was the tail, and it moves to (2,2), so new snake: head at (2,3), body at (2,2).\n> \n> But (2,2) is now the tail.\n> \n> And no collision because head is at (2,3), which was previously occupied, but since the tail moved away, it's empty now except for head.\n> \n> In terms of collision, moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves.\n> \n> Similarly, here, moving to (2,3) is possible.\n> \n> But (2,3) is within bounds? y=3, x=2, walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=3 is between 1 and 6? y from 1 to 6, since y=0 and y=7 walls.\n> \n> y=1 to 6 inclusive? y=0 is wall, y=7 wall, so y=1,2,3,4,5,6 are free, except obstacles.\n> \n> (2,3) is at y=3, fine.\n> \n> Similarly, other moves.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,2):\n> \n> - U: to (2,3) - this is the current tail position, so allowed, and safe.\n> \n> - D: to (2,1) - down, y-1.

The body segment at (2,3) should move to the previous head position (2,2), but since head moved to (2,1), the new body position is (2,2), and tail is removed? With two segments: head moves to new position, and the tail is removed, so new snake is [ (2,1), (2,2) ] with head at (2,1).\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> No food eaten, length still 2.\n> \n> - Move L: to (1,2)\n> \n> (1,2) has food!

If I eat food, the snake grows, so after eating, length becomes 3, and tail moves only when not eating.\n> \n> But for collision, since it's short, not much body to hit yet.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions for the next few turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's find possible immediate moves.\n> \n> Current position (3,2), can move U to (3,3), D to (3,1), or R to (4,2).\n> \n> Moving R to (4,2): is (4,2) safe? (4,2) is not a wall, not occupied by body? Body is at (2,2), so (4,2) is empty. Also, no food there directly, but there is food at (5,2).\n> \n> (4,2) should be free. Let me sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> Assume x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> y=6 is top, y=1 is bottom? Usually in grids, y increases up, but in the movement, U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so higher y is up.\n> \n> In the state, walls y=0 and y=7, with y=0 probably bottom, y=7 top.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> So playable: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle (4,6), so (4,6) blocked.\n> \n> Food: (1,2) at bottom left-ish, (3,5) top middle, (5,2) bottom right.\n> \n> Snake head (3,2), body (2,2), so at bottom row, y=2.\n> \n> Moving options:\n> \n> - U: to (3,3)\n> \n> - D: to (3,1) — y=1 is above y=0 wall? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is playable, since walls are the boundaries, so moving to x=0 or y=0 is wall collision, but y=1 is inside.\n> \n> Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so coordinates with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Playable cells have x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> y=1 is playable, y=6 is playable, except where obstacles.\n> \n> So D to (3,1): (3,1) is playable, no wall, not body, so safe.\n> \n> Similarly, U to (3,3): (3,3) should be free.\n> \n> R to (4,2): (4,2) is free, and no food there.\n> \n> Now, food at (1,2), (3,5), (5,2).\n> \n> (1,2) is left of head, at (1,2), head at (3,2), so same row, two left.\n> \n> (5,2) is two right, same row.\n> \n> (3,5) is up, three up from (3,2) to (3,5), delta y=3.\n> \n> I need to think about eating food.\n> \n> First, the food at (1,2): if I want to eat it, I need to move left, but current head direction is R, so I cannot move left immediately because no instant reverse. So on this turn, I can't move left. I have to choose U, D, or R.\n> \n> If I move R to (4,2), then next turn I could move left, but that might not be efficient.\n> \n> Also, life span: food at (1,2) has life span 7 at turn 3, so it will disappear after turn 9? Let's calculate.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 3, life span 7 means:\n> \n> - After turn 3, life span 6\n> \n> - After turn 4, life span 5\n> \n> ...\n> \n> - After turn 9, life span 0, so disappears before turn 10? The rule: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L more turns, meaning it is present for turns t to t+L-1, and gone at turn t+L.\n> \n> For example, at turn 3, life span 7: present from turn 3 to turn 9 (since 3 to 9 is 7 turns: turn 3,4,5,6,7,8,9), gone at turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, food (3,5) life span 7 at turn 3, same, gone after turn 9.\n> \n> Food (5,2) life span 8 at turn 3, so present from turn 3 to turn 10 (8 turns: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10), gone at turn 11.\n> \n> So I have time; no immediate expiration.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence.\n> \n> Since I must think 5+ turns ahead, I should consider paths to food and potential risks.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving towards food.\n> \n> Option 1: Move right to (4,2)\n> \n> Then head at (4,2), direction R.\n> \n> From there, I can go to (5,2) to eat the food, since (5,2) has food.\n> \n> But (5,2) has food, so if I move to (5,2), I eat it, snake grows to length 3.\n> \n> Then the new position: head moves to (5,2), body was (3,2) and (2,2), but after eating, tail doesn't move, so positions: head (5,2), then previous head (3,2) becomes body, and (2,2) remains, so snake: [(5,2), (3,2), (2,2)]\n> \n> Then I need to move from there.\n> \n> But let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Turn 3: move R to (4,2) — not eating, so tail moves? When not eating, tail moves forward.\n> \n> General movement: when snake moves to a cell without food, head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so length same.\n> \n> If cell has food, head moves to new cell, food eaten, tail not removed, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (4,2), no food there, so head to (4,2), tail (2,2) is removed, so new positions: head (4,2), body (3,2) — since only two segments, after moving to (4,2), the body is only (3,2), and (2,2) is gone. Snake was [(3,2), (2,2)], move to (4,2), so new positions [(4,2), (3,2)], length 2 still.\n> \n> Then from there, I can move to (5,2) which has food, so eat it, head to (5,2), body becomes (4,2) and (3,2), so snake [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2)], length 3.\n> \n> Then I need to move from (5,2).\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (5,3), D to (5,1), L to (4,2), or R to (6,2).\n> \n> But (4,2) is now body, so moving left to (4,2) would cause collision with body, death.\n> \n> Similarly, R to (6,2): (6,2) is playable? x=6, y=2, x=7 is wall, so x=6 is playable, since x=1 to 6 are inside.\n> \n> x=7 is wall, so x=6 is ok.\n> \n> y=2 ok.\n> \n> So possible moves: U, D, R (since L is body).\n> \n> Head direction after eating at (5,2) would be R, since I moved right to get there.\n> \n> So cannot move left immediately next turn.\n> \n> But moving left to (4,2) is body, so invalid anyway.\n> \n> So from (5,2), I can go U, D, or R.\n> \n> If I go R to (6,2), then at (6,2), no food, so tail moves, etc.\n> \n> But let's think further.\n> \n> Option: from (3,2) now, move up to (3,3)\n> \n> Then to (3,4), etc., to reach (3,5) food.\n> \n> Or move down to (3,1), but no food there directly.\n> \n> I need to consider the tail reward danger.\n> \n> Since snake is short, tail is close.\n> \n> For example, if I am near the tail and there is food on the tail cell.\n> \n> But currently, tail is at (2,2), and no food on it. Food is at (1,2), which is adjacent to tail? (1,2) and (2,2) are adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> But the food is at (1,2), not on (2,2).\n> \n> Tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But here, tail cell (2,2) has no food; food is at (1,2), different cell.\n> \n> So no issue.\n> \n> Now, let's plan a sequence that gets me to eat food safely and survive.\n> \n> I should aim for the closest food or most accessible.\n> \n> (5,2) is close; I can reach it in two moves: turn 3 R to (4,2), turn 4 R to (5,2) eat.\n> \n> Then at turn 4, head at (5,2), snake [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2)]?

It's turn 4, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) is a wall, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7 or y=0, y=7. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6). So the playable grid is from (1,1) to (6,6), except (4,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (4,2), and body at (3,2). So the snake is only 2 segments long right now. Head direction is R (right), which makes sense since from (3,2) to (4,2) is moving right.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,2) with value 1, life span 6. Since it's turn 4, it will disappear after 6 turns, so at turn 10 (4+6=10, but life span decreases each turn including current, so if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, meaning it lasts until turn t + N - 1 or something? Let's see the rule.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if food has life span L, it will disappear at turn t + L. For example, at turn 4, food with life span 6: countdown starts at 6, decreases by 1 each turn, so after turn 4, countdown is 5; after turn 5, countdown 4; ... after turn 9, countdown 0, and it disappears at the start of turn 10 or after being eaten? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", so I think after N turns from now, it's gone.\n> \n> For food at turn t with life span L, it exists from turn t to turn t + L - 1, and disappears at turn t + L. Countdown at turn t is L, decreases each turn, reaches 0 at turn t + L, and disappears.\n> \n> In this case, turn 4:\n> \n> - Food at (1,2): value 1, life span 6. So countdown 6, disappears at turn 4+6=10.\n> \n> Similarly:\n> \n> - (3,5): value 1, life span 6, disappears at turn 10\n> \n> - (5,2): value 1, life span 7, disappears at turn 11 (4+7=11)\n> \n> - (6,5): value 1, life span 10, disappears at turn 14\n> \n> All food has value 1, meaning they are all positive food? Value is given as 1 for all, but it says value1, value2, etc., and in the description, positive food has value +1, negative has -1. Here all values are 1, so all are positive food. No negative food in this state.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, thinking about long-term survival and maximizing score.\n> \n> Current snake: head at (4,2), direction R. Body at (3,2). So possible moves: since direction is R, I can't move left instantly (opposite direction), but I can move up, down, or right.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,2):\n> \n> - Up: to (4,3)\n> \n> - Down: to (4,1)\n> \n> - Right: to (5,2)\n> \n> - Left: to (3,2), but (3,2) is the body segment. Now, collision rules: if head touches body, it dies, except if it's the tail and we're moving into it, but since the tail will move, it might be safe.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves away, so after move, head is where tail was, but tail is gone, so no collision.\n> \n> In this case, moving left to (3,2) is possible because (3,2) is the tail, and after move, head is at (3,2), body is at (4,2), and tail was at (3,2), but since we move to it, the snake grows only if we eat food, but we're not eating now, just moving.\n> \n> When we move without eating, the snake moves forward, so head goes to new position, and tail moves off the previous tail position.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so the segment that was tail is now empty.\n> \n> Here, snake positions: [(4,2), (3,2)] head at (4,2), tail at (3,2).\n> \n> If I move left to (3,2), that's the tail cell. After move, head should be at (3,2), and since we didn't eat, the tail (which was at (3,2)) is removed? But head is moving to (3,2), which is where tail was.\n> \n> After move: the new head position is (3,2), and the body segment was at (4,2), so new positions: head at (3,2), and body at (4,2)? But (4,2) was head, now body, and (3,2) was tail, now head? Let's think.\n> \n> Original positions: index 0: head (4,2), index 1: tail (3,2)\n> \n> If we move left to (3,2): new head position is (3,2). Since we didn't eat food, the tail is removed. So the new snake should be [ (3,2) ]? But that would mean the snake has only one segment, which doesn't make sense because we have a body segment.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard: when snake moves, head moves to new cell. If no food eaten, the tail cell is vacated, and the new tail is the previous body segment.\n> \n> In this case, snake segments: segment 0: (4,2) head, segment 1: (3,2) tail.\n> \n> Move left: head moves to (3,2). Since (3,2) is now the new head position, and it was the tail, but after move, the tail is removed, so segment 1 is gone, and new snake is just [ (3,2) ]? But that can't be right because we have a body.\n> \n> Perhaps the segments shift.\n> \n> After moving to (3,2): the head is now at (3,2), and the previous head (4,2) becomes the body? But then the tail was (3,2), which is now head, so the cell is occupied.\n> \n> Better to think: the snake moves by adding a new head and removing the tail if no food eaten.\n> \n> So from positions [A, B] where A head, B tail.\n> \n> Move to new cell C: if C is not food, new positions [C, A], and B is removed. So now head at C, tail at A.\n> \n> In this case, from [ (4,2), (3,2) ], move left to (3,2). (3,2) is the current tail position.\n> \n> If we move to (3,2), which is the tail, and no food there, then new head at (3,2), and since we moved to tail, the tail is removed, but (3,2) was tail, so after removal, we have only [ (3,2) ] as head, but the body segment is gone? That would shorten the snake, but in snake game, when you move into the tail, since tail moves, it should be safe and snake length remains the same.\n> \n> I think the rule clarifies: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So when you move to the tail cell, it's like the tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> In terms of positions: from [head, tail], move to tail position: new positions become [tail position, head position], and the old tail is gone, so new snake [ (3,2), (4,2) ]? But (3,2) was tail, now head, and (4,2) was head, now tail.\n> \n> Let's specify:\n> \n> Current: segments: 0: (4,2) head, 1: (3,2) tail\n> \n> Move to (3,2): since we move to the tail cell, and no food, the new head is at (3,2), and the previous head (4,2) becomes the new tail. The previous tail (3,2) is now head, so the cell is the same, but the segment is now head. After move, positions: head at (3,2), tail at (4,2). So snake is now [(3,2), (4,2)].\n> \n> Visually, the snake was at (4,2) head and (3,2) tail, moving left to (3,2): head moves to (3,2), which was occupied by tail, but tail is moving away, so now head is at (3,2), and the body is at (4,2), so positions [(3,2), (4,2)].\n> \n> Yes, that makes sense. Length unchanged.\n> \n> If there was food at (3,2), eating it would grow the snake, so tail not removed, positions become [ (3,2), (4,2), (3,2) ]? But that would have two at (3,2), which is collision. But the rule has \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, if food at tail and we eat it, we grow, so new head at food position, which was tail, and tail doesn't move, so head and tail at same position, collision.\n> \n> But here, no food at (3,2), so moving to it is safe.\n> \n> Similarly, other moves.\n> \n> Back to possible moves from (4,2):\n> \n> - Up: to (4,3)\n> \n> - Down: to (4,1)\n> \n> - Right: to (5,2)\n> \n> - Left: to (3,2)  // safe as per above\n> \n> Now, walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so (4,1) is y=1, not wall; (4,3) y=3, not wall; (5,2) x=5, not wall; (3,2) x=3, not wall.

Or y=0 bottom? Typically in grids, y=0 might be bottom or top, but since walls y=0 and y=7, and y=0 is border, so probably y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 top wall? But in coordinates, (x,y), with y increasing up or down?\n> \n> In the snake positions, head at (4,2), and if I move up, to (4,3), so y increases as we go up, I assume.

It's turn 5, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid (since x and y go from 0 to 7, so 8 cells each way). Walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls, and there's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,2), then (4,2), and tail at (3,2). So the snake is horizontal, moving right, since head direction is R. That means the head is at (5,2), and it was previously at (4,2), so moving right to (5,2).\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,2) with value 1 and life span 5. Since it's turn 5, and life span decreases every turn including current, this food will disappear after 5 turns, so at turn 10? Let's calculate: life span 5 at turn 5 means it has 5 turns left, including turn 5. So after turn 5, life span becomes 4, then 3, etc., so it disappears after turn 9? I need to be careful.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life_span L, it will be present for L turns, including turn t. So after turn t + L - 1, it disappears?

So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> For the food at (1,2): at turn 5, life_span=5, so it can be eaten from turn 5 to turn 9 (since 5 + 5 - 1 = 9? Turn 5: L=5, turn 6: L=4, turn 7: L=3, turn 8: L=2, turn 9: L=1, then turn 10: gone. But life span decreases every turn including current, so after turn 5, L=4 for turn 6, etc.\n> \n> Standard way: at the start of turn t, if food has life_span L, it can be eaten during turn t, and then life_span decreases to L-1 for the next turn. If L=1, after being eaten or not, it disappears for the next turn.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> I think it's better to interpret as: for food spawned with life_span N at some turn, it will disappear after N turns from that point. But here, it's given at turn 5 with life_span, so it was spawned earlier or at turn 5? The state gives the current food with their life span at turn 5.\n> \n> Probably, at turn 5, the food exists with life_span as given, and for each turn, after the snake moves, the life span decreases by 1 for the next turn.\n> \n> But for eating, during a turn, if head moves to food, it's eaten.\n> \n> So for food at (1,2): value 1, life_span 5 at turn 5. So it can be eaten on turns 5,6,7,8,9 (since on turn 5, L=5, eaten if head there; after turn 5, if not eaten, L=4 for turn 6, and so on, up to turn 9 L=1, eaten or not, then turn 10 gone).\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5): value 1, life_span 5, same as above, can be eaten turns 5-9.\n> \n> (6,5): value 1, life_span 9, so can be eaten from turn 5 to 13 (turn 5 L=9, turn 6 L=8, ..., turn 13 L=1, turn 14 gone).\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Now, snake is at [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2)], head at (5,2), direction R (right). So possible moves: since moving right, I can go U (up), D (down), or R (right), but not L (left) because that's opposite direction, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move left on this turn.\n> \n> So options: U, D, R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's see the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

It's turn 6. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6). So, I should avoid those cells.\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (6,2), then body at (5,2), and tail at (4,2). The head is moving right, so from (6,2), it was going to (7,2), but x=7 is a wall, so moving right now would cause a wall collision. That's bad. Since the head direction is R (right), and it's at (6,2), moving right to (7,2) is impossible because x=7 is a wall. So, I must not move right; that would be instant death.\n> \n> The possible moves from (6,2) are:\n> \n> - Up (U) to (6,3)\n> \n> - Down (D) to (6,1)\n> \n> - Left (L) to (5,2), but (5,2) is occupied by the body segment. Let's see the snake positions: head (6,2), body (5,2), tail (4,2). So (5,2) is the second segment, which is part of the body. Moving left to (5,2) would mean the head collides with the body, which is deadly. So I cannot move left.\n> \n> - Right to (7,2) is wall, impossible.\n> \n> - Down to (6,1): y=0 is wall, but y=1 is not a border wall? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is fine, as long as not wall.\n> \n> Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.

(1,2) with value 1, life span 4. So it disappears after 4 turns, including current? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 6, if life span is 4, it will disappear at turn 10? Let's see: life span is the number of turns it remains, decreasing each turn. So at turn t, if life span is N, it appears at turn t and lasts until turn t + N - 1? No.\n> \n> The input says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> And current turn is 6.\n> \n> For food: (1,2,4,1) — I think it's (x,y, life_span, value), but in the input it says \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (1, 2, 4, 1)\" so probably (x,y, life_span, value). Similarly, (3,5,4,1) and (6,5,8,1).\n> \n> Value is 1 for all, so all are positive food? Value 1, and it says positive food has value +1, negative has -1. Here all values are 1, so all positive food? But in the description, it says \"Positive Food\" and \"Negative Food\", but in this state, all have value 1, so all positive. No negative food here.\n> \n> (1,2,4,1) : x=1,y=2, life=4, value=1\n> \n> (3,5,4,1) : x=3,y=5, life=4, value=1\n> \n> (6,5,8,1) : x=6,y=5, life=8, value=1\n> \n> All value 1, so all positive food.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,2), life span 4 at turn 6, so it will disappear after 4 turns, meaning at the end of turn 9? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> At turn 6, life span 4, so:\n> \n> - Turn 6: life span 4 (present)\n> \n> - Turn 7: life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 8: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 9: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 10: disappears, not present.\n> \n> Typically, if it disappears after N turns, it means it lasts for N turns starting from now. Since countdown decreases each turn including current, at turn t, with life span N, it will be gone by turn t + N.\n> \n> For example, turn 6: life span 4, so it can be eaten from turn 6 to turn 9 (since at turn 10 it's gone). Turn 9 is the last turn it can be eaten, with life span 1.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5,4,1): life span 4 at turn 6, same as above.\n> \n> (6,5,8,1): life span 8, so lasts until turn 13.\n> \n> Now, snake is at (6,2), (5,2), (4,2).

Snake has three segments: indices 0=head, 1=body, 2=tail.\n> \n> After move without eating: head moves to new cell, body segments move to previous head position, tail position is vacated.\n> \n> So from [(6,2), (5,2), (4,2)], move U to (6,3):\n> \n> - New head: (6,3)\n> \n> - Body: (6,2) (previous head)\n> \n> - Tail: (5,2) (previous body), and (4,2) is no longer part of snake, so that cell is free.\n> \n> Similarly, if move D to (6,1): head (6,1), body (6,2), tail (5,2), and (4,2) free.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about getting food.\n> \n> Food at (1,2) is on the same row, but at x=1. Snake is at x=6,2 to x=4,2. To reach (1,2), I need to go left, but currently at (6,2), moving left would go to (5,2), which is body, collision, so I can't go left now.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,5) and (6,5).\n> \n> (6,5) is at same x, y=5, which is above. From (6,2), U to (6,3), then I can go up to (6,4), then (6,5), but (6,5) has food, so I could eat it.\n> \n> But let's see the life spans.\n> \n> (6,5) has life span 8, so plenty of time.\n> \n> (1,2) has life span 4, so it disappears after turn 9?

It's turn 7, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and internal obstacles. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (6,3), then body at (6,2), and tail at (5,2). The head is facing Up (U), which means it was moving upwards to get to (6,3).\n> \n> Food items are given with their positions, value, and life span. The format is (x, y, life_span, value). From the input:\n> \n> - (1,2) with life_span 3, value 1\n> \n> - (3,5) with life_span 3, value 1\n> \n> - (6,5) with life_span 7, value 1\n> \n> - (2,4) with life_span 10, value 1\n> \n> All food has value 1, meaning they're all positive food since value is +1. No negative food here, so I don't have to worry about penalties.\n> \n> Life span decreases each turn, including the current turn. So at turn 7, for the food:\n> \n> - (1,2) has life_span 3, so it will disappear after 3 more turns? Life span is given, and it decreases every turn. Since it's turn 7, and life_span is 3, that means it will last until turn 7 + 3 - 1? I need to clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at the start of turn t, if a food has life_span L, after the turn, it decreases to L-1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So if life_span is L on turn t, it will be present for this turn and the next L-1 turns, disappearing after turn t + L - 1? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, a food has life_span L. After turn t, it becomes L-1. So it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., up to t + L - 1, and after turn t + L - 1, it disappears before turn t + L.\n> \n> For example, food at (1,2) has life_span 3 on turn 7. That means:\n> \n> - On turn 7: life_span 3, can be eaten\n> \n> - After turn 7: life_span becomes 2\n> \n> - Turn 8: life_span 2, can be eaten\n> \n> - After turn 8: life_span becomes 1\n> \n> - Turn 9: life_span 1, can be eaten\n> \n> - After turn 9: life_span becomes 0, disappears, so not available on turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (6,3), direction U. Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> Current direction is U, so I cannot move D (down) immediately because that would be instant reverse. So allowed moves: U (up), L (left), R (right). D is forbidden.\n> \n> Now, grid boundaries: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so positions outside [0,7] in x or y are invalid. Also internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> Snake body: head (6,3), body (6,2), tail (5,2). So the snake has 3 segments.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score by eating food while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's list the current positions:\n> \n> - Head: (6,3)\n> \n> - Body: (6,2)\n> \n> - Tail: (5,2)\n> \n> After any move, the snake moves, and if it eats food, it grows, so the tail doesn't move if food is eaten; otherwise, the tail moves forward.\n> \n> But in this case, since no food is at head position now, moving won't eat immediately.\n> \n> Now, possible actions for turn 7:\n> \n> - U: to (6,4)\n> \n> - L: to (5,3)\n> \n> - R: to (7,3) but x=7 is wall, so invalid?

But is it occupied by body? Body is at (6,2) and (5,2), so (6,4) is empty? Let's see the grid.\n> \n> Current occupied cells: snake at (6,3), (6,2), (5,2). Walls at borders and (4,6). Food at (1,2), (3,5), (6,5), (2,4).\n> \n> (6,4) is not occupied by anything, so moving U to (6,4) is possible.\n> \n> But is there a risk? Moving to (6,4) doesn't hit body or wall.\n> \n> Similarly, L: to (5,3). Is (5,3) occupied? Snake body is at (6,2) and (5,2), so (5,3) is empty. Walls: x=5, y=3 is within bounds, not wall.

Better to think index.\n> \n> At turn t, life_span L, it can be eaten until turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> So for (1,2): L=3 at t=7, can be eaten on turns 7,8,9.\n> \n> (3,5): same, turns 7,8,9\n> \n> (6,5): L=7 at t=7, can be eaten turns 7 to 13 (7 to 7+6=13)\n> \n> (2,4): L=10 at t=7, can be eaten turns 7 to 16 (7 to 7+9=16)\n> \n> Now, snake is at (6,3), and I need to plan actions.\n> \n> Also, when snake eats food, it grows, so length increases, and tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (6,3): U to (6,4) or L to (5,3).\n> \n> I should consider both options and simulate ahead.\n> \n> First, let's think about the food at (6,5).

Currently, tail is at (5,2), head at (6,3), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so neighbors: (5,3), (7,3), (6,2), (6,4). Tail is at (5,2), which is not adjacent to head (6,3); (5,2) is diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent cells are up, down, left, right, not diagonally.\n> \n> So head (6,3) neighbors: (6,4) U, (6,2) D, (5,3) L, (7,3) R.\n> \n> Tail at (5,2), which is down-left, not directly adjacent. So no issue.\n> \n> After moving to (6,4), tail is at (6,2), head at (6,4), so positions (6,4) and (6,2) are two apart, not adjacent; (6,3) is between them.\n> \n> Then if I move to (6,5), head at (6,5), tail at (6,2), not adjacent.\n> \n> So eating (6,5) should be safe.\n> \n> But let's confirm the tail after eating.\n> \n> As I thought earlier, after eating (6,5) on turn 8, positions: head (6,5), body (6,4), (6,3), tail (6,2).

Turn 9 is the turn I can eat.\n> \n> If I move L to (4,5) on turn 9, I don't eat (3,5), I need another move.\n> \n> Turn 9: I'm at (5,5), if I move L to (4,5), then on turn 10 I can move to (3,5), but (3,5) expires after turn 9, so on turn 10 it might be gone.\n> \n> (3,5) life_span 3 at turn 7, so on turn 9: at turn 9, life_span? At turn 7, L=3, after turn 7: L=2, turn 8: L=1, turn 9: L=1, can be eaten, after turn 9: L=0, disappears. So on turn 9, it is present, can be eaten.\n> \n> But if I move to (4,5) on turn 9, I'm not at (3,5) yet. To eat on turn 9, I need to be at (3,5) on turn 9.\n> \n> From (5,5) on turn 9, I can only move to adjacent cells: (5,6), (5,4), (4,5), (6,5) but (6,5) is body now?

Then on turn 10, if I move to (3,5), but (3,5) may be gone if life_span ends.\n> \n> At turn 9, (3,5) has life_span: at turn 7 L=3, turn 8 L=2, turn 9 L=1, so it can be eaten on turn 9. But I am not at (3,5) on turn 9; I am at (5,5). To eat on turn 9, I need to be at (3,5) on turn 9, but from (5,5) it's impossible in one move. So I cannot eat (3,5) on turn 9 if I ate (6,5) first.\n> \n> Similarly, for (1,2), it's farther.\n> \n> If I want to eat (3,5) by turn 9, I need to start moving towards it now.\n> \n> For example, from turn 7, instead of moving U, I move L to (5,3).\n> \n> Then positions: move L to (5,3), so for turn 8: head (5,3), body (6,3), tail (6,2)  // since tail moved from (5,2) to (6,2)\n> \n> From (5,3), I can move L to (4,3) or U to (5,4) or D to (5,2), etc.\n> \n> (3,5) is at (3,5), so I need to go left and up.\n> \n> From (5,3), to (3,5), I can go to (4,3) then (3,3) then (3,4) then (3,5), but that takes multiple turns.\n> \n> Manhattan: from (5,3) to (3,5) is |5-3| + |3-5| = 2 + 2 = 4 cells, so at least 4 moves.\n> \n> Turn 7: at (6,3)\n> \n> Turn 8: after move L to (5,3)\n> \n> Then turn 9: from (5,3), say move U to (5,4) or something.\n> \n> To reach (3,5) by turn 9, I need to be at (3,5) on turn 9.\n> \n> From turn 7 position (6,3), in two moves: turn 7 and turn 8.\n> \n> After turn 7 move, I am at new position for turn 8.\n> \n> From (6,3) to (3,5) in two moves: impossible, since min distance 5 cells? |6-3|=3, |3-5|=2, min 5 moves?

It's turn 9, and the grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls occupy the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6). So the snake can only move within x from 1 to 6 and y from 1 to 6, except where obstacles are.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,5), then body at (6,4), (6,3), (6,2). So it's a vertical line going down from (6,5) to (6,2). Head direction is U, which is up. So currently moving upwards.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,2) with value 1 and life span 1. Life span decreases every turn, including current, so since turn 9, it will disappear after this turn? Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life span is L, it disappears at the end of turn t + L - 1? Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for a food with life span N, it appears for N turns. Countdown starts at N and decreases by 1 each turn. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn. But since it decreases including current turn, if life span is 1, it will disappear after the current turn. So for (1,2) with life span 1, at turn 9, it will be gone after turn 9, meaning if not eaten on turn 9, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5) with value 1, life span 1, same thing.\n> \n> (2,4) with value 1, life span 8. So it will last for 8 turns from now.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive food? But one is at (1,2), one at (3,5), one at (2,4). Values are all 1, so no negative food here.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for multiple turns ahead. Think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Current head position: (6,5), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: since head direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse.

Possible moves: U, L, R.\n> \n> - U: to (6,6). Is (6,6) valid? y=6, but walls at y=7, so y=6 is playable? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is not wall, since y=7 is wall. Similarly, x=0 and x=7 walls. So (6,6) should be playable, but is it occupied? Snake body: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) — (6,6) is not occupied, and no obstacle mentioned except (4,6), so (6,6) should be free.\n> \n> But let's confirm: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (6,6) are within 1 to 6? x=6 is between 1 and 6, y=6 between 1 and 6? y=1 to 6: since y=0 and y=7 are walls, playable y is 1 to 6 inclusive?

No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So new head at new position.\n> \n> Then segment 1 (first body) moves to where head was.\n> \n> Segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was.\n> \n> Segment 3 (tail) moves to where segment 2 was.\n> \n> So after moving U to (6,6):\n> \n> - Head: (6,6)\n> \n> - Body1: (6,5)  // previous head\n> \n> - Body2: (6,4)  // previous body1\n> \n> - Body3: (6,3)  // previous body2, and tail was (6,2), but it moves to (6,3)? Positions: new head (6,6), then body at (6,5), (6,4), and (6,3). Tail is now at (6,3), which was previously body2.\n> \n> Previous tail (6,2) is no longer occupied because the tail moved to (6,3).\n> \n> The cell (6,2) is now empty.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move L to (5,5):\n> \n> Head to (5,5), body to (6,5), (6,4), (6,3). Tail moves from (6,2) to (6,3), so (6,2) free.\n> \n> Now, back to turn 9 choices.\n> \n> Option 1: Move U to (6,6)\n> \n> Then head at (6,6), direction now U? After move, head direction is the direction I just moved, so if I move U, new direction is U.\n> \n> Then from (6,6), possible moves: U to (6,7), but y=7 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> D to (6,5), but (6,5) is now occupied by body, so collision? After move, positions: head (6,6), body at (6,5), (6,4), (6,3). So (6,5) is body, so moving D to (6,5) would collide with body.\n> \n> L to (5,6), or R to (7,6) invalid since wall.\n> \n> So possible moves from (6,6): L to (5,6) or D, but D to (6,5) is body, collision, so only L to (5,6) possible? U and R invalid, D invalid, so only L.\n> \n> (5,6) is playable? x=5,y=6, not wall, no obstacle mentioned, so yes.\n> \n> But no food there.\n> \n> Then from (5,6), I can move to other places.\n> \n> But I might be cornering myself.\n> \n> Option 2: Move L to (5,5) on turn 9.\n> \n> Head to (5,5), direction now L? Since I moved left.\n> \n> New positions: head (5,5), body at (6,5), (6,4), (6,3). Tail was (6,2), now moved to (6,3)? Body segments: after move, body at previous positions except tail moves.\n> \n> Head moved to (5,5), so body1 at old head (6,5), body2 at old body1 (6,4), body3 at old body2 (6,3), and tail is body3 at (6,3). So positions: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3).\n> \n> Now from (5,5), direction L, so possible moves: L, U, D, but not R (opposite).\n> \n> L to (4,5), U to (5,6), D to (5,4).\n> \n> All should be playable.\n> \n> (4,5): x=4,y=5, not wall, but obstacle at (4,6), not (4,5), so (4,5) free.\n> \n> (5,6): free.\n> \n> (5,4): free.\n> \n> No food immediately.\n> \n> But there is food at (2,4) which is available for 8 turns.\n> \n> (2,4) with life span 8, so I have time to reach it.\n> \n> But I need to think about the path and risks.\n> \n> Also, after moving, the tail leaves (6,2) free, but no food there.\n> \n> Now, the food at (3,5) and (1,2) disappear after this turn, so only (2,4) remains.\n> \n> (2,4) is at x=2,y=4.\n> \n> Current head after turn 9: if I move L to (5,5), head at (5,5).\n> \n> Distance to (2,4): |5-2|=3 in x, |5-4|=1 in y, so Manhattan distance 4.\n> \n> I can reach it in a few turns.\n> \n> If I move U to (6,6), head at (6,6), distance to (2,4): |6-2|=4, |6-4|=2, distance 6, farther.\n> \n> So moving L to (5,5) seems better to get closer to (2,4).\n> \n> But I need to consider the board and possible traps.\n> \n> Also, the snake length is 4, after eating, it grows.\n> \n> But for now, no food eaten.\n> \n> Another thing: the internal obstacle at (4,6), which might block paths.\n> \n> Now, let's plan multiple turns.\n> \n> First, for turn 9, I think moving L to (5,5) is better than U to (6,6), because (6,6) is a corner and I have only one move to (5,6), which might be limiting.\n> \n> Whereas from (5,5), I have more options.\n> \n> Also, closer to (2,4).\n> \n> So I'll choose L for turn 9.\n> \n> Action turn 9: L\n> \n> Then head at (5,5), direction L.\n> \n> Now turn 10: from (5,5), I can move L, U, or D.\n> \n> I want to reach (2,4).\n> \n> (2,4) is left and down from (5,5).\n> \n> So I can move L to (4,5), or D to (5,4), or U to (5,6).\n> \n> Moving D to (5,4) gets me closer in y, since y=4 to y=4.\n> \n> (5,4) to (2,4) is same y, so only x difference.\n> \n> But let's see the path.\n> \n> Also, after moving, the tail is moving, so cells free up.\n> \n> Current positions after turn 9 move: head (5,5), body (6,5), (6,4), (6,3). (6,2) is free now.\n> \n> On turn 10, I move from (5,5).\n> \n> Option: move D to (5,4). Then head to (5,4), which is closer to (2,4).\n> \n> (5,4) to (2,4) is |5-2|=3 in x, same y.\n> \n> Then body: head moves to (5,4), so body1 to (5,5), body2 to (6,5), body3 to (6,4). Tail moves from (6,3) to (6,4)? Positions: new head (5,4), body at (5,5), (6,5), (6,4).\n> \n> So (6,3) is free.\n> \n> Now from (5,4), direction D (since I moved down).\n> \n> Possible moves: L, R, D, but not U (opposite).\n> \n> L to (4,4), R to (6,4) but (6,4) is occupied by body, collision.\n> \n> D to (5,3), U invalid.\n> \n> So possible: L to (4,4) or D to (5,3).\n> \n> (4,4) is playable, (5,3) playable.\n> \n> No food.\n> \n> I can continue towards (2,4).\n> \n> But (2,4) has life span 8, so from turn 9, it will last until turn 9 + 8 - 1? Let's calculate food life.\n> \n> At turn 9, life span 1 for some, but for (2,4), life span 8.\n> \n> Countdown decreases each turn including current, so at turn 9, countdown=8, after turn 9, countdown=7, ..., after turn 16, countdown=0, disappears after turn 16? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current). Disappears after N turns.\"\n> \n> So for a food with life span N at turn t, it will be present from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and disappear at the start of turn t + N or something.\n> \n> Example: life span 1 at turn t: present at turn t, disappears after turn t, so only on turn t.\n> \n> Life span 2: present at turn t and t+1, disappears after turn t+1.\n> \n> Generally, available for turns t to t + N - 1.\n> \n> For (2,4) at turn 9, life span 8, so available from turn 9 to turn 9 + 8 - 1 = turn 16. So can be eaten on turns 9 to 16 inclusive? Turn 9 to turn 16 is 8 turns: 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16.\n> \n> Yes, 8 turns.\n> \n> So I have until turn 16 to eat it.\n> \n> Now back to path.\n> \n> After turn 9: head at (5,5), direction L.\n> \n> Turn 10: I need to move towards (2,4).\n> \n> I can move D to (5,4) to decrease y.\n> \n> Or L to (4,5) to decrease x.\n> \n> (2,4) is at (2,4), so both x and y need to decrease.\n> \n> From (5,5), moving D to (5,4) gets y=4, same as target y.\n> \n> Then from there, I can move left multiple times to (4,4), (3,4), (2,4).\n> \n> But are there obstacles? (4,6) obstacle, but not on this row.\n> \n> (4,4) should be free.\n> \n> But when I move to (2,4), I need to make sure it's safe.\n> \n> Another thing: after I eat, the snake grows, so I need space to move without colliding.\n> \n> But since I'm moving towards it, let's simulate.\n> \n> First, turn 10: move D to (5,4).\n> \n> Head to (5,4), direction now D.\n> \n> Positions: head (5,4), body at (5,5), (6,5), (6,4). (6,3) free? After move, body segments: body1 at (5,5), body2 at (6,5), body3 at (6,4). So (6,3) is free, but not important.\n> \n> Now turn 11: from (5,4), direction D, so can move L, R, D (not U).\n> \n> L to (4,4), R to (6,4) but (6,4) is body, occupied, collision if I move there.\n> \n> D to (5,3), U invalid.\n> \n> So only L to (4,4) or D to (5,3).\n> \n> I want to go left, so move L to (4,4).\n> \n> Head to (4,4), direction L (since I moved left? From direction D, I moved L, so new direction L.\n> \n> Positions: head (4,4), body at (5,4), (5,5), (6,5). Body3 at (6,4)? After move: head to (4,4), body1 to old head (5,4), body2 to old body1 (5,5), body3 to old body2 (6,5). Tail was (6,4) before, but moved to (6,5)? Old body2 was (6,5)? Let's list:\n> \n> Before turn 11 move: positions: head (5,4), body1 (5,5), body2 (6,5), body3 (6,4)\n> \n> After moving head L to (4,4):\n> \n> New head: (4,4)\n> \n> Body1: old head (5,4)\n> \n> Body2: old body1 (5,5)\n> \n> Body3: old body2 (6,5)\n> \n> And old body3 (6,4) is now free.\n> \n> So positions: (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5)\n> \n> Now from (4,4), direction L.\n> \n> Turn 12: possible moves L, U, D (not R, opposite).\n> \n> L to (3,4), U to (4,5), D to (4,3).\n> \n> (3,4) is closer to (2,4), and no obstacle.\n> \n> (4,5) and (4,3) free.\n> \n> I can move L to (3,4).\n> \n> Head to (3,4), direction L.\n> \n> Positions: head (3,4), body at (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n> \n> (6,5) free, etc.\n> \n> Now turn 13: from (3,4), direction L, can move L, U, D.\n> \n> L to (2,4), which is the food!\n> \n> (2,4) has food, so if I move to (2,4), I eat it.\n> \n> So on turn 13, move L to (2,4), eat food, snake grows.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows, so when I move to (2,4), I eat the food, value +1, length increases by 1.\n> \n> So new positions: head moves to (2,4), and since I eat, the tail doesn't move, so body segments stay, but a new segment is added at the tail position? Standard: when you eat, the head moves to food, you grow, so tail stays in place, and a new segment is added where the tail was or something.\n> \n> \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n> \n> So, before move, positions: head (3,4), body (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n> \n> After moving head to (2,4) and eating:\n> \n> New head: (2,4)\n> \n> Then the body: since growth, the tail doesn't move, so body segments: body1 at old head (3,4), body2 at old body1 (4,4), body3 at old body2 (5,4), and new tail at old body3 (5,5)? Typically, the body segments move as usual, but since growth, an additional segment is added at the position where the tail was before moving.\n> \n> Let's clarify.\n> \n> Normally, when moving without eating: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so tail moves away.\n> \n> When eating: head moves to food, each body segment moves as usual, but the tail does not move, meaning a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail stays, and the snake grows.\n> \n> So positions: after move and eat, head at new position, body segments move to their new positions, but since growth, the last position (old tail) is not vacated; instead, it becomes part of the body, and a new segment is there.\n> \n> In this case, before move: positions: head (3,4), body1 (4,4), body2 (5,4), body3 (5,5)  // tail\n> \n> After moving head to (2,4) and eating:\n> \n> Head: (2,4)\n> \n> Body1: moves to old head (3,4)\n> \n> Body2: moves to old body1 (4,4)\n> \n> Body3: moves to old body2 (5,4)\n> \n> And since eating, add new segment at old body3 position (5,5), so new body4 at (5,5)\n> \n> So positions: (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n> \n> Snake length now 5.\n> \n> Now, I have eaten the food, good.\n> \n> But I need to think if this path is safe.\n> \n> In the sequence above, I moved from (5,5) to (5,4) to (4,4) to (3,4) to (2,4).\n> \n> On turn 13, I eat at (2,4).\n> \n> But is (2,4) safe?

That means coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but since walls occupy those cells, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm.\n> \n> The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so moving to x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall collision. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6). So the snake can only move within x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, except for (4,6) which is blocked.\n> \n> Current turn is t=10.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,5), then body segments at (6,5), (6,4), (6,3). So the snake is three segments long: head, and two body parts, but positions list has four points: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)]. That means the snake has a head and three body segments? Let's count: index 0: head (5,5), index 1: (6,5), index 2: (6,4), index 3: (6,3). So that's four positions, meaning the snake length is 4, including head. When it eats positive food, it grows by one segment.\n> \n> Snake head direction is L, which means it was moving left to reach (5,5). Since direction is L, and head is at (5,5), previous position was to the right, so (6,5) is the first body segment.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (3,5) with value 1 and life_span 1\n> \n> - (2,4) with value 1 and life_span 7\n> \n> - (6,4) with value 1 and life_span 10\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food? Value is given as 1 for all, and it says \"Value and Life Span\", so for (3,5): value=1, life_span=1\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4): value=1, life_span=7\n> \n> (6,4): value=1, life_span=10\n> \n> Value 1 means positive food, since penalty for negative is -1, but here all are +1, so all are good to eat.\n> \n> Now, life_span: for (3,5), life_span=1, meaning it will disappear after this turn or next? Life-span disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t=10, life_span=1, so after this turn, it will be gone? Let's see: \"Disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> For a food with life_span N at turn t, it will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1 or something? I need to clarify.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, a food has life_span L. Then, after each turn, L decreases by 1. When L reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or before the next? The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means that at the start of turn t, if life_span is L, then during turn t, it can be eaten, and at the end of turn t, L decreases by 1. If L becomes 0 after decrease, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, for (3,5) at t=10, life_span=1. So at the end of turn 10, after the action, life_span decreases to 0 and it disappears. So it can be eaten during turn 10, but not after.\n> \n> For (2,4), life_span=7, so it has 7 turns left including turn 10.\n> \n> For (6,4), life_span=10, 10 turns left.\n> \n> Now, important: food at (6,4) is currently occupied by the snake's body! Look at snake positions: (6,4) is the third segment, index 2.\n> \n> But the rule says: food can spawn under snake body, and can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, (6,4) has food, but it's under the snake body. To eat it, the snake must move such that the body at (6,4) moves away, and then the head moves to (6,4) later.\n> \n> But since the head is not adjacent to (6,4) now, it's not possible immediately.\n> \n> Also, Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Tail is at (6,3), which is the last position.\n> \n> Head is at (5,5), tail at (6,3). Are they adjacent? Let's see distance: |5-6|=1, |5-3|=2, so not adjacent; adjacent means sharing an edge, so horizontal or vertical neighbor, not diagonal.\n> \n> So (5,5) and (6,3) are not adjacent; (5,5) neighbors are (5,6), (5,4), (4,5), (6,5). (6,5) is body, (4,5) might be free, etc.\n> \n> (6,3) neighbors: (6,4), (6,2), (5,3), (7,3) but x=7 is wall, so (6,4) is body, (6,2) might be free, (5,3) might be free.\n> \n> Head is not adjacent to tail, so no immediate danger.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose actions for turn 10 and a few more turns, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Possible moves from current position (5,5) with direction L (left).

So if I don't eat it this turn, it's gone.\n> \n> At turn t=10, I can move to a cell and eat food if it's there.\n> \n> If I move to (4,5) now, I don't eat (3,5) because it's not adjacent; only if I move directly to the food cell.\n> \n> To eat (3,5), I need to move to (3,5) directly.

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game at Turn \\( t_0 = 11 \\):\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - There's an internal obstacle at (4, 6).\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake positions (head first): [(4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4)].\n     - Head at (4, 5).\n     - Body segments at (5, 5), (6, 5).\n     - Tail at (6, 4).\n   - Current head direction: Left (L).\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - Positive food at (2, 4) with value +1, life span 7 (disappears after Turn 17).\n   - Positive food at (6, 4) with value +1, life span 9 (disappears after Turn 19).\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 11\n\nGiven the current head direction is Left (L), the possible moves are:\n- **Left (L)**: (3, 5)\n- **Up (U)**: (4, 6) → Blocked by internal obstacle at (4, 6).\n- **Down (D)**: (4, 4)\n- **Right (R)**: (5, 5) → Opposite of current direction (L), so not allowed.\n\nThus, valid immediate moves are:\n- Left (L) to (3, 5)\n- Down (D) to (4, 4)\n\n### Evaluating Move Options\n\n**Option 1: Move Left (L) to (3, 5)**\n- New head position: (3, 5)\n- Snake positions after move: [(3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5)]\n  - Tail (6, 4) is removed since no food is eaten.\n- Food at (6, 4) is now uncovered and can be eaten later.\n- Next steps towards (2, 4):\n  - From (3, 5), can move Down (D) to (3, 4).\n  - Then Left (L) to (2, 4) to eat the food by Turn 13.\n\n**Option 2: Move Down (D) to (4, 4)**\n- New head position: (4, 4)\n- Snake positions after move: [(4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5)]\n  - Tail (6, 4) is removed.\n- Food at (6, 4) is now uncovered.\n- Next steps towards (2, 4):\n  - From (4, 4), can move Left (L) to (3, 4).\n  - Then Left (L) to (2, 4) to eat the food by Turn 13.\n\nBoth options allow reaching (2, 4) by Turn 13. However, moving Left first seems more direct because:\n- After moving Left, the body is [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)], leaving (6,4) free, which might be useful later.\n- Moving Down first also works but may slightly complicate the path to (6,4) later due to body positions.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: When eating food under the tail, ensure the head isn't adjacent to the tail after eating to avoid collision.\n  - Currently, head at (4,5) and tail at (6,4) are not adjacent (distance is 3), so no immediate danger.\n- **Body Collision**: Must avoid moving into body segments.\n  - Moving Left to (3,5) is safe as it's empty.\n  - Moving Down to (4,4) is also safe.\n\n### Long-term Strategy\n\n1. **Prioritize (2,4)**:\n   - Life span until Turn 17, so must eat by Turn 17.\n   - Can reach it by Turn 13 with either initial move.\n   \n2. **Then Target (6,4)**:\n   - Life span until Turn 19, so more time.\n   - After eating (2,4), navigate towards (6,4) carefully to avoid body collisions.\n\n### Deciding the Immediate Action\n\nGiven that both initial moves (L and D) allow reaching (2,4) by Turn 13, but moving Left first seems slightly more straightforward for later navigation towards (6,4), I'll choose:\n\n**Immediate Action at Turn 11: Move Left (L) to (3,5)**\n\n### Action Sequence\n\nBased on the above reasoning, here's the planned sequence:\n\n1. **Turn 11**: Move Left (L) to (3,5)\n   - Snake: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)]\n2. **Turn 12**: Move Down (D) to (3,4)\n   - Snake: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]\n3. **Turn 13**: Move Left (L) to (2,4) and eat the food.\n   - Snake grows: [(2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]\n\nThis sequence ensures we eat the more urgent food at (2,4) first and positions us to later target (6,4).\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 11 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(4, 6)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: L\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (2, 4, 7, 1)\n\t- (6, 4, 9, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 11 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 11. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6). So, I should avoid those cells.\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (4,5), then body segments at (5,5), (6,5), and tail at (6,4). The head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left last turn.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - One at (2,4) with life span 7 and value 1 (positive food).\n> \n> - Another at (6,4) with life span 9 and value 1 (also positive). But (6,4) is the tail position right now. Since the tail is there, and food can be under the body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Also, there's a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail collide. In this case, the tail is at (6,4), and the head is at (4,5). Are they adjacent?\n> \n> Let's see the positions: head (4,5), tail (6,4). Distance: |4-6| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3, which is more than 1, so not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right. From (4,5) to (6,4): not adjacent; it's diagonal or further. So, no immediate danger from that.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: since head direction is L, I can move U, D, or L, but not R because that would be instant reverse. Current direction L, so opposite is R, so I cannot move R on this turn.\n> \n> Available moves: U (up, to (4,6)), D (down, to (4,4)), or L (left, to (3,5)).\n> \n> But (4,6) is an internal obstacle! The walls include (4,6) as an internal obstacle, so I cannot move there.\n> \n> Also, borders: x=0 to x=7, y=0 to y=7, so (4,4) should be within bounds, (3,5) should be within bounds.\n> \n> (4,6) is blocked by obstacle, so I cannot move U.\n> \n> So, possible actions this turn: D to (4,4) or L to (3,5).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid. Assume x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are borders. Also, internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> Snake: head (4,5), body (5,5), (6,5), tail (6,4).\n> \n> Food: (2,4) with life span 7, value 1; and (6,4) with life span 9, value 1. But (6,4) is currently occupied by the tail.\n> \n> Life span: food disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn, including current. So at turn 11, for (2,4), life span 7, so it will disappear after turn 11 + 7 - 1? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> The food has life span N, meaning it will disappear after N turns from now, so after turn t_1 + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, at turn t, if life span is L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and disappears when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> For food at (2,4): life span 7 at turn 11, so countdown 7. After turn 11, it will be 6, then 5, ..., down to 0 at turn 18? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 11: countdown 7\n> \n> - After turn 11 (i.e., during turn 12), countdown 6\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn 17, countdown 1 during turn 18\n> \n> - After turn 18, countdown 0, so it disappears before turn 19? The food is present on turns when countdown > 0.\n> \n> Typically, \"disappears after N turns\" might mean it's there for N turns, including the current one.\n> \n> To avoid confusion: countdown starts at N and decreases by 1 each turn, so it is present from turn t to turn t + N - 1 inclusive? Let's see an example.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, life span N. After the turn, countdown decreases, so at turn t, countdown = N, it is present.\n> \n> At turn t+1, countdown = N-1, still present if N-1 > 0.\n> \n> It disappears when countdown reaches 0, which happens after the turn when countdown was 1.\n> \n> So, for countdown C at turn T, it is present on turn T, and will be present until turn T + C - 1, and disappears before turn T + C.\n> \n> At turn T, countdown C, it is present.\n> \n> After turn T, countdown becomes C-1.\n> \n> So on turn T+1, countdown C-1, present if C-1 > 0.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> On turn T + k, countdown C - k, present if C - k > 0.\n> \n> Disappears when C - k <= 0, so after turn T + C - 1.\n> \n> For example, if C=1 at turn T, it is present on turn T, and disappears after turn T, so not present on turn T+1.\n> \n> If C=2, present on T and T+1, disappears after T+1.\n> \n> So general: food with life span L at turn T is present from turn T to turn T + L - 1 inclusive.\n> \n> Here turn 11, food (2,4) life span 7, so present from turn 11 to turn 17 inclusive.\n> \n> Food (6,4) life span 9, present from turn 11 to 19 inclusive.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves.\n> \n> Current head at (4,5), direction L.\n> \n> Can move: D to (4,4) or L to (3,5). Cannot U to (4,6) because obstacle, cannot R because reverse.\n> \n> Now, if I move D to (4,4), what happens?\n> \n> New head position (4,4), which is empty, no food there. Then the snake moves: head to (4,4), body segments follow: the old head (4,5) becomes body, so body positions: (4,4) head, then (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), and tail (6,4) moves to where? When snake moves, the tail moves forward only if no food eaten. Since no food at (4,4), length unchanged, so tail moves: the last segment (6,4) is removed, and the new position depends on the movement.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when moving to a new cell without food, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So, from positions: [(4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)]\n> \n> Move head to (4,4): new positions: head at (4,4), then the first body segment is the old head (4,5), then (5,5), then (6,5). The tail (6,4) is removed because no growth.\n> \n> So new snake: [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)]\n> \n> Tail is now (6,5).\n> \n> Food at (6,4) is still there, but now uncovered? (6,4) is empty now, since tail moved away.\n> \n> Food at (6,4) was under tail, now tail moved to (6,5), so (6,4) is free, and food is still there with countdown decreasing.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (2,4) still there.\n> \n> If I move L to (3,5): head to (3,5), no food there, so new snake: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)] and tail (6,4) removed, so (6,4) free with food.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead.\n> \n> First, let's list possible actions for this turn and simulate.\n> \n> Also, after moving, the head direction changes.\n> \n> If I move D, new direction down.\n> \n> If I move L, new direction left.\n> \n> Now, food: (2,4) is positive, I want to eat it, but it's at (2,4), head at (4,5). Distance: |4-2| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3, so at least 3 moves away, but not Manhattan, since moves are grid-based.\n> \n> From (4,5) to (2,4): possible paths, e.g., left to (3,5), then down to (3,4), then left to (2,4). Or down to (4,4), then left to (3,4), then left to (2,4). Etc.\n> \n> But I have to avoid walls and body.\n> \n> Also, (6,4) has food, but it's where the tail was.

Walls: border y=7 is wall, but y=6 is not border unless specified. Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (2,6) should be ok, since y=6 <7, not equal to wall. Walls are the cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, so (x,y) with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So (2,6) has x=2 not 0 or 7, y=6 not 0 or 7, so not wall. Similarly, (2,4) y=4 not 0 or 7, ok.

But since walls are at the borders, the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So, moving to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 is a wall collision. Also, internal obstacle at (4,6), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (4,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: (2,4) head, (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). So the snake body is mostly on row y=5, from x=2 to x=5, except the head is at (2,4), which is one row below? y=4 is below y=5 if y increases upwards or downwards?\n> \n> In grid coordinates, usually y increases upwards, but in this context, movement U is (x,y+1), which might imply that y increases upwards. Let me check.\n> \n> Movement: U (x,y+1) — so if y+1, that means increasing y moves up. D (x,y-1) decreasing y moves down. L (x-1,y) decreasing x moves left. R (x+1,y) increasing x moves right.\n> \n> In the snake positions, head is (2,4), and next segment is (2,5). Since head direction is D (down), moving down to (2,4) from (2,5)? Positions are listed head first: [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]. So head is at (2,4), and the segment behind it is (2,5). Since direction is down, that means the snake was at (2,5) and moved down to (2,4). So y=5 is above y=4, so higher y is up, lower y is down.\n> \n> In coordinates: (x,y) with y increasing upwards. So (2,5) is above (2,4), so moving down from (2,5) to (2,4) makes sense.\n> \n> Now, food at (6,4) and (6,1). (6,4) is on the same row as head but to the right. Head at (2,4), food at (6,4), so same y, x=6. x=6 is not a wall? Walls are at x=7, so x=6 is playable. Similarly, y=4 is between 1 and 6.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 is playable.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (4,6). (4,6) has y=6, which is the top row? y=6, and walls at y=7, but y=6 is playable, but (4,6) is blocked by obstacle.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells from y=1 to y=6 are playable. Similarly, x=1 to x=6 except obstacles.\n> \n> (4,6) is at y=6, x=4, which is blocked.\n> \n> Food at (6,4) and (6,1). (6,1) is at y=1, which is the bottom row, but not a wall since walls are at y=0.\n> \n> I need to plan the next moves to maximize score, thinking 5+ turns ahead, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid: 8x8 but borders walls, so 6x6 playable, minus obstacles.\n> \n> x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Obstacle at (4,6), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake: head (2,4), body: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). So the body forms a horizontal line at y=5 from x=2 to x=5.\n> \n> Head is at (2,4), which is directly below (2,5).\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,4): current head direction is D (down). So I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since current direction is D, I cannot move U on the next turn because that would be opposite.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is D, so I cannot move U (up) on turn 14.\n> \n> Possible actions: D (down), L (left), R (right). Moving U is not allowed.\n> \n> Now, evaluate each possible move for turn 14.\n> \n> First, move D: down to (2,3). Is that safe? (2,3) is within bounds: x=2, y=3, both between 1 and 6. No wall. Is it occupied by body? Snake positions: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). (2,3) is not in the list, so empty. Also, after moving, the tail will move, but since we're moving to a new cell, no collision.\n> \n> When the head moves, the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is vacated, but the head occupies a new cell.\n> \n> If I move to (2,3), head to (2,3), then the new positions would be: head (2,3), then the previous head (2,4) becomes body, then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), and tail (5,5) might move or stay? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail segment is left, and a new segment is added only if food is eaten.\n> \n> In this case, no food eaten, so length remains same, tail moves.\n> \n> Current positions: [ (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) ] with head at (2,4).\n> \n> If I move down to (2,3):\n> \n> - New head: (2,3)\n> \n> - Then body: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) — and the tail (5,5) is removed? Positions: the segment that was at (2,4) is now part of body, but since head moved to (2,3), the new body starts from previous head position.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the tail cell is vacated unless food is eaten.\n> \n> So new positions: head at (2,3), then the first body segment at (2,4) (previous head), then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), and since no food, the tail (5,5) is removed. So new snake: [(2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)] with tail at (4,5)? Let's list:\n> \n> - Head moves to (2,3)\n> \n> - The body segments follow: the segment behind head was at (2,4), now it moves to where head was, but head was at (2,4), so it stays? Better to think: the head moves to new position, and each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - New head position: (2,3)\n> \n> - Then the segment that was first body (index 1) moves to where head was, (2,4)\n> \n> - The segment that was index 2 moves to where index 1 was, (2,5)\n> \n> - Index 3 moves to where index 2 was, (3,5)\n> \n> - Index 4 moves to where index 3 was, (4,5)\n> \n> - And the tail, index 4, was at (5,5), but since no food, we don't add a segment, so the tail is removed; that is, the last position is not occupied anymore.\n> \n> Positions after move: head at (2,3), then body segments at previous positions of head and body except the tail is cut off.\n> \n> Initial positions: indices: 0: head (2,4), 1: (2,5), 2: (3,5), 3: (4,5), 4: tail (5,5)\n> \n> After moving head to (2,3):\n> \n> - New head: (2,3)\n> \n> - New body segment 1: position of old head, (2,4)\n> \n> - New body segment 2: position of old segment 1, (2,5)\n> \n> - New body segment 3: position of old segment 2, (3,5)\n> \n> - New body segment 4: position of old segment 3, (4,5)  // since no food, tail is not grown, so old tail position (5,5) is vacated.\n> \n> So new snake: [(2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)] with tail at (4,5).\n> \n> (5,5) is now empty.\n> \n> Similarly for other moves.\n> \n> But for collision check, when moving, I need to ensure the new head position is not a wall, not a body segment except the tail.\n> \n> Now, back to move D to (2,3): (2,3) is free, not wall, not body (since body is at (2,4),(2,5),etc., (2,3) not occupied), so safe.\n> \n> Move L to (1,4): x=1, y=4. x=1 is not wall (walls x=0 and x=7, so x=1 ok), y=4 ok. Not occupied by body: body at y=5 or (2,4), (1,4) is different. (2,4) is head, but we're moving to (1,4), which is not current body. Current body positions: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), all at y=5 except head at (2,4). So (1,4) is free, so safe.\n> \n> Move R to (3,4): (3,4) is free? Body at (3,5), which is above, not (3,4). Head at (2,4), so (3,4) is adjacent, not occupied, so safe.\n> \n> Now, U is not possible because reverse.\n> \n> So possible actions for turn 14: D, L, R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score.\n> \n> Food available: (6,4) with life span 6, so must be eaten by turn 20 (since disappears after turn 20? Life span decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> Life span: at turn 14, food has life span N, it will disappear after N turns, meaning at the start of turn 14+N or after?\n> \n> The problem says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, when we are given state, life span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it is present for this turn and next L-1 turns? Let's see.\n> \n> For example, turn 14, food at (6,4) has life span 6. Countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn 14, countdown is 6. After turn 14, countdown becomes 5, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears after that turn? Or at countdown 0 it is still there?\n> \n> Typically, \"disappears after N turns\" might mean it is available for N turns starting from now.\n> \n> The problem says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, with life span L, the countdown is L. After the turn, it decreases to L-1 for next turn. When countdown reaches 0, after that turn it disappears.\n> \n> So for food at (6,4), life span 6 at turn 14, so:\n> \n> - Turn 14: countdown 6, present\n> \n> - Turn 15: countdown 5, present\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 19: countdown 1, present\n> \n> - Turn 20: countdown 0, present during turn, but after turn 20, it disappears, so not available for turn 21.\n> \n> Similarly, it can be eaten on turn 20 if head moves to it on turn 20.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,1), life span 9, present until turn 23, can be eaten on turn 23.\n> \n> Both foods are positive, value +1.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence to eat food while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's find a path to the food.\n> \n> Food at (6,4) is closer to head than (6,1).

It's turn 16, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid (since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so playable area might be from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, let's clarify.\n> \n> The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning those cells are blocked. So the grid has x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,4), then (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5). So the snake body: head (4,4), then segment 1: (3,4), segment 2: (2,4), segment 3: (2,5), segment 4: (3,5). And head direction is R, which is right, so moving east.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (6,4) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,1) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (1,6) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, value 1, so no negative food here. Good, only rewards.\n> \n> Life span: for (6,4), life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? The rule says \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 16, if life span is 4, it will disappear after turn 19 (since turn 16: countdown 4, turn 17: 3, turn 18: 2, turn 19: 1, then after turn 19 it's gone? Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, at the start of turn t, if life_span is L, then after L turns, it disappears. Since countdown decreases every turn including current, if at turn t, life_span is L, then:\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown becomes L-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, L-2\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn t + L - 1, countdown 1\n> \n> - After turn t + L, it disappears, so not available on turn t+L.\n> \n> For food at (6,4) with life span 4 at turn 16:\n> \n> - Turn 16: available, countdown 4\n> \n> - Turn 17: available, countdown 3\n> \n> - Turn 18: available, countdown 2\n> \n> - Turn 19: available, countdown 1\n> \n> - Turn 20: disappears, not available.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) life span 7 at turn 16: available until turn 22 (since 16+7-1=22, countdown 1 on turn 22, gone on turn 23).\n> \n> Turn 16: life span 7, so after 7 turns, it disappears. After turn 16, countdown 6; after turn 17, countdown 5; ... after turn 22, countdown 1; after turn 23, gone. So last chance to eat is on turn 22.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6) life span 10: available until turn 25 (16+10-1=25, gone on turn 26).\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,4), direction R (right). Possible moves: since head direction is R, I can move R, U, or D, but not L because that would be instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move L on this turn. Possible moves: R (right), U (up), D (down).\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacles.

Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are playable, similarly x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 inclusive are playable. Similarly x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> But (4,6) is given as internal obstacle, and (4,6) has y=6, which is within 1 to 6, so it's a blocked cell.\n> \n> Similarly, snake positions: (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5)\n> \n> So let's plot:\n> \n> Assume x increases right, y increases up?

Walls: y=7 is wall, but (5,5) is within bounds. Internal obstacles: (4,6) is obstacle, but (5,5) is not that. Snake body: positions are (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5). (5,5) is not occupied by body, so should be safe to move if not wall.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3): y=0 is wall, but (5,3) is y=3>0, so within bounds. Not obstacle, not body, so safe.\n> \n> (6,4): has food, but let's check if it's safe. (6,4) is within bounds, x=6<7, y=4>0. Not obstacle. But it has food, and if I move there, I eat it.\n> \n> But I need to think about the tail and future positions.\n> \n> Also, life_span: food at (6,4) has life_span=3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Let's see the rule.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 17, life_span=3, so it will disappear after turn 19?

But after N turns, meaning after N full turns?\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> I think it means that at the start of turn t, if food has life_span L, then after L turns, it disappears. Since countdown decreases each turn, including the current one, so:\n> \n> - At turn t (current), life_span = L\n> \n> - After turn t, life_span becomes L-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn t + L - 1, life_span becomes 0, and it disappears before or after the turn?\n> \n> Typically in such games, food disappears at the end of the turn when countdown reaches 0 or something.

When snake eats food, it grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Rule: when eating positive food, \"Length of snake +1\", so after moving to food, the head is on food, and a new segment is added, so the tail remains in place for that turn, I think.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, you move to the food, and the tail doesn't advance, so length increases.\n> \n> Then next turn, tail moves as usual.\n> \n> In terms of positions: if head moves to food, the body follows, but since tail doesn't move, a new segment is added at the end.\n> \n> So positions: after eating, head is at food, previous head becomes body, and tail stays.\n> \n> For example, current positions: [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5)]\n> \n> If I move R to (6,4), and eat food, then new positions: head (6,4), then (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), and (2,5) remains, so snake becomes [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5)] length 6.\n> \n> Then next move, tail (2,5) will move if head moves away.\n> \n> But (2,4) is now part of body.\n> \n> Now, is moving to (6,4) safe?

No reverse means cannot move opposite to the current direction on the very next turn.\n> \n> Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n> \n> So at turn 18, current direction is R (from turn 17 move), so I cannot move L (left) on turn 18, because that would be opposite.\n> \n> Similarly, I can move U, D, or R, but R to (7,4) is wall, impossible.\n> \n> So possible: U to (6,5) or D to (6,3).\n> \n> Now, (6,5): is it safe?

That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm: walls at x=0 and x=7, so x from 1 to 6? No, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so the grid goes from x=1 to x=6? But y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6?

So the snake is mostly horizontal from (6,4) to (2,4), then up to (2,5). Head direction is R, which is right, but head is at (6,4), and moving right would be to (7,4), but x=7 is a wall, so moving right is impossible. Current head direction is R, but from (6,4), moving right would be to (7,4), which is a wall, so it's blocked.\n> \n> But the snake must move, so I need to choose a different direction. Since head direction is R, but I can't move right, I have to move up, down, or left, but I can't move opposite to current direction instantly? No, the rule says \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so I cannot move left immediately, because left is opposite to right.\n> \n> Directions: U (y+1), D (y-1), L (x-1), R (x+1). So from head at (6,4), current direction R, so possible moves: U, D, or L? But L is left, which is opposite to R, so I cannot move left because it's instant reverse. But moving right is impossible because it's a wall. So only U or D are possible.\n> \n> Let's list possible moves from (6,4):\n> \n> - Right (R): to (7,4) - wall, invalid.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (5,4) - but (5,4) is the second segment of the snake. But the snake body: positions are [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5)]. So (5,4) is occupied by the body. However, the rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, moving left to (5,4): (5,4) is the second segment, not the tail. Tail is at (2,5). So moving to (5,4) would cause collision with body, since it's not the tail.\n> \n> The tail is at (2,5), so (5,4) is a body segment, not tail. Therefore, moving to (5,4) would be fatal.\n> \n> Similarly, moving down: to (6,3), or up to (6,5). Let's see what's there.\n> \n> First, possible cells:\n> \n> - Up (U): (6,5) - what is this? Not in snake positions, not a wall? Walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle (4,6). So (6,5) should be free? y=5, between 1 and 6, x=6, not wall, not obstacle (4,6 is different), so (6,5) is free.\n> \n> - Down (D): to (6,3) - similarly, should be free.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (5,4) - occupied by snake body, fatal.\n> \n> - Right (R): to (7,4) - wall, fatal.\n> \n> Also, cannot move left because it's opposite to current direction R? The rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so moving left would be opposite, so it's not allowed.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible moves are U or D.\n> \n> Now, food available:\n> \n> - (6,1) with value 1, life span 5. So it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. Current turn is 18, so if not eaten, it will disappear after turn 18 + 5 = 23? Life span is 5, so it has 5 turns left, including turn 18. So after turn 18, it has 4 turns left? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The food life-span: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (6,1) with life span 5 on turn 18, it will disappear after turn 18 + 5 - 1? Or on turn 18 + 5?\n> \n> Typically, if countdown decreases every turn including current, then on the turn it spawns, life_span is N, and after N turns, it disappears. But since it decreases each turn, including the current, so on turn t, if life_span is L, it will be gone by turn t + L.\n> \n> For example, on turn t, life_span L, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears after turn t+L-1 or at turn t+L?\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the start of turn t, food has life_span L, it can be eaten during turn t. After the turn, if not eaten, life_span decreases by 1. When life_span reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> But the rule says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning it exists for N turns.\n> \n> In this case, turn 18, food at (6,1) has life_span 5, so it can be eaten on turns 18,19,20,21,22, and disappears after turn 22 or before turn 23? Since countdown decreases including current turn.\n> \n> To be precise: on turn t, if life_span is L, after the turn, if not eaten, life_span becomes L-1. When life_span becomes 0, it disappears, so it can be eaten until life_span is 1, after which it disappears.\n> \n> For L=5 on turn 18:\n> \n> - Turn 18: life_span=5, can be eaten\n> \n> - After turn 18, if not eaten, life_span=4\n> \n> - Turn 19: life_span=4, can be eaten\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 22: life_span=1, can be eaten\n> \n> - After turn 22, if not eaten, life_span=0, disappears, so not available on turn 23.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (1,6) with life span 8, value 1, so it will last until turn 18+8-1=25? Life span 8 on turn 18:\n> \n> - Can be eaten from turn 18 to 25? Turn 18: L=8, after turn L=7; turn 19: L=7, ... turn 25: L=1, can be eaten; after turn 25, L=0, gone.\n> \n> Turn 18 + (8-1) = turn 25 is last chance.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,1): L=5, last chance turn 18+4=22? Turn 18: L=5, eaten or not, after turn L=4; turn 19: L=4; ... turn 22: L=1; after turn 22 L=0 gone. So last chance to eat is turn 22.\n> \n> Turn 22: L=1, can be eaten on turn 22, then disappears.\n> \n> Now back to the snake. Head at (6,4), must move U or D.\n> \n> If I move U to (6,5), or D to (6,3).\n> \n> Food is at (6,1) which is down, and (1,6) which is far left and up.\n> \n> Also, the snake has a segment at (2,5), which is the tail? Snake positions: head (6,4), then (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5). So tail is (2,5), and before that (2,4).\n> \n> The tail is at (2,5), so when the snake moves, the tail will move to where the second last was, I assume.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a new cell, and if not eating, tail moves forward, so the last cell is vacated.\n> \n> If eating, tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, immediate move: from (6,4), I can go U to (6,5) or D to (6,3).\n> \n> (6,3) is closer to food at (6,1), but (6,1) is down, and I might go for it.\n> \n> But I have to consider risks.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (1,6), which is top-left.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid layout.\n> \n> Grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6?

No negative food mentioned, so all are good to eat.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid to visualize:\n> \n> - Walls: all borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and (4,6)\n> \n> - Snake: head (6,5), body (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4). So the snake is mostly on row y=4, from x=2 to x=6, except the head is at (6,5), which is one above.\n> \n> Since head is at (6,5) and direction is U, it just moved up to (6,5) from (6,4) I assume? Positions are given as [(6,5), (6,4), ...], so (6,4) is the first body segment, which was the head before moving up.\n> \n> Current head direction is U, so from (6,4) it moved U to (6,5).\n> \n> Now possible moves from (6,5):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (6,6)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (6,4) but (6,4) is occupied by the body, so that would be a collision unless it's the tail.\n> \n> (6,4) is the first body segment, not the tail.

Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is fine. But is there an obstacle? Internal obstacle at (4,6), which is different. (6,6) should be empty.\n> \n> - D: (6,4) - but (6,4) is occupied by the body segment at index 1. Moving to a body segment is deadly, except for the tail if it moves away.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to (6,4) would collide with body segment at (6,4), which is not the tail. Tail is at (2,4), so (6,4) is a body part, so moving down to (6,4) would cause collision and death.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left or right:\n> \n> - L: (5,5)\n> \n> - R: (7,5) but x=7 is a wall, so cannot move right.\n> \n> x=7 is a wall border, so (7,5) is invalid, wall collision.\n> \n> - D: (6,4) occupied, collision.\n> \n> So possible moves from (6,5):\n> \n> - U: to (6,6)\n> \n> - L: to (5,5)\n> \n> - R: to (7,5) but x=7 wall, so not possible.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: current direction is U, so cannot move D, which is opposite.

Or at the start of turn 23?\n> \n> I think it's better to think: the food is present until the end of turn t + life_span - 1 or something. Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically in such games, if life span is N at turn t, it means after N turns it disappears, so it can be eaten on turns t to t+N-1.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> For example, at turn t, countdown N, after turn t, countdown N-1, and so on, until countdown 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So it can be eaten as long as countdown >0.\n> \n> At turn t, with life span L, it can be eaten on that turn, and the countdown decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, etc., until turn t+L-1, countdown=1, can be eaten, then after that, at turn t+L, it disappears.\n> \n> So for (6,1) at turn 19, life span 4: can be eaten on turns 19,20,21,22.

I'll assume (0,0) is bottom-left, but in coordinates, y=0 is bottom or top? Typically in such problems, y=0 is bottom, but let's confirm from walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y increases upwards or downwards? Not specified, but since it's a grid, I'll assume (x,y) with x from left to right, y from bottom to top, so (0,0) bottom-left, (7,7) top-right.\n> \n> In snake positions: head (5,5), then (6,5) which is to the right, then (6,4) which is down, then (5,4) left, (4,4) left, (3,4) left. So from (5,5) to (6,5) is east, then to (6,4) is south, then to (5,4) is west, to (4,4) west, to (3,4) west.

Snake positions: (5,5) head, (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4). So (5,4) is the fourth segment. If I move down to (5,4), that would be a body collision, which is deadly. So I cannot move down to (5,4) because it's occupied by the body except if it's the tail, but tail is at (3,4), which is not adjacent directly.\n> \n> Let's list all occupied cells by snake: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4).

Life_span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 22, life_span=1 means it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. Since we're at turn 22, and it has life_span 1, it will be gone by turn 23. But we can eat it on turn 22 if we move to it.\n> \n> Life_span: it says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (6,1) with life_span 1, on turn 22, if not eaten, it disappears at the end of turn 22 or before turn 23? I need to clarify.\n> \n> Typically in such games, food is available to be eaten on the turn it's present, and disappears after that turn if life_span reaches zero.

Usually in grids, y=0 is bottom, but here it says U is (x,y+1), so y increases up, so (0,0) is bottom-left, (7,7) top-right? Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> Given border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7 are walls.

(2,5) is within 1-6, no wall. Is it occupied? Snake body: positions are (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4). So (2,5) is not in body, so should be safe, but need to consider if moving there causes collision later.\n> \n> When moving, the head moves to new position, and the tail moves forward, so if head moves to a cell not occupied by body except possibly the tail, it's ok.

But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So collision only if head hits a body segment that is not the tail, or if the tail is there but after eating food, tail doesn't move, so if head eats food on tail cell, it might cause collision.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills snake because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (5,4).

Let me calculate: life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 23, life span 4 means it has 4 turns left, including turn 23. So it will disappear after turn 26 if not eaten. Turn 23: countdown 4, turn 24: 3, turn 25: 2, turn 26: 1, then gone? No, life span is the number of turns it remains, including the current turn. So if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after turn t + N - 1. For example, at turn t, life span N, it exists for turns t to t + N - 1. So for food at (1,6) at turn 23 with life span 4: exists from turn 23 to 26 inclusive? Turn 23: life span 4, so after turn 23, it has 3 left; after turn 24, 2 left; after turn 25, 1 left; after turn 26, 0, so it disappears before turn 27. Similarly, (5,6) with life span 6: from turn 23 to 28, and (3,4) with life span 9: from turn 23 to 31.\n> \n> Food positions: (1,6), (5,6), and (3,4). All have value 1, so all positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, the grid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so it's an 8x8 grid? x from 0 to 7 inclusive, that's 8 cells (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7), similarly for y. But walls are at the borders, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's see: x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> Playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (4,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,5), body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4).

Current turn is 23, and positions are given for turn 23.\n> \n> I need to think about the next moves. I have to provide an action sequence for the next few turns, at least 5+ turns ahead, and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid for clarity. Rows y from 0 to 7, but y=0 and y=7 are walls. Similarly, x=0 and x=7 walls. Internal wall at (4,6).\n> \n> But since y=6 is not a wall? y=7 is wall, y=6 is playable except at (4,6) which is obstacle.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are playable? y=0 is wall, so y=1 is the bottom? Let's define coordinates. Typically, (0,0) might be bottom-left or top-left. But in the snake positions, (2,5) to (6,5) and (6,4). Also food at (1,6), (5,6), (3,4).\n> \n> (1,6): x=1, y=6; (5,6): x=5, y=6; (3,4): x=3, y=4.\n> \n> Since y=7 is wall, y=6 is the top row, I assume.

But (3,5) is the first body segment, and since the snake will move, when the head moves, the body follows, so if head moves to (3,5), which is currently occupied, but after the move, the tail will move away, so it might be ok if it's the tail, but (3,5) is not the tail; it's the segment behind head.\n> \n> Collision rules: head touches any body segment except that it can move to the tail cell because the tail will move, so no collision.\n> \n> In this case, (3,5) is the segment immediately behind head, which is not the tail. The tail is (6,4).\n> \n> So if head moves to (3,5), that cell is currently occupied by the body, and since it's not the tail, it would cause a collision because the body is still there when head moves in.\n> \n> But let's think: when the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front. So if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it will collide because that segment hasn't moved yet.\n> \n> Specifically, only the tail cell is safe to move into because after the move, the tail moves away, so the head occupies the cell that was tail, but since tail moves, it's empty.\n> \n> For any other body segment, if head moves there, that segment is still there, so collision.\n> \n> In this case, (3,5) is occupied by the second segment, which is not tail. Tail is at (6,4). So moving to (3,5) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to any other body cell would be bad.\n> \n> Now, what about (6,4)? That's the tail.

Let's see current snake positions: (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). So (1,5) is not occupied, and y=5 is within 1-6, x=1 within 1-6, no wall or obstacle there.

After move, the head would be at (2,4), but the body segment at (2,4) will move to... let's think about the movement.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front.\n> \n> Current positions:\n> \n> Head: (1,4) – after move, it will be wherever we go.\n> \n> Then segment 1: (2,4) will move to where head was, (1,4)\n> \n> Segment 2: (2,5) will move to (2,4)\n> \n> Segment 3: (3,5) to (2,5)\n> \n> Segment 4: (4,5) to (3,5)\n> \n> Segment 5: (5,5) to (4,5)\n> \n> And tail is (5,5), which will move to (4,5) if head moves elsewhere.\n> \n> If I move right to (2,4), which is currently occupied by segment 1.\n> \n> After move: head moves to (2,4), but segment 1 is still there? No: when head moves to (2,4), since (2,4) was segment 1, but segment 1 will move to the previous head position (1,4). So effectively, head and segment 1 swap positions? But in terms of collision, at the moment of move, if head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment, it collides, except if it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n> \n> The rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, (2,4) is not the tail; it's the first body segment, which is part of the body. The tail is (5,5).\n> \n> So moving to (2,4) would cause head to collide with the body segment at (2,4), which is deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, moving into any body segment except the tail is collision.\n> \n> In this case, (2,4) is not the tail; tail is (5,5). So moving right to (2,4) is invalid because it would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Therefore, from current position (1,4), possible moves are only U to (1,5) or D to (1,3).\n> \n> L is wall, R is body collision.\n> \n> So only two choices: U or D.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, food positions:\n> \n> - (1,6): life span 2, so it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn?

So moving to (1,4) would collide with body.\n> \n> - L to (0,5) invalid wall.\n> \n> - R to (2,5): (2,5) is occupied by a body segment in the new position? After move, positions: (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). So (2,5) is the fourth segment?

But (1,6) might be a move.\n> \n> U to (1,6) is a move, and it's free.\n> \n> If I move U to (1,6), I eat the food there, snake grows.\n> \n> But let's see the tail reward danger.\n> \n> If I eat at (1,6), which is positive food, snake length increases by one, so new tail will be added.\n> \n> But tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Here, after moving to (1,5), tail is at (4,5), not adjacent to (1,6). Adjacent means sharing a side, so (1,6) adjacent to (1,5), (0,6) wall, (2,6), (1,7) wall. (1,6) neighbors: U (1,7) wall, D (1,5), L (0,6) wall, R (2,6).\n> \n> (1,5) is the head, not tail.

Tail is (4,5), but since I ate, a new segment is added, so tail remains or new position?\n> \n> When you eat, the tail doesn't move, so new segment is added at the tail position? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, the head moves to food, you grow, so the tail stays where it is for that turn, meaning the snake gains a segment.\n> \n> After eating, positions: head at food cell, and the body includes all previous segments, so tail is the same as before until next move.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after moving to food and eating, the head is at new position, and the tail does not move, so the snake has an extra segment.\n> \n> In this case: from positions before move: head (1,5), body (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) tail.\n> \n> Move head to (1,6), eat food, so now head at (1,6), and the body segments remain, so positions: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). Length 7, tail at (4,5).\n> \n> Now, from (1,6), possible moves: U to (1,7) but y=7 wall, invalid; D to (1,5), which is now a body segment; L to (0,6) wall; R to (2,6).\n> \n> (2,6) is free?

Previous head (1,4) is now body, but segments: after head moves to (1,3), body: (1,4) [previous head], then (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). Tail (5,5) moves to (4,5)? Positions: head (1,3), then (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). Tail at (4,5).\n> \n> Now from (1,3), possible moves: U to (1,4) - but (1,4) is now a body segment (second segment), so moving there would collide.\n> \n> D to (1,2) - free?

It's turn 27, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) and (7,7) are walls, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm the borders.\n> \n> The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 is inside, similarly y from 1 to 6. But let's see the coordinates given: snake positions include (1,6), (1,5), etc., and y=6 is not a wall? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 should be playable. Similarly, x=1 is playable. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). So the snake has 7 segments. Head direction is U, which is up, so moving towards increasing y? In standard coordinates, U might be (x,y+1), but let's define the coordinate system.\n> \n> The movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). So y increases upwards, I assume, like in math coordinates. But in grid terms, sometimes y increases downwards, but here it's specified as U (x,y+1), so y+1 is up. So (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? Walls: x=0 is left, x=7 is right, y=0 is bottom? y=7 is top? Let's see.\n> \n> Snake head at (1,6), which is x=1, y=6. Since y=7 is top wall, y=6 is high y, so probably y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, so (1,6) is near the top. Head direction U, which is (x,y+1), so towards y=7, but y=7 is wall, so moving up would hit wall if at y=6.\n> \n> Current head position (1,6), head direction U, so next move if I go U would be to (1,7), but y=7 is wall, so that's invalid and deadly. I must avoid that.\n> \n> But I don't have to move U; I can change direction, but with no instant reverse. Current direction is U, so I cannot move D on the next turn. Possible moves are U, L, R, but not D.\n> \n> Current direction U, so next move cannot be D, because that's opposite. So I can move U, L, or R.\n> \n> But moving U to (1,7) is into wall, so invalid. So only possible moves are L or R.\n> \n> L: (x-1,y) so from (1,6) to (0,6), but x=0 is wall, so also invalid. x=0 is left wall, so (0,6) is wall, can't move there.\n> \n> R: (x+1,y) to (2,6). (2,6) is not a wall? Walls are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, and internal obstacles. (2,6) has x=2, y=6, both within 1-6, and not (4,6), so should be free.\n> \n> Internal obstacle is (4,6), so (2,6) is fine.\n> \n> But is (2,6) occupied by snake body? Snake positions: head (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). So body segments: (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). (2,6) is not in this list, so it should be empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (0,6) is wall, (1,7) is wall, so only possible move is R to (2,6).\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead. Also, there are food items.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (5,6,2,1) : position (5,6), life_span=2, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> - (3,4,5,1) : (3,4), life_span=5, value=1\n> \n> - (3,1,8,1) : (3,1), life_span=8, value=1\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive, no negative food here.\n> \n> Life_span: for (5,6) it's 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Current turn is 27, so for (5,6), life_span=2, so it will disappear after turn 27 + 2 - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life_span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will be gone after t + L - 1? No.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at the start of turn t, if a food has life_span L, then after this turn (turn t), countdown becomes L-1. If L-1 >0, it stays, else disappears.\n> \n> Typically, \"after N turns\" might mean it lasts for N turns.\n> \n> But here: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means that on the turn it is spawned, countdown is N, then after each turn, it decreases by 1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or something.\n> \n> But to be precise: \"life-span: Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think: at turn t, with life_span L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? Let's see.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, food has life_span L. After turn t, countdown becomes L-1. After turn t+1, countdown becomes L-2, and so on, until after turn t + L - 1, countdown becomes 0, and it disappears.\n> \n> So it exists for L turns: from turn t to turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> For example, (5,6) at turn 27, life_span=2, so it exists on turn 27 and 28, disappears after turn 28 or at start of turn 29? But since countdown decreases each turn including current, at turn 27, life_span=2, after turn 27 it becomes 1, after turn 28 it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 27 or 28.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4) life_span=5, so from turn 27 to 31, can be eaten turns 27 to 31.\n> \n> (3,1) life_span=8, turns 27 to 34.\n> \n> Now, back to movement. Current head at (1,6), direction U. Possible moves: U to (1,7) but wall, invalid; L to (0,6) wall, invalid; R to (2,6) possible.\n> \n> So only R is possible? But I need to consider if (2,6) is safe.\n> \n> (2,6) is empty, as per positions.\n> \n> After moving to (2,6), the snake body: head moves to (2,6), then the tail: since it's moving, the tail will move forward, so the segment at (1,4) will be removed? Snake movement: when head moves to new cell, a new segment is added if food eaten, else tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> Currently, snake positions: [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)] so tail is (4,5).\n> \n> After moving head to (2,6) without eating, tail moves from (4,5), so new positions: head (2,6), then (1,6) becomes body, (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5). Tail was (4,5), but since no food, tail moves, so (4,5) is removed, and the segment before tail is (3,5), which is now the new end, but since tail moves, the body shifts.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to new cell, if no food, tail moves to the next position, so the last cell is vacated.\n> \n> Positions: current: index 0: (1,6) head, 1: (1,5), 2: (1,4), 3: (2,4), 4: (2,5), 5: (3,5), 6: (4,5) tail.\n> \n> After moving right to (2,6): new head at (2,6), then the body: the old head (1,6) becomes segment 1, then (1,5) becomes segment 2, (1,4) segment 3, (2,4) segment 4, (2,5) segment 5, (3,5) segment 6, and tail (4,5) is removed since no growth. So new positions: [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5)]\n> \n> Tail is now (3,5).\n> \n> Now, at turn 27, I must move, and only possible move is R to (2,6), since U and L are walls.\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (4,6)\n> \n> So (1,6): x=1, y=6, not wall.\n> \n> Move U: (1,7) y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> Move L: (0,6) x=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> Move R: (2,6) x=2,y=6, not wall, not obstacle (obstacle at (4,6)), and not occupied by snake body as per current positions. After move, it might be, but during move, we check if the cell is free.\n> \n> (2,6) is free now.\n> \n> So yes, only possible action at turn 27 is R.\n> \n> But the problem is to think multiple turns ahead, so I need to plan a sequence.\n> \n> After moving to (2,6), head is at (2,6), direction was U, but I moved R, so new direction is R.\n> \n> Then from there, I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse.

Turn 28 I moved to (3,6), not (5,6). (5,6) is at x=5,y=6, I was at (3,6) on turn 28, I could have moved to (4,6) but (4,6) is obstacle, so impossible to reach (5,6) from there. From (3,6), to go to (5,6), I would need to go right, but (4,6) is obstacle, so no direct path. And since only one move per turn, I couldn't reach it on turn 28.

No: when food eaten, head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the snake grows.\n> \n> Specifically: head moves to new cell (with food), the previous positions remain, and the tail doesn't move, so the snake gains one segment.\n> \n> So new positions: head (3,4), then body: (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), and since food eaten, tail stays, so (2,4) is still there, but now it's not the tail; the segment before was (2,4), which is now part of body, and a new segment is added?

No.\n> \n> Standard: when food eaten, the tail does not move, so the segment that was the tail remains, and a new segment is added when the head moves, but the positions: the head moves to the new cell, and the body from the previous head to the tail remains, so the snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> So positions: new head (3,4), then previous head (3,5), then the rest: (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4).

Let me read:\n> \n> \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (5, 6, 1, 1) - (3, 4, 4, 1) - (3, 1, 7, 1) - (2, 6, 10, 1)\"\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - Food at (5,6): value=1, life_span=1\n> \n> - Food at (3,4): value=4, life_span=1? It says \"life_span1\" but I think that's the value. Let's parse:\n> \n> For (5,6,1,1) – that's x=5,y=6, value=1, life_span=1\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4,4,1) – x=3,y=4, value=4, life_span=1\n> \n> (3,1,7,1) – x=3,y=1, value=7, life_span=1? But life_span=1 for all? That can't be right because for (2,6,10,1) it says life_span=10? No:\n> \n> Look: (2,6,10,1) – x=2,y=6, value=10, life_span=1? But (2,6) is where the head is? Snake head is at (2,6), and there's food at (2,6) with value 10? But the food can be under the snake, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it. But head is already on (2,6), so if there's food there, how can it be eaten?\n> \n> Important point: food at (2,6) is listed, but snake head is at (2,6). According to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but it can only be eaten when the body moves away and head moves back onto it. But here, the head is on it now, but since the snake is there, it can't be eaten immediately because the body needs to move away first.\n> \n> Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So in this case, since the head is on (2,6), and food is there, but the body is also on some cells. Specifically, (2,6) has the head, and (1,6) is the first body segment. So to eat this food, the snake needs to move away so that (2,6) is vacated, then later move back to it when the head can land on it.\n> \n> But currently, at turn 28, head is on (2,6) with food, but since the snake occupies it, it can't be eaten now. Only when the snake moves off and back on.\n> \n> Also, life_span for (2,6) food is 10? Let's confirm the values.\n> \n> Food list:\n> \n> 1. (5,6,1,1) – x=5,y=6, value=1, life_span=1. So it will disappear after this turn (turn 28), meaning if not eaten on turn 28, it's gone.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 28, life_span=1, after turn 28, it becomes 0 and disappears. So to eat it, must be on turn 28.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4,4,1) – value=4, life_span=1, must eat on turn 28 or gone.\n> \n> (3,1,7,1) – value=7, life_span=1, must eat on turn 28 or gone.\n> \n> (2,6,10,1) – value=10, life_span=1, must eat on turn 28 or gone? But life_span=1, and it's turn 28, so if not eaten now, it disappears.\n> \n> But the snake is on (2,6), so it can't be eaten now because the body hasn't moved away. Since the head is on it, but the rule requires the body to move away first, then head moves on. But currently, the head is on the food, so to eat it, the snake needs to move off this cell so that it's free, then later move back.\n> \n> But with life_span=1, it will disappear after this turn, so it's impossible to eat this food at (2,6) because it can't be eaten on this turn, and after turn it's gone. Life_span=1 at turn 28, so after turn 28, it disappears. So it can only be eaten on turn 28, but since the snake is on it, it can't be eaten. Therefore, this food is effectively wasted; it can't be consumed.\n> \n> Is that correct? Let me think.\n> \n> The rule says: \"can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto the food cell.\" But if the head is already on it, moving away might not trigger eating; eating only happens when head moves onto a food cell that is free at that moment. Since the food is under the snake, it's not free until the snake moves off.\n> \n> Then, when the head moves back later, if food is still there, it can be eaten. But here, life_span is 1, so after this turn, it's gone, so no chance to eat it. Therefore, the food at (2,6) with value 10 is unattainable and will disappear after this turn without being eaten. So I should ignore it for action planning.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods with life_span=1 must be eaten this turn or lost.\n> \n> Now, food at (3,1,7,1) has life_span=1, but it's far away, at (3,1), while snake is at (2,6), so impossible to reach in one turn, so it will be lost. Similarly, (3,4,4,1) is at (3,4), which might be reachable, but let's see positions.\n> \n> Snake head at (2,6), so possible moves: from (2,6), with direction R (right), so can move U, D, L, R? But no instant reverse: since last direction was R, cannot move L (left) immediately, because that would be opposite.\n> \n> Current head direction is R, meaning it was moving right to (2,6). So possible moves: U (up), D (down), R (right). Cannot move L (left) because that would be reverse.\n> \n> Now, let's list possible moves from (2,6):\n> \n> - U: to (2,7) but y=7 is a wall, since border y=7 is wall, so (2,7) is invalid, wall collision.\n> \n> - D: to (2,5) – now, (2,5) is occupied by the snake body? Snake positions: (2,6) head, (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5)\n> \n> (2,5) is the sixth segment, so it's part of the body, but it's not the tail; tail is (3,5). Moving to (2,5) would be moving into a body segment, which is deadly, except for the tail.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if head moves to a cell where the tail is, and the tail moves away, it's ok. But here, (2,5) is not the tail; it's a body segment, so moving to (2,5) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, R: to (3,6) – is (3,6) free? Let's see what is at (3,6).\n> \n> Walls: x=0,7 y=0,7 walls, so (3,6) is within bounds. Obstacles: (4,6) is an internal obstacle, so (4,6) is wall, but (3,6) should be free.\n> \n> Snake positions: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5) – so (3,6) is not listed, so it should be empty except for possible food.\n> \n> Food: (5,6) is at (5,6), not (3,6). So (3,6) is empty.\n> \n> D: to (2,5) – but (2,5) is occupied by snake body, as per positions, it's the sixth position, so index 5 if head is 0: positions[0] = (2,6) head, positions[1] = (1,6), positions[2] = (1,5), positions[3] = (1,4), positions[4] = (2,4), positions[5] = (2,5), positions[6] = (3,5) tail.\n> \n> So (2,5) is positions[5], which is not the tail; tail is positions[6] = (3,5). So moving to (2,5) would collide with body.\n> \n> L: to (1,6) – but (1,6) is positions[1], the first body segment. Also, moving left is reverse? Current direction is R, moving left is opposite, so cannot because of no instant reverse.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, D, R.\n> \n> U: to (2,7) – y=7 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> D: to (2,5) – occupied by body, collision.\n> \n> R: to (3,6) – empty, valid.\n> \n> But only R is valid? U and D are invalid, L is not allowed due to reverse.\n> \n> U is wall, D is body, L not allowed, so only possible move is R to (3,6).\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so (2,7) is out of bounds, wall.\n> \n> (2,5) is snake body.\n> \n> (1,6) is snake body, and reverse move.\n> \n> (3,6) is free.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (4,6), but that's not affecting (3,6).\n> \n> So indeed, only possible move is R to (3,6).\n> \n> Then, after moving, the snake will have new head at (3,6), and the tail will move forward, so the segment at (1,4) might be left, but the body moves.\n> \n> When snake moves right to (3,6), the head moves to (3,6), and each body segment moves to the next position, so the tail (3,5) moves to where? Let's simulate.\n> \n> Current positions: [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5)]\n> \n> After move R: head to (3,6), then body: the first body segment (1,6) moves to where head was (2,6)? No, in snake movement, when head moves to a new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So new positions: head at (3,6), then positions[1] goes to old head position (2,6), positions[2] goes to old positions[1] which is (1,6), positions[3] goes to old positions[2] (1,5), positions[4] goes to old positions[3] (1,4), positions[5] goes to old positions[4] (2,4), positions[6] (tail) goes to old positions[5] (2,5).\n> \n> Old positions[5] is (2,5), so tail moves to (2,5).\n> \n> So new snake: [(3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5)]\n> \n> Tail was (3,5), which moved to (2,5), so (3,5) is vacated.\n> \n> Now, at turn 28, if I move to (3,6), I don't eat any food, since no food at (3,6).\n> \n> Foods: (5,6) at (5,6), (3,4) at (3,4), (3,1) at (3,1), (2,6) at (2,6) but with life_span=1, and since I moved away, but head didn't move back, and after this turn, it disappears, so not eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,6) has life_span=1, so if not eaten on turn 28, gone.\n> \n> (3,4) life_span=1, gone if not eaten now.\n> \n> (3,1) life_span=1, gone.\n> \n> So all food with life_span=1 will disappear after this turn, and since snake can only move to (3,6), no food eaten, so all lost.\n> \n> But the action sequence is for multiple turns; I need to think ahead for turns after.\n> \n> The question is to provide an action sequence starting from turn 28, for multiple turns, and think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> But at turn 28, I have only one choice: move R to (3,6).\n> \n> Then for subsequent turns, I can plan.\n> \n> Also, after move, the head direction will be R, since I moved right.\n> \n> Now, let's list the food again, but after turn 28, all life_span=1 foods are gone, so only foods with longer life span? But in this state, all foods have life_span=1 except... all listed have life_span=1.\n> \n> (2,6,10,1) has life_span=1, (5,6,1,1) life_span=1, etc., all have life_span=1, so after turn 28, all food disappears? But that can't be right; probably there are other foods or I misread.\n> \n> The food list: (5,6,1,1), (3,4,4,1), (3,1,7,1), (2,6,10,1) all with life_span=1, so all will disappear after turn 28 if not eaten.\n> \n> Since none can be eaten on turn 28 except possibly (2,6) but it can't because snake is on it, so all food gone after turn 28.\n> \n> Then the grid has no food, but new food might spawn?

It's turn 29. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid (since x and y from 0 to 7 inclusive). There's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,6), then body segments: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5).

So it disappears after 4 turns, including this one, so it will be gone after turn 32? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 29, life span 4 means it will last until turn 32? Let's clarify: life span N, disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it's gone at the start of turn t+L or something. I need to be careful.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is given at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn. So at turn t, life span L, then at turn t+1, it's L-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and then it disappears. So for food at (3,4), life span 4 at turn 29: it will be there on turns 29,30,31, and disappear after turn 32 starts? Or at the end of turn 32? I think it's better to think that it disappears when life span reaches 0.\n> \n> Rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\". So if at turn t, life span is N, then after N turns, meaning after turn t + N - 1, it disappears? Let's read: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Example: suppose at turn t, life span N. After turn t, countdown becomes N-1. After turn t+1, N-2, ..., after turn t + (N-1), countdown is 1, then after turn t + N, countdown becomes 0 and it disappears. But \"disappears after N turns\" might mean it is removed before turn t+N or after.\n> \n> To simplify, since we're planning moves, I'll assume that at the start of each turn, we check the food. If life span >0, it's present; after the turn, life span decreases by 1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> But for movement, we care about food present when we move.\n> \n> Similarly for this state:\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (3,4): value 1, life span 4 at turn 29.

Snake positions: [(3,6), (2,6), (1,6), ...] so (2,6) is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> But food can spawn under snake body, as per rules. It says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So (2,6) has food with value 1, life span 9. Since it's under the snake body, it can only be eaten if the snake moves away from that cell and then head moves back.\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so I can only move within x=1 to 6 and y=1 to 6? No, walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So yes, the snake can be on cells from (1,1) to (6,6). Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,5), then body segments: (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4). So the snake has 7 segments. Head direction is down, which is D. Since it's moving down, from (3,5) to (3,6)? Positions are listed as [(3,5), (3,6), ...], so head is at (3,5), and the next segment is (3,6), which is directly below it. Since head direction is D, down, that makes sense; it moved from (3,5) to (3,6) but in the list, (3,5) is head, then (3,6) is the first body segment. So the snake was moving down to (3,6) or something? Let's think about the movement.\n> \n> The positions are given in order: head first, then the body. So at turn t1=30, head is at (3,5), and it just moved there? Head direction is D, down, so it must have come from above. Previous head position? Not given, but we can infer.\n> \n> From the positions: [(3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)]\n> \n> Since head is at (3,5) and direction is D, it means it moved down to (3,5) from, say, (3,4) or something? But (3,4) isn't in the positions; let's see the sequence.\n> \n> The tail is at (2,4), and it goes to (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), head (3,5).

(1,6) to (1,5) is down? y decreases when moving down? Coordinates: let's assume y increases up or down?\n> \n> In movement, U is (x,y+1), which might imply y increases up, but in grid coordinates, often y increases down, but here it's specified: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y).\n> \n> So U: y increases, so probably y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Or y=0 is top? Let's see walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Typically in such games, (0,0) might be top-left, but with U increasing y, it could be bottom-left or top-left.\n> \n> U: (x,y+1) — if y+1, and walls at y=0 and y=7, so if y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, then U (y+1) would move up towards higher y.\n> \n> Similarly, D (y-1) down to lower y.\n> \n> In the snake positions: head at (3,5), then (3,6) — if y=6 is higher than y=5, so (3,6) is above (3,5)? But head direction is D, down, which is decreasing y.\n> \n> If head is at (3,5) and moving D (down, y-1), so it was at (3,6) previous? Positions show head at (3,5), then next is (3,6), so the body segment behind head is at (3,6), meaning the head was at (3,6) before moving to (3,5)? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard snake: the head moves, and body follows. So at turn t, head is at position, and body segments are previous positions.\n> \n> Given positions: [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...] with (x0,y0) head, (x1,y1) first body segment, etc.\n> \n> So at current state, head is at (3,5), and the segment that was head at t-1 is at (3,6). Then (2,6) was head at t-2, and so on.\n> \n> Since head direction is D (down), and it moved from (3,6) to (3,5), so y decreased from 6 to 5, so down direction.\n> \n> Similarly, from (3,6) it came from? Before that, it was at (2,6) at t-2, so from (2,6) to (3,6) which is right, so direction was R at that time, but we don't have past directions, only current head direction.\n> \n> Current head direction is given as D.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (3,4, 3, 1) — this is (x,y, life_span, value) I think?

Value 1, and penalty for negative is -1, but here all are value 1, so all positive.\n> \n> Value: +1 for positive food, -1 for negative. Here all value=1, so all positive food.\n> \n> Life_span: how many turns left, including current turn? \"Life-span disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\"\n> \n> So for food at (3,4), life_span=3, so it will disappear after 3 turns, meaning it can be eaten on turn 30,31,32? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> Let's see: \"life-span: disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for a food with life_span N at turn t, it will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1? Or beginning?\n> \n> Better to think: at the start of turn t, food has life_span L, it can be eaten during turn t, and if not eaten, life_span decreases to L-1 at start of next turn. When life_span reaches 0, it disappears before that turn or after?\n> \n> \"disappears after N turns\" – ambiguous.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so if at turn t, life_span is L, then after turn t, it becomes L-1 for turn t+1, and when L=1, after being available for that turn, it disappears? Or at turn t with L=1, it can be eaten, then disappears.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's standard to assume that at turn t, with life_span L, the food is present and can be eaten; after the turn, if not eaten, life_span decreases, and when life_span becomes 0, it disappears.\n> \n> For example, life_span 3 at turn t: available on t, t+1, t+2; after t+2, if not eaten, disappears before t+3.\n> \n> Similarly, life_span 1: available only on turn t, disappears after.\n> \n> In this case, turn t1=30.\n> \n> Food at (3,4): life_span 3, so available on turns 30,31,32; disappears after turn 32.\n> \n> Food at (3,1): life_span 5, available turns 30 to 34.\n> \n> Food at (2,6): life_span 8, available turns 30 to 37.\n> \n> Now, special cases: food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves on.\n> \n> Here, look at food at (2,6): position (2,6) is occupied by the snake! Snake positions include (2,6), which is the third segment.\n> \n> Snake: [(3,5), (3,6), (2,6), ...] so (2,6) is a body segment.\n> \n> And food is at (2,6) with life_span 8, value 1.\n> \n> So this food is under the snake's body.

Since it's free, I can eat it immediately.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> If I eat, snake grows, so after eating, the tail doesn't move, so new positions: head to (3,4), then body: previous head (3,5) becomes new segment, so snake becomes [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)]? When you eat, the head moves to food, and a new segment is added, so the tail stays.\n> \n> Standard: when you eat, head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, but since tail moves only when not eating, it's a bit confusing.\n> \n> In snake, when you move to a food, you grow, so the head moves to the food, and the tail doesn't move, so the snake gains a segment.\n> \n> So positions: new head at food, then the previous head becomes second segment, and so on, tail unchanged.\n> \n> So after eating at (3,4), snake would be: head at (3,4), then segments: (3,5) (previous head), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4) — but (2,4) is tail, and (1,4) is before tail? Positions: from head: (3,4), then (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), and tail (2,4)? That doesn't make sense; the tail should be the last.\n> \n> The list should be in order: head at (3,4), then the body segments in order from head to tail.\n> \n> Previous snake: positions [(3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)] so the segment after head is (3,6), then (2,6), etc., down to (2,4) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (3,4) and eating, the new position list: head at (3,4), then the previous head (3,5) is now first body, then (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), and (2,4) is still tail, but since we ate, we add a new segment, so the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is (2,4), and we have an additional segment.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows by one segment. So the head moves to the food, and the body follows, but since we ate, the tail stays in place, so the new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> Positions: the new head is at the food cell (3,4). The previous head (3,5) becomes the second segment. The segment that was second, (3,6), becomes third, and so on. The tail (2,4) remains, and since we added a segment, the tail doesn't move, so the new position includes (2,4) and the segment before it is still (1,4), so the list becomes: [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)] — but (2,4) is the last, tail, and (1,4) is before it.\n> \n> The snake has 8 segments now.\n> \n> If I don't eat, head moves to a new position, and tail moves off its position.\n> \n> But in this case, if I move to (3,4) and eat, we grow.\n> \n> (3,4) is free, so I can do that.\n> \n> But is there risk?\n> \n> After moving, head at (3,4), which is below (3,5), so direction would be D still.\n> \n> Then possible next moves.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple steps.\n> \n> Food at (2,6) is under body, so I need to vacate it first.\n> \n> (2,6) is currently occupied by snake, so I need to move so that (2,6) is vacated.\n> \n> In the snake positions, (2,6) is the third segment. When the snake moves, the tail moves, so if I don't eat, the tail (2,4) will move off, but (2,6) is not tail, so it won't be vacated immediately.\n> \n> Let's see the snake movement: when I move, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and tail is removed if not eating.\n> \n> So to vacate (2,6), I need the snake to move so that the segment at (2,6) moves to another position, and no new segment is added there.\n> \n> Since (2,6) is not the tail, when I move, the segment at (2,6) will move to the position that was occupied by the segment before it in the chain.\n> \n> In the list, segments: index 0: head (3,5), 1: (3,6), 2: (2,6), 3: (1,6), 4: (1,5), 5: (1,4), 6: tail (2,4)\n> \n> When I move the head to a new position, say to P, then new head is P, segment 1 moves to old position of head (3,5), segment 2 moves to old position of segment 1 (3,6), segment 3 moves to old position of segment 2 (2,6)? Old position of segment 2 is (2,6), so segment 3 moves to (2,6)? Let's clarify.\n> \n> After moving head to new position, the new position of each body segment is the old position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So for segment i, it moves to the old position of segment i-1, for i>=1.\n> \n> Segment 0 (head) moves to new position.\n> \n> Then segment 1 moves to where segment 0 was.\n> \n> Segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was.\n> \n> Etc.\n> \n> In this case, if I move head to, say, (3,4), then:\n> \n> New head: (3,4)\n> \n> New segment 1: old position of head, (3,5)\n> \n> New segment 2: old position of segment 1, which was (3,6)\n> \n> New segment 3: old position of segment 2, which was (2,6)\n> \n> New segment 4: old position of segment 3, (1,6)\n> \n> New segment 5: old position of segment 4, (1,5)\n> \n> New segment 6: old position of segment 5, (1,4)\n> \n> And segment 6 was tail, so tail was (2,4), but it moves to (1,4), and since we didn't eat, the tail is removed, so the new tail is at (1,4), but segment 6 is now at (1,4), and the old tail (2,4) is vacated.\n> \n> Positions: old segment 5 was (1,4), so new segment 6 moves to old position of segment 5, which was (1,4), so it stays?

When the snake moves, seg 2 will move to the old position of seg 1, which is (3,6), so if I move, (2,6) will be vacated only if no segment moves to it, but in the new positions, the cell (2,6) might be occupied by a different segment.\n> \n> In the move above, when I moved to (3,4), new seg 3 is at (2,6), so (2,6) is still occupied.\n> \n> To vacate (2,6), I need the segment that was at (2,6) to move to another cell, and no other segment moves to (2,6).\n> \n> Since seg 2 is at (2,6), it will move to where seg 1 was, which is (3,6), so after move, (2,6) is empty, because no segment is moving to (2,6); the new position at (2,6) is for the segment that was after, but in the chain, the cell (2,6) is left empty when seg 2 moves to (3,6).\n> \n> In the example above, when I moved head to (3,4), the new position for what was seg 2 is at (3,6), so the cell (2,6) is no longer occupied; it's free now.\n> \n> Similarly, in general, when the snake moves, the tail cell is vacated, and other cells may change, but each cell that was occupied might be vacated if not reoccupied.\n> \n> Specifically for (2,6): old position, occupied by seg 2. After move, seg 2 moves to (3,6), so (2,6) is empty. Also, no other segment moves to (2,6) because the segments move to previous positions.\n> \n> So after any move, (2,6) will be vacated, since the snake moves forward.\n> \n> In this case, after turn 30, when I move the head, the body will shift, and (2,6) will be left empty, so the food at (2,6) can be eaten if head moves there later.\n> \n> Similarly for other cells.\n> \n> Now, back to turn 30.\n> \n> Possible actions from (3,5) with direction D: can move D, L, or R.\n> \n> Move D to (3,4): has food, so I can eat it.

But internal obstacle at (4,6), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Also, snake positions: head at (3,4), direction D (down), so moving down.\n> \n> Snake body: [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4)]\n> \n> Head is (3,4), and it's moving down. Direction is D, so from (3,4), moving down would go to (3,3), but let's list all positions:\n> \n> Index 0: (3,4) head\n> \n> Index 1: (3,5)\n> \n> Index 2: (3,6)\n> \n> Index 3: (2,6)\n> \n> Index 4: (1,6)\n> \n> Index 5: (1,5)\n> \n> Index 6: (1,4)\n> \n> Index 7: (2,4) tail\n> \n> Since head is at (3,4) and direction is down, it must have come from above? Direction D means it's facing down, so last move was down, so from (3,5) to (3,4)? But (3,5) is index 1, which is behind the head.\n> \n> Snake positions are listed head first, so at turn 31, head is at (3,4), and it moved to there from previous position. Since direction is D, it was moving down, so previous head position was at (3,5) at turn 30, and it moved down to (3,4).\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (3,1) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,6) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,1) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (3,1), life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 31, life span 4 means it will disappear after turn 34 (since turn 31,32,33,34; after 4 turns).\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) life span 7, disappears after turn 37.\n> \n> (4,1) life span 10, disappears after turn 40.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns.\n> \n> First, what are possible moves from current position.\n> \n> Head at (3,4), direction D (down). So I can move: down to (3,3), left to (2,4), or right to (4,4). Cannot move up because that would be opposite direction, and no instant reverse.\n> \n> Current direction is D, so I cannot move U (up) next.\n> \n> Possible moves: D, L, R.\n> \n> Now, check for collisions or walls.\n> \n> Moving D to (3,3): is (3,3) occupied or wall?\n> \n> Walls: x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls, so (3,3) is within 1 to 6, so not wall. Internal obstacle at (4,6), not here. Snake body: positions are (3,4) head, (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4). (3,3) is not in this list, so free. But when I move, the snake moves, so after move, head goes to (3,3), tail moves away, so (2,4) is tail, it will move, so (3,3) should be safe.\n> \n> Similarly, move L to (2,4): (2,4) is currently the tail. Since tail will move when head moves, it's safe to move to tail position, because tail vacates the cell.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So (2,4) is tail, moving to (2,4) is safe, as long as no other body part is there, but tail is there, and it moves.\n> \n> After move, head is at (2,4), and tail moves to next position.\n> \n> Similarly, move R to (4,4): (4,4) is empty? Snake positions: no (4,4), so free.\n> \n> Now, also, food at (2,6) is on a body segment? (2,6) is index 3 in snake positions: (2,6) is a body segment.\n> \n> Food at (2,6) with value 1, but it's under the snake body. Rule: it can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Currently, (2,6) is occupied, so cannot eat it now.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (3,1) and (4,1) are free, I think.\n> \n> (3,1) and (4,1) are not in snake positions, so free cells with food.\n> \n> Now, I need to think long-term. Maximize score, but prioritize survival.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since walls at 0 and 7.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Similarly x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal wall at (4,6), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake: head (3,4), body: (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4) tail.\n> \n> So the snake is coiled around the top-left corner.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (3,1) at bottom? y=1 is bottom, since y=0 wall, so y=1 is the lowest row.\n> \n> Assuming y increases upwards or downwards? In coordinates, it says U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), so y increases as we go up? U is y+1, so y increases upwards.\n> \n> In standard coordinates, often y=0 at bottom, but here: U (x,y+1), so if y increases, U is up.\n> \n> Similarly, D (x,y-1) down.\n> \n> Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 top wall, so y from 1 to 6, with y=1 bottom, y=6 top.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right, so x=1 left, x=6 right.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - (3,1): x=3, y=1, bottom row\n> \n> - (2,6): x=2, y=6, top row, but occupied by snake body\n> \n> - (4,1): x=4, y=1, bottom row\n> \n> Now, head at (3,4), which is middle, y=4.\n> \n> Now, life spans: (3,1) disappears after turn 34, so 4 turns from now: turns 31,32,33,34; it exists on turns 31,32,33, disappears after turn 34? Countdown decreases each turn including current.\n> \n> At turn 31, life span 4, so after turn 31, life span 3, then 2, then 1, then 0, so it exists until turn 34, and disappears at the start of turn 35? I need to clarify.\n> \n> The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, with life span N, after the turn, it decreases to N-1.\n> \n> But when can it be eaten? During the turn when head moves to it.\n> \n> The food is present on a turn if life span > 0 at the start of the turn.\n> \n> For example, at turn 31, life span 4, so food is present.\n> \n> After turn 31, life span becomes 3, so on turn 32, life span 3, etc.\n> \n> It can be eaten on turn t if life span at start of t is >=1.\n> \n> After eaten or after life span 0, it disappears.\n> \n> For (3,1), life span 4 at turn 31:\n> \n> - Turn 31: can be eaten, life span 4\n> \n> - Turn 32: life span 3, can be eaten\n> \n> - Turn 33: life span 2, can be eaten\n> \n> - Turn 34: life span 1, can be eaten\n> \n> - Turn 35: life span 0, disappears, cannot be eaten.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves from (3,4) at turn 31.\n> \n> Options: D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4).\n> \n> (2,4) is tail, so moving there is safe, and since it's not food, no growth, just move.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,3) and (4,4) no food.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan for multiple turns to eat food while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's consider going for the food at (3,1) or (4,1), since (2,6) is under body and might be tricky.\n> \n> (2,6) has life span 7, so plenty of time, but it's currently occupied.\n> \n> To eat (2,6), I need the body to move away and head to move there.\n> \n> Currently, (2,6) is occupied by the body at index 3.\n> \n> The snake will move, so positions change.\n> \n> For example, if I move down to (3,3), then new head is (3,3), tail is (2,4) moves to where? Snake positions: after move, head to new position, each segment moves to previous position.\n> \n> After moving down to (3,3):\n> \n> New positions: head (3,3), then body: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), and tail was (2,4), but since head moved, the segment that was at (2,4) is not part of body, and new tail is (1,4)?

No: each segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the preceding segment.\n> \n> So after moving head to (3,3):\n> \n> - Head: (3,3)\n> \n> - Body segment 1 (was at index 1, (3,5)) moves to where head was, (3,4)\n> \n> - Body segment 2 (was at (3,6)) moves to where segment 1 was, (3,5)\n> \n> - Body segment 3 (was at (2,6)) moves to where segment 2 was, (3,6)\n> \n> - Body segment 4 (was at (1,6)) moves to where segment 3 was, (2,6)\n> \n> - Body segment 5 (was at (1,5)) moves to where segment 4 was, (1,6)\n> \n> - Body segment 6 (was at (1,4)) moves to where segment 5 was, (1,5)\n> \n> - Tail segment 7 (was at (2,4)) moves to where segment 6 was, (1,4)\n> \n> So new positions: head (3,3), body: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) tail.\n> \n> (2,6) is still occupied, by the body segment that moved there from (1,6)?

It's turn 32. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,3), then body segments at (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4). So the snake has 8 segments.

Let's check: snake positions include (2,6), which is the fifth segment. So food at (2,6) is under the snake's body.\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1 and life span 9.\n> \n> All food has positive value +1, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's visualize the grid. I'll sketch a grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> Snake: head at (3,3), body: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4). So the tail is at (1,4).\n> \n> Head direction D, so it was moving down to (3,3) from previous position. Since head is at (3,3) and direction is D, that means it came from (3,4)? Positions are listed head first: (3,3) is head, then (3,4) is next, which is the segment behind the head.\n> \n> Since head direction is D, and head is at (3,3), that means in the last turn, head was at (3,4) and moved down to (3,3). So current direction is downward.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: I can go Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). But I cannot instantly reverse direction. Since current head direction is D (down), I cannot move Up (U) because that would be opposite. So forbidden move is U.\n> \n> Allowed moves: D, L, R. Down, Left, Right.\n> \n> But moving down: to (3,2). Is that valid? Let's see what's there.\n> \n> First, check for walls: (3,2) is within bounds, x=3 between 0 and 7, y=2 between 0 and 7, not a border cell since borders are x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (3,2) is not a wall. Internal obstacles: (4,6) is not (3,2), so ok.\n> \n> Now, snake body: positions are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4). (3,2) is not in this list, so it should be empty, unless food, but food is at (3,1), (2,6), (4,1). (2,6) is occupied by snake body.\n> \n> (3,2) has no food, so moving down to (3,2) is safe, no collision.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left: from (3,3) to (2,3). (2,3): x=2,y=3. Not wall, not obstacle. Snake positions: (2,3) not in list, so empty. Food? Not listed, so no food.\n> \n> Moving right: to (4,3). (4,3): not wall, not obstacle. Snake positions? Not in, so empty. No food.\n> \n> All immediate moves seem safe, but I need to consider food and future states.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (3,1): value +1, life span 3, so disappears at turn 35? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 32, life span 3 means it has 3 turns left including turn 32, so after turn 32, 2 left; after turn 33, 1 left; after turn 34, 0 left, so it disappears before turn 35. So it can be eaten on turn 32, 33, or 34.\n> \n> - (2,6): value +1, life span 6. But it's under the snake body at (2,6). To eat it, the snake body must move away, and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, (2,6) is occupied by the snake, so we can't eat it now. It will be available only when the snake moves away from that cell.\n> \n> Life span 6, so it has 6 turns including turn 32, so it will disappear after turn 37? Let's calculate: life span N, disappears after N turns from now, meaning after turn 32 + N - 1 or something.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, with life span L, it disappears after L turns, meaning it is present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and gone at turn t+L.\n> \n> For (2,6): life span 6 at turn 32, so it is present on turns 32,33,34,35,36,37? Disappears after 6 turns, so if life span is 6 at turn 32, it decreases to 5 at turn 33, 4 at turn 34, ..., to 0 at turn 37, and disappears before turn 38. Standard: countdown from L to 1, disappears when countdown reaches 0 after the turn it is decreased.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the start of turn t, food has remaining life. When the countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> For (2,6) at turn 32, life span 6, so remaining life: 6. After turn 32, it decreases to 5, still present. After turn 33, to 4, and so on, until after turn 37, it decreases to 0 and disappears, so not available on turn 38.\n> \n> Similarly, for (3,1): life span 3 at turn 32, after turn 32, decreases to 2; after turn 33, to 1; after turn 34, to 0 and disappears. So available on turns 32,33,34.\n> \n> (4,1): life span 9, available for many turns.\n> \n> Now, (2,6) is under snake body. Snake segment at (2,6) is the fifth segment. When the snake moves, the tail moves, so if the snake doesn't grow, the tail will move away.\n> \n> Currently snake length is 8, no growth yet.\n> \n> If we eat food, length increases.\n> \n> But for (2,6), since it's under the body, we need to move the snake so that the body leaves (2,6), then head can move there to eat it.\n> \n> Specifically, (2,6) is occupied, so when the snake moves, if no food eaten, the tail will move to (1,3) or something, let's see current tail.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (3,3), then (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) tail.\n> \n> So tail is at (1,4).\n> \n> When snake moves, if no food eaten, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the previous position, so tail at (1,4) will be removed, and new tail will be at (1,5)? Let's think.\n> \n> After one move without eating, head moves to new cell, and tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> For example, if snake moves down to (3,2), then new positions: head (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5). Tail was (1,4), which is removed, so (1,5) is new tail.\n> \n> Similarly, if move left to (2,3), positions: head (2,3), then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5). Tail (1,4) removed.\n> \n> If move right to (4,3), head (4,3), then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5). Tail (1,4) removed.\n> \n> In all cases, the cell (2,6) is still occupied by the body; in the new positions, (2,6) is now the segment that was previously at (3,6) or something.\n> \n> After move down to (3,2): positions: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5). So (2,6) is still occupied.\n> \n> Similarly for other moves, (2,6) remains occupied because it's not the tail.\n> \n> The tail is at (1,4), which is being vacated.\n> \n> (2,6) is the fifth segment, so to vacate (2,6), the snake needs to move several times until that segment becomes the tail and moves away.\n> \n> Currently, the segment at (2,6) will move to (1,6) or something when the snake moves, but it stays occupied until the tail passes that point.\n> \n> Let's see the order: positions index from head: 0: (3,3), 1: (3,4), 2: (3,5), 3: (3,6), 4: (2,6), 5: (1,6), 6: (1,5), 7: (1,4) tail.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So segment 1 moves to where head was, segment 2 to where seg1 was, etc., tail is removed.\n> \n> So after one move, say down to (3,2): new head (3,2), then seg1 to old head (3,3), seg2 to (3,4), seg3 to (3,5), seg4 to (3,6), seg5 to (2,6), seg6 to (1,6), seg7 to (1,5). Tail (1,4) gone, so (1,5) is new tail. (2,6) is still occupied by seg5.\n> \n> After another move, if no eat, head moves, say again down to (3,1), then positions: head (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6). Tail was (1,5), gone. (2,6) occupied by seg6.\n> \n> Still occupied.\n> \n> (2,6) will be occupied until the segment that was at (2,6) moves away or becomes tail.\n> \n> The segment that is currently at (2,6) is index 4. When the snake moves, this segment moves to the position of index 3, which is (3,6). So it leaves (2,6) and goes to (3,6), but (3,6) might be occupied later, but (2,6) is vacated only if no other segment moves there immediately, but since segments move sequentially, (2,6) is vacated when the segment there moves to the next position.\n> \n> In the first move, when snake moves, the segment at (2,6) moves to where the previous segment was, which is (3,6) in this case, so (2,6) is left empty, and (3,6) is now occupied by that segment.\n> \n> Similarly, the cell is vacated when the segment moves out.\n> \n> In the first move down to (3,2): head to (3,2), seg1 to (3,3), seg2 to (3,4), seg3 to (3,5), seg4 to (3,6), seg5 to (2,6) — seg5 was at (2,6), but now moves to where seg4 was, which is (3,6)? Positions: old positions: head (3,3), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (3,6), seg4 (2,6), seg5 (1,6), seg6 (1,5), seg7 (1,4)\n> \n> After move down: new head (3,2), new seg1: old head (3,3), new seg2: old seg1 (3,4), new seg3: old seg2 (3,5), new seg4: old seg3 (3,6), new seg5: old seg4 (2,6), new seg6: old seg5 (1,6), new seg7: old seg6 (1,5). Old seg7 (1,4) is removed.\n> \n> So the cell (2,6) was occupied by old seg4, but new seg5 is at (2,6) because it moved to old seg4 position. So (2,6) is still occupied, now by new seg5.\n> \n> Similarly, the cell (2,6) remains occupied because the segment that was there moves, but another segment moves in or the same segment is now at a different position? In this case, new seg5 is at (2,6), which was previously occupied by old seg4, so it's the same cell, still occupied.\n> \n> To vacate (2,6), we need the snake to move so that no segment is at (2,6). That happens when the segment that is at (2,6) moves to another cell, and no other segment moves to (2,6) immediately.\n> \n> In the current setup, (2,6) is occupied by seg4. When the snake moves, seg4 moves to the position of seg3, which is (3,6), so it leaves (2,6). Then, the next segment, seg5, moves to where seg4 was, which is (2,6), so seg5 moves to (2,6), thus (2,6) is occupied again by seg5.\n> \n> As long as the snake doesn't grow, the body segments shift, but the cell (2,6) is always occupied by some segment until the tail passes it.\n> \n> Currently, the tail is at (1,4). The segment at (2,6) is fixed in position relative to the head, but as the snake moves, the body moves, and (2,6) will be vacated when the tail reaches that point or something.\n> \n> Let's see the distance from head.\n> \n> Head at (3,3), (2,6) is occupied by the 4th segment behind head? Index 4, so 4 segments behind.\n> \n> When the snake moves, each segment moves forward, so the position (2,6) will be occupied by different segments, but the cell is only vacated when the tail is at that cell and the snake moves without eating, so the tail moves away.\n> \n> The tail is currently at (1,4). To vacate (2,6), the tail needs to be at (2,6) and then move away.\n> \n> The tail is at (1,4). From there, it can move to (1,5) or other, but let's see the path.\n> \n> The cell (2,6) is currently occupied by a body segment. The number of moves until it is vacated depends on how many segments are behind it.\n> \n> From head to (2,6): head at index 0, (2,6) at index 4, so there are 4 segments between head and that cell, including the head? Positions: index 0: head (3,3), index 1: (3,4), index 2: (3,5), index 3: (3,6), index 4: (2,6). So (2,6) is 4 segments away from head, meaning it will take 4 moves for the head to be far enough that this cell becomes the tail, but only if the snake doesn't grow.\n> \n> After k moves without eating, the segment that was at index k will become the tail when the tail moves k times.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at index 7, (1,4).\n> \n> The segment at index 4, (2,6), will become the tail after (7-4) = 3 moves, because there are 3 segments behind it (index 5,6,7).\n> \n> Index 4 has indices 5,6,7 behind it, so 3 segments behind.\n> \n> After 3 moves without eating, the segment that was at index 4 will be at the tail position.\n> \n> For example, after first move, tail is at old index 6 position.\n> \n> After second move, tail at old index 5 position.\n> \n> After third move, tail at old index 4 position.\n> \n> Then on the fourth move, if no eat, tail moves away from that cell.\n> \n> So for (2,6), it is currently occupied by index 4 segment. After 3 moves without eating, it will be the tail cell. Then on the fourth move, if we move and no eat, the tail leaves, vacating (2,6).\n> \n> But during these moves, (2,6) is still occupied until that point.\n> \n> After 3 moves, when it becomes tail, it is still occupied. On the next move, when the snake moves, the tail leaves, so (2,6) is vacated.\n> \n> So for (2,6) to be vacated, it takes 4 moves: after 3 moves, it is tail, after 4th move, it is empty.\n> \n> Let's clarify:\n> \n> - Turn 32: (2,6) occupied by body.\n> \n> - After 3 moves (turns 32,33,34) without eating, at the start of turn 35, the segment that was at (2,6) is now the tail at some position.\n> \n> Assume no growth.\n> \n> After turn 32 move: as above, positions shift, (2,6) still occupied.\n> \n> After turn 33 move: similar, (2,6) occupied.\n> \n> After turn 34 move: after three moves, the tail is now at what was index 4 position at turn 32, which is (2,6), but after three moves, it has moved.\n> \n> At turn 32, position of index 4 is (2,6).\n> \n> After one move (turn 32 action), new positions, index 4 is at old index 3 position or something.

No.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Normally, when moving without eating: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, so tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> When eating food: head moves to food cell, but instead of tail moving, a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail stays, and the snake grows.\n> \n> So the cell that was tail remains occupied, and head moves to food.\n> \n> In terms of positions: suppose before move, head at H, body B1, B2, ..., tail T.\n> \n> After moving to non-food: new head at new position, B1 moves to H, B2 to B1, ..., T moves to previous position of the segment before it, so T cell is vacated.\n> \n> After moving to food: new head at food, B1 moves to H, B2 to B1, ..., but T does not move, and a new segment is added at T, so the tail is still at T, but now it's not the tail anymore; the new segment is added, so the tail becomes the new segment at T.\n> \n> Positions: after eating, the head is at food, and the body includes all previous segments plus the old tail position has a new segment, so the snake is one longer, tail is the same cell.\n> \n> For example, current positions: head (3,2), body (3,3) to (1,5) tail.\n> \n> If I move D to (3,1), which has food, so I eat it. Then new head is (3,1), and the body segments move: (3,3) moves to (3,2), (3,4) to (3,3), (3,5) to (3,4), (3,6) to (3,5), (2,6) to (3,6)? No.\n> \n> The body segments shift: the first body segment (3,3) moves to the head's old position (3,2), (3,4) moves to (3,3), (3,5) to (3,4), (3,6) to (3,5), (2,6) to (3,6)?

It's turn 34. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (4,6). So, the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, except where blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,1), then (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5). So the snake is 9 segments long. Head direction is down, which is D. Since the head is at (3,1) and direction is D, moving down would go to (3,0), but y=0 is a wall, so I can't move down because it's a border wall. That's important.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,1). Direction D means last move was down, but since the head is at (3,1) and direction is D, it came from above, so it was at (3,2) before? Let's list the positions: snake is [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)]. So head is at (3,1), which is the first element. The segment behind it is (3,2), so the head moved down to (3,1) from (3,2)? But direction is given as D, which is down. If head is at (3,1) and direction is D, that means it was moving down to get to (3,1), so from (3,2) to (3,1) is down? y decreases as we go down? Let's clarify coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y=0 is top or bottom? The walls are given: y=0 and y=7 are borders. It doesn't specify, but often in such games, y increases downward or upward. But here, since moving down from (3,2) to (3,1) suggests that y=1 is below y=2? Let's see the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), then (2,6), (1,6), (1,5). So y values: from head to tail: y=1,2,3,4,5,6,6,6,5. So y=6 is above y=5? No: (3,1) to (3,6) with y increasing, so if y=1 is bottom and y=6 is top? But walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders. Probably y=0 is bottom or top? Movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). So if U increases y, that might mean y increases upward, but let's see the tail.\n> \n> From (1,6) to (1,5), which is down if y decreases downward. I think it's standard to have y=0 at the top, so increasing y goes down. But let's confirm.\n> \n> In the movement constraints: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1). If y increases downward, then U (up) would decrease y, but here U is (x,y+1), so y+1 for up, which suggests y increases as we go down. So y=0 is top, y=7 is bottom? Walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders. If y=0 is top, y=7 bottom, then moving down from (x,y) to (x,y+1) since D is (x,y-1)? No.\n> \n> Movement definitions:\n> \n> - U: (x, y+1)  // up increases y? That would mean y increases upward.\n> \n> But then D: (x, y-1) down decreases y? That seems inconsistent with typical coordinates.\n> \n> Perhaps it's a coordinate system where (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? I need to assume.\n> \n> Look at the snake positions: head at (3,1), and direction D down. If it moves down, it would go to (3,0), but y=0 is a wall border. Similarly, positions like (3,6) to (2,6) to (1,6) to (1,5). When it moves from (1,6) to (1,5), if y decreases, that might be up or down.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, let's think in terms of the grid boundaries.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are borders. So the playable grid is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> Now, head at (3,1). Since direction is D, and D is (x,y-1), so from (3,2) to (3,1) would be moving to lower y, which is down if y=1 is below y=2? Let's define: assume that y=0 is the top row, y=1 is below it, up to y=7 bottom. But y=0 is a border, so y=1 is the top row of playable area? No.\n> \n> The border cells are x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, meaning these are walls, so the grid has cells from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6.\n> \n> y=1 to y=6, with y=1 being one side, y=6 the other.\n> \n> But movement: U (x,y+1) — if y increases, and U is up, that means y increases as we go down. For example, from (3,1) moving U would be to (3,2), which has higher y, so if y increases downward, (3,2) is below (3,1).\n> \n> Similarly, D (x,y-1) would be to lower y, which is above if y increases down.\n> \n> But in the snake positions, head at (3,1), then (3,2), which is behind, so if the snake is moving down to (3,1), from (3,2), that means (3,2) is above (3,1), so y=2 > y=1, and y increases downward. So y=1 is above y=2? No.\n> \n> Let's list positions in order: head (3,1), next segment (3,2), so the head is at (3,1), and the body is at (3,2), meaning the head moved toward lower y to reach (3,1) from (3,2)? That doesn't make sense for movement.\n> \n> I think I have a confusion in the snake position list.\n> \n> Snake positions are given as a list: [ (x0,y0), (x1,y1), ... ] with head first, body segments follow. So (x0,y0) is head, (x1,y1) is the first body segment, which is adjacent to head.\n> \n> Direction is given as head direction, which is the direction it was moving to get to the current position.\n> \n> Here, head at (3,1), direction D down. So it was moving down to (3,1), so it came from (3,2) because moving down to (3,1) means from a higher y to lower y, if down decreases y.\n> \n> D is (x,y-1), so from (x,y) to (x,y-1) is down, meaning y decreases as we go down? That's unusual.\n> \n> Perhaps the coordinate system has y=0 at the top, so moving down increases y? But the movement says U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), which would be inconsistent.\n> \n> U: (x,y+1) — if y+1 for up, that suggests y increases as we go up, but then D (x,y-1) down would decrease y, which is down.\n> \n> But in terms of position, if y increases up, then (3,1) to (3,2) is moving up if y2>y1.\n> \n> But in the snake, head at (3,1), body at (3,2), so if the head is at (3,1) and body at (3,2), that means the head moved from (3,2) to (3,1) or from elsewhere?\n> \n> The list is positions, so the head is at (3,1), and the next segment is at (3,2), so the vector from head to body is from (3,1) to (3,2), which is increasing y, so if y increases up, that means the body is above the head, so the head is facing down.\n> \n> Similarly, from (3,2) to (3,3) increasing y, so body above, so the snake is moving down.\n> \n> Then from (3,6) to (2,6), which is decreasing x, so left, then to (1,6), left, then to (1,5), decreasing y, so down or up? (1,6) to (1,5), y from 6 to 5, decreasing y. If y increases up, decreasing y is down.\n> \n> So overall, the snake has been moving down and left.\n> \n> Head at (3,1), which is low y, and since y increases up, (3,1) is below (3,2), so head is at bottom.\n> \n> Playable grid y from 1 to 6, with y=1 bottom, y=6 top? But walls y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is below y=1 or above? Since y=0 is border, and snake at y=1, which is adjacent to y=0 wall.\n> \n> Similarly, at the top, (3,6) is at y=6, adjacent to y=7 wall.\n> \n> So for head at (3,1), moving down D to (x,y-1) would be to (3,0), which is y=0, a wall, so I cannot move down because it's a wall collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left L to (2,1), or right R to (4,1), or up U to (3,2).\n> \n> But up to (3,2) is the body segment, so it would be a collision if I move there, but the rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> The tail segment is at (1,5), so if I move to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's ok, but here (3,2) is not the tail; it's the second segment.\n> \n> Let's list all body positions: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5). So the cells occupied by snake: (3,1) head, (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5).\n> \n> If I move up to (3,2), that's a body segment, so collision, death.\n> \n> Similarly, moving down to (3,0) is wall, death.\n> \n> Moving left to (2,1): is (2,1) occupied? From the list, (2,1) is not in positions, so it's free? Positions are (3,1), (3,2), etc., no (2,1), so (2,1) should be free.\n> \n> Moving right to (4,1): similarly, not in positions, so free.\n> \n> But I need to check for walls or obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal (4,6). So (4,1) is not a wall, playable.\n> \n> (2,1) similarly.\n> \n> Also, food positions.\n> \n> Food: (2,6,4,1) — this is (x,y, life_span, value). Format: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) but in input it's given as (2,6,4,1), which might be (x,y, life_span, value), so (2,6) with value 1, life_span 4.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1,7,1) : (4,1) value 1, life_span 7\n> \n> (5,1,10,1) : (5,1) value 1, life_span 10\n> \n> All positive food, value +1.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn.\n> \n> Current turn t=34.\n> \n> For food at (2,6): life_span 4, so it will disappear after 4 turns, meaning on turn 34+4=38 it disappears, but since countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn 34, life_span=4, so after this turn, if not eaten, it becomes 3, then 2, then 1, then 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 34,35,36,37, disappears on turn 38.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1) life_span 7, so can be eaten until turn 34+7-1=40? Let's see: at turn t, life_span L, it can be eaten on turn t if L>0, then after eating or not, L decreases by 1 each turn. So with L=4 at t=34, it can be eaten on t=34,35,36,37 (since on t=37, L=1, eaten, then gone; if not eaten on t=37, L=0 on t=38 and gone).\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, back to movement options at head (3,1), direction D.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (3,1+1) = (3,2) — but (3,2) is occupied by body, so collision, death. Cannot.\n> \n> - D: to (3,1-1) = (3,0) — y=0 wall, collision, death. Cannot.\n> \n> - L: to (3-1,1) = (2,1) — is this free? Snake positions: (2,1) not listed, walls: not border or obstacle, so should be free. (2,1) is within 1-6, not wall.\n> \n> - R: to (3+1,1) = (4,1) — (4,1) has food? Food at (4,1), but let's see if it's free. (4,1) is not in snake positions, so free, and no wall.\n> \n> (4,1) has food, which is positive.\n> \n> Also, (2,1) has no food mentioned, so empty.\n> \n> So possible actions: L to (2,1) or R to (4,1).\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: current direction D, so I cannot move U, which is opposite, but U is not possible anyway due to body.\n> \n> L and R are perpendicular, so ok.\n> \n> Now, if I move R to (4,1), I eat the food there, since it's positive food, so snake grows by 1, so new length 10, and score +1.\n> \n> Then the new head is at (4,1), and tail stays, so positions: new head (4,1), then previous head (3,1) becomes body, so body at (3,1), then (3,2), etc., and tail at (1,5) still, but when we eat, the tail doesn't move that turn, so the snake grows, so after eating, positions: head at (4,1), then (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) — but since we ate, we add a segment, so the tail doesn't move, so the last segment (1,5) stays, and we have one more segment. So new body: after head, (3,1), (3,2), ..., up to (1,6), and (1,5) is tail, but now since we add a segment, the position (1,5) is still there, and the new tail is (1,5)? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, the tail doesn't move on that turn, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail end. So positions: after moving head to (4,1) and eating, the body from previous position: (3,1) becomes neck, then (3,2), etc., all the way to (1,6), and tail (1,5) remains, but since we grow, the tail doesn't move, so the new segment is added, meaning the tail stays at (1,5) for this turn, and next turn when we move, the tail moves only if no growth.\n> \n> But for collision, at this turn, after moving, head is at (4,1), which was food, now empty, and body positions are (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5). So (4,1) is head, (3,1) is now body, etc. (1,5) is tail.\n> \n> Is (4,1) adjacent to any body? (3,1) is adjacent, but (3,1) is the neck, not a collision. Collision only if head touches body except the neck, but the rule is head touches any body segment except that it can move to tail cell if tail moves, but here (4,1) is not tail.\n> \n> In this case, (4,1) is free, so no collision.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move L to (2,1), no food, so no growth, head moves to (2,1), tail moves away from (1,5) to where? When we move, if no eat, head moves to new position, tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> So if move L to (2,1), no eat, so new positions: head (2,1), then (3,1) becomes body, then (3,2), ..., up to (1,6), and tail was (1,5), but since tail moves, we remove (1,5), so new tail is (1,6)? Positions: previous: head (3,1), body (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), tail (1,5).\n> \n> After moving head to (2,1), new head (2,1), then the first body segment is previous head (3,1), then (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), and since no growth, tail (1,5) is removed, so the last segment is (1,6), which was the second last.\n> \n> So positions: (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)\n> \n> Tail at (1,6).\n> \n> Now, back to decision.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (2,6) and (5,1), etc.\n> \n> First, let's list all food:\n> \n> - Food at (2,6): value 1, life_span 4, so available turns 34,35,36,37\n> \n> - Food at (4,1): value 1, life_span 7, available turns 34 to 40\n> \n> - Food at (5,1): value 1, life_span 10, available turns 34 to 43\n> \n> (5,1) is at x=5,y=1.\n> \n> Now, the snake is at (3,1), and I can move to (2,1) or (4,1).\n> \n> If I move to (4,1), I eat the food, grow to length 10.\n> \n> Then head at (4,1), direction from (3,1) to (4,1) is right, so new direction R.\n> \n> From there, possible moves: U to (4,2), D to (4,0) wall, L to (3,1) which is body, R to (5,1) which has food.\n> \n> (4,1) to U (4,2): is (4,2) free?

Look at snake positions: (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), etc. Specifically, (2,6) is the 7th segment: positions index: 0:head(3,1), 1:(3,2), 2:(3,3), 3:(3,4), 4:(3,5), 5:(3,6), 6:(2,6), 7:(1,6), 8:(1,5) tail.\n> \n> So (2,6) is occupied by body, and there is food at (2,6). But the food can be eaten only if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, (2,6) has food, but it's under the body, so to eat it, the snake must move such that the body leaves (2,6), and then head moves to (2,6) when it's free.\n> \n> Now, life_span 4, so it will disappear on turn 38 if not eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, the tail is at (1,5), and will move.\n> \n> Now, if I don't eat the food at (4,1) now, and move left to (2,1), then no growth, head at (2,1), direction L (since from (3,1) to (2,1) left).\n> \n> Then positions: head (2,1), body (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) — tail at (1,6) now.\n> \n> (2,6) is still occupied, with food under it?

But let's confirm: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid has cells from (0,0) to (7,7), with the borders being walls. So playable cells are where 1≤x≤6 and 1≤y≤6? No, the walls are at those coordinates, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls and cannot be moved to. Therefore, the snake can only be on cells where 1≤x≤6 and 1≤y≤6.

Let's check snake positions: [(4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)] so (4,2) is not listed, so it should be empty, except possibly food, but no food there.\n> \n> Food is at (2,6) and (5,1), so (4,2) is empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) has food.\n> \n> Now, possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (4,2) - safe, empty cell\n> \n> - D: to (4,0) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - L: to (3,1) - body segment, collision, invalid\n> \n> - R: to (5,1) - food cell, and it's positive food, so eating it.\n> \n> But I need to consider if it's safe.\n> \n> First, moving R to (5,1): I eat the food, so score +1, and snake length increases by 1, so new tail will be added.\n> \n> After moving to (5,1), the head is now at (5,1), and the body: the tail doesn't move yet, but when head moves, the body follows.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and if food eaten, tail doesn't shorten, so length increases.\n> \n> Specifically: when head moves to a new cell, if no food, tail is removed; if food, tail stays, so length +1.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (5,1), there is food, so I eat it, value +1, length increases.\n> \n> Now, is (5,1) safe?

When food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one, meaning the tail position remains, and a new segment is added after the tail? No.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves to food, the head occupies the food cell, and the tail does not move, so the snake gains one segment. So the positions: new head at food, then the previous positions shift, with the tail staying.\n> \n> For example, current positions: H(4,1), B1(3,1), B2(3,2), ..., T(1,5)\n> \n> After moving right to (5,1) and eating food: new head at (5,1), then B1 is previous H, (4,1), then B2 is (3,1), B3 is (3,2), ..., and the last body segment is (1,6)?

The head is now at (5,1). The first body segment is the previous head position, (4,1). Then segment 1 moves to where segment 0 was, but segment 1 was (3,1), now it moves to (4,1)? No.\n> \n> When head moves, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So new position 0: (5,1) head\n> \n> Position 1: (4,1)  // previous position 0\n> \n> Position 2: (3,1)  // previous position 1\n> \n> Position 3: (3,2)  // previous position 2\n> \n> Position 4: (3,3)  // previous position 3\n> \n> Position 5: (3,4)  // previous position 4\n> \n> Position 6: (3,5)  // previous position 5\n> \n> Position 7: (3,6)  // previous position 6\n> \n> Position 8: (2,6)  // previous position 7\n> \n> Position 9: (1,6)  // previous position 8\n> \n> Position 10: (1,5)  // previous position 9, and since food eaten, this tail stays, so we have a new segment at (1,5), but (1,5) was tail, now it becomes position 10, and since food eaten, we don't remove the tail, so positions are from 0 to 10 now, with tail at (1,5).\n> \n> Previous position 9 is (1,5), which was tail.

It's turn 36. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6). So, I can't move to those cells.\n> \n> The snake positions are given: head at (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5). So the snake is 11 segments long. Head direction is right, meaning it was moving to the right to reach (5,1) from (4,1), I assume.\n> \n> Now, food: there's one food at (2,6) with value 1 and life span 2. Life span 2 means it disappears after 2 turns, including this one. So after turn 36, it has 2 turns left; after turn 37, it has 1 turn left; after turn 38, it disappears. Since we're at turn 36, it can be eaten on turn 36 or 37.\n> \n> The food is at (2,6). Looking at the snake positions, (2,6) is actually part of the snake body. Specifically, it's the 9th segment: positions are index 0: (5,1) head, 1: (4,1), 2: (3,1), 3: (3,2), 4: (3,3), 5: (3,4), 6: (3,5), 7: (3,6), 8: (2,6), 9: (1,6), 10: (1,5) tail.\n> \n> So food is at (2,6), which is occupied by the snake's body segment at index 8.\n> \n> According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. So for this food at (2,6), it's under the body now, so I need to move the snake such that the body leaves (2,6), and then the head can move there to eat it.\n> \n> But the food has a life span of 2, so I have until turn 37 to eat it. Turn 36 and 37 are the chances.\n> \n> Now, head is at (5,1), direction right. So from (5,1), possible moves: up, down, left, right? But I need to consider the no instant reverse rule. Head direction is right, so I cannot move left immediately, because left is opposite to right.\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,1):\n> \n> - Up: (5,2)\n> \n> - Down: (5,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Left: (4,1) but that's the second segment, and also left is opposite to right, so instant reverse is not allowed.

Let's see the coordinates.\n> \n> Walls: x=0 and x=7 are borders, so valid x are 1 to 6? Similarly y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to 6? But snake has positions like (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), etc., and (3,6) is at y=6, which should be border? y=7 is wall, so y=6 is one before border, so y=6 is valid, I think. Similarly, x=1 to x=6 valid.\n> \n> Head at (5,1), so:\n> \n> - Up: (5,2) - is this valid? Need to check if it's wall or body.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacle (4,6). So (5,2) is not a wall.\n> \n> Now, is it occupied by body? Snake positions: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5). So (5,2) is not in this list, so it's free? But we need to consider the food too, but food is at (2,6), which is occupied.\n> \n> Available cells: (5,2) seems free.\n> \n> Down: (5,0) - y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Left: (4,1) - this is the second segment of snake. But moving left would go to (4,1), which is occupied by the body. Also, since head direction is right, moving left is reverse, which is not allowed.\n> \n> Right: (6,1) - x=6, since x=7 is wall, x=6 should be valid. Is it occupied? Snake positions: (5,1), (4,1), etc., no (6,1), so it should be free.\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid size. Walls at x=0 and x=7, so cells from x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6? But snake has (1,6) and (3,6), y=6, and y=7 is wall, so y=6 is valid. Similarly, x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> So from (5,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: (5,2) - free\n> \n> - Down: (5,0) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - Left: (4,1) - body and reverse, invalid\n> \n> - Right: (6,1) - free\n> \n> So only two choices: up or right.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> The food at (2,6) is positive, value 1, but it's under the body now. To eat it, I need to move the snake so that the body at (2,6) moves away, and then head moves there.\n> \n> Currently, the segment at (2,6) is the 8th segment. When the snake moves, the tail moves forward, so the body segments shift.\n> \n> The food life span is 2, so it can be eaten on turn 36 or 37.\n> \n> But to eat it on turn 36, head would need to be at (2,6) now, but head is at (5,1), far away. So impossible to eat on turn 36. Only possible on turn 37 or later, but life span 2: after turn 36, it has 1 turn left, so can be eaten on turn 37. After turn 37, if not eaten, it disappears.\n> \n> Life span: at turn 36, life span is 2, meaning it will disappear after N turns, including current. So:\n> \n> - At start of turn 36: life span 2, can be eaten during turn 36.\n> \n> - After turn 36, if not eaten, life span decreases to 1.\n> \n> - During turn 37, can be eaten.\n> \n> - After turn 37, if not eaten, disappears.\n> \n> Since head is at (5,1) and food at (2,6), it's impossible to reach in one move. Minimum moves: from (5,1) to (2,6) is at least 4 moves away? Let's see the Manhattan distance: |5-2| + |1-6| = 3 + 5 = 8, so at least 8 moves, but we have only until turn 37 to eat it, which is one turn from now? Turn 36 is current, we choose action for turn 36, then turn 37.\n> \n> After choosing action for turn 36, the snake moves, then food life span decreases.\n> \n> Sequence:\n> \n> - Start of turn 36: state given.\n> \n> - We choose action for turn 36.\n> \n> - Snake moves to new position.\n> \n> - If head eats food, score increases, snake grows.\n> \n> - Then, for any food not eaten, life span decreases by 1. If life span 0, it disappears.\n> \n> - Then turn 37, and so on.\n> \n> For food at (2,6) with life span 2 at turn 36:\n> \n> - If head moves to (2,6) on turn 36, it can be eaten, but impossible since head is at (5,1).\n> \n> - After turn 36 move, if head not at (2,6), food life span decreases to 1.\n> \n> - Then on turn 37, if head moves to (2,6), it can be eaten.\n> \n> - After turn 37, if not eaten, it disappears.\n> \n> So the only chance to eat this food is on turn 37, by moving the head to (2,6) during turn 37.\n> \n> But for that to happen, on turn 37, the food must be uncovered, meaning the body must have moved away from (2,6).\n> \n> Currently, at turn 36, (2,6) is occupied by body segment.\n> \n> When the snake moves on turn 36, the tail will move, and all segments shift.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list them in order:\n> \n> Index: 0: head (5,1)\n> \n> 1: (4,1)\n> \n> 2: (3,1)\n> \n> 3: (3,2)\n> \n> 4: (3,3)\n> \n> 5: (3,4)\n> \n> 6: (3,5)\n> \n> 7: (3,6)\n> \n> 8: (2,6)\n> \n> 9: (1,6)\n> \n> 10: tail (1,5)\n> \n> When snake moves, say we move in direction D, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves off its current cell, so the segment at (1,5) is removed, and new head position added, all shift.\n> \n> After move, the cell (2,6) might still be occupied or not, depending on the move.\n> \n> Specifically, for the food at (2,6) to be eatable, we need that after some move, the body leaves (2,6), so that it's free, then head can move there later.\n> \n> In this case, since we want to eat on turn 37, we need that after turn 36 move, (2,6) is no longer occupied by body, so that on turn 37, head can move there.\n> \n> Currently, (2,6) is segment 8.\n> \n> After one move, depending on direction, the snake shifts.\n> \n> The segment that was at index 8 will move to where index 7 was, but only if the snake doesn't grow.\n> \n> If we don't eat food, snake doesn't grow, so length same, tail is removed.\n> \n> So after move, new positions: head goes to new position, then index 1 goes to old head, index 2 to old index 1, ..., up to the tail.\n> \n> After move without eating:\n> \n> - New head position: based on action\n> \n> - Then segment 1: old head position (5,1)\n> \n> - Segment 2: old segment 1 position (4,1)\n> \n> - Segment 3: old segment 2 (3,1)\n> \n> - Segment 4: old segment 3 (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 5: old segment 4 (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 6: old segment 5 (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 7: old segment 6 (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 8: old segment 7 (3,6)\n> \n> - Segment 9: old segment 8 (2,6)\n> \n> - Segment 10: old segment 9 (1,6)\n> \n> - Tail segment 10 is removed? No, the positions: after move, the new body segments are from old head to old second last, I think.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when moving without growing, the head moves to a new cell, the tail cell is vacated, and all body segments move forward one step.\n> \n> So positions after move:\n> \n> - New head: (new_x, new_y)\n> \n> - Then segment 1: previous head position (5,1)\n> \n> - Segment 2: previous segment 1 position (4,1)\n> \n> - ...\n> - Segment 9: previous segment 8 position (2,6)  // old index 8\n> \n> - Segment 10: previous segment 9 position (1,6)  // old index 9\n> \n> - The previous tail (1,5) is no longer part of snake, so vacated.\n> \n> The food is at (2,6), which is currently occupied by old segment 8.\n> \n> After move, if the snake does not grow, the cell (2,6) will be occupied by the new segment 9, which comes from old segment 8? Let's see:\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - New segment 0: head at new position\n> \n> - New segment 1: old head (5,1)\n> \n> - New segment 2: old segment 1 (4,1)\n> \n> - New segment 3: old segment 2 (3,1)\n> \n> - New segment 4: old segment 3 (3,2)\n> \n> - New segment 5: old segment 4 (3,3)\n> \n> - New segment 6: old segment 5 (3,4)\n> \n> - New segment 7: old segment 6 (3,5)\n> \n> - New segment 8: old segment 7 (3,6)\n> \n> - New segment 9: old segment 8 (2,6)  // so (2,6) is still occupied by new segment 9\n> \n> - New segment 10: old segment 9 (1,6)  // and (1,6) is now segment 10\n> \n> - Old segment 10 (1,5) is vacated.\n> \n> So after one move without eating, the cell (2,6) is still occupied by the snake body, now as segment 9.\n> \n> Similarly, it will remain occupied until the snake moves enough that the tail passes it.\n> \n> The segment at (2,6) is part of the body and will move only when the snake progresses.\n> \n> To free up (2,6), we need the tail to move away from that area.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (1,5), which is adjacent to (1,6) and (2,5), etc.\n> \n> But to have (2,6) free for turn 37, we need that after turn 36 move, (2,6) is not occupied.\n> \n> But from above, after any move without eating, (2,6) is still occupied by the body, since it shifts to the next segment.\n> \n> Only if we eat food, the snake grows, so we add a new segment, and the positions don't shift as much.\n> \n> If we eat food on turn 36, the snake grows, so when we move, the head moves to new position, but the tail stays, and we add a new segment at the tail position? No.\n> \n> When snake eats food, it grows: after moving to a food cell, the snake increases in length, so the tail does not move; a new segment is added at the position where the tail was or something.\n> \n> Rule: when eating positive food, length increases by one. So after eating, the snake has one more segment.\n> \n> Movement with growth: head moves to new cell (which has food), food is consumed, then the tail remains in place, and a new segment is added at the old tail position, so the snake extends.\n> \n> Positions: after eating, new head at food cell, then the previous body segments, and the tail stays, with a new segment added.\n> \n> For example, if head moves to a food cell, then:\n> \n> - New head: the food cell\n> \n> - Then segment 1: old head\n> \n> - Segment 2: old segment 1\n> \n> - ...\n> - Up to old tail, which is still there, and then a new segment is added at the old tail position? Or the tail position doesn't change, but we add a new segment before the tail.\n> \n> Typically in snake, when you eat, you move to the food, consume it, and the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail end.\n> \n> So positions: after eating, the head is at the new position, the body segments from 1 to n-1 are the same as before except shifted, but since tail doesn't move, the segment positions remain, and we have an additional segment at the tail.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Suppose before move, positions: H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T\n> \n> After moving without eating: new head position, then H becomes B1, B1 becomes B2, ..., Bk becomes new something, T is removed.\n> \n> After moving with eating: head moves to new cell (food), then the body is: old H, old B1, old B2, ..., old Bk, and old T, with old T now being the new last body segment, and a new tail segment is added at old T position? No.\n> \n> When you eat, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't advance; it stays, and you add a new segment.\n> \n> So after moving to food:\n> \n> - New head: food cell\n> \n> - New segment 1: old head\n> \n> - New segment 2: old segment 1\n> \n> - ...\n> - New segment k: old segment k-1\n> \n> - New segment k+1: old tail  // since tail didn't move\n> \n> - And then for the new length, a new segment is added at the position of old tail, but since the tail didn't move, it's the same position? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard: after eating, the head moves to the food cell, the body segments from the head to the tail remain in place, but the tail does not move, so the position that was tail is still occupied, and the snake gains one segment, so the new tail is the old tail position, but since it didn't move, it's the same cell, and we have an extra segment.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think that when you eat, you don't remove the tail, so the snake length increases by one, with the tail staying.\n> \n> For example, positions before: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After moving to food: [new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., T]  so the tail T is still there, and all previous positions are kept, with new head added.\n> \n> So the cell that was tail is still occupied, and no cell is vacated.\n> \n> In this case, for the food at (2,6), which is currently occupied by a body segment, if we could move the head there now, it would eat it, but we can't because it's far.\n> \n> But for it to be eatable later, we need that the body moves away, so the cell is free.\n> \n> In the current state, (2,6) is occupied by segment 8.\n> \n> After a move without eating, the body shifts, so the cell (2,6) is now occupied by the segment that was at (3,6) or something, but as I calculated earlier, after move, (2,6) is still occupied by new segment 9 from old segment 8.\n> \n> Specifically, after one move without eating, new segment 9 is at old segment 8 position, which is (2,6), so still occupied.\n> \n> After another move, it might change.\n> \n> But for turn 37, we need (2,6) to be free at the start of turn 37 so that head can move there.\n> \n> At start of turn 37, after turn 36 move, if (2,6) is not occupied by body or wall, and food is still there, head can move there to eat it.\n> \n> But after turn 36 move without eating, (2,6) is still occupied by the body, as new segment 9.\n> \n> So it's not free.\n> \n> If on turn 36 we eat food somewhere, but there's no other food, only this one at (2,6), which we can't reach.\n> \n> So for (2,6) to be free on turn 37, we need that during turn 36 move, the tail moves away from the area, but specifically, the cell (2,6) needs to be vacated.\n> \n> Currently, (2,6) is occupied by a middle segment, not the tail.\n> \n> The tail is at (1,5).\n> \n> To vacate (2,6), we need the snake to move such that the segment at (2,6) moves away, which only happens when the snake moves forward and the tail advances.\n> \n> But since (2,6) is not the tail, it will take several moves for it to become the tail and then move away.\n> \n> Let's see the positions: the snake is in a sort of U-shape or something.\n> \n> Head at (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), then up to (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), then left to (2,6), then down to (1,6), then left to (1,5) tail.\n> \n> So the body from (3,1) to (3,6) is vertical, then left to (2,6), down to (1,6), left to (1,5).\n> \n> The segment at (2,6) is the turn point.\n> \n> To free (2,6), we need to move the snake so that this segment is no longer there.\n> \n> For example, if we move down or up or right from head, the tail will eventually move, but it will take time.\n> \n> Specifically, the distance from head to the food area is far.\n> \n> Since the food has only until turn 37, and after turn 36 move, if we don't eat it, life span decreases to 1, and on turn 37 we can eat it only if it's free, but after turn 36 move, (2,6) is still occupied, so on turn 37, even if we move head there, it's occupied by body, so collision, death.\n> \n> Therefore, it's impossible to eat this food at (2,6) because:\n> \n> - On turn 36, we can't reach it.\n> \n> - On turn 37, to eat it, we need to move head to (2,6), but at the start of turn 37, after turn 36 move, (2,6) is still occupied by the body (as new segment 9), so moving there would cause head to collide with body segment, which is deadly.\n> \n> Moreover, even if it were free, moving to (2,6) from head position after turn 36 might not be possible in one move.\n> \n> But since it's occupied, it's impossible to eat this food.\n> \n> The food is under the body, and to eat it, the body must move away first, but in this case, with the current position, after one move, the body hasn't moved away from (2,6), so it can't be eaten on turn 37.\n> \n> Therefore, this food will disappear after turn 37 without being eaten, since we can't reach it in time.\n> \n> So I should ignore this food and focus on long-term survival and finding other food, but currently there's only this one food listed.\n> \n> Food positions: only one, at (2,6).\n> \n> But it's not eatable, as per above.\n> \n> So for now, no food to eat, so I need to move to avoid dying and plan for future.\n> \n> Also, there might be new food spawning later, but I don't know when;

Therefore, I prioritize long-term survival by moving upward into the open right-side area (columns 5-6, rows 2-6), which has ample space to avoid collisions and wait for new food spawns. This path minimizes immediate risks and maintains flexibility for future turns.\n",

It's turn 37, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates go from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (5,2), then body segments: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), and tail at (1,6). So the snake is 11 segments long.\n> \n> Head direction is Up, meaning the snake is moving upwards. Last move was Up, so from (5,1) to (5,2), I assume.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - One at (2,6) with value 1 and life span 1. Since life span is 1, it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. Value is +1, so positive food.\n> \n> - Another at (5,4) with value 1 and life span 10. Also positive food, and it has 10 turns left.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current, so for (2,6), life span 1 means if not eaten on turn 37, it disappears. For (5,4), life span 10, so it will last until turn 37 + 10 - 1? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for a food with life span L, it appears at turn T, it will disappear after turn T + L - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> If it has life span N at turn t, it decreases every turn, so at turn t, life span is N; turn t+1, it's N-1; ... down to turn t + (N-1), life span 1; then after that turn, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns from t to t + N - 1 inclusive.\n> \n> In this case, for (2,6): position (2,6), value 1, life span 1 at turn 37. So it can only be eaten on turn 37, or it disappears.\n> \n> For (5,4): life span 10 at turn 37, so it can be eaten from turn 37 to 37 + 9 = 46? Turn 37: life span 10, so after this turn, life span becomes 9, and so on, until turn 37 + 9 = 46, life span 1, then after turn 46, it disappears.

Let's see.\n> \n> Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so snake can only be on cells where 1<=x<=6 and 1<=y<=6? For example, (5,2) is given, x=5, y=2, which is between 1 and 6, I think. x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6 inclusive? (1,6) is a position, y=6, but y=7 is wall, so y=6 is ok? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Cells occupied by walls: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So for any cell, if x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7, it's a wall. Therefore, the playable area is 1<=x<=6, 1<=y<=6? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, that's 6x6 grid? But positions include (3,6), y=6, which is not wall, since wall is y=7. Similarly, (5,2) y=2, fine. And internal obstacle at (4,6), which is not border, but specific cell.\n> \n> So grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, I think. 6x6 cells.\n> \n> x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, yes, since x=0 and x=7 are walls, so min x=1, max x=6; min y=1, max y=6.\n> \n> Now, internal obstacle at (4,6), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Back to possible moves from (5,2):\n> \n> - Up to (5,3): y=3, which is between 1 and 6, no wall, need to check if occupied by body.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (5,2), then (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)\n> \n> So body segments: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)\n> \n> (5,3) is not in this list, so it's free, I think. But is there food? Food at (2,6) and (5,4), not at (5,3), so empty.\n> \n> - Left to (4,2): x=4,y=2, not wall, check body: positions have (4,1), (3,2), etc., but (4,2) not listed, so free.\n> \n> - Right to (6,2): x=6,y=2, x=6 is not wall (x=7 is wall), so ok. Check body: no (6,2) in positions, so free.\n> \n> Down is not possible.\n> \n> Now, there's food at (2,6) with life span 1, meaning it must be eaten this turn or lost.\n> \n> But (2,6) is currently occupied by the snake's body? Snake positions: (2,6) is the second last segment, before tail (1,6). So (2,6) is a body segment.\n> \n> The food is at (2,6), but it's under the snake's body.\n> \n> Rule for eating food under body: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for (2,6), which has food, but it's currently occupied by the body. To eat it, I need the body to move away first, then head moves to it.\n> \n> But life span is 1, so only this turn. If I don't eat it now, it disappears.\n> \n> Can I eat it this turn? Head is at (5,2), (2,6) is far away. I can't reach it in one move; it's 4 units away in x and 4 in y? |5-2|=3, |2-6|=4, so at least 7 moves away? Manhattan distance.\n> \n> From (5,2) to (2,6): Δx=3, Δy=4, min moves 7, since each move changes one coordinate by 1.\n> \n> So impossible to reach this turn. Therefore, I cannot eat the food at (2,6) because it will disappear after this turn, and I can't get there in time. So it's lost.\n> \n> No point trying for it.\n> \n> Now, the other food at (5,4), which is close. Head at (5,2), so (5,4) is two steps up: (5,2) to (5,3) to (5,4).\n> \n> But I need to consider the path and future moves.\n> \n> Also, there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n> \n> Tail is at (1,6). Head at (5,2), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so neighbors: up, down, left, right.\n> \n> Tail at (1,6), neighbors: (1,5), (1,7) but y=7 wall, so (1,5); (0,6) x=0 wall; (2,6); (1,7) invalid. So possible adjacent cells: (1,5) and (2,6).\n> \n> Head at (5,2), which is not (1,5) or (2,6), so not adjacent to tail. So no immediate danger.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's list the snake positions again: head (5,2), then (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)\n> \n> So the body forms a sort of L-shape or something. From (5,1) to (4,1) to (3,1), then up to (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), then left to (2,6), then left to (1,6).\n> \n> Now, food at (5,4), which is above the head.\n> \n> Current turn 37.\n> \n> I need to eat food to grow and score.\n> \n> But I must avoid collisions.\n> \n> Also, the snake will move, so positions change.\n> \n> After each move, the snake moves: head to new position, and tail might move or not, depending on if food eaten.\n> \n> If no food eaten, tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> If food eaten, tail stays, so snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> In this case, since no food is eaten yet, when I move, tail will move.\n> \n> But for planning, I need to simulate.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food at (5,4). It's at (5,4), which is currently empty? Snake positions: (5,4) not listed, so yes, free.\n> \n> Life span 10, so I have time, but it's close, so I should go for it.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term survival.\n> \n> Possible actions this turn: U, L, R.\n> \n> If I go Up to (5,3): then head at (5,3), direction U.\n> \n> Then next turn, from (5,3), I can go U to (5,4), which has food, so I eat it, snake grows.\n> \n> But let's see if that causes any issue.\n> \n> First, move sequence:\n> \n> Turn 37: U to (5,3)\n> \n> Then snake positions: new head (5,3), then previous head (5,2) becomes body, so body: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), etc., and tail (1,6) moves? Since no food eaten, tail moves off (1,6), so new positions: head (5,3), then (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6) — and (1,6) is removed, so tail is (2,6).\n> \n> Snake was 11 segments, after move without eating, it stays 11, tail moves, so segments: head new, then all previous except tail removed.\n> \n> After moving to (5,3) without eating, positions: head (5,3), then body: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6) — that's 10 body segments? Let's count.\n> \n> Previous positions: 11 segments: index 0: (5,2) head, 1: (5,1), 2: (4,1), 3: (3,1), 4: (3,2), 5: (3,3), 6: (3,4), 7: (3,5), 8: (3,6), 9: (2,6), 10: (1,6) tail.\n> \n> After move to (5,3), head to (5,3), then the body segments: the previous head (5,2) becomes segment 1, then (5,1) segment 2, (4,1) seg3, (3,1) seg4, (3,2) seg5, (3,3) seg6, (3,4) seg7, (3,5) seg8, (3,6) seg9, (2,6) seg10, and tail (1,6) is removed, so new tail is (2,6). So positions: head (5,3), then (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6) — 11 segments?

So I move to (5,4), eat food, value +1, snake grows, so new head (5,4), then body includes all previous, and tail doesn't move. So positions: head (5,4), then (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6) — and since eaten, no removal, so length 12 now.\n> \n> (2,6) is still there, and (1,6) was already removed earlier.\n> \n> After eating, the tail doesn't move, so the last segment stays.\n> \n> In this case, after turn 38, head at (5,4), body: (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6) — 11 body segments, total 12.\n> \n> (2,6) is the tail, and it has food?

The head direction is U, which is up, so moving towards increasing y.\n> \n> Food information: there's one food at (5,4) with value 1 and life span 10. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, it will disappear after 10 turns from now, so at turn 48 if not eaten.\n> \n> I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 38.

Let's confirm.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. So the grid goes from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6 for the playable area, except for obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (4,6), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (4,6) is wall.\n> \n> Now snake: head at (5,3), direction U.

It's turn 40. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (4,6). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the edges and a block at (4,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,4), then body segments: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). That's 12 segments. Head direction is right, so it's moving east.\n> \n> Food: only one piece at (4,2) with value 1 and life span 10.

Since there's only one food now, but more might spawn later, I should consider the grid and possible moves.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid to visualize:\n> \n> - Rows y=0 to y=7, columns x=0 to x=7.\n> - Walls: all cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also, (4,6) is an obstacle.\n> - Snake: head (6,4), body: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). So the snake is mostly on the left side, with head near the right.\n> \n> Current head direction is R, so moving right. From (6,4), possible moves: U, D, L, R.

Check collisions: head at (6,5), which is not a wall (x=6<7, y=5<7), and not on body except the tail, but tail is at (3,5), not adjacent. Body positions: (6,4) is directly below, but head is at (6,5), so not touching. Other body parts are not at (6,5). So no collision.\n> \n> Also, no food at (6,5), so no eating.\n> \n> Now, move D to (6,3):\n> \n> Head to (6,3), then body: [(6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)] tail (3,6) gone.\n> \n> (3,6) was tail, removed.

At turn 41, life_span=9, so it can be eaten until turn 49, which is 8 turns from now? Turn 41 to turn 49 is 8 turns later?

I need to read the rule carefully.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> So, it's about the cell where the tail is: if that cell has food, and head is adjacent to it, then if head moves to that cell to eat, after eating, the snake grows, so the tail does not move, and a new segment is added at the tail position, but since head is now on the food cell (which was tail position), and the new tail is the old tail segment, but when you eat, the tail stays, so the head is on the food cell, and the previous tail position becomes part of body, so no immediate collision? But the rule says \"the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> Let's think: before move, tail is at T, with food on T. Head is adjacent to T. Head moves to T to eat food. After moving to T, food is eaten, so snake grows: the head is now at T, and the tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the previous tail position? No.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when head moves to a food cell, it eats it, so the snake grows by one segment. That means, after moving head to the food cell, the tail does not move; the body extends, so the new tail is the same as before, but the head is on the new position, and a new segment is added behind.\n> \n> But in terms of positions: suppose tail is at T, and head moves to T to eat food on T. But T is occupied by tail, so head cannot move to a cell occupied by body, except the tail, because tail moves away.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for food under body, it must be that the body moves away first, then head can eat.\n> \n> But for tail specifically, if food is under tail, and head moves to it after tail moves away.\n> \n> But in tail reward danger, it's when the tail cell has food, and head is adjacent, so if tail moves away, the cell is free, then head can move to it to eat, but after eating, the snake grows, so the tail position is now a body segment, and the head is on that cell, but since tail moved, it's ok? I'm confused.\n> \n> Let me read the rule again: \"**Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is *adjacent to the tail* and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> Ah, I see: when you eat the food at the tail cell, after eating, the snake grows, so the tail does not move; it stays in place, but since head is now on that cell, they occupy the same cell, which is a collision. But the head moved to that cell, so it should be that head and the segment that was tail are now on the same cell, but in sequence, when head moves to a cell, if it's food, it eats and grows, so the tail doesn't move, meaning the last segment stays, so head is at new position, and tail is still there, but if head moved to tail position, it's the same cell, so collision.\n> \n> Yes: if head moves to the cell where tail is, and that cell has food, after eating, the head is at that cell, and the tail is still at that cell for that moment, so collision occurs.\n> \n> But in general, moving to tail position is allowed only if it's not food or if you don't eat, but with food, it causes collision.\n> \n> The rule specifies for when the tail cell has food and head is adjacent.\n> \n> In this case, for (4,2), it's not the tail now, so no immediate danger.\n> \n> But I need to plan the path to eat (4,2) safely.\n> \n> First, from current position (6,5), I have two choices: Up to (6,6) or Left to (5,5).\n> \n> If I go Left to (5,5), I'm closer to food.\n> \n> (5,5) to (4,2) is |5-4| + |5-2| =1+3=4 cells away.\n> \n> From (6,5) to (4,2) is 2+3=5, so (5,5) is closer.\n> \n> If I go Up to (6,6), I'm at (6,6), which is farther, |6-4| + |6-2| =2+4=6 cells away.\n> \n> So going Left seems better to approach food.\n> \n> But let's see the surrounding cells for risks.\n> \n> First, after moving to (5,5), what can I do?\n> \n> From (5,5), possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right, but head direction will be Left, so cannot move Right instantly (opposite).\n> \n> Current direction after move: if I moved Left to (5,5), new direction Left.\n> \n> Then possible moves: Up to (5,6), Down to (5,4), Left to (4,5), Right is illegal.\n> \n> Now, (5,4) is a body segment?

I can move U, D, or L.\n> \n> Now, let's see the adjacent cells to head (5,5):\n> \n> - Up: (5,6)\n> \n> - Down: (5,4)\n> \n> - Left: (4,5)\n> \n> - Right: (6,5)\n> \n> But right is occupied by the first body segment at (6,5), so moving right would cause collision with body, deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, down to (5,4): is that occupied? Snake positions: (5,4) is a body segment, yes, segment 3? Positions: (5,5) head, then (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) — (5,4) is the fourth position? Let's index:\n> \n> 0: head (5,5)\n> \n> 1: (6,5)\n> \n> 2: (6,4)\n> \n> 3: (5,4)\n> \n> 4: (5,3)\n> \n> etc.\n> \n> So (5,4) is segment 3, which is a body part. So moving to (5,4) would collide with body, deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left to (4,5): what is there? Not in snake positions, so should be free? But need to check walls or obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so (4,5) is x=4,y=5, within 1-6? x from 0 to 7, but borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (4,5) is not border. Internal obstacle at (4,6), not (4,5). So (4,5) should be empty.\n> \n> Moving up to (5,6): not in snake positions, not wall, since y=6<7, and no internal obstacle there. Internal obstacle is (4,6), not (5,6).\n> \n> (5,6) should be free.\n> \n> So from (5,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (5,6): free\n> \n> - D to (5,4): occupied by body, deadly, cannot\n> \n> - L to (4,5): free\n> \n> - R to (6,5): occupied by body, deadly, cannot\n> \n> Also, cannot move R because it's reverse direction?

Snake positions: let's see, (5,2) is segment 5, which is at (5,2), and food is at (4,2), not the same. (4,2) is not in snake positions; positions are: (5,5),(6,5),(6,4),(5,4),(5,3),(5,2),(5,1),(4,1),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3),(3,4). So (4,2) is not listed, so it should be free, except food is there, but food is separate.\n> \n> Food is at (4,2), and it's not a snake segment, so it can be eaten.\n> \n> But note the special case: food can spawn under body, but here it's not under body; (4,2) is not occupied by snake, so it can be eaten when head moves there.\n> \n> But there's a rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Here, tail is at (3,4), and food is at (4,2), which is not the tail cell. Tail cell is (3,4), no food there.\n> \n> Food is at (4,2), which is not adjacent to tail? Tail at (3,4), adjacent cells would be (3,3), (3,5), (2,4), (4,4), etc. (4,2) is not adjacent to (3,4); distance Δx=1, Δy=-2, not adjacent.\n> \n> So no issue.\n> \n> Now, I need to move to (4,2).\n> \n> From head (5,5), possible moves U or L.\n> \n> If I move L to (4,5), then head at (4,5), direction L.\n> \n> Then from (4,5), I can move to (4,4), (4,6), (3,5), etc., but need to avoid body and walls.\n> \n> Body: after moving to (4,5), the snake will move, so positions change.\n> \n> I need to simulate the movement.\n> \n> Also, for long-term, I need to eat the food and survive.\n> \n> But food life span is 8, so I have time, but I should eat it as soon as possible to avoid missing it, but not if risky.\n> \n> Since only one food, and it's positive, I should go for it.\n> \n> But let's see the path.\n> \n> First, from (5,5), if I move L to (4,5).\n> \n> Then turn 42: move L, head to (4,5), direction L.\n> \n> Then snake positions: head at (4,5), then the body: since snake moves, the tail end is removed, but when it moves, if not eating, length same.\n> \n> Currently no food eaten, so after move, head to new position, tail removed.\n> \n> So after moving to (4,5), positions: new head (4,5), then previous head (5,5) becomes segment 1, then (6,5) segment 2, etc., up to segment 11 at (3,4), and tail (3,4) is removed?

Let me confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> Walls: x=0 and x=7 are borders, so x from 1 to 6? Similarly, y=0 and y=7, so y from 1 to 6? But let's see the snake positions: head at (4,5), and so on, down to (3,3). All x and y between 1 and 5, except (6,5) and (6,4), which are within 1 to 6? x=6 is valid since x=7 is wall, so x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? y=7 is wall, so y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)]\n> \n> So head is at (4,5), direction is L, which means left, so it was moving left to (4,5) from previous position.

Snake positions: (5,2) is a segment, but (4,2) is not listed as snake, so it should be free for food?

Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Turn t1=43, so (4,2) disappears at turn 43 + 7 - 1? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be there for L more turns, including turn t. So after L turns, it's gone. At turn t + L, it's no longer there.\n> \n> For (4,2), life span 7 at turn 43, so it will be there until turn 43 + 6?

After turn 49, since at turn 49 life span 1, decreases to 0, so disappears after turn 49? The rule: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food with life span N at turn t, it will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1, meaning it is not there at turn t + N.\n> \n> Similarly, here t1=43, N=7, so (4,2) disappears after turn 43+7-1=49?

No, (4,2) is not occupied by snake; snake has (5,2) at y=2, x=5, but (4,2) is different, so it's free, with food.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) free.\n> \n> But there's a special rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves on.\"\n> \n> In this case, (4,2) is not under body; body has (5,2), but (4,2) is adjacent, not under. So it can be eaten normally if head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,2).\n> \n> Another rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Here, tail is at (3,3), food is at (4,2) and (6,2), not on tail, so no issue now.\n> \n> First, I need to plan a path to eat food while surviving.\n> \n> Also, after eating, snake grows, so tail doesn't move immediately, but when it eats, length increases, so the tail stays for one move? When snake eats food, it grows, so the next time it moves, the tail doesn't advance, so the new segment is added where the head was, I think.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to food, it eats, grows, so the tail remains in place for that turn, meaning the segment count increases immediately.\n> \n> But in terms of movement: when head moves to food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move on that turn; only the head moves to the food, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position or something? I need to recall the growth mechanic.\n> \n> From the rules: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food, so after eating, the snake has one more segment.\n> \n> In movement: on a turn when it eats, the head moves to the food cell, and since it grows, the tail does not move, so the new position has the head on food, and all body segments stay, with an extra segment added at the end? But the end is tail.\n> \n> Typically, in snake games, when you eat, you move to the cell, and the tail doesn't advance, so the snake grows by one cell for that move.\n> \n> For example: suppose head at A, tail at B. If no eat, head moves to new cell, tail moves to next, so length same.\n> \n> If eat, head moves to food cell, tail does not move, so now the snake has head at food, and tail still at B, so length increased by one; the new segment is effectively added where the tail was, but since tail didn't move, it stays.\n> \n> Then next move, tail moves as usual.\n> \n> In terms of positions: before move, positions: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After move without eat: new head, then [H, B1, B2, ..., second last], T is removed.\n> \n> After move with eat: new head (on food), then [H, B1, B2, ..., T], and T stays, so positions: [new head, H, B1, ..., T], length increased.\n> \n> In this case, the cell that was tail remains occupied until the next move.\n> \n> But for collision, when head moves, if it moves to a body cell except the tail (which might move away), it dies.\n> \n> But tail is special; if head moves to tail cell, and tail is about to move, it's ok, because tail moves away.\n> \n> But if it eats food on tail cell, then tail doesn't move, so head and tail are on same cell, which is collision.\n> \n> That's the tail reward danger.\n> \n> But here, no food on tail, so we're fine.\n> \n> Now, back to choices.\n> \n> From (4,5), move to (4,4) or (3,5).\n> \n> I need to see which one is better for reaching food or avoiding dead ends.\n> \n> First, let's list all occupied cells and free cells.\n> \n> Grid: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but walls at borders, so cells (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake occupies: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n> \n> So let's list free cells.\n> \n> All cells not snake or wall or obstacle.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,7 and y=0,7, so we only care about (1,1) to (6,6).\n> \n> Obstacle: (4,6) blocked.\n> \n> Snake: as above.\n> \n> So free cells:\n> \n> Row y=1: cells (1,1), (2,1), (6,1) — but (5,1) snake, (4,1) snake, (3,1) snake, so (1,1), (2,1) free? x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> x=1,y=1: not snake, not wall, not obstacle, so free.\n> \n> x=2,y=1: free\n> \n> x=3,y=1: snake (3,1)\n> \n> x=4,y=1: snake (4,1)\n> \n> x=5,y=1: snake (5,1)\n> \n> x=6,y=1: free?

Internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> Snake positions (listed from head to tail):\n> - Head: (4,4)\n> - Then: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n> \n> Tail is at (3,2).\n> \n> Head direction is D, so last move was down to (4,4). Since head is at (4,4) and previous was (4,5), yes, moving down.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (4,4): I can go Up, Down, Left, Right, but need to avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions except for the tail which is moving.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse, so since I'm moving Down, I cannot go Up on the next turn. So from Down, I can go Down, Left, or Right. Not Up.\n> \n> So at turn 44, from (4,4), possible actions: D, L, R.\n> \n> - Down to (4,3): is this safe? Let's see what's there.\n> \n> First, check for walls: (4,3) is not on border or obstacle. Border walls are x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (4,3) is fine. Obstacle at (4,6), so no issue.\n> \n> Now, is there a body segment? Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n> \n> So (5,3) is a body segment, but (4,3) is not listed, so it should be empty. (4,3) is free.\n> \n> (4,3) is not in the list, so yes, empty.\n> \n> Left to (3,4): (3,4) not in snake positions, not wall, not obstacle. Should be free.\n> \n> Right to (5,4): (5,4) is a body segment! (5,4) is in the list, it's part of the snake body.\n> \n> Snake positions: (5,4) is the 6th segment? Head (4,4), then (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), then (5,4), yes, so (5,4) is occupied.\n> \n> Moving to (5,4) would be a body collision, except if it's the tail, but the tail is at (3,2), so (5,4) is not tail; it's a body segment. So moving to (5,4) would cause collision and death.\n> \n> Therefore, from (4,4), moving Right to (5,4) is not possible; it's occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, moving Down to (4,3) seems free.\n> \n> Moving Left to (3,4) seems free.\n> \n> Moving Up to (4,5) is not possible because (4,5) is the second segment, so body collision, and also instant reverse is not allowed since current direction is Down.\n> \n> So possible actions at turn 44: Down to (4,3) or Left to (3,4).\n> \n> Now, I need to consider the food. There's food at (4,2) and (6,2).\n> \n> (4,2) has life span 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns from now? Life span decreases every turn, including current turn. So at turn 44, life span is 6, so it will disappear after turn 44 + 6 - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, with life span L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? Or at the end of turn t + L?\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means that at the start, life span is N, and after each turn, it decreases by 1. When it reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or something.\n> \n> But for planning, we need to know when it's gone.\n> \n> Typically in such games, if life span is L at turn t, it will be available until turn t + L - 1, and gone at turn t + L.\n> \n> For example, at turn 44, life span 6, so it decreases to 5 at turn 45, 4 at 46, ..., down to 0 at turn 50? Let's calculate.\n> \n> Turn 44: life span 6\n> \n> After turn 44 (i.e., after we move), countdown decreases by 1? The rule says \"every turn (including current)\", but it might be ambiguous.\n> \n> The input says \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\" for turn 44, so at the beginning of turn 44, life span is 6. After each turn, it decreases by 1.\n> \n> So after turn 44 is processed, life span becomes 5 for the next turn, and so on.\n> \n> It disappears when life span reaches 0, so at the end of turn when life span is 1, after that turn it decreases to 0 and disappears.\n> \n> So for (4,2), life span 6 at turn 44:\n> \n> - After turn 44: life span 5\n> \n> - After turn 45: 4\n> \n> - After turn 46: 3\n> \n> - After turn 47: 2\n> \n> - After turn 48: 1\n> \n> - After turn 49: 0, so it disappears before turn 50 or at turn 50? It should be gone at turn 50.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) life span 9 at turn 44, so it will last longer.\n> \n> For (4,2), it can be eaten from turn 44 to 49, I think. Since at turn 49, if we eat it, life span might be 1 or 0? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> At the start of turn t, food is present if life span > 0.\n> \n> After the move on turn t, if head eats food, it's consumed, and life span doesn't decrease that turn? The rule doesn't specify when exactly the eating happens.\n> \n> I think we need to assume that during the turn, when head moves to a cell with food, it eats it immediately, and then the life span decreases after all actions or something.\n> \n> To simplify, I think for planning, we can consider that at the beginning of each turn, food with life span > 0 is present, and can be eaten if head moves there.\n> \n> After eating, the food is removed, and for other food, life span decreases at the end of the turn.\n> \n> But the life span decrease is part of the turn processing.\n> \n> For this, since we're planning moves, we can think that when we move to a food cell, we eat it if it's there.\n> \n> For (4,2) at turn 44, life span 6, so it's present. If we move to it on turn 44, we eat it.\n> \n> If not, at turn 45, life span is 5, and so on.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,2).\n> \n> Now back to possible moves.\n> \n> At turn 44, from (4,4), I can go Down to (4,3) or Left to (3,4).\n> \n> Now, (4,3) is empty, as per snake positions.\n> \n> (3,4) is also empty.\n> \n> Now, let's see the food locations relative to head.\n> \n> (4,2) is below, at (4,2), and (6,2) is to the right and down.\n> \n> Head at (4,4), (4,2) is two steps down: from (4,4) to (4,3) to (4,2).\n> \n> (6,2) is right and down: from (4,4) to (5,4) but (5,4) is occupied, so not directly. Path might be via (4,3) or (3,4).\n> \n> Also, need to avoid risks.\n> \n> First, consider moving Down to (4,3) at turn 44.\n> \n> Then head to (4,3).\n> \n> Now, at (4,3), what can I do next turn.\n> \n> First, after moving to (4,3), the snake body: the tail moves, so the segment at (3,2) will move to the next position, but since head moved down, the body will follow.\n> \n> After turn 44, if I move D to (4,3), new head position (4,3), and the body: the previous head (4,4) becomes neck, so snake becomes: head (4,3), then (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), etc., but the tail will move away from (3,2).\n> \n> Let's update the snake positions after move.\n> \n> Current snake: positions list, head first.\n> \n> After moving D to (4,3), new head is (4,3), and the tail end is removed? No, when we move, if we don't eat food, the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> Snake movement: if no food eaten, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail segment is removed from the grid.\n> \n> So positions update.\n> \n> Initial positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)]\n> \n> After move D to (4,3):\n> \n> - New head: (4,3)\n> \n> - Then the body: the segment that was at (4,4) moves to where head was, but head was at (4,4), now at (4,3), so the first body segment (4,5) moves to (4,4), and so on.\n> \n> Standard way: the new positions are [new_head] + body[:-1], but since tail moves, the last element is removed.\n> \n> So new snake: head (4,3), then the previous head (4,4) is now first body, then (4,5), then (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1).

Head direction is down (D), meaning it was moving down to get to (4,3) from, I assume, (4,4) or something.

Snake positions: [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)]\n> \n> If head is at (4,3) and moving down (D), which is (x,y-1), so from (4,4) to (4,3)? But (4,4) is the second segment, which is the neck. So the head moved from (4,4) to (4,3) by moving down to (4,3), so at turn 44, head was at (4,4), and it moved D to (4,3) at turn 45? No.\n> \n> The state is for turn 45, so at the start of turn 45, snake is at these positions, and head direction is D, meaning the last move was down to get to (4,3) from (4,4). But (4,4) is now the second segment.\n> \n> For movement, on turn 45, I need to choose where to move from (4,3).\n> \n> Food positions: (4,2) with life span 5, value 1; and (6,2) with life span 8, value 1. Both are positive food, value +1.\n> \n> Life span: (4,2) has life 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn, so if not eaten by turn 49, it's gone. Similarly, (6,2) has life 8, disappears after turn 52.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6. But internal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells to avoid collisions.\n> \n> Head: (4,3)\n> \n> Body: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)\n> \n> So the tail is at (3,1).\n> \n> Food: (4,2) and (6,2)\n> \n> Now, from head (4,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But head direction is D, so I cannot move U (up) immediately because that would be instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n> \n> Current direction is D (down), so opposite is U (up). So I cannot move U on this turn.\n> \n> Possible moves: D, L, R. D is down, L is left, R is right.\n> \n> But I need to check if these moves are valid, no wall or body collision.\n> \n> First, move D (down): to (4,2). (4,2) has food, which is positive. But I need to check if it's safe to eat.\n> \n> (4,2) is a food position, and it's not occupied by snake body currently? Snake body: (4,3) is head, (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), etc., (5,2) is body, (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). Is (4,2) occupied? From the list: positions are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). So (4,2) is not in the list, so it's free, but has food.\n> \n> Now, if I move to (4,2), I eat the food, so snake grows: length increases by 1, and the new head is (4,2), tail stays, but when I eat, the tail doesn't move immediately? No.\n> \n> Movement: when snake moves, head goes to new position, and if no food eaten, tail end is removed. If food eaten, tail stays, so snake grows.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (4,2) and eat food, then new head is (4,2), and the tail remains, so the new tail will be the same as before, but since I ate, the body extends.\n> \n> Current positions: let's index: head index 0: (4,3), 1: (4,4), 2: (4,5), 3: (5,5), 4: (6,5), 5: (6,4), 6: (5,4), 7: (5,3), 8: (5,2), 9: (5,1), 10: (4,1), 11: (3,1) tail.\n> \n> If I move to (4,2), and eat food, then new head is (4,2), and the tail doesn't move, so positions become: head (4,2), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). So the snake grows by one segment, tail is still (3,1).\n> \n> But (4,2) is where head is, and it was food, so eaten.\n> \n> Now, is this safe? After moving, head is at (4,2), and body segments include (4,3), which is adjacent, but not collision unless head hits body.\n> \n> Collision if head touches body segment, except the tail if it moves away, but here tail is at (3,1), not near (4,2).\n> \n> (4,2) is adjacent to (4,3), but (4,3) is now the neck, not the head, so when head moves to (4,2), (4,3) becomes part of body, so head at (4,2) and body at (4,3), which is adjacent, but that's fine, as long as not the same cell. Collision is when head is in the same cell as a body segment.\n> \n> After move, cells: head (4,2), body: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). All distinct, so no collision.\n> \n> But what about the food at (4,2)? It's eaten, so no issue.\n> \n> But there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n> \n> Here, tail is at (3,1), which has no food, and head is moving to (4,2), not adjacent to tail before or after? Before moving, head at (4,3), tail at (3,1), not adjacent. After moving, head at (4,2), tail at (3,1), which are not adjacent; (4,2) and (3,1) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> (4,2) and (3,1): x differs by 1, y differs by 1, so diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent cells have same x and y±1 or same y and x±1.\n> \n> So (4,2) adjacent to (4,3), (4,1), (3,2), (5,2). (3,1) is not adjacent to (4,2).\n> \n> (4,2) to (3,1): delta x=1, delta y=1, not adjacent.\n> \n> So no issue.\n> \n> But (4,2) has food, and I'm eating it.\n> \n> Life span: (4,2) has life 5, current turn 45, so it will disappear after 5 turns, meaning if not eaten by turn 49, it's gone. Since I'm eating it now, it's fine.\n> \n> Now, other moves.\n> \n> Move L (left): to (3,3). Is (3,3) free? Snake positions: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). (3,3) not in list, so free. No food there, so just move, no growth. Head to (3,3), tail moves to (4,1)? Let's see.\n> \n> After move L: head to (3,3), then body: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), and tail (3,1) is removed? When no food, tail is removed.\n> \n> Positions: new head (3,3), then the previous head (4,3) becomes first body, then (4,4), ..., up to (4,1), and (3,1) is removed, so tail becomes (5,1) or something.\n> \n> List: after move, snake: [(3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)] and (3,1) is gone, so tail is (4,1).\n> \n> (4,1) was there, and (3,1) removed.\n> \n> Move R (right): to (5,3). (5,3) is occupied! (5,3) is a body segment. From list: (5,3) is the 8th segment? Positions: index 0: (4,3) head, 1: (4,4), 2: (4,5), 3: (5,5), 4: (6,5), 5: (6,4), 6: (5,4), 7: (5,3), 8: (5,2), etc. So (5,3) is position 7, which is a body segment. So moving to (5,3) would cause head to collide with body, death.\n> \n> Cannot move R.\n> \n> Move U (up): but cannot, because instant reverse. Current direction D, so U is opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> So possible moves: D or L.\n> \n> D: to (4,2) with food, eat and grow.\n> \n> L: to (3,3), no food, just move.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> First, if I go D to (4,2), eat food, score +1, snake grows to 13 segments? Current length is 12 positions, so after eating, 13.\n> \n> Then head at (4,2), direction D (since moved down).\n> \n> From there, possible moves: U, L, R. Cannot D? Head direction after move would be D, since I moved down to (4,2).\n> \n> After moving D to (4,2), new head direction is D.\n> \n> Then from (4,2), possible moves: cannot U (up, opposite), so D, L, R.\n> \n> But D to (4,1): (4,1) is body segment? After eating, positions: head (4,2), body (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). (4,1) is present, so (4,1) is occupied by body, cannot move to (4,1).\n> \n> L to (3,2): (3,2) is free? Not occupied, no food. Possible.\n> \n> R to (5,2): (5,2) is body segment? (5,2) is in the list, position 8, so occupied, cannot.\n> \n> So from (4,2), only possible move is L to (3,2), or U but U not allowed.\n> \n> Moves: D to (4,1) occupied, invalid. L to (3,2) free. R to (5,2) occupied, invalid. U is opposite, not allowed. So only L to (3,2).\n> \n> Then head to (3,2), no food, so tail moves: after move, head (3,2), then (4,2), (4,3), etc., tail (3,1) removed or something. Since no food eaten, tail moves.\n> \n> Previous positions: before move from (4,2), snake: (4,2) head, (4,3), (4,4), ..., (3,1) tail.\n> \n> Move L to (3,2): new head (3,2), then body: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), and tail (3,1) removed, so snake length 12 again.\n> \n> Tail was (3,1), removed, new tail is (4,1)? Positions: after move: head (3,2), then segments: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1). So tail is (4,1).\n> \n> Now head at (3,2), direction L (since moved left).\n> \n> From here, possible moves: U, D, L. Cannot R (right, opposite to L).\n> \n> U to (3,3): (3,3) free?

Walls: border x=0 and x=7, so x=2 is within 1-6, y=2 within 1-6, no wall, and not occupied, since snake at (3,2), (4,2), etc., (2,2) free.\n> \n> But I need to look at the bigger picture.\n> \n> If I had chosen L at turn 45: from (4,3) move L to (3,3), no food eaten.\n> \n> Then head at (3,3), direction L.\n> \n> Then from there, possible moves.\n> \n> First, let's compare the two options.\n> \n> Option 1: Turn 45 move D to (4,2), eat food, score +1, grow to 13 segments.

It's turn 46. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (4,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,2), then body segments: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). That's 13 segments. Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (4,2)\n> \n> - (4,3)\n> \n> - (4,4)\n> \n> - (4,5)\n> \n> - (5,5)\n> \n> - (6,5)\n> \n> - (6,4)\n> \n> - (5,4)\n> \n> - (5,3)\n> \n> - (5,2)\n> \n> - (5,1)\n> \n> - (4,1)\n> \n> - Tail: (3,1)\n> \n> Head direction is Down, which is (x,y-1). Since it's moving down, y decreases.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 7, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (1,3) with life span 10, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> Both foods are positive, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls: all borders, so (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x. Also internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> Snake body: let's plot the positions.\n> \n> - Row y=7: walls except possibly, but walls at borders, so y=7 is all walls except where obstacles aren't, but internal obstacle at (4,6), which is not on border.\n> \n> y=7 is top row, I assume y increases upwards or downwards? The movement: U is (x,y+1), so y increases upwards. Typically in grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The problem doesn't specify, but since U is (x,y+1), it might be that y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> In the snake positions, head at (4,2), and moving down to (4,3)? Down is (x,y-1), so if y increases upwards, down decreases y.\n> \n> Head at (4,2), direction Down, so next move would be to (4,1) if it continues down, but (4,1) is occupied by a body segment? Let's see the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)]\n> \n> So, (4,2) is head, then (4,3) which is above it if y increases up, so from head (4,2) to (4,3) which is y=3, so if y increases up, (4,3) is north of (4,2). But direction is Down, which should be decreasing y. Contradiction?\n> \n> Direction is given as \"Snake Head Direction: D\", and positions are listed head first.\n> \n> Perhaps the snake was moving down, so from previous position, it moved to (4,2) by going down, meaning y decreased.\n> \n> Let's think: if head is at (4,2) and direction is D, that means it arrived at (4,2) by moving down, so from (4,3) to (4,2)? But in positions, (4,3) is the first body segment after head, so head is (4,2), next is (4,3), which must be where the head was before, so the snake moved from (4,3) to (4,2) down, so y decreased from 3 to 2, so y=2 is below y=3 if y increases upwards. I think it's standard to have y=0 at bottom, y increasing up.\n> \n> Confirm with positions: head at (4,2), body at (4,3), so (4,3) is above (4,2), so the snake is moving down from (4,3) to (4,2), so direction down means decreasing y.\n> \n> Similarly, next segments: (4,4) above (4,3), (4,5) above (4,4), then (5,5) which is east and same y, but (4,5) to (5,5) is right, then (5,5) to (6,5) right, then (6,5) to (6,4) down? (6,5) to (6,4) is down, decreasing y, then (6,4) to (5,4) left? (6,4) to (5,4) is west, decreasing x, then (5,4) to (5,3) down, (5,3) to (5,2) down, (5,2) to (5,1) down, (5,1) to (4,1) west, (4,1) to (3,1) west.\n> \n> The snake has a complex shape, but head is at (4,2) moving down.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from current position (4,2) with direction Down.\n> \n> Since direction is Down, I cannot move Up (opposite) immediately, because of no instant reverse. So possible moves: Down, Left, Right. Down would be to (4,1), but (4,1) is occupied by a body segment? Positions: (4,1) is in the list, it's the 12th segment, but since the tail moves, I can move to a cell that will be vacated by the tail.\n> \n> General rule: the head can move to a cell that is not occupied by a body segment except the tail, because when the head moves, the tail also moves, so the cell that was tail is freed.\n> \n> In this case, current tail is at (3,1). When the snake moves, the head goes to a new position, and the tail is removed, so the cell (3,1) will be empty after move, but for the head movement, I need to see where it can move without colliding.\n> \n> Collision: head touches any body segment except the tail if it's moving into the tail position just as tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically, the head can move to the current tail position because the tail will move, so it's safe.\n> \n> Other body segments: if head moves to a cell occupied by a non-tail body, it dies.\n> \n> Also walls.\n> \n> From (4,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - Down (D): to (4,1)\n> \n> - Left (L): to (3,2)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (5,2)\n> \n> Now, check these cells:\n> \n> First, (4,1): is it occupied? Snake positions include (4,1), which is not the tail; tail is (3,1). (4,1) is the 12th segment, so it's a body part. If head moves to (4,1), it would collide with the body at (4,1), which is not the tail, so death. Therefore, cannot move Down to (4,1).\n> \n> Next, Left to (3,2): what is at (3,2)? Look at snake positions: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), etc., no (3,2) listed, so not occupied by body. Also, walls: x=0 to x=7 borders, so (3,2) is within 1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6? Borders: x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 walls. Internal obstacle (4,6).\n> \n> (3,2): x=3, y=2, not on border, not (4,6), so empty and safe to move.\n> \n> Right to (5,2): (5,2) is in snake positions? Positions: (5,2) is listed, it's the 10th segment, body part, not tail. So occupied, cannot move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: (5,2) is after head (4,2), so yes, body segment.\n> \n> Therefore, from (4,2), only possible safe move is Left to (3,2).\n> \n> Is that right? Down to (4,1) is body, Left to (3,2) empty, Right to (5,2) body.\n> \n> But what about Up? Direction is Down, so I cannot move Up because no instant reverse. Even if I could, Up to (4,3), but (4,3) is the first body segment, so occupied, death.\n> \n> So only possible move is Left to (3,2).\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Food: (6,2) with life span 7, value 1; and (1,3) with life span 10, value 1.\n> \n> (6,2) is at x=6,y=2. Current head at (4,2), so same row, but to the right.\n> \n> But moving right to (5,2) is blocked by body.\n> \n> (1,3) is at x=1,y=3.\n> \n> Now, life spans: (6,2) has life span 7, meaning it disappears after 7 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn 46, life span 7, so it will disappear on turn 46 + 7 - 1? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if food has life_span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it lasts for L more turns, including the current turn.\n> \n> For example, if L=1, it disappears after this turn, so can be eaten only this turn.\n> \n> If L=2, can be eaten this turn or next, disappears after next turn.\n> \n> In this case, (6,2) life span 7 at turn 46, so it can be eaten from turn 46 to 52, disappears after turn 52 (since turn 46 + 7 - 1 = 52? Let's calculate.\n> \n> At turn 46, life span 7: after turn 46, countdown 6 left; after turn 47, 5; ... after turn 52, countdown 0, so disappears before turn 53 or after turn 52? \"Disappears after N turns\" might be ambiguous.\n> \n> I think \"after N turns\" means after N turns from now, so if N=7, it disappears after 7 turns, meaning at the start of turn 53 it is gone, so can be eaten up to turn 52.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) life span 10, disappears after turn 56.\n> \n> Now, back to moves. From (4,2), only possible move is Left to (3,2), as we concluded.\n> \n> Then, after moving to (3,2), what next?\n> \n> At turn 46, move to (3,2).\n> \n> Then snake positions update: head now at (3,2), body segments: the previous head (4,2) becomes new first body, then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), and tail (3,1) is removed? When head moves, the tail is removed, so new tail is the second last, which was (4,1).\n> \n> After move to (3,2):\n> \n> - New head: (3,2)\n> \n> - Body: (4,2) [previous head], (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)  // (3,1) is gone\n> \n> (4,1) is now the tail.\n> \n> Direction: after moving Left, the new head direction is Left.\n> \n> Now, at (3,2), possible moves: since direction is Left, cannot move Right (instant reverse).\n> \n> Possible: Left to (2,2), Up to (3,3), Down to (3,1).\n> \n> Now, check cells:\n> \n> (2,2): not occupied, not wall.\n> \n> (3,3): not in snake positions, empty.\n> \n> (3,1): but (3,1) was tail, now removed, so empty?

So the tail is at (4,1). The snake is 13 segments long.\n> \n> Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to reach (3,2) from the previous position.

After moving, the snake will have a new head at (3,3), and the tail will move away from (4,1), but since we're only moving head, the body will shift.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> But for collision check, when head moves to a cell, it must not be wall or body except the tail cell which might be vacated.\n> \n> Rule: deadly collisions include body collision except that you can move into the tail cell because the tail moves.\n> \n> So for (3,3): not in body positions except possibly tail, but tail is at (4,1), not (3,3). Body segments: (4,2), (4,3), etc. (3,3) is not occupied, so safe to move there.\n> \n> Similarly, move D (down): to (3,1). (3,1) is within bounds? y=1, not y=0, so yes. Is it occupied? Body positions: (5,1) and (4,1), but (3,1) not listed, so empty. Walls: no, so safe.\n> \n> Move L (left): to (2,2). (2,2) should be within bounds, x=2 not 0.

It's turn 48. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6). The snake positions are: head at (3,1), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1). That's 13 segments. Head direction is down, which is D.\n> \n> Food locations: one at (6,2) with life span 5 and value +1, and another at (1,3) with life span 8 and value +1. Both are positive food.\n> \n> I should sketch this grid to visualize. Let's make a grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Rows y from 0 to 7, columns x from 0 to 7.\n> \n> - Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are borders. Internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> Snake: head (3,1), then body: (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1). Since head is at (3,1) and direction is down, moving down would go to (3,0), but y=0 is a wall, so that's illegal. Similarly, moving left to (2,1) might be possible, but I need to check walls and body.\n> \n> Current head direction is D, so last move was down. From turn 47, head was at (3,2) or something? Positions: at turn 48, head is (3,1), and before that was (3,2) since the list is head first. So from (3,2) it moved down to (3,1). So current direction is D.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is D, I can move L, R, or D, but not U because that would be instant reverse. Rules say \"no instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is D, so opposite is U. So I cannot move U next. Possible moves: D, L, R.\n> \n> But moving D to (3,0): y=0 is wall, so collision, death. So D is invalid.\n> \n> Moving L to (2,1): need to check if that cell is free.\n> \n> Moving R to (4,1): check if free.\n> \n> First, list all occupied cells by snake: (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1).\n> \n> So (2,1): is it occupied? Snake positions: (3,1) is head, (5,1) is tail or body? Positions: index 0: (3,1) head, 1: (3,2), 2: (4,2), 3: (4,3), 4: (4,4), 5: (4,5), 6: (5,5), 7: (6,5), 8: (6,4), 9: (5,4), 10: (5,3), 11: (5,2), 12: (5,1). So (5,1) is the last segment, tail.\n> \n> Now, (2,1): not in snake positions, and not a wall? Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (4,6). So (2,1): x=2, y=1, not border, not (4,6), so should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1): not in snake positions? Snake has (3,1), (4,2), etc., but not (4,1). (4,1) is not listed, so free? But let's list all snake cells: (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1). So (4,1) is not occupied, and not wall, so free.\n> \n> Also, (3,0) is y=0, wall.\n> \n> So possible moves from (3,1) with direction D: cannot U (reverse), cannot D (wall), so only L to (2,1) or R to (4,1).\n> \n> Now, food: (6,2) with life span 5, and (1,3) with life span 8.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current turn? State is at turn 48, so for (6,2), life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, so last chance to eat is on turn 52? Let's see: life span decreases every turn, starting from turn 48.\n> \n> At turn 48, life span is 5, so after turn 48, it decreases to 4 at turn 49, to 3 at 50, to 2 at 51, to 1 at 52, to 0 at 53, so it disappears after turn 53? \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> The description: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at the start of turn t, if life span is L, it decreases during turn t, so after turn t, it becomes L-1. If L=1 at start of turn, after the turn it becomes 0 and disappears? But food can be eaten during the turn.\n> \n> Typically, during turn t, if head moves to food, it is eaten, and then life span decreases or something? But the countdown decreases every turn, including when it is present.\n> \n> Assume that at the beginning of turn t, food has life span L. During the turn, if snake eats it, it's consumed; else, at the end of the turn, life span decreases by 1. If life span reaches 0 after decrease, it disappears.\n> \n> For example, food with life span 5 at turn 48: during turn 48, it can be eaten. If not, at end of turn 48, life span becomes 4. Turn 49: if eaten during, good; else decrease to 3, and so on, until turn 52: if not eaten during turn 52, at end of turn 52, life span becomes 0? Start turn 52 with life span 1, if not eaten during turn 52, at end decrease to 0 and disappear. So last chance to eat is during turn when life span >=1, so for life span 5 at turn 48, it can be eaten during turns 48,49,50,51,52. On turn 53 it would be gone if not eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, for (1,3) life span 8 at turn 48, can be eaten during turns 48 to 55.\n> \n> Now back to possible moves.\n> \n> At turn 48, from (3,1), head direction D, possible actions: L to (2,1) or R to (4,1). D is invalid (wall), U is invalid (reverse).\n> \n> So I need to choose between L or R.\n> \n> But I have to think multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns.\n> \n> First, let's see the grid layout.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all border cells, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (4,6)\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (3,1)\n> \n> Body: (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1)\n> \n> (5,1) is tail.\n> \n> Now, food at (6,2) and (1,3)\n> \n> (6,2): is this cell occupied?

The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm the grid size. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, but with an internal obstacle at (4,6). Also, food positions are given as (x,y,life_span,value), but value is always 1 for positive food? Let's see the food: (6,2,4,1) means (x=6,y=2, life_span=4, value=1), similarly (1,3,7,1) and (6,3,10,1). All have value=1, so all are positive food? The problem says negative food has value=-1, but here all are +1, so no negative food in this state. Good.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,1), and direction is R (right). Body segments: (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2). So the tail is at (5,2).\n> \n> List the snake positions in order:\n> \n> Head: (4,1)\n> \n> Then: (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) <-- tail.\n> \n> Current direction is R, so moving right.\n> \n> Now, food locations:\n> \n> - (6,2) with life_span=4, value=1\n> \n> - (1,3) with life_span=7, value=1\n> \n> - (6,3) with life_span=10, value=1\n> \n> All positive, so eating any is good, but we need to avoid risks.\n> \n> Life_span decreases every turn, including current turn, so at turn 49, life_span is as given, meaning after this turn, it decreases? Let's see the rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so when we are at turn t, the life_span is for that turn, and after action, it decreases.\n> \n> The state says \"Current Turn: t1=49\", and food has life_span given. So for (6,2), life_span=4, meaning it will disappear after 4 more turns, including turn 49? Or at the end of turn 49?\n> \n> I think it's better to interpret: at the start of turn t, life_span is the number of turns it will remain, including t. So after turn t, life_span decreases by 1.\n> \n> Standard: if life_span is N at turn t, it means it will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, at turn t, with life_span L, it means:\n> \n> - After turn t, life_span becomes L-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, L-2, and so on, until L=0, it disappears.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" might mean after N turns from now, so if L=4 at turn t, it disappears after turn t+3? I need to be careful.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Probably, at the beginning of turn t, if life_span is N, then:\n> \n> - During turn t, it is present\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown decreases to N-1\n> \n> - If N-1 >0, it remains for turn t+1, and so on.\n> \n> - When countdown reaches 0 after decrease, it disappears.\n> \n> So for food at (6,2) with life_span=4 at turn 49:\n> \n> - Turn 49: present, life_span=4\n> \n> - After turn 49, life_span=3, present for turn 50\n> \n> - After turn 50, life_span=2, present for turn 51\n> \n> - After turn 51, life_span=1, present for turn 52\n> \n> - After turn 52, life_span=0, disappears, not present for turn 53.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> (1,3) life_span=7 at turn 49, so lasts until after turn 55? Let's not get ahead.\n> \n> First, I need to plan actions for turn 49 and beyond.\n> \n> Current head position: (4,1), direction R, so moving right, so from (4,1), possible moves: since direction is R, I can go U, D, R, but not L because L is opposite to R? Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is R, so for next move (turn 49 action), I cannot go L (left), because that would be reverse. So possible moves: U (up), D (down), R (right).\n> \n> Grid: walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so for (4,1), y=1, so U to (4,2), D to (4,0) but y=0 is wall, so D is invalid.

So moving to (4,2) would collide with body, death.\n> \n> - D: to (4,0) – y=0 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n> \n> - R: to (5,1) – is (5,1) occupied? Look at snake positions: (5,1) not listed, so empty? Cells: (5,2) is tail, (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) are occupied, but (5,1) is not in the list, so should be free.\n> \n> Positions: (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)\n> \n> So (5,1) not occupied, and not wall, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,0) is wall, (3,1) occupied, but we can't go there anyway.\n> \n> So from (4,1), with direction R:\n> \n> - U to (4,2): occupied by body, collision, invalid\n> \n> - D to (4,0): wall, invalid\n> \n> - R to (5,1): free, valid\n> \n> - L to (3,1): but L is reverse, not allowed, and also occupied, but invalid due to reverse anyway.\n> \n> So only possible move is R to (5,1).\n> \n> Is that right? U to (4,2) is occupied, D to wall, L not allowed, so only R is possible?\n> \n> But (4,2) is part of the body, so yes, collision.\n> \n> But let's confirm the snake movement: when snake moves, the head moves to new position, and each segment moves to the next position, so the tail moves away.\n> \n> But at the moment, before move, (4,2) is occupied, so if head moves to (4,2), it collides.\n> \n> Unless it's the tail, but (4,2) is not tail; tail is (5,2).\n> \n> In this case, (4,2) is a body segment, so moving head there would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) is free, so moving there is safe.\n> \n> But is there any other possibility?

Earlier I had 13 segments initially.\n> \n> Turn 50: start with 13 segments.\n> \n> Move to (6,1), no eat, so new snake: head (6,1), then the 12 body segments from old head to second last: old positions 0 to 11: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) — that's 12, and tail (5,3) removed. So new snake has 12 segments: head (6,1) and 11 body segments? List indices.\n> \n> After move to (6,1) no eat: new positions: segment 0: (6,1) head, segment 1: (5,1), segment 2: (4,1), segment 3: (3,1), segment 4: (3,2), segment 5: (4,2), segment 6: (4,3), segment 7: (4,4), segment 8: (4,5), segment 9: (5,5), segment 10: (6,5), segment 11: (6,4), segment 12: (5,4) tail? No, after move, the segments are: new head at (6,1), then the old segments from 0 to 11 become the new body segments 1 to 12, but since no growth, there is no segment 12, only up to index 11 for the body.\n> \n> Standard: when moving without eating, the head moves to new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, so the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> So for turn 50 to 51: after move to (6,1), positions: head: (6,1), body: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), and tail is (5,4) — but (5,4) was segment 11, which is now the last body segment, so tail at (5,4). And (5,3) is gone.\n> \n> Number of segments: 13 originally, after move no eat, 12 segments.\n> \n> Similarly, if I had moved U to (5,2), same thing, 12 segments.\n> \n> Now, back to after moving R to (6,1) on turn 50, on turn 51 head at (6,1), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (6,2), D invalid, L to (5,1) but (5,1) is body segment, collision, invalid. R to (7,1) wall invalid. So only U to (6,2).\n> \n> Then move U to (6,2), which has food, so eat it, head to (6,2), and since eat, tail does not move, so snake grows: new head at (6,2), then body: the previous head (6,1) becomes new segment, and all body segments stay, so positions: head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) — and tail still at (5,4)? Let's see: after eating, the new segment is added at the head, so the body includes the previous head position.\n> \n> After move to (6,2) with eat: new head at (6,2), then the previous positions: previous head (6,1) becomes first body, then (5,1), (4,1), ..., up to (5,4), and since tail didn't move, (5,4) is still there, but now it's not tail, the tail is the last one, which is (5,4) still? Positions: segment 0: (6,2) head, segment 1: (6,1), segment 2: (5,1), segment 3: (4,1), segment 4: (3,1), segment 5: (3,2), segment 6: (4,2), segment 7: (4,3), segment 8: (4,4), segment 9: (4,5), segment 10: (5,5), segment 11: (6,5), segment 12: (6,4), segment 13: (5,4) tail. Yes, 14 segments now.\n> \n> Then direction is U.\n> \n> Now, on turn 51, head at (6,2), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (6,3), D to (6,1) but (6,1) is body segment, collision, invalid.

Current positions: (6,2) head, (6,1) body, (5,1) body, etc. (5,2) not listed, so should be empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) has food, but let's see if it can be eaten.\n> \n> Move U to (6,3): (6,3) has food with life span 9, so I can eat it.\n> \n> But is there a danger? Tail is at (5,4), which is not adjacent to (6,3)? (6,3) and (5,4) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing edge, so (6,3) adjacent cells: (5,3), (6,2), (7,3), (6,4).\n> \n> (6,2) is body, (6,4) is body? From above, segment 12 is (6,4), which is body, not tail. Tail is (5,4).\n> \n> (6,3) adjacent to (6,4) which is a body segment, but when I move to (6,3), if I eat, the head moves there, and if (6,4) is body, but since I'm moving to (6,3), which is not (6,4), and after eating, the body grows, so (6,4) remains body.\n> \n> But collision only if head touches body, which it doesn't immediately, but when moving to (6,3), it might be adjacent to body, but as long as not moving into a body cell, it's ok. The danger is only if the head moves to a cell occupied by body or wall.\n> \n> (6,3) is not occupied currently, so moving there is fine, and I eat the food.\n> \n> Then snake grows again.\n> \n> But let's sequence.\n> \n> If I go this path, on turn 50: R to (6,1)\n> \n> Then turn 51: must U to (6,2) and eat food there.\n> \n> Then turn 52: head at (6,2), direction U, I can move to (6,3) and eat that food too, since it's there.\n> \n> (6,3) has life span 9, plenty.\n> \n> Then I would have eaten two food quickly, but is it safe?\n> \n> After turn 51: head at (6,2), after eating (6,2) food.\n> \n> Then on turn 52, move to (6,3): (6,3) has food, so eat it, head to (6,3), grow, tail not move.\n> \n> New positions: head (6,3), then (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), etc., up to (5,4) tail?

Positions: segment 0: (6,3) head, segment 1: (6,2), segment 2: (6,1), segment 3: (5,1), ..., segment 13: (6,4), segment 14: (5,4) tail? From turn 51, there were 14 segments: indices 0 to 13?

Similarly for others.\n> \n> Perhaps it's (x, y, value, life_span) or (x, y, life_span, value)? I think I should assume the format is (x, y, life_span, value) since for (6,2,2,1) if life_span=2 and value=1, that makes sense with the description.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3,5,1) life_span=5, value=1; (6,3,8,1) life_span=8, value=1.\n> \n> And value=1 for all, so all are positive food.

No.\n> \n> When snake eats, it grows, so the tail does not move; a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail stays in place, and the new head position is added.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so the snake grows by one.\n> \n> But in terms of movement, when you move, if not eating, head moves to new cell, tail moves to next segment, so tail cell is freed.\n> \n> If eating, head moves to food, tail does not move, so the cell is occupied, and snake length increases.\n> \n> In this case, for turn 51, if I move R to (6,2) and eat, then new snake positions: head (6,2), then the previous head (5,2) becomes first body, then (5,1), (4,1), etc., up to tail (5,4), and since I ate, a new segment is added at the current tail position (5,4), so the new tail is still at (5,4)? No.\n> \n> Let's think: before move, snake segments: S0: (5,2), S1: (5,1), S2: (4,1), S3: (3,1), S4: (3,2), S5: (4,2), S6: (4,3), S7: (4,4), S8: (4,5), S9: (5,5), S10: (6,5), S11: (6,4), S12: (5,4) tail.\n> \n> After moving R to (6,2) and eating: head moves to (6,2), so new head is (6,2). The body segments remain, but since eating, the tail does not move, so the new segments are: head (6,2), then S0 becomes body: (5,2), then S1: (5,1), S2: (4,1), ..., S12: (5,4), and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so new tail at (5,4), but the segment that was tail is now second last, and new segment at (5,4)? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard: after eating, the snake has the same segments plus the new head, and the tail segment stays, so the new tail is the old tail, and length increases.\n> \n> Positions: the new head is at the food cell (6,2). The previous head (5,2) is now the first body segment. Then the rest of the body is the same: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), and the tail (5,4) remains. But since we ate, a new segment is added, so the tail should be extended. So the new segments are: head (6,2), then (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), and then the new tail is at (5,4) because we add a new segment there. So positions: 1. (6,2) head, 2. (5,2), 3. (5,1), 4. (4,1), 5. (3,1), 6. (3,2), 7. (4,2), 8. (4,3), 9. (4,4), 10. (4,5), 11. (5,5), 12. (6,5), 13. (6,4), 14. (5,4) new tail.\n> \n> But (5,4) was the old tail, and now it's still there, but the snake has grown, so (5,4) is occupied, and the new tail is (5,4), so it's the same cell, but the segment is there.\n> \n> In terms of cells, (5,4) is occupied.\n> \n> From turn 51 to 52, after eating at (6,2), snake positions: head (6,2), body: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), and tail (5,4).\n> \n> Now, head at (6,2), direction: since I moved R, new direction is R.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (6,2): U, D, L, but not R?

Actions: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> Since head is at (5,3) and direction is U, moving up would go to (5,4). But let's see what cells are occupied.\n> \n> First, list all occupied cells by snake:\n> \n> - Head: (5,3)\n> \n> - Body: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)\n> \n> Tail is (6,4).\n> \n> Also, walls: borders and (4,6).\n> \n> So, possible moves from (5,3):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (5,4) – is this safe? (5,4) is not in snake positions? Snake positions: (5,3) head, then (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4). (4,4) is a body segment, but (5,4) is not listed. Let me list all snake coordinates:\n> \n> Index: 0: (5,3) head\n> \n> 1: (5,2)\n> \n> 2: (5,1)\n> \n> 3: (4,1)\n> \n> 4: (3,1)\n> \n> 5: (3,2)\n> \n> 6: (4,2)\n> \n> 7: (4,3)\n> \n> 8: (4,4)\n> \n> 9: (4,5)\n> \n> 10: (5,5)\n> \n> 11: (6,5)\n> \n> 12: (6,4) tail\n> \n> So cells occupied: (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)\n> \n> (5,4) is not occupied. (5,4) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) is food, (6,2) is food, etc.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from head (5,3):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (5,4) – (5,4) is not occupied, and y=4 is within 0 to 7, x=5 within 0 to 7, not wall. Walls: borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (5,4) is fine. No internal wall at (5,4), obstacle is at (4,6).\n> \n> - Down (D): to (5,2) – but (5,2) is a body segment, so moving there would cause collision, unless it's the tail and we move away, but (5,2) is not the tail; tail is (6,4). (5,2) is the second segment, so if head moves to (5,2), it would hit the body at index 1, which is not the tail, so death. So Down is invalid.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (4,3) – (4,3) is a body segment, index 7, not tail, so collision. Invalid.\n> \n> - Right (R): to (6,3) – (6,3) has food, but let's see if it's occupied. (6,3) is not in snake positions; it's a food position. Snake has (6,4) and (6,5), but not (6,3). So (6,3) is free, except for food.\n> \n> (6,3) has food with value 1 and life span 7.\n> \n> Moving to (6,3) is possible.\n> \n> But head direction is U, so moving Right might be allowed, but we have to consider the no instant reverse.\n> \n> Current head direction is U (up). Moving opposite would be D (down), but we're not moving D. Moving L or R is perpendicular, not opposite, so it should be fine. No instant reverse only applies to opposite direction. Since U and D are opposites, L and R are opposites to each other, but perpendicular moves are ok.\n> \n> So from U, I can go U, L, or R, but not D.\n> \n> In this case, possible moves: U, R, but not L? Left to (4,3) is occupied, so invalid. Down is opposite and occupied, invalid. So only U and R are possible? U to (5,4), R to (6,3).\n> \n> R to (6,3) is possible, and it has food.\n> \n> But there's also food at (6,2) with life span 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now.\n> \n> (6,2) has life span 1, so if not eaten on turn 52, it will be gone.\n> \n> Now, (6,3) has life span 7, so it will be around for several turns.\n> \n> Also, (1,3) and (2,1) with longer life spans.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> First, for turn 52, I must choose an action.\n> \n> Options:\n> \n> 1. Move U to (5,4): this is an empty cell, no food, so snake doesn't grow, just moves.\n> \n> 2. Move R to (6,3): this has food, so eating it would increase length to 14, and the segment added at the end.\n> \n> When snake eats food, it grows on the next move, meaning that after moving to a food cell, the tail doesn't move that turn, so length increases.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to food, the tail stays, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (6,3), which has food, value +1, so I eat it, score +1, length becomes 14, and the new tail will be added after this move.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows, so the position list will have head at (6,3), and tail stays where it was, but since tail moves only when not eating, when eating, tail doesn't move, so positions: new head at (6,3), body segments shift, tail remains.\n> \n> But in terms of positions, after move: head moves to new position, if food eaten, tail doesn't move, so the segment that was tail is still there, and a new segment is added, but since it's the tail, it stays.\n> \n> For collision, we need to see where the body is after the move.\n> \n> But for now, let's list possible actions for turn 52.\n> \n> Also, there is a danger with tail: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n> \n> Currently, head at (5,3), tail at (6,4). Are they adjacent? (5,3) and (6,4): difference in x is 1, y is 1, so diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so same x or y, diff by 1.\n> \n> (5,3) and (6,4) are not adjacent; adjacent cells would be (5,4), (6,3), (5,2), (4,3) for (5,3).\n> \n> (6,3) is adjacent to head, but (6,3) is food, not tail.\n> \n> Tail is at (6,4), which is adjacent to head? (5,3) and (6,4): x diff 1, y diff 1, not sharing side, so not adjacent. Only if same row or column with diff 1.\n> \n> So no adjacency with tail now.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (6,3) is safe and gets food.\n> \n> Moving to (5,4) is safe but no food.\n> \n> Now, food at (6,2) will disappear after this turn, so if I don't eat it now, it's gone.\n> \n> To eat (6,2), I need to move to it, but from (5,3), to go to (6,2), I need to move down-right or something, but I can only move one cell per turn.\n> \n> From (5,3), I can go to (6,3) this turn, then next turn to (6,2), but if I go to (6,3) this turn, on turn 52, I eat the food at (6,3), then on turn 53, head at (6,3), I can move to (6,2) if possible.\n> \n> But (6,2) has life span 1, meaning it disappears after turn 52. Since we're on turn 52, if I don't eat it on this turn, it will be gone before turn 53.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (6,2) with life span 1: on turn 52, if not eaten, it disappears after turn 52, so not available for turn 53.\n> \n> Similarly, for life span N, it lasts for N turns starting from when it appears, but we don't know when it appeared, but life span decreases each turn.\n> \n> In the state, it's given with current life span, so for (6,2), life span=1, so it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now.\n> \n> Therefore, to eat (6,2), I must move directly to it on turn 52.\n> \n> But from current position (5,3), can I move directly to (6,2)? (6,2) is not adjacent to (5,3); adjacent cells are (5,4), (5,2), (4,3), (6,3).\n> \n> (5,3) to (6,2) is not a valid move; it's diagonal, not allowed. I can only move up, down, left, right to adjacent cells.\n> \n> So I cannot move directly to (6,2) from (5,3); it's not reachable in one move.\n> \n> Therefore, I cannot eat (6,2) on turn 52; it's impossible. So it will disappear after this turn, and I miss it.\n> \n> No point worrying about it.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (1,3) life span 4, (6,3) life span 7, (2,1) life span 10.\n> \n> So for turn 52, I can choose to go U to (5,4) or R to (6,3).\n> \n> If I go R to (6,3), I eat the food there, gain +1, length increases to 14.\n> \n> If I go U to (5,4), no food, snake moves, length same.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, after moving, the head direction changes.\n> \n> If I move R to (6,3), new head direction is R (right).\n> \n> If I move U to (5,4), new head direction is U (still up).\n> \n> Now, let's consider the grid and possible paths.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Walls: borders, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, cannot move there. Internal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head (5,3)\n> \n> Body: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), tail (6,4)\n> \n> List of positions:\n> \n> - Row y=3: x=4,5,6: (4,3) body, (5,3) head, (6,3) food\n> \n> - y=4: (4,4) body, (5,4) empty?

Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for a food with life span L on turn t, it will be present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear after turn t+L-1, so not available on turn t+L.\n> \n> For (1,3) life span 4 on turn 52: present on turns 52,53,54,55; disappears after turn 55, so not on turn 56.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) life span 7: present turns 52 to 58.\n> \n> (2,1) life span 10: turns 52 to 61.\n> \n> (6,2) life span 1: only on turn 52, gone after.\n> \n> Since I can't eat (6,2), it will be gone.\n> \n> Now, back to actions for turn 52.\n> \n> Option A: Move R to (6,3) - eat food, grow to 14, new head at (6,3), direction R.\n> \n> Option B: Move U to (5,4) - no food, head at (5,4), direction U.\n> \n> I need to see which is better long-term.\n> \n> First, let's consider Option A: Move R to (6,3) on turn 52.\n> \n> After eating, head at (6,3), snake length 14. The body: since we ate, tail doesn't move, so positions: new head (6,3), then the previous body: (5,3) becomes segment 1, (5,2) segment 2, ..., up to tail (6,4) still there, and since we ate, the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is still (6,4)? No.\n> \n> When snake eats, the head moves to food, and the tail stays in place for that turn, so the snake grows by one segment at the tail end.\n> \n> So positions after move: head at (6,3), then the previous head (5,3) is now segment 1, (5,2) segment 2, ..., and the tail (6,4) is still segment 12? Let's index.\n> \n> Original positions before move: 0:(5,3) head, 1:(5,2), 2:(5,1), 3:(4,1), 4:(3,1), 5:(3,2), 6:(4,2), 7:(4,3), 8:(4,4), 9:(4,5), 10:(5,5), 11:(6,5), 12:(6,4) tail.\n> \n> After moving to (6,3) and eating: head moves to (6,3), so new position 0: (6,3)\n> \n> Then the body: segment 1 is previous head (5,3), segment 2 is (5,2), ..., up to segment 12 is (6,5)? Since tail didn't move, the last segment is still (6,4), but we add a new segment.\n> \n> Standard: when not eating, head moves to new cell, tail moves out of old tail cell, so positions shift.\n> \n> When eating, head moves to new cell, tail does not move, so the old tail remains, and a new segment is added at the tail, so length increases.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after eating, the head is at new position, and all previous positions remain, with the tail unchanged, so the new body includes all old segments plus the head moved.\n> \n> So after move to (6,3) with eat:\n> \n> - Head: (6,3)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (5,3)  // previous head\n> \n> - Segment 2: (5,2)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (5,1)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (4,1)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (3,1)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 7: (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 8: (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 9: (4,4)\n> \n> - Segment 10: (4,5)\n> \n> - Segment 11: (5,5)\n> \n> - Segment 12: (6,5)\n> \n> - Segment 13: (6,4)  // tail, same as before\n> \n> But now length is 14, with tail at (6,4).\n> \n> The cell (6,4) is still occupied, but it was the tail, and we didn't move from there, so it's fine.\n> \n> Now, for turn 53, head at (6,3), direction R (since we moved right).\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,3):\n> \n> - U: to (6,4) – but (6,4) is now segment 13, the tail.

So the tail is at (6,5). The head direction is U (up), meaning it was moving upwards to get to (5,4) from (5,3)?

Life span decreases each turn, including current, so at turn 53, food at (1,3) has 4 turns left, meaning it disappears after turn 56?

But since head direction is U, I cannot move D (down) immediately because that would be instant reverse. So allowed moves: U, L, R. Not D.\n> \n> Let's list possible actions for turn 53:\n> \n> - U: to (5,5)\n> \n> - L: to (4,4)\n> \n> - R: to (6,4)\n> \n> Now, check for collisions or walls.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> So moving:\n> \n> - U to (5,5): what is at (5,5)? Snake positions: (5,5) is part of the body, it's the 12th segment? List positions again: indices: 0: head (5,4), 1: (5,3), 2: (5,2), 3: (5,1), 4: (4,1), 5: (3,1), 6: (3,2), 7: (4,2), 8: (4,3), 9: (4,4), 10: (4,5), 11: (5,5), 12: (6,5) tail.\n> \n> (5,5) is position 11, which is a body segment. If I move to (5,5), that's a body collision, except if it's the tail. But the tail is at (6,5), and (5,5) is not the tail; it's a segment before that. So moving to (5,5) would cause head to hit body, death.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, (5,5) is not the tail; tail is (6,5). So (5,5) is a body segment, so moving there causes collision. U is invalid.\n> \n> L to (4,4): (4,4) is position 9 in the list, which is a body segment. Similarly, not tail, so collision.\n> \n> R to (6,4): (6,4) is not in the snake positions? Let's see: positions are all listed, (6,4) is not there. Also, not a wall. Walls: x=0,7 y=0,7 borders, and (4,6) internal.\n> \n> (6,4): x=6, y=4. x=6 is not 7, so not border wall. y=4 not 0 or 7. And not (4,6). So (6,4) should be empty. But is it occupied by food? Food is at (1,3), (6,3), (2,1). (6,4) is not food, so empty cell.\n> \n> So R to (6,4) is possible.\n> \n> But I thought U and L are invalid? U to (5,5) is body, L to (4,4) is body.\n> \n> What about D? D is down to (5,3), but (5,3) is position 1, body segment, and also, instant reverse? Head direction is U, moving D would be opposite direction, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> Current head direction is U, so cannot move D. So only possible move is R to (6,4).\n> \n> Is that the only choice? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,4). Neighbors:\n> \n> - Up: (5,5) - occupied by body at index 11\n> \n> - Down: (5,3) - occupied by body at index 1\n> \n> - Left: (4,4) - occupied by body at index 9\n> \n> - Right: (6,4) - not occupied, not wall, so free.\n> \n> And since head direction U, cannot move down anyway.\n> \n> So indeed, only possible move is R to (6,4).\n> \n> But that seems forced. I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Turn 53 action must be R, since it's the only choice.\n> \n> Then, after moving R to (6,4), new head position (6,4), direction now R (since moved right).\n> \n> Snake will move: head to (6,4), tail moves forward?

Food at (6,3) is one, but (6,5) has no food mentioned.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (6,3): (6,3) has food, positive, value +1.\n> \n> But need to check if eating is safe.\n> \n> First, let's consider the moves.\n> \n> Turn 54 options:\n> \n> - U to (6,5): empty cell, no food.\n> \n> - D to (6,3): food at (6,3), so if move there, eat food, snake grows.\n> \n> But check Tail Reward Danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills, but here food is at (6,3), not on tail.\n> \n> Current tail is at (5,5).\n> \n> After moving to (6,3), if we eat, head moves to (6,3), then since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so new tail is still the old tail, but positions: after eating, head to (6,3), and body includes all previous positions, so length increases by one.\n> \n> Current positions before move: [(6,4), (5,4), ..., (5,5)]\n> \n> If move D to (6,3) and eat, new head (6,3), then body: (6,4), (5,4), ..., (5,5), so tail is (5,5).\n> \n> Now, is head adjacent to tail?

It's turn 54, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since the borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. There's an internal obstacle at (4,6), which I must avoid.\n> \n> The snake positions are given: head is at (6,4), and the body segments follow: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). That's 13 segments, so the snake length is 13.\n> \n> The head direction is right (R), so the snake is moving to the right. Last move was to the right, so I can't do an instant reverse, meaning I can't move left on the next turn because that would be opposite to current direction.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (1,3) with value 1 and life span 3. So, it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 54, life span 3 means it will be gone by turn 57? Let's clarify: if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, meaning it lasts for N more turns including t. So at turn t, life span N, it will be there until turn t + N - 1? I need to be careful.\n> \n> The problem says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So, for a food with life span L at turn T, it will disappear after T + L - 1? For example, at turn 54, life span 3, so:\n> \n> - Turn 54: life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 55: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 56: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 57: disappears? Or at turn 56 it has life span 1, and after that turn, it disappears, so not present on turn 57.\n> \n> Typically, if countdown decreases every turn including current, and it disappears after N turns, that means on the turn when countdown reaches 0, it can still be eaten, and after that, it's gone. But the problem says \"disappears after N turns\", which might be ambiguous.\n> \n> Let me read: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so if life_span is given as N, at the current turn, the countdown starts at N, decreases by 1 each turn. When countdown reaches 0, after that turn, it disappears. So for (1,3): at turn 54, life span 3, so countdown=3. After turn 54, countdown=2; after turn 55, countdown=1; after turn 56, countdown=0, so it disappears after turn 56, meaning not present on turn 57.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) has life span 5, so at turn 54, countdown=5, disappears after turn 58.\n> \n> (2,1) has life span 8, countdown=8 at turn 54, disappears after turn 61.\n> \n> All food have value +1, so all positive food.

Also internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,4), then (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). Let's list all positions to understand the shape.\n> \n> Starting from head: (6,4) - head\n> \n> Then body: (5,4), which is left of head.\n> \n> Then (5,3) - down? y decreases down? The movement: U is (x,y+1), so y increases up, I assume. Standard coordinates: y=0 bottom, y=7 top? But in the positions, let's see the y-values.\n> \n> Snake positions: (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)\n> \n> So let's plot this:\n> \n> - Row y=4: (6,4), (5,4)\n> \n> - y=3: (5,3)\n> \n> - y=2: (5,2)\n> \n> - y=1: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)\n> \n> Then (3,2) at y=2, x=3\n> \n> (4,2) at y=2, x=4\n> \n> (4,3) at y=3, x=4\n> \n> (4,4) at y=4, x=4\n> \n> (4,5) at y=5, x=4\n> \n> (5,5) at y=5, x=5\n> \n> So the snake body forms a sort of loop or something. From (3,1) it goes up to (3,2), then right to (4,2), up to (4,3), up to (4,4), up to (4,5), then right to (5,5). But head is at (6,4) moving right.\n> \n> Current head direction is R, so from (5,4) it moved to (6,4) right? Positions are head first, so the snake was at (5,4) at previous position, moved right to (6,4), and the tail will move from (5,5) or something? Let's see the movement.\n> \n> The positions list: index 0: head (6,4), index 1: (5,4), which is the segment behind head, so when head moves, this becomes the new position, but since it moved right, from turn 53, head was at (5,4), moved to (6,4) on turn 54.\n> \n> Then the tail is (5,5), which is the last segment.\n> \n> Now, food locations:\n> \n> - (1,3): x=1,y=3\n> \n> - (6,3): x=6,y=3\n> \n> - (2,1): x=2,y=1\n> \n> All with value +1.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose an action for turn 54 and a sequence for a few turns ahead.\n> \n> First, possible moves from current position (6,4) with head direction R.\n> \n> I can move U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> But no instant reverse, so since current direction is R, I cannot move L (left) immediately, because that would be opposite. So possible moves: U, D, R. L is not allowed.\n> \n> Now, check what cells are around:\n> \n> - Right: (7,4) - but x=7 is border wall, so cannot move right, collision.\n> \n> - Up: (6,5) - is this free? Let's see if it's occupied or wall.\n> \n> y=5, x=6. Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (6,5) is not border, internal obstacle is (4,6), not here. Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)\n> \n> So (6,5) is not in this list, so it should be free? But is there food? Food at (6,3), not (6,5). (6,5) is empty, I think.\n> \n> Similarly, down: (6,3) - is there food? Food at (6,3), with value 1, life span 5.\n> \n> (6,3) is a food position, but is it occupied? No, the snake is not on it; head is at (6,4), so (6,3) is free, but has food.\n> \n> Left: (5,4) - but (5,4) is the body segment, directly behind head? In the positions, (5,4) is index 1, which is the first body segment. If I move left to (5,4), that would be colliding with body, but in Snake, when you move, the tail moves, so if you move into a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's ok, but here (5,4) is not the tail; tail is (5,5).\n> \n> General rule: moving to a cell occupied by the body is deadly unless it's the tail cell that will move away.\n> \n> Specifically, for a cell that is occupied by the body, if it's the tail and the tail will move, then head can move there after tail moves, so no collision. But if it's not the tail, then collision.\n> \n> In this case, from (6,4), moving left to (5,4): (5,4) is currently occupied by the first body segment. After the move, the head moves to (5,4), but at that moment, the body segment that was there will have moved? Let's think step by step.\n> \n> At the start of turn, positions are fixed. When head moves to a new cell:\n> \n> - If the new cell is food, snake grows, so tail doesn't move.\n> \n> - Else, tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> But for collision: head collides if it moves to a cell occupied by any body segment except that if it's the tail cell and no growth, then it's ok because tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (5,4): (5,4) is currently occupied by a body segment (index 1). After head moves to (5,4), if no food eaten, the tail (5,5) will move to the next position, but the segment at (5,4) will become part of the body. Specifically, when head moves to (5,4), the segment that was at (5,4) will be pushed to where? The body follows.\n> \n> Standard Snake mechanics: when head moves to a new cell, if not food, the tail is removed, and all segments shift. So the cell that was occupied by the first body segment might be vacated or not.\n> \n> But for collision detection: before moving, if the cell head wants to move to is occupied by any body segment, and that segment is not the tail (or if it is tail but snake grows), then collision.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, only if the cell is occupied by the tail and no growth, it's safe. Otherwise, if occupied by any other body segment, collision.\n> \n> Here, for (5,4): it is occupied by a body segment, and it's not the tail (tail is (5,5)), so moving left to (5,4) would cause collision with body, deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, moving down to (6,3): (6,3) is not occupied by snake, it has food, so if I move there, I eat the food and grow.\n> \n> Moving up to (6,5): not occupied, no food, so just move.\n> \n> Moving right to (7,4): wall, collision.\n> \n> So possible moves: U to (6,5) or D to (6,3) with eating food.\n> \n> R is impossible due to wall.\n> \n> L is impossible due to body collision and also instant reverse not allowed.\n> \n> So only U or D.\n> \n> Now, U: (6,5), no food, so snake moves, no growth, tail moves away.\n> \n> D: (6,3), has food, so eat food, snake grows to length 14, tail stays.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food.\n> \n> Food at (6,3) is very close, life span 5, so plenty of time.\n> \n> But if I eat it now, I grow, which might make the snake longer and potentially more risk, but since it's positive, it's good for score.\n> \n> But I need to consider the path and future moves.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (1,3) with life span 3, so it disappears after turn 56, meaning I have until turn 56 to eat it. Turn 54,55,56 it exists, gone on turn 57.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) life span 8, plenty of time.\n> \n> Now, the snake is long, 13 segments, so space might be tight.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all borders and (4,6).\n> \n> Snake:\n> \n> - (6,4) head\n> \n> - (5,4)\n> \n> - (5,3)\n> \n> - (5,2)\n> \n> - (5,1)\n> \n> - (4,1)\n> \n> - (3,1)\n> \n> - (3,2)\n> \n> - (4,2)\n> \n> - (4,3)\n> \n> - (4,4)\n> \n> - (4,5)\n> \n> - (5,5) tail\n> \n> Food: (1,3), (6,3), (2,1)\n> \n> (2,1) is at x=2,y=1, but snake has (3,1) and (4,1), etc., so (2,1) might be near.\n> \n> (2,1): x=2,y=1\n> \n> Snake has (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), so (2,1) is adjacent to (3,1), but not occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) at x=1,y=3, not occupied.\n> \n> (6,3) at x=6,y=3, not occupied.\n> \n> Now, back to choices: move down to (6,3) to eat food now, or move up to (6,5).\n> \n> If I move down to (6,3), I eat the food, score +1, length becomes 14. Then head is at (6,3), direction down.\n> \n> From there, possible moves: since I moved down, direction is D, so I cannot move up (U) next turn.\n> \n> Possible cells: from (6,3), I can move L to (5,3), D to (6,2), R to (7,3) but x=7 wall, impossible.\n> \n> (7,3) is x=7, wall, so cannot.\n> \n> So L to (5,3) or D to (6,2).\n> \n> Now, (5,3) is currently occupied by a body segment?

Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake: (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n> \n> (4,5) is the last segment? Positions: index 0: (6,5) head, 1: (6,4), 2: (5,4), 3: (5,3), 4: (5,2), 5: (5,1), 6: (4,1), 7: (3,1), 8: (3,2), 9: (4,2), 10: (4,3), 11: (4,4), 12: (4,5) — that's 13 positions.\n> \n> (4,5) is the tail, I think. When snake moves, the tail moves away.\n> \n> Now, (6,6): is it occupied? From snake positions, no. Walls: border walls are at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (6,6) is corner, but playable? x=6, y=6, which is within 1 to 6, so yes. Internal obstacle at (4,6), but (6,6) is different.\n> \n> (4,6) is internal obstacle, but (6,6) is free, I think.\n> \n> Also, food: (1,3), (6,3), (2,1), (1,5) — none at (6,6).\n> \n> So moving Up to (6,6) should be possible.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Move Left: from (6,5) to (5,5). (5,5) is not in snake positions, and not wall, so possible.\n> \n> Move Right: from (6,5) to (7,5), but x=7 is wall, so cannot move right. x=7 is border wall, so invalid.\n> \n> x=7 is wall, so cannot move to x=7.\n> \n> Similarly, Down: to (6,4), but (6,4) is the second segment of the snake. If I move down, head goes to (6,4), which is currently occupied by the body.\n> \n> But collision rules: body collision is deadly if head touches any body segment, except that moving into the tail might be ok if the tail moves.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if I move to a cell that is the current tail position, and when I move, the tail moves, so it might be safe.\n> \n> Current tail is at (4,5). If I move to a body segment that is not tail, it's collision.\n> \n> Specifically: after the move, if the head is on a cell that has a body segment (and since the body moves, only the segments that don't move away cause collision).\n> \n> Standard snake: when you move, the head goes to new position, and the tail end is removed. So the cell that was tail becomes empty if no food, but here food might be there.\n> \n> Collision: after moving, if the head is on a cell that is occupied by any body segment, it dies. But since the body moves, the only body segment that might be an issue is if the head moves to where a body segment was, but that segment moves away except for the tail.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> At current state, cells occupied by snake: all positions from (6,5) to (4,5).\n> \n> After a move:\n> \n> - If I move to a free cell, no problem.\n> \n> - If I move to a cell that is currently a body segment:\n> \n> - If that segment is not the tail, after moving, that segment will still be there (since the tail moves away), so head collides with body.\n> \n> - If that segment is the tail, after moving, the tail moves away, so that cell becomes empty (unless food, but for collision, it's about the snake positions after the move).\n> \n> After the move, the new head position is set, and the tail is removed, so the cell that was tail is no longer occupied.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to the current tail position is safe, because after the move, that cell is head, and the old tail is gone.\n> \n> Moving to any other body segment is deadly, because that segment will still be part of the body after the move.\n> \n> For example, if I move to (6,4), which is currently the segment after head. After moving, head is at (6,4), but the segment that was at (6,4) will move to... let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: (6,5) head, 1: (6,4), 2: (5,4), 3: (5,3), ..., 12: (4,5) tail.\n> \n> If I move Down to (6,4), new head position (6,4). Then the body: segment 1 was at (6,4), but now head is there, so segment 1 moves to where? After head moves, the body segments follow: the new position 1 is the old head position (6,5), but since head moved to (6,4), the new snake: head at (6,4), then segment 1 at old head (6,5), segment 2 at old segment 1 position (6,4)? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So, after moving Down to (6,4):\n> \n> - New head: (6,4)\n> \n> - Then segment 1 (which was at (6,4)) moves to where? The positions shift: the cell (6,4) is now head, so the body segment that was at (6,4) needs to move, but it becomes segment 1 at the position where the head was, which is (6,5).\n> \n> Let's list new positions:\n> \n> - New position 0 (head): (6,4)  // moved down\n> \n> - New position 1: old position 0, which is (6,5)\n> \n> - New position 2: old position 1, which is (6,4) but that's now head, so it takes old position of previous segment.\n> \n> After head moves to new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the segment before it.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - Head moves to new cell: (6,4)\n> \n> - Segment 1 (which was at (6,4)) moves to the position where segment 0 was, which is (6,5)\n> \n> - Segment 2 (which was at (5,4)) moves to where segment 1 was, which is (6,4), but (6,4) is now occupied by head? No, positions are updated sequentially.\n> \n> In terms of cells: before move, cell (6,4) has segment 1.\n> \n> After head moves to (6,4), now cell (6,4) has head, and segment 1 must move to the position that segment 0 was at, which is (6,5).\n> \n> Similarly, segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, which is (6,4), but (6,4) is now head, so it's conflicting.\n> \n> I think I have a confusion.\n> \n> Better to think: the head moves first to the new position. Then, each body segment from neck to tail moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - New head at (6,4)\n> \n> - The segment that was at index 1 ( (6,4) ) moves to the position of index 0, which is (6,5) (old head position)\n> \n> - The segment that was at index 2 ( (5,4) ) moves to the position of index 1, which was (6,4), but (6,4) is now the new head position? No: the position of index 1 before move was (6,4), but after head moved, the position for index 1 is now (6,5), because it moves to where index 0 was.\n> \n> Let's clarify with indices.\n> \n> Before move:\n> \n> Position index 0: (6,5)  // head\n> \n> Index 1: (6,4)\n> \n> Index 2: (5,4)\n> \n> Index 3: (5,3)\n> \n> ... up to index 12: (4,5)  // tail\n> \n> After moving head Down to (6,4):\n> \n> New position index 0: (6,4)  // new head\n> \n> Now, for index 1: it moves to the position where index 0 was before move, which is (6,5)\n> \n> For index 2: it moves to the position where index 1 was before move, which is (6,4)\n> \n> But (6,4) is now the new head position, so if index 2 moves to (6,4), it would be on the same cell as head, which is collision.\n> \n> Ah, yes, that's the point.\n> \n> If you move the head to a cell that was occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, then after the move, that body segment might still be there or move to a position causing collision.\n> \n> Specifically, when you move to a cell that is occupied by a body segment at index K, then after the move, that segment at index K will move to the position of index K-1, but since head moved to its position, it causes the segment to be at a different position, but the key is that after the move, the head is at the new cell, and the body segments are at their new positions.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (6,4): before move, (6,4) has index 1.\n> \n> After head moves to (6,4), new head at (6,4).\n> \n> Then index 1 moves to where index 0 was, (6,5)\n> \n> Index 2 moves to where index 1 was, (6,4)\n> \n> But (6,4) is now head, so index 2 moving to (6,4) means head and body at same cell, collision.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to any cell that is currently occupied by a body segment except the tail will cause collision because after the move, that body segment moves to the new head position or something.\n> \n> General rule: if you move to a cell that is not the tail, it is occupied by a body segment that will not move away; it will stay or move to cause collision.\n> \n> Only the tail: if you move to the current tail position, after move, the tail moves away, so that cell is only head now.\n> \n> In this case, current tail is at (4,5), which is not (6,4), so moving to (6,4) is deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to any other body segment except tail is deadly.\n> \n> Now, for tail: if I move to (4,5), which is tail, then after move, head at (4,5), and the tail moves away to where the previous segment was, so no collision.\n> \n> But in this position, (4,5) is not adjacent to head; head is at (6,5), (4,5) is far.\n> \n> Back to possible moves from (6,5):\n> \n> - Up: to (6,6) - let's check if occupied.

Let's see.\n> \n> Snake positions: (5,5) head, then (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), etc. So (5,4) is the 4th segment?

Obstacle at (4,6), not (5,6). So should be empty.\n> \n> - Down (D) to (5,4): but (5,4) is occupied by snake body at position index 3. But can I move there? Rule: I can move to tail segment only if tail moves away, meaning that after move, tail is not there, but when I move head to (5,4), the tail is at (4,4), and it will move after head moves.\n> \n> General rule: the snake moves by head moving to new cell, and tail moving off the last cell, unless food is eaten.\n> \n> If I move head to a cell with food, snake grows, so tail doesn't move, length increases.\n> \n> If no food, head moves to new cell, tail moves off last cell.\n> \n> But collision: head cannot touch any body segment except the tail, but when moving to tail position, it might be ok if tail moves.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But in this case, (5,4) is not the tail; tail is (4,4). (5,4) is a body segment, index 3.\n> \n> So moving to (5,4) would cause head to collide with body segment, which is deadly.\n> \n> Therefore, from (5,5), I cannot move down to (5,4) because it's occupied by body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving right to (6,5) is not possible because it's instant reverse from current direction L, and also (6,5) is the second segment, occupied.\n> \n> So only possible moves: Left to (4,5) or Up to (5,6).\n> \n> Down is invalid due to body.\n> \n> Right invalid due to reverse and body.\n> \n> So choices: L to (4,5) or U to (5,6).\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's list the food and their life spans.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,3): value 1, life span 1.

Since it's turn 56, after this turn, it will be gone if not eaten now.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for (1,3), life span 1, meaning after turn 56, it will disappear. So if not eaten on turn 56, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) life span 3, so disappears after turn 58? Countdown decreases including current turn.\n> \n> Turn 56: countdown to 1, if not eaten, after turn 56, it disappears? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for a food with life span N, when spawned, it has N turns left, including the current turn. Each turn, countdown decreases by 1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn.\n> \n> Standard way: if countdown is K at start of turn, after the turn, if K=1, it disappears; if K>1, it remains with K-1 for next turn.\n> \n> But for eating, if head moves to it on a turn, it is eaten.\n> \n> For (1,3): life span 1, so at turn 56, if not eaten on turn 56, it disappears immediately after turn 56.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3): life span 3, so at turn 56, countdown=3; after turn 56, if not eaten, countdown=2; after turn 57, countdown=1; after turn 58, disappears if not eaten.\n> \n> (2,1): life span 6, countdown from 6 down.\n> \n> (1,5): life span 9, countdown 9.\n> \n> All value +1.\n> \n> Now, (1,3) is about to disappear; I can only eat it if I move to (1,3) on this turn, turn 56.\n> \n> But where am I? Head at (5,5), (1,3) is at (1,3), which is far away. From (5,5) to (1,3) is not reachable in one move; it's at least |5-1| + |5-3| = 4 + 2 = 6 moves away, Manhattan distance. So impossible to eat (1,3) on turn 56. Therefore, it will disappear after this turn, and I should ignore it.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) is at (6,3), which is closer. From (5,5) to (6,3): x from 5 to 6 is +1, y from 5 to 3 is -2, so Manhattan distance 3, but I can't move directly; it takes multiple turns.\n> \n> But (6,3) has life span 3, so I have until turn 58 to eat it.\n> \n> (2,1) life span 6, (1,5) life span 9.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves: from (5,5), I can go L to (4,5) or U to (5,6).\n> \n> I need to evaluate these options for multiple turns.\n> \n> First, let's consider the grid state.\n> \n> Available cells: I should find free cells.\n> \n> Snake occupies: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (4,6) obstacle.\n> \n> So free cells: for example, (1,1) to (1,6) except where snake or walls, but y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to 6.\n> \n> List all possible cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except obstacles.\n> \n> x=1: y=1,2,3,4,5,6\n> \n> But snake has (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), etc., so (1,1) is free?

Positions: from head to tail: (4,5) <- head, then (5,5) which was previous head, then (6,5), etc.\n> \n> When moving, the head moves to a new position, and each segment follows, so the tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> Current head at (4,5), direction L, so it just moved left to (4,5).\n> \n> Available moves: since direction is L, I can move L (continue left), or U/D, but not R because that would be instant reverse. Cannot move opposite to current direction.\n> \n> Current direction is L, so cannot move R (right) on next turn.\n> \n> Possible actions for turn 57: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), but not R.\n> \n> Now, from (4,5), moving:\n> \n> - U: to (4,6)\n> \n> - D: to (4,4)\n> \n> - L: to (3,5)\n> \n> - R: not allowed.\n> \n> Now, check if these are valid.\n> \n> First, walls: (4,6) is an internal obstacle? (4,6) is given as internal obstacle? No, internal obstacles are only [(4,6)], so (4,6) is blocked, cannot move there.\n> \n> Walls: border walls and internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> So (4,6) is occupied by wall, so cannot move U to (4,6).\n> \n> Then D to (4,4): is (4,4) free? Let's see snake positions: snake is at (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), etc. (5,4) is occupied, but (4,4) is not in the list? Snake positions: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3)\n> \n> So (4,4) is not occupied by snake, so it should be free, unless wall or food, but walls are only borders and (4,6), so (4,4) is empty.\n> \n> Similarly, L to (3,5): (3,5) not in snake positions, so free.\n> \n> R not allowed.\n> \n> But U to (4,6) is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves: D to (4,4) or L to (3,5).\n> \n> Now, also need to consider food and future moves.\n> \n> Food locations:\n> \n> - (6,3): value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (2,1): value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (1,5): value 1, life span 8\n> \n> (6,3) is occupied by snake? Snake has (6,4), (6,5), but (6,3) is not listed. Snake positions: from (6,5) to (6,4) to (5,4), etc. (6,3) is not in the list, so it should be free, but there's food at (6,3).\n> \n> Food at (6,3), and life span 3.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) has food, and (1,5) has food.\n> \n> Now, (6,3) is near the snake body. Snake has segments at (6,4), (6,5), etc.\n> \n> If I move to (6,3), I can eat the food, but need to see if it's safe.\n> \n> First, for turn 57, I can move D to (4,4) or L to (3,5).\n> \n> I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, there's a special rule: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills, but tail is at (4,3), and head is at (4,5), so not adjacent. Adjacent means next to, like same row or column adjacent cell.\n> \n> (4,5) and (4,3) are two apart, not adjacent. Adjacent would be (4,4) or (3,5) or (5,5), but (5,5) is body.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,3), so cells adjacent to tail: (4,2), (4,4), (3,3), (5,3)? (4,2) is part of snake, (4,4) is empty, (3,3) empty, (5,3) is snake position? (5,3) is in the list, yes, (5,3) is body.\n> \n> Tail at (4,3), so adjacent cells: up (4,4), down (4,2) but (4,2) is snake, left (3,3), right (5,3) snake. So only (4,4) and (3,3) are free, but head is at (4,5), not adjacent to tail.\n> \n> So no issue with tail reward danger now.\n> \n> Now, back to moves.\n> \n> Option 1: Move D to (4,4) on turn 57.\n> \n> Then head moves to (4,4). Since it's not food, no growth, so tail moves away, snake becomes: head (4,4), then (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), and tail was (4,3) but since no food, tail moves, so (4,3) is no longer part of snake, but (4,3) had no food? Food is at (6,3), (2,1), (1,5), not at (4,3), so (4,3) is empty after tail moves.\n> \n> After move to (4,4), no food eaten, so snake: new head (4,4), followed by previous head (4,5), then (5,5), ..., up to (4,2) which was before tail? Positions: after move, head at (4,4), then the segments: first body is previous head (4,5), then (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2). And the tail (4,3) is gone because no growth, so snake has 12 segments now? Original had 13 positions, after move without eating, length same, so new positions: head at new position, and all body segments shift, so the last one is removed.\n> \n> Original snake: 13 segments. After move to empty cell, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the next, so the tail position is vacated. So new snake: positions from new head to the second last of previous, but shifted.\n> \n> Specifically: previous positions: index 0: (4,5) head, 1: (5,5), 2: (6,5), 3: (6,4), 4: (5,4), 5: (5,3), 6: (5,2), 7: (5,1), 8: (4,1), 9: (3,1), 10: (3,2), 11: (4,2), 12: (4,3) tail.\n> \n> After move to (4,4), new head at (4,4), then body: the previous head becomes first body, so (4,5), then (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2). The tail (4,3) is gone, and (4,2) is now the last segment. So 12 segments.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move L to (3,5), new head (3,5), body: (4,5), (5,5), ..., up to (4,2), and (4,3) gone.\n> \n> Now, after moving to (4,4) on turn 57, what can I do next?\n> \n> Head at (4,4), direction was D (since I moved down), so for next turn, possible moves: U, D, L, R, but not opposite. Opposite of D is U, so cannot move U immediately? Current direction after move is D, so for turn 58, cannot move U (up), because that would reverse.\n> \n> Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n> \n> So after moving to a direction, that becomes the current direction for the next move.\n> \n> So if on turn 57 I move D to (4,4), then current direction is D, so on turn 58, I cannot move U.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move L to (3,5), direction becomes L, so cannot move R on next turn.\n> \n> Back to option: move D to (4,4) on turn 57.\n> \n> Then turn 58, head at (4,4), direction D.\n> \n> Possible moves: D to (4,3), but (4,3) is now empty? After the move, (4,3) is free, but let's see.\n> \n> After move to (4,4), snake positions: head (4,4), then (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2)\n> \n> So (4,3) is free, but no food there.\n> \n> Now moves from (4,4): D to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4), but R to (5,4): (5,4) is occupied by snake?

Walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is not wall, x=0 and x=7 walls. Internal obstacle (4,6), but (3,6) is not obstacle. So (3,6) should be free, but is it within bounds? x=3, y=6, x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, so y=6 is playable?

So possible moves from (3,5): U, D, or L.\n> \n> Now, let's see what cells are available:\n> \n> - U: (3,6) - y=6, is that within bounds? y from 1 to 6, so y=6 is the top row. But there's an internal obstacle at (4,6), but (3,6) is not (4,6), so should be ok? Walls: border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so y=6 is not y=7, so y=6 is playable. y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are ok. Similarly x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> (3,6) is at x=3, y=6, which is within 1-6, and no obstacle mentioned except (4,6), so (3,6) should be free, but we need to check if snake body is there.\n> \n> Snake positions: list all occupied: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2)\n> \n> (3,6) is not in this list, so free.\n> \n> But is (3,6) a wall?

It's turn 59. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,4), then body segments: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2). So the tail is at (3,2). Snake head direction is down, meaning it's moving downward, so from (3,4) to (3,3) would be down, but let's confirm coordinates. Typically, y=0 is bottom or top? In the movement, U is (x,y+1), which might imply y increases upward, but let's see the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (3,4), then (3,5) which is above it since y=5 > y=4, so U increases y, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? But in the list, head is (3,4), next is (3,5) which is one step up, but direction is down? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> Head direction is D, down, but from (3,4) to where? If it's moving down, it should go to (3,3), but the next position in the list is (3,5), which is up. Perhaps the positions are listed with head first, so the snake was at (3,5) before moving to (3,4)? No.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), ...] so head is at (3,4), and the segment behind it is (3,5), which means the snake moved from (3,5) to (3,4), so it moved down to (3,4). Direction D means it was moving down to get to (3,4). So current head is at (3,4), and it was moving down to get there, so from (3,5) to (3,4).\n> \n> Now, for the next move, since head direction is D, I can move U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse, so I cannot move up immediately because that would be opposite to down. Current direction is D, so opposite is U, so I cannot move U on this turn. Possible moves are D, L, R.\n> \n> Movement constraints: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So for turn t1=59, current direction is D, so I cannot choose U for this turn. I can choose D, L, or R.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (6,3) with value 1, life span 1, so it disappears after this turn if not eaten? Life span is given, and countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t1=59, life span 1 means it will disappear after this turn, so if not eaten now, it's gone.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food with life span L at turn t, it will disappear at turn t + L if not eaten. Let's read: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (6,3), life span 1 at turn 59: countdown decreases this turn, so after this turn, it disappears. So if not eaten on turn 59, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) life span 3, so it will disappear after 3 turns, meaning it has until turn 61? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, after this turn, countdown becomes N-1. If countdown reaches 0, it disappears. So at turn t, with life span N, after turn t, if not eaten, countdown is N-1. It disappears when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> For (6,3): life span 1 at turn 59. After turn 59, if not eaten, countdown becomes 0, so it disappears. So must be eaten on turn 59 to get it.\n> \n> For (2,1): life span 3 at turn 59. After turn 59, countdown 2; after turn 60, countdown 1; after turn 61, countdown 0, disappears.

(3,3) is not in the body positions. Body positions: (3,5), (4,5), etc., no (3,3). Also not wall, since y=3 >0, x=3 between 0-7. So (3,3) is empty and safe.\n> \n> - L to (2,4): x=2,y=4. Not in body positions? Body: (3,5),(4,5),... (2,4) not listed, so empty. Not wall. Safe.\n> \n> - R to (4,4): (4,4) not in body positions? Body has (4,5), (5,5), etc., no (4,4). Also not wall.

To reach (6,3) in one move? (3,4) to (6,3) is not adjacent; adjacent cells are (3,3), (2,4), (4,4), (3,5) but (3,5) is body, cannot move there.\n> \n> (6,3) is three steps away: for example, right to (4,4), then right to (5,4), but (5,4) is body? Snake positions: (5,4) is the 7th segment? Positions: index 0 head (3,4), 1: (3,5), 2: (4,5), 3: (5,5), 4: (6,5), 5: (6,4), 6: (5,4), 7: (5,3), etc.\n> \n> So (5,4) is occupied by body, cannot move there.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4) is occupied.\n> \n> To reach (6,3), it's at (6,3), which is below (6,4).\n> \n> From (3,4), I need to go right and down.\n> \n> But (6,3) must be eaten this turn, turn 59, or it disappears. Since it's not adjacent, I cannot reach it in one move. From (3,4) to (6,3) is not adjacent; Manhattan distance |3-6| + |4-3| = 3+1=4, so multiple moves away. I can only move one step per turn, so impossible to reach (6,3) on turn 59. Therefore, (6,3) will disappear after this turn and cannot be eaten. So ignore it.\n> \n> Next food: (2,1) at (2,1), value 1, life span 3, so can be eaten on turns 59,60,61.\n> \n> (1,5) at (1,5), life span 6, turns 59-64.\n> \n> (4,3) at (4,3), life span 9, turns 59-67.\n> \n> Now, (4,3) is close to head. Head at (3,4), (4,3) is down-right? From (3,4), moving R to (4,4) or D to (3,3), but (4,3) is at (4,3), which is adjacent to (4,4) and (3,3), but not directly to (3,4).\n> \n> (3,4) to (4,3) is not adjacent; it's diagonal, so not directly reachable. Adjacent cells: (3,3), (2,4), (4,4), and (3,5) but (3,5) is occupied.\n> \n> So to reach (4,3), I need at least two moves: for example, D to (3,3), then R to (4,3)? (3,3) to (4,3) is right, adjacent.\n> \n> Or R to (4,4), then D to (4,3)? (4,4) to (4,3) is down, adjacent.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) is at (2,1), which is left and down.\n> \n> (1,5) is at (1,5), left and up.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills snake because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Current tail is at (3,2). Head is at (3,4), so not adjacent; adjacent would be same x or y diff 1. (3,4) and (3,2) have |dy|=2, not adjacent. So no immediate danger.\n> \n> Now, let's think about moving.\n> \n> Possible actions for turn 59: D, L, R.\n> \n> If I move D to (3,3), then head at (3,3).\n> \n> Then from there, I can move to adjacent cells: U to (3,4) but (3,4) will be body? After move to (3,3), the body segments: the tail moves or not? Depends on if I eat food.\n> \n> (3,3) is empty, no food? Food at (4,3), (2,1), etc., not at (3,3). So moving to (3,3), no food, so head moves to (3,3), tail moves from (3,2) to? Tail is at (3,2), and since no growth, tail moves forward. The snake positions: after moving head to (3,3), the body follows: the segment behind head was (3,5), but when head moves to new cell, the body shifts.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> So from current positions: head to (3,3), then body: segment 1 moves to head old (3,4), segment 2 moves to segment 1 old (3,5), and so on, tail (3,2) moves to previous tail-1 position?

It's turn 60. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (4,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are on the borders, meaning I can't go to those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,4), and the body segments are: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). That's 13 segments. Let me list them in order: head (4,4), then (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). So the tail is at (3,1).\n> \n> Head direction is R, which is right. So currently moving east.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1 and life span 3. Since current turn is 60, it disappears after 3 turns, so it will be gone after turn 63. Life span decreases each turn, including current, so at turn 60, life span is 3, meaning it has 3 turns left including this one. After turn 60, it has 2 left; after 61, 1 left; after 62, 0 left, so it disappears before turn 63 or on turn 63? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food with life span N, it appears for N turns starting from when it was spawned. At the turn it's spawned, life span is N, and it decreases each turn. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or after? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", so I think after N turns from spawn, it's gone. But since we don't know when it spawned, we have the current life span.\n> \n> For food at (2,1): life span 3 at turn 60. So:\n> \n> - Turn 60: life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 61: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 62: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 63: life span 0, disappears before turn 63? Or after? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and countdown decreases every turn including current. I think \"after N turns\" means it is present for N turns, so after the Nth turn, it disappears. For example, if spawned at turn T, it is present at turns T, T+1, ..., T+(N-1), and disappears before turn T+N. Similarly here, with current turn 60 and life span 3, it was spawned at some turn, but we don't care; at turn 60, it has 3 turns left including turn 60, so it will be present for turns 60, 61, 62, and disappear before turn 63.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (1,5): value 1, life span 5, so present for turns 60,61,62,63,64, disappear before turn 65.\n> \n> Food at (4,3): value 1, life span 8, present for turns 60 to 67.\n> \n> All food have value 1, positive, so no negative food here. Good.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for at least 5 turns ahead: turns 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, and possibly more since I have to think 5+ turns.\n> \n> But the action sequence should be for consecutive turns starting from t1=60.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid. Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

at turn 60 is down to eat the positive food at (4,3), avoiding immediate collision. Subsequent moves prioritize navigating left and up toward the food at (1,5) for potential consumption, but due to distance and the food's lifespan (must be eaten by turn 64), it cannot be reached in time, so the sequence focuses on survival by moving into open space while avoiding body collisions.\n",

It's turn 61. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (4,6). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are on the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, (4,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,3), and it's moving down (direction D). The body segments are: (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). So the snake is quite long, 14 segments.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1 and life span 2. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, at turn 61, life span 2 means it will disappear after turn 62? Life span decreases each turn, so if it has life span N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, meaning it's gone at turn t + N. But the countdown decreases every turn, including current, so at turn t, it has N turns left, including this one. So for food at (2,1): position (2,1), value 1, life span 2 at turn 61. That means it will be gone after turn 62? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn 61, life span is 2, so after 2 turns, it disappears. So it will be available on turn 61 and 62, and disappear at the start of turn 63? I think it's better to think that at the beginning of each turn, the life span decreases, and when it reaches 0, it disappears before the turn starts or something. But the problem says \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so for turn 61, we have the state, and during turn 61, if we move to it, we can eat it, but after the turn, life span decreases.\n> \n> I think it's safer to assume that at the start of turn t, for each food, life span is reduced by 1, and if it becomes 0, it disappears before any action. But the rule says \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", and it's given at turn 61.\n> \n> Perhaps the life span is the number of turns it will remain, including the current turn. So for (2,1) with life span 2 at turn 61, it can be eaten on turn 61 or 62, and disappears after turn 62.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5) has life span 4, so available for turns 61,62,63,64.\n> \n> (4,5) has life span 10, so available for a long time.\n> \n> Now, (4,5) is listed as a food position, but let's see the snake positions: (4,5) is part of the snake body! Snake positions include (4,5) as the fourth segment? Let's list snake positions in order:\n> \n> Head: (4,3) at index 0\n> \n> Then: (4,4) index 1\n> \n> (3,4) index 2\n> \n> (3,5) index 3\n> \n> (4,5) index 4\n> \n> (5,5) index 5\n> \n> (6,5) index 6\n> \n> (6,4) index 7\n> \n> (5,4) index 8\n> \n> (5,3) index 9\n> \n> (5,2) index 10\n> \n> (5,1) index 11\n> \n> (4,1) index 12\n> \n> (3,1) index 13\n> \n> So (4,5) is occupied by the snake's body segment at index 4.\n> \n> But there's a food at (4,5) with value 1 and life span 10.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for (4,5), since it's under the body, we can only eat it if the snake moves such that the body is no longer there, and then the head moves to it.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 61, the head is at (4,3), moving down.\n> \n> Possible moves: since head direction is D (down), I can move D, L, or R, but not U because that would be instant reverse? Current direction is D, so opposite is U. So I cannot move U next. So possible actions: D (continue down), L (left), R (right).\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid around head.\n> \n> Head at (4,3). Moving down would go to (4,2). Is (4,2) occupied? Snake positions: (4,3) head, (4,4) is body, but (4,2) is not in the list. Also, walls: y=0 is bottom, so (4,2) should be within bounds? Grid from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, so (4,2) is valid, not a wall. But is it free? Snake positions don't have (4,2), so it might be free, but there might be food or something.\n> \n> Foods are at (2,1), (1,5), and (4,5). (4,5) is occupied by body.\n> \n> (4,2) has no food listed, so it should be empty.\n> \n> But let's confirm if (4,2) is safe to move to.\n> \n> First, collision: if I move down to (4,2), is it occupied by body? Current snake positions: from above, (4,3) is head, moving to (4,2). After move, the head moves to (4,2), and the tail will move, so the body segments shift.\n> \n> When snake moves, the head goes to new position, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the one in front, and the tail segment is removed if no food eaten, or a new segment added if food eaten.\n> \n> But for collision, during the move, if the head moves to a cell occupied by body, it dies, except if it's the tail cell, because the tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically, \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, before moving, we need to check if the target cell is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail.\n> \n> Current snake positions: cells occupied: (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)\n> \n> Tail is at (3,1).\n> \n> If I move down to (4,2), is (4,2) occupied? Looking at the list, (4,2) is not in the positions, so it should be free. (5,2) is occupied, but not (4,2). So (4,2) is empty, no body, no wall, so safe to move to.\n> \n> Similarly, move left to (3,3)? (3,3) is not in positions, should be free.\n> \n> Move right to (5,3)? (5,3) is occupied by the body segment at index 9: (5,3). So if I move right to (5,3), that's a body segment, not the tail (tail is (3,1)), so it would be a collision, death.\n> \n> Therefore, moving right to (5,3) is not possible, collision.\n> \n> So from (4,3), possible moves: D to (4,2), or L to (3,3), or R to (5,3) but (5,3) is occupied, so not possible. Only D or L.\n> \n> Current direction D, so moving R to (5,3) is right, which is perpendicular, not opposite, so allowed, but the cell is occupied, so not possible.\n> \n> Similarly, moving L to (3,3) is left, perpendicular.\n> \n> Moving D to (4,2) down.\n> \n> Now, also, walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,2) is within bounds, y=2>0, x=4 between 0 and 7. (3,3) also fine. (5,3) is occupied.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (4,6), but that's not relevant here.\n> \n> So at turn 61, possible actions: D or L.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival and maximizing score.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (2,1): value +1, life span 2, so must be eaten by turn 62 or it disappears. At turn 61, life span 2, after turn 61 it decreases to 1, then after turn 62 to 0 and disappears. So can be eaten on turn 61 or 62.\n> \n> - (1,5): value +1, life span 4, so available turns 61-64.\n> \n> - (4,5): value +1, life span 10, but currently under body at index 4. To eat it, we need the body to move away and head to move there.\n> \n> Also, there might be negative food, but in this state, all foods listed have value 1, so all positive? The food positions: (2,1,2,1) – I think it's (x,y, life_span, value), so value is 1, positive.\n> \n> Similarly, all have value 1, so all positive food.\n> \n> No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But tail is at (3,1), and no food there, so not immediate issue.\n> \n> Now, let's plan the sequence.\n> \n> First, I need to eat the food at (2,1) soon because it disappears after turn 62.\n> \n> (2,1) is at bottom left, tail is at (3,1), which is adjacent? (3,1) and (2,1) are adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> Head is at (4,3).\n> \n> To reach (2,1), possible paths.\n> \n> Also, (1,5) is top left, and (4,5) is center, but under body.\n> \n> Since (2,1) is urgent, I should go for it.\n> \n> But head is at (4,3), moving down to (4,2) is one step closer to (2,1)?

Usually in grids, y=0 bottom, y=7 top, I think.\n> \n> In the state, snake positions: head (4,3), then (4,4) which is up, since y increased, so y=0 bottom, y=7 top? Head at (4,3), direction D down, so moving down decreases y.\n> \n> So y=0 is bottom, y=7 top.\n> \n> So (2,1) is at x=2,y=1, which is bottom left area.\n> \n> Tail at (3,1), so adjacent to (2,1).\n> \n> Head at (4,3).\n> \n> If I move down to (4,2), then I'm at (4,2).\n> \n> Then from (4,2), I can move left to (3,2), or down to (4,1), but (4,1) is occupied by body at index 12?

(1,5) are unreachable within their remaining life spans (2 and 4 turns, respectively), so the strategy prioritizes avoiding immediate risks and positioning to eat the long-life food at (4,5) (life span 10) in future turns, starting by moving left to open space and then upward for flexibility.\n",

It's turn 62, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,3), and the body segments follow: (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1). The head direction is left (L), so it's moving towards decreasing x.\n> \n> Food items:\n> - (2,1) with value 1 and life span 1\n> - (1,5) with value 1 and life span 3\n> - (4,5) with value 1 and life span 9\n> \n> All food has value +1, so no negative food here. But I need to be careful with (4,5) because it's currently under the snake's body. Specifically, (4,5) is part of the snake; it's the 6th segment in the list: positions are [(3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), ...]. So (4,5) is occupied by the snake body, and food is at (4,5) with life span 9. According to the rules, food under the body can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it. So for (4,5), since it's under the body, I can't eat it immediately; I need to move the body away first.\n> \n> Life span: For (2,1), life span 1, which means it disappears after this turn or next? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 62, life span is 1, meaning it will disappear after turn 62? Let me clarify the life span mechanic.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, for a food with life_span L at turn t, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? I need to be precise.\n> \n> Typically, if life_span is N at turn t, it means it will last for N more turns, including turn t. So after N turns, it's gone.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life_span N: it exists on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N.\n> \n> But the rule says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Let's read: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, when food is spawned, it has a life_span N. Each turn, the life_span decreases by 1. When life_span reaches 0, it disappears after that turn? Or at the end of the turn?\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at the start of turn t, if life_span is S, after the turn, it becomes S-1. When S=1, after this turn, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n> \n> For food at (2,1), life_span=1 at turn 62. So at the start of turn 62, life_span=1. After turn 62, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So if the snake doesn't eat it on turn 62, it's gone forever.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5) has life_span=3, so it will disappear after turn 64 (since turn 62: life_span=3, turn 63:2, turn 64:1, after turn 64:0 and gone).\n> \n> (4,5) has life_span=9, so it will last until after turn 70 or so.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (3,3), direction L, so last move was left, to (3,3). From (4,3) to (3,3), I assume.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (3,3), then (4,3), which is the neck, so it came from right to left to (3,3).\n> \n> Current direction is L, so it can move U, D, L, but not R, because R is opposite to L, and no instant reverse is allowed. So possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1).\n> \n> But I need to check for collisions and walls.\n> \n> First, let's list all wall cells: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> So grid is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think, since walls are at 0 and 7, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 are playable? Let's see: for example, snake has positions like (5,1), which is y=1, but y=0 is wall, so y=1 is playable. Similarly, (4,1) is at y=1.\n> \n> y=0 is wall, so y=1 to y=6 are playable? But y=7 is wall, so y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Similarly x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> But there's an internal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Also, walls include border cells, so cells like (0,0), (0,1), etc., are all walls, but since the snake is never there, we don't care. Only the playable area matters.\n> \n> Playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (4,6) is obstacle.\n> \n> y=1 to 6, but y=6: for example, (4,6) is obstacle, but (3,6) might be free? (3,5) is a position, y=5.\n> \n> Let's list all cells to avoid: walls are all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, and also (4,6).\n> \n> So for movement, snake cannot move to these cells.\n> \n> Now, snake body: positions are [(3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)]\n> \n> Head at (3,3), tail at (4,1).\n> \n> Length is 14 segments.\n> \n> Food: (2,1), (1,5), (4,5)\n> \n> (4,5) is occupied by snake body, as it's the 6th segment.\n> \n> For (2,1), it's at (2,1), which is not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (5,1), (4,1) are at y=1, but (2,1) is free? Let's see: snake has (5,1) and (4,1), so (2,1) should be free unless there's a wall, but walls are borders, so (2,1) is playable and has food.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5) is at x=1,y=5, which should be playable, since x=1 is not wall, only x=0 is wall.\n> \n> x=0 is wall, x=1 is playable.\n> \n> y=0 wall, y=1 playable, etc.\n> \n> So (1,5) is free.\n> \n> (4,5) has food but is under snake body, so cannot eat now.\n> \n> Now, current turn 62, head at (3,3), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: U (up to (3,4)? (3,4) is occupied by snake body. Positions: head (3,3), next is (4,3), then (4,4), then (3,4), so (3,4) is the 4th segment.\n> \n> Let's index: position 0: head (3,3), pos1: (4,3), pos2: (4,4), pos3: (3,4), pos4: (3,5), pos5: (4,5), etc.\n> \n> So (3,4) is occupied, so moving up to (3,4) would collide with body.\n> \n> Similarly, down to (3,2): is (3,2) free? Snake positions: y=2, (5,2) is there, but (3,2) not in list. Walls: y=2, x=3, should be free unless obstacle, but no, obstacle is (4,6).\n> \n> So (3,2) is free.\n> \n> Left to (2,3): (2,3) not in snake positions, not wall, so free.\n> \n> Right to (4,3): but (4,3) is the neck, directly behind head, but since tail will move, it might be ok, but let's see collision rules.\n> \n> Collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, because when moving, if head moves to where tail is, and tail moves away, it's ok, but if it touches other body, it dies.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, when moving, if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by the tail at that moment, and after the move, tail moves, so no collision, but if it moves to any other body segment, collision.\n> \n> In this case, for possible moves from (3,3):\n> \n> - U to (3,4): (3,4) is position 3, body segment, not tail (tail is (4,1)), so collision, invalid.\n> \n> - D to (3,2): (3,2) not occupied, not wall, so possible.\n> \n> - L to (2,3): (2,3) not occupied, not wall, possible.\n> \n> - R to (4,3): (4,3) is position 1, body segment, not tail, so collision? But (4,3) is directly adjacent and will it move away?\n> \n> When snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front.\n> \n> So if head moves right to (4,3), which is currently occupied by the neck segment. After the move, the neck segment will move to where? The head was at (3,3), moving to (4,3). Then the segment that was at (4,3) will move to the next position, but since it's a chain, the segment at (4,3) will move to where the head was, (3,3)? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the tail end is removed if no food eaten, or if food eaten, tail stays and new segment added.\n> \n> But for collision check, at the moment of move, if the head moves to a cell occupied by any body segment except the current tail, it collides.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (4,3): (4,3) is occupied by pos1, which is not the tail, so it should be a collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (3,4) is occupied by pos3, collision.\n> \n> Moving to (2,3) or (3,2) are free.\n> \n> Also, direction: current direction L, so cannot move R (opposite), but R is to (4,3), which is invalid anyway.\n> \n> So possible moves: D to (3,2) or L to (2,3).\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead to maximize score and survive.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (2,1) at turn 62, life_span=1, so must eat it this turn or it's gone.\n> \n> - (1,5) life_span=3, so can eat in turns 62,63,64.\n> \n> - (4,5) under body, life_span=9, so can eat later after moving body away.\n> \n> To eat (2,1), which is at (2,1), head at (3,3).\n> \n> From (3,3), to reach (2,1) in one move? Not adjacent; (2,1) is two steps away.\n> \n> (3,3) to (2,3) is adjacent left, then from (2,3) to (2,2) down, then to (2,1) down, but that's multiple turns.\n> \n> But (2,1) must be eaten this turn, turn 62.\n> \n> Head at (3,3), (2,1) is not adjacent; adjacent cells are (3,4) up, (3,2) down, (2,3) left, (4,3) right.\n> \n> (2,1) is at (2,1), which is not adjacent to (3,3); distance is |dx=1, dy=2|, so not directly reachable.\n> \n> Therefore, it's impossible to eat (2,1) on this turn because it's not adjacent to the head. To eat food, head must move to the food cell.\n> \n> Since (2,1) is not adjacent to (3,3), and we can only move one cell per turn, we cannot reach it this turn.

Life span 3 means it disappears after 3 turns, including the current turn.

Similarly, it has 8 turns left starting from turn 63.\n> \n> The food at (4,5) is listed, but looking at snake positions, (4,5) is part of the snake body. Specifically, the snake has a segment at (4,5), which is the 7th position in the list: indices: 0 head (2,3), 1 (3,3), 2 (4,3), 3 (4,4), 4 (3,4), 5 (3,5), 6 (4,5), etc. So position 6 is (4,5), which is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> But the food is at (4,5) with value 1 and life span 8. However, since the snake body is on that cell, the food can't be eaten immediately because the head isn't there.

Safe.\n   - **L (Left)**: (1, 4) - Not occupied by body or wall. Safe.\n   - **R (Right)**: (3, 4) - Occupied by body segment (index 5). Deadly.\n   - **D (Down)**: (2, 3) - Occupied by body segment (index 1) and opposite direction. Invalid.\n\n### Immediate Action Decision\n\nGiven the possible safe moves are U or L, we need to decide which one is better for maximizing score and avoiding risks.\n\n1. **Option 1: Move U to (2, 5)**:\n   - Next turn (Turn 65), from (2, 5), direction U, possible moves:\n     - **L (Left)**: (1, 5) - Food present, can eat.\n     - **U (Up)**: (2, 6) - Safe.\n     - **R (Right)**: (3, 5) - Occupied by body. Deadly.\n     - **D (Down)**: (2, 4) - Opposite direction. Invalid.\n   - If we move L to (1, 5) on Turn 65, we eat the food there before it expires.\n\n2. **Option 2: Move L to (1, 4)**:\n   - Next turn (Turn 65), from (1, 4), direction L, possible moves:\n     - **U (Up)**: (1, 5) - Food present, can eat.\n     - **L (Left)**: (0, 4) - Wall. Invalid.\n     - **D (Down)**: (1, 3) - Safe.\n     - **R (Right)**: (2, 4) - Opposite direction. Invalid.\n   - If we move U to (1, 5) on Turn 65, we eat the food there before it expires.\n\nBoth options allow us to eat the food at (1, 5) on Turn 65. However, moving U first (Option 1) seems slightly better because it keeps the snake more centered and provides more flexibility for future moves after eating the food.\n\n### Potential Risks and Rewards\n\n- **Eating (1, 5)**:\n  - Increases score by +1.\n  - Increases snake length by 1.\n  - No tail reward danger since the tail is at (5, 2), far from (1, 5).\n\n- **Future Moves After Eating (1, 5)**:\n  - From (1, 5), we can navigate down to (1, 4), then further down to (1, 3), etc., to avoid getting trapped in the top-left corner.\n  - This path also allows us to eventually reach the food at (3, 2).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move **Up (U)** to (2, 5) on Turn 64, followed by moving **Left (L)** to (1, 5) on Turn 65 to eat the expiring food. This sequence ensures we maximize the score while maintaining safe movement options for future turns.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",

No.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when you move to a food cell, head moves there, and since you eat, the tail does not retract, so the snake grows by one; the new position list has the new head position, and the previous positions all stay, with the tail segment not removed.\n> \n> So if you move to a cell that was the tail, and it had food, you move head there, eat food, so tail does not move, so the previous tail segment is now the second last, and you add a new segment at the end, but the end is where the tail was, but since head moved to tail, it's occupied.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think: positions before move: head, body, tail at position P.\n> \n> If you move head to a new position Q.\n> \n> If Q has food, then new positions: Q (new head), then previous head, body, and previous tail remains, so the snake grows, new tail is the previous tail position.\n> \n> If Q is the previous tail position, and it has food, then you move head to P (tail), which had food, so you eat, so new head at P, then previous head, body, and tail remains at P, but now P has both head and tail? No.\n> \n> Before move: positions [A, B, C, ..., Y, Z] where A head, Z tail.\n> \n> Move head to new position N.\n> \n> If N is not food, new positions [N, A, B, C, ..., Y] and Z is removed.\n> \n> If N has food, new positions [N, A, B, C, ..., Y, Z] so Z remains, snake grows.\n> \n> Now, if N is Z, that is, moving to tail position.\n> \n> But in snake, you can move to tail position only if it's adjacent, and since tail will move, it's safe normally, because after move, tail is removed, so no collision.\n> \n> But if there is food on tail, and you move to it, you eat the food, so tail is not removed, so the position N=Z has head now, and the tail Z is still there, so you have two segments at Z: head and tail, which is collision, death.\n> \n> Yes, that's the tail reward danger.\n> \n> So if you eat food that is on the tail cell, and head was adjacent, after eating, head and tail are on the same cell, collision.\n> \n> Therefore, I must avoid eating food that is on the tail if head is adjacent.\n> \n> In this case, for (1,5), it is not the tail, tail is at (5,2) or after moves, so no issue.\n> \n> Back to planning.\n> \n> I need to plan 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, I should eat the (1,5) food since it expires soon.\n> \n> Then, for (4,5) food, I need to free it up.\n> \n> Also, the snake is quite long, 14 segments, so the board might be crowded.\n> \n> Let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid from (1,1) to (6,6), but walls at borders, so accessible (1,1) to (6,6) except (4,6) is obstacle.\n> \n> (4,6) is wall, so not accessible.\n> \n> Current snake positions:\n> \n> Let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Head: (2,4)\n> \n> Body: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)\n> \n> Tail: (5,2)\n> \n> Food: (1,5), (4,5), (3,2)\n> \n> (4,5) is both food and body, but food is under it.\n> \n> Free cells: for example, (1,4), (1,5) is food but not occupied?

Adjacent means sharing a side, so (2,5) and (5,3) are not adjacent; different x and y.\n> \n> Adjacent cells: for (2,5), adjacent are (2,6), (2,4), (1,5), (3,5). (2,4) is the second segment, which is body, but not tail. Tail is (5,3).\n> \n> (1,5) has food, but tail is (5,3), far away.

Snake positions have (4,5) as position 8.\n> \n> Special rule: food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Currently, (4,5) has food, but it's under the snake body, so I can't eat it now because the head isn't on it, and the body is there. To eat it, I need to move the body away first, then have head move there when it's free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) is food, not occupied, I think. (3,2) is not in snake positions, so free cell.\n> \n> Now, life spans: (1,5) life span 1, so must be eaten this turn or gone.\n> \n> (4,5) life span 6, so 6 turns including this one?

Moving to (1,5) seems safe immediately.\n> \n> Then, after moving, snake grows, so positions will be head at (1,5), then the previous head (2,5) becomes new body segment, and tail remains, but since we eat, tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> After eating, the new segment is added at the end, but when moving, the head moves to new position, if food, tail doesn't move, else tail moves forward.\n> \n> Standard Snake: when head moves to a cell with food, it eats, grows, so tail stays; else, tail moves to the next segment.\n> \n> Here, if I move to (1,5) which has food, I eat it, so snake length increases by one, and the new head is at (1,5), and the previous head (2,5) becomes part of body, and tail (5,3) remains, but since we grow, tail doesn't move, so positions: new head (1,5), then (2,5), (2,4), ..., (5,3), and new tail is (5,3) still? No.\n> \n> When snake eats, it grows, so the tail doesn't move, meaning the last segment stays, and a new segment is added at the head. So the positions list grows by one element.\n> \n> Current positions: 14 segments. After eating, 15 segments: head at new position, then all previous positions including the old head.\n> \n> So after moving to (1,5) and eating, positions: head (1,5), then (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3). Tail is (5,3).\n> \n> Now, head at (1,5), direction was U, but after move, direction changes based on action. I moved L, so new head direction is L.\n> \n> Now, from there, I need to plan ahead.\n> \n> But let's see the other option: moving U to (2,6).\n> \n> If I move U to (2,6), no food there, so no eat, tail moves. Tail is (5,3), so it moves to (5,4)? When no eat, tail moves forward to the next segment.\n> \n> Current positions: head (2,5), body segments. When head moves to (2,6), no food, so tail moves: the tail segment (5,3) is removed, and all segments shift: new head at (2,6), then (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4). Last position is (5,4), which was previously (5,4) in index 12, but after tail move, it's gone, and (5,4) becomes the tail?

So 14 segments, tail at (5,4).\n> \n> Head at (2,6), direction U.\n> \n> Now, (1,5) food disappears after this turn since life span 1, not eaten.\n> \n> But if I don't eat it, it's gone forever.\n> \n> Now, back to decision: I have two choices: L to (1,5) or U to (2,6).\n> \n> If I go L, I eat the food, grow to 15, head at (1,5), direction L.\n> \n> If I go U, no eat, head at (2,6), direction U, and (1,5) food gone.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about future food and risks.\n> \n> There's food at (4,5) with life span 6, but it's under the snake body at position (4,5), which is segment 8 or 9? Positions: (4,5) is index 8 in original, but after move, it might change.\n> \n> In the U move case, after moving U, positions include (4,5) as index 9 or something, but the food is there, under body, so to eat it, I need to move the body away.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,2) with life span 9, free cell.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (4,6), which is wall, so cannot go there.\n> \n> Now, let's consider the grid state.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but walls at borders and (4,6).\n> \n> So cells: (0,0) to (7,7), but x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6?

Let's define.\n> \n> Assume: at turn t, life_span S means it has S turns left including current. So after S turns, it's gone. E.g., S=1: eaten only on turn t. S=2: eaten on turn t or t+1, gone by t+2.\n> \n> So for (4,5): S=5 at turn 66, can be eaten on turns 66,67,68,69,70.\n> \n> For (3,2): S=8, can be eaten on turns 66 to 73.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (1,5), direction L.

Snake positions: from above, (1,5) to (5,3), no (3,2), so yes, free.\n> \n> Now, for turn 66, I need to choose an action: U, D, or L.\n> \n> First, let's see what happens if I move left: from (1,5) to (0,5). But x=0 is a wall, so moving to (0,5) would be wall collision, death. So cannot move left.\n> \n> Similarly, move down: from (1,5) to (1,4). Is (1,4) occupied? Snake positions: (2,4) is there, but (1,4) is not in the list.

But let's confirm.\n> \n> y=4, x=1: not in list, so yes, free. But is it a wall? Walls are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, and (4,6). (1,4) is not a wall, so moving down to (1,4) should be safe for now.\n> \n> Move up: from (1,5) to (1,6). (1,6) not occupied, and y=6, not y=7 or 0, x=1 not border, and not (4,6), so free.\n> \n> Move left: to (0,5), wall, invalid.\n> \n> Cannot move right because of no instant reverse.\n> \n> So possible moves: U to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, there's food at (4,5) under the snake body, which can be eaten if the body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,2).\n> \n> But (4,5) has life span 5, so only until turn 70.\n> \n> First, let's consider the immediate move.\n> \n> If I move up to (1,6): then head moves to (1,6), and the tail will move, so the segment at (5,3) will be removed, and a new segment added at head, but since no food eaten, length same, so tail moves away.\n> \n> Similarly for down to (1,4).\n> \n> Now, the food at (4,5) is under segment 10. To eat it, the body must move away from (4,5), then head moves there.\n> \n> Currently, (4,5) is occupied, so we need to vacate it first.\n> \n> The snake is moving, so positions change each turn.\n> \n> I should simulate the snake's movement.\n> \n> Current positions:\n> \n> Let's index the segments for clarity:\n> \n> S0: (1,5) head\n> \n> S1: (2,5)\n> \n> S2: (2,4)\n> \n> S3: (2,3)\n> \n> S4: (3,3)\n> \n> S5: (4,3)\n> \n> S6: (4,4)\n> \n> S7: (3,4)\n> \n> S8: (3,5)\n> \n> S9: (4,5)  // food here\n> \n> S10: (5,5)\n> \n> S11: (6,5)\n> \n> S12: (6,4)\n> \n> S13: (5,4)\n> \n> S14: (5,3) tail\n> \n> After a move, if no food eaten, head moves to new position, and tail is removed.

Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> After move, the new head is at the new position, and the previous head becomes the first body segment, and so on, with the tail segment removed if no growth.\n> \n> So positions: new head at (1,6), then previous head (1,5) is now first body, then S1 (2,5) is second body, ..., up to S13 (5,4) is now the 14th segment?

Let's think.\n> \n> Positions before move:\n> \n> Cell A: head\n> \n> Cell B: seg1\n> \n> Cell C: seg2\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After move to new cell X:\n> \n> New head at X\n> \n> New seg1 at A (previous head)\n> \n> New seg2 at B (previous seg1)\n> \n> New seg3 at C (previous seg2)\n> \n> etc.\n> \n> So the cell that was occupied by seg2 (C) is now occupied by new seg3, which is the same segment that was at C, but it moves to B? No.\n> \n> The segment that was at position C is now at position B, because new seg2 is at B, which was previous seg1.\n> \n> Let's label:\n> \n> At time t: positions: H, P1, P2, P3, ..., Pk\n> \n> At time t+1, after moving to new head position N:\n> \n> New positions: N (head), H (body1), P1 (body2), P2 (body3), ..., P_{k-1} (bodyk)\n> \n> So the cell that was P1 is now occupied by body2, which is the segment that was at P1.\n> \n> The cell that was P2 is now occupied by body3, which was at P2, and so on.\n> \n> The cell that was H is now occupied by body1, which was at H.\n> \n> The cell that was P_{k-1} is now occupied by bodyk, which was at P_{k-1}.\n> \n> The cell that was Pk (tail) is vacated.\n> \n> So only the tail cell is vacated; all other cells that were occupied remain occupied by the same or different segments, but the cell itself may change occupation only at the tail.\n> \n> Specifically, for a cell that is not the tail, it may be occupied by a different segment after move, but the cell is still occupied unless it was the tail.\n> \n> To vacate a cell that has food under it, it must be the tail cell that moves away, because only the tail cell is vacated when the snake moves without eating.\n> \n> In this case, for (4,5), it is not the tail; the tail is (5,3). So when the snake moves, (4,5) will still be occupied, by the segment that was there or another one.\n> \n> In the new positions, after move, (4,5) might be occupied by a different segment, but the cell is not vacated.\n> \n> For example, in current state, S9 at (4,5).\n> \n> After move, say up to (1,6), new positions: head (1,6), body1 (1,5), body2 (2,5), body3 (2,4), body4 (2,3), body5 (3,3), body6 (4,3), body7 (4,4), body8 (3,4), body9 (3,5), body10 (4,5), body11 (5,5), body12 (6,5), body13 (6,4), body14 (5,4)\n> \n> So body10 is at (4,5), which is the same segment that was S9, now at position body10, but still at (4,5)? In this case, from above, new body10 is at (4,5), which was the position of S9, and S9 is now body10 at (4,5), so it hasn't moved; the segment at (4,5) remains there because the previous segment S8 was at (3,5), and new body9 is at (3,5), so the segment that was at (4,5) (S9) is now at (4,5) as body10? No.\n> \n> S9 was at (4,5). After move, new body10 is at the position that was S9, which is (4,5), and new body10 is the segment that was S9, so it is still at (4,5). So the cell (4,5) is still occupied by the same segment, so not vacated.\n> \n> Similarly, for any move, since (4,5) is not the tail, it won't be vacated unless that segment moves.\n> \n> But when does the segment at (4,5) move? It moves when the snake moves in a way that the segment before it moves to a different position relative to it.\n> \n> The segment at (4,5) will move to the position of the segment that was before it in the chain.\n> \n> Currently, before it is S8 at (3,5), which is above or below? (3,5) and (4,5), so adjacent.\n> \n> S8 at (3,5), S9 at (4,5), so when the snake moves, S9 will move to where S8 was, which is (3,5), only if S8 moves away.\n> \n> But S8 moves to where the previous segment was, and so on.\n> \n> Eventually, to vacate (4,5), we need that when the segment that is at (4,5) moves to a different cell, and no other segment moves to (4,5) immediately.\n> \n> That can only happen if (4,5) becomes the tail at some point, but it's not the tail now.\n> \n> The tail is (5,3), so (4,5) is far from tail.\n> \n> To make (4,5) vacated, the snake needs to move in such a way that the segment at (4,5) becomes the tail, which means we need to eat food to grow, but the food is at (4,5), so we can't eat it while it's under.\n> \n> The only way to vacate it is to move the snake so that the segment at (4,5) moves away and the cell is not reoccupied, which happens when it is the tail and we move, but it's not tail.\n> \n> Since the snake is a path, the cell (4,5) will be vacated only when the tail moves away from it, but the tail is at (5,3), so it will take many moves for the tail to reach (4,5).\n> \n> Let's see the distance.\n> \n> From tail (5,3) to (4,5): not direct.\n> \n> The snake must move so that the body segment at (4,5) is no longer there, which will happen when that segment is the one that moves to the tail position or something.\n> \n> Each time the snake moves, the tail cell is vacated, and internal cells may change but are still occupied.\n> \n> The cell (4,5) will be vacated only when the segment that is there moves to a different position and no segment comes to it, which means that in the new configuration, no segment is assigned to (4,5).\n> \n> That happens only if (4,5) was the position of a body segment that is not the position of any new segment, which only occurs for the tail position when it is not the head position or something.\n> \n> In the move, the only cell that is vacated is the previous tail position.\n> \n> For any other cell, it remains occupied because the segments shift.\n> \n> So for (4,5) to be vacated, it must be the tail position at some turn.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (5,3), so we need to move until (4,5) becomes the tail.\n> \n> How many moves until (4,5) is the tail? Since the snake has 15 segments, and (4,5) is the 10th segment (S9, but indexing from 0 or 1? S0 head, S1 to S14 body, S14 tail.\n> \n> S9 is at (4,5), which is the 10th segment from head, so it will become the tail after 5 moves, because there are 5 segments after it: S10 to S14.\n> \n> After 5 moves, S9 will be the tail.\n> \n> Let's see.\n> \n> After 1 move: tail is S14 removed, new tail is S13.\n> \n> After 2 moves: new tail S12\n> \n> After 3 moves: new tail S11\n> \n> After 4 moves: new tail S10\n> \n> After 5 moves: new tail S9\n> \n> S9 is at (4,5), but after each move, positions change.\n> \n> After k moves, the segment that was S9 will be the tail when k=5, but its position changes.\n> \n> Initially, S9 at (4,5)\n> \n> After first move, S9 moves to where S8 was, which is (3,5) in the current state, but after move, it depends on the moves.\n> \n> The position of the segment changes with each move.\n> \n> So after 5 moves, the segment that was S9 will be the tail, but at that time, it could be at a different position.\n> \n> To have the cell (4,5) vacated, we need that at some point, the tail is at (4,5), and when we move, the tail moves away, vacating it.\n> \n> But currently, the tail is at (5,3), not at (4,5).\n> \n> And (4,5) is occupied by S9.\n> \n> S9 will not necessarily be at (4,5) when it becomes tail; it depends on how the snake moves.\n> \n> For example, if we move in a way that the snake doesn't turn much, S9 might stay near, but it's messy.\n> \n> To eat the food at (4,5), we need to vacate the cell first, which requires that the tail is at (4,5) at some turn, then when we move, the tail leaves, vacating (4,5), then later we can move the head to (4,5) to eat the food.\n> \n> But the food has life span 5, so it can be eaten on turns 66 to 70.\n> \n> If we can vacate (4,5) by turn 70 and move head there.\n> \n> But vacating means that at some turn, tail is at (4,5), then on the next turn, when we move, tail leaves, so (4,5) is free, then we can move head there on a subsequent turn.\n> \n> But the food must be there when head moves there.\n> \n> So we need to vacate (4,5) by a turn when food is still there, say turn T, then on turn T+1 or later, move head to (4,5) while food is present.\n> \n> But life span decreases, so for (4,5) food, present until turn 70.\n> \n> Turn 66 now.\n> \n> If we can make tail at (4,5) by turn 69 or 70.\n> \n> But currently tail at (5,3), and (4,5) is not adjacent, so it will take multiple moves to bring the tail to (4,5), but we control the head, so we can steer the snake to move the tail to (4,5), but it's complicated.\n> \n> Perhaps it's not feasible to eat the food at (4,5) within the life span, or it might be risky.\n> \n> There is another food at (3,2) with life span 8, so more time.\n> \n> Also, we need to avoid risks.\n> \n> First, for the immediate move, I have to choose between U and D.\n> \n> Let's see the board.\n> \n> Grid: let's sketch the grid from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (4,6) obstacle.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> List all occupied cells:\n> \n> (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3)\n> \n> Free cells: for example, (1,4), (1,6), (3,2) has food, etc.\n> \n> Food at (3,2) and (4,5) but (4,5) occupied.\n> \n> Now, from head (1,5), moving U to (1,6): (1,6) is free, not wall, not occupied.\n> \n> Moving D to (1,4): (1,4) is free.\n> \n> If I move U to (1,6), then head at (1,6), direction U.\n> \n> Then possible next moves: not D (opposite), so U, L, R.\n> \n> L to (0,6) wall, invalid.

So currently moving down.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (4,5) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (3,2) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (5,3) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and (4,6).\n> \n> Playable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (4,6) is obstacle.\n> \n> (4,6) is internal obstacle, so cannot go there.\n> \n> Snake head at (1,4), moving down. So from (1,4), down would be to (1,3), but let's see possible moves.\n> \n> Current head position: (1,4)\n> \n> Direction: D (down), so last move was down.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot instant reverse. Reverse of down is up, so cannot move up immediately.\n> \n> So possible actions: D, L, R. Not U.\n> \n> Now, what are the adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Down: (1,3) - is this valid?\n> \n> - Left: (0,4) - x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Right: (2,4)\n> \n> - Up: (1,5) but cannot because reverse, and also (1,5) is occupied by body? Let's see.\n> \n> (1,5) is the second segment, body part. But since snake is moving, if I move, the tail might move away, but for collision, when head moves to a cell, if that cell has body, it's collision except if it's the tail and tail moves.\n> \n> Standard snake: head moves to a cell, if that cell has a body segment that is not the tail at that moment, it collides. But if it's the tail, and tail moves away, it's ok.\n> \n> In this case, current positions: head (1,4), body segments: (1,5), (2,5), etc.\n> \n> If I move up to (1,5), that is currently occupied by index 1, which is not the tail. After move, head would be at (1,5), and the body segments shift, so index 1 would become the new head position? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> When snake moves:\n> \n> - New head position based on action.\n> \n> - Then, all body segments move forward, so the tail is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> So, if I move to a cell that is currently occupied by the body, but that body part is not the tail, after movement, that cell will still be occupied by the new body, so head collides with body.\n> \n> Specifically, if the new head position is the same as any body segment except the current tail, it collides. If it's the current tail, and no food eaten, tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> But if food is eaten at tail position, then tail doesn't move, so head collides with tail.\n> \n> In this case, for move up to (1,5): current position of (1,5) is body segment, index 1. The tail is at (5,4), so (1,5) is not tail, so if I move to (1,5), it will be occupied by body when head arrives, collision.\n> \n> Similarly, for other moves.\n> \n> Let's list possible actions from (1,4) with direction D (down).\n> \n> - Up (U): to (1,5) - but (1,5) is currently occupied by body (index 1), not tail, so collision. Also, reverse direction, not allowed anyway.\n> \n> Cannot move up because reverse.\n> \n> - Down (D): to (1,3) - what is (1,3)? Is it wall or body?\n> \n> y=3, x=1. Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (1,3) is within bounds. Is it occupied? Snake positions: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), ... (2,3) is index 4, at (2,3). (1,3) is not in the list, so free? Let's list all positions: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4). (1,3) is not listed, so it should be free. Also, no wall, so down to (1,3) is possible.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (0,4) - x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Right (R): to (2,4) - (2,4) is currently occupied by index 3, body segment. Is it tail? Tail is (5,4), index 14. So (2,4) is not tail, so if I move to (2,4), collision.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move is down to (1,3).\n> \n> Is that right? Only one option?\n> \n> But let's confirm the snake body.\n> \n> After moving down to (1,3), the new head is (1,3), then the body: the first segment moves to (1,4), which was head, then (1,5) to (1,5)? No.\n> \n> When snake moves down:\n> \n> - New head: (1,3)\n> \n> - Then body segments: the previous head (1,4) becomes the first body segment.\n> \n> Then (1,5) becomes second, (2,5) third, and so on, up to (5,4) is tail, which moves away to where? The tail was at (5,4), and since no food eaten, it is removed, so the new tail is the previous second last, which is (6,4).\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - Head: (1,3)\n> \n> - Body: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)\n> \n> - Tail: (6,4) since (5,4) was tail and removed.\n> \n> (5,4) was index 14, tail. After move, without eating, tail is removed, so segments from 0 to 13, but new head is (1,3), so positions: new index 0: (1,3), index 1: old head (1,4), index 2: (1,5), index 3: (2,5), index 4: (2,4), index 5: (2,3), index 6: (3,3), index 7: (4,3), index 8: (4,4), index 9: (3,4), index 10: (3,5), index 11: (4,5), index 12: (5,5), index 13: (6,5), index 14: (6,4)? Old positions: index 0 to 14: 15 segments.\n> \n> After move down:\n> \n> - New head: (1,3)\n> \n> - New body: the first body segment is old head (1,4), then old index 1: (1,5), old index 2: (2,5), old index 3: (2,4), old index 4: (2,3), old index 5: (3,3), old index 6: (4,3), old index 7: (4,4), old index 8: (3,4), old index 9: (3,5), old index 10: (4,5), old index 11: (5,5), old index 12: (6,5), old index 13: (6,4), and old tail index 14: (5,4) is removed since no food.\n> \n> So new positions: head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) — that's 15 segments? No: old snake had 15 segments, after move without eating, length should be same, but tail removed, so 14 segments.\n> \n> Old: 15 positions.\n> \n> After move: new head at (1,3), and the body consists of the old head and all but the last segment? Standard: when moving, the head moves to new cell, and the tail cell is removed unless food eaten.\n> \n> So the new snake has the same segments except the tail is removed and a new head is added.\n> \n> So from old positions: segments S0 to S14.\n> \n> After move to (1,3):\n> \n> - New S0: (1,3) head\n> \n> - New S1: old S0 (1,4)\n> \n> - New S2: old S1 (1,5)\n> \n> - New S3: old S2 (2,5)\n> \n> - New S4: old S3 (2,4)\n> \n> - New S5: old S4 (2,3)\n> \n> - New S6: old S5 (3,3)\n> \n> - New S7: old S6 (4,3)\n> \n> - New S8: old S7 (4,4)\n> \n> - New S9: old S8 (3,4)\n> \n> - New S10: old S9 (3,5)\n> \n> - New S11: old S10 (4,5)\n> \n> - New S12: old S11 (5,5)\n> \n> - New S13: old S12 (6,5)\n> \n> - And old S13 (6,4) becomes new S14? Old S13 is (6,5), old S14 is (5,4).\n> \n> After move, the last segment old S14 (5,4) is removed, so the new snake has positions: new head (1,3), then old S0 to S13, but S13 is (6,5), S14 is (5,4) removed.\n> \n> The body segments are the old positions from S0 to S13, but S0 is now the first body segment at (1,4), S1 at (1,5), up to S13 at (6,5)? Old S13 is index 13: (6,5), old S14 is index 14: (5,4).\n> \n> After move, without eating:\n> \n> - New head: (1,3)\n> \n> - New body segment 1: old head (1,4)\n> \n> - New body segment 2: old body1 (1,5)\n> \n> - ...\n> - New body segment 14: old body13 (6,5) — old body13 is index 13, which is (6,5)\n> \n> Then old body14 (5,4) is removed.\n> \n> So new positions: head (1,3), body: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), and tail (6,5) is the last? New body has 14 segments? Let's count the new list:\n> \n> - Head: (1,3)\n> \n> - Body: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)\n> \n> - And (6,4) is not part of it? Old S14 was (5,4), removed. Old S13 was (6,5), which is now the last body segment.\n> \n> New positions: 15 cells? No: when no food eaten, snake length decreases by one? No, in snake game, when no food, length stays the same, but the tail moves forward.\n> \n> Initial length L, after move without eating, head moves to new cell, tail cell is vacated, so snake occupies L cells still.\n> \n> In terms of positions, the snake has a fixed length unless food eaten.\n> \n> Here, current snake has 15 segments. If no food eaten, after move, it still has 15 segments, but the head is at new position, and the tail is removed, so the segments shift.\n> \n> So from list: old positions: 0:(1,4), 1:(1,5), 2:(2,5), 3:(2,4), 4:(2,3), 5:(3,3), 6:(4,3), 7:(4,4), 8:(3,4), 9:(3,5), 10:(4,5), 11:(5,5), 12:(6,5), 13:(6,4), 14:(5,4)\n> \n> After move down to (1,3):\n> \n> - New head: (1,3) — new position 0\n> \n> - New position 1: old position 0 (1,4)\n> \n> - New position 2: old position 1 (1,5)\n> \n> - New position 3: old position 2 (2,5)\n> \n> - New position 4: old position 3 (2,4)\n> \n> - New position 5: old position 4 (2,3)\n> \n> - New position 6: old position 5 (3,3)\n> \n> - New position 7: old position 6 (4,3)\n> \n> - New position 8: old position 7 (4,4)\n> \n> - New position 9: old position 8 (3,4)\n> \n> - New position 10: old position 9 (3,5)\n> \n> - New position 11: old position 10 (4,5)\n> \n> - New position 12: old position 11 (5,5)\n> \n> - New position 13: old position 12 (6,5)\n> \n> - New position 14: old position 13 (6,4)  — old position 14 (5,4) is removed.\n> \n> So new tail is at (6,4), which was old position 13.\n> \n> And (5,4) is free now.\n> \n> Back to moves: from current position (1,4), only down to (1,3) is valid and safe, since (1,3) is empty and not wall.\n> \n> Left to (0,4) wall, invalid.\n> \n> Right to (2,4) is occupied by old position 3, which is body, not tail, so collision.\n> \n> Up to (1,5) occupied and reverse, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move is down to (1,3).\n> \n> But that seems limiting.

Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> In positions, head at (1,3), moving down (D), which is (x,y-1), so from (1,3) to (1,2) if it moves down.\n> \n> But (1,2): is it within bounds? x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, since walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so playable from (1,1) to (6,6).\n> \n> y=1 is bottom, y=6 is top? y=0 is wall, y=1 is row 1, bottom; y=6 is row 6, top; since y=7 is wall above.\n> \n> Similarly, x=1 left, x=6 right.\n> \n> So head at (1,3), moving down to (1,2) if it chooses D, but current direction is D, so it can continue or turn.\n> \n> But no instant reverse: cannot move up since current is down, so cannot go U immediately. Can go L, R, or D.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (1,3):\n> \n> - Down (D): to (1,2). Is (1,2) available? Not occupied by snake or wall? Walls: borders, so (1,2) is within 1-6,1-6, and no internal wall there. Snake: positions include (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), etc. (1,2) not in list, so free? Let's check: snake has (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), and (2,3) etc. No (1,2), so (1,2) is free.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (0,3), but x=0 is wall, so invalid, cannot move left.\n> \n> - Right (R): to (2,3). (2,3) is occupied by snake at index 5, but it's a body segment. However, since the snake will move, when head moves to a cell, if it's the tail cell, it might be ok if tail moves away.\n> \n> Collision rules: head touches body segment, deadly, except if it's the tail and tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, for (2,3), it is currently occupied by the snake, index 5. But after movement, the tail will move, so if head moves to (2,3), and (2,3) was tail or something? Let's see the snake order.\n> \n> After movement, the head moves to new position, and each segment moves to the next position.\n> \n> Current tail is (6,4).\n> \n> If head moves to a cell that is not occupied after the move, it's safe.\n> \n> But at the moment of move, if head moves to a cell occupied by body, it dies, unless that cell is the current tail and will be vacated.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by any body segment except the tail, it collides. If it's the tail, and tail moves, it's ok because tail leaves.\n> \n> In this case, (2,3) is index 5, not tail. Tail is (6,4). So (2,3) is a body segment, not tail, so if head moves to (2,3), it would collide with body.\n> \n> Similarly, up (U): to (1,4). (1,4) is occupied by index 1, body segment.\n> \n> (1,4) is directly above head? Head at (1,3), U to (1,4), but (1,4) is occupied, and it's body, not tail.\n> \n> Possible moves from (1,3):\n> \n> - D: to (1,2) - free? (1,2) not in snake positions, and within grid, so yes.\n> \n> - L: to (0,3) - x=0 wall, invalid\n> \n> - R: to (2,3) - occupied by snake at (2,3), index 5. Since not tail, collision if head moves there.\n> \n> - U: to (1,4) - occupied by snake at (1,4), index 1, not tail, collision.\n> \n> But current direction is D, and we can move to adjacent cells.\n> \n> U would be opposite to current D? Current direction is D (down), so moving U (up) is instant reverse? The rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> So from current direction D, cannot move U on next turn. But moving to (1,4) is U, which is opposite to D, so invalid move anyway, even if not occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, moving D is same direction, allowed.\n> \n> L and R are perpendicular, allowed.\n> \n> But L is to wall, invalid.\n> \n> R is to (2,3), occupied and not tail, so collision.\n> \n> D to (1,2) seems the only possible move? But is that right?\n> \n> (1,2) is free, no wall, no snake, so moving D to (1,2) should be safe.\n> \n> But let's confirm the snake body.\n> \n> After moving, the head goes to (1,2), and the body follows: segment 0 was head, now body, goes to where head was? Standard snake movement: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So if head moves to (1,2), new head at (1,2), then the old head (1,3) becomes part of body, segment 1 moves to (1,3), segment 2 to (1,4), and so on, up to tail (6,4) moves to where the second last was, which is (6,5)? Positions: after move, the new positions:\n> \n> - Head moves to (1,2)\n> \n> - Then segment 1 (was at (1,4)) moves to (1,3) (previous head position)\n> \n> - Segment 2 (was (1,5)) moves to (1,4) (where segment 1 was)\n> \n> - Segment 3 (was (2,5)) moves to (1,5) (where segment 2 was)\n> \n> - Segment 4 (was (2,4)) moves to (2,5) (where segment 3 was)\n> \n> - Segment 5 (was (2,3)) moves to (2,4) (where segment 4 was)\n> \n> - Segment 6 (was (3,3)) moves to (2,3) (where segment 5 was)\n> \n> - Segment 7 (was (4,3)) moves to (3,3) (where segment 6 was)\n> \n> - Segment 8 (was (4,4)) moves to (4,3) (where segment 7 was)\n> \n> - Segment 9 (was (3,4)) moves to (4,4) (where segment 8 was)\n> \n> - Segment 10 (was (3,5)) moves to (3,4) (where segment 9 was)\n> \n> - Segment 11 (was (4,5)) moves to (3,5) (where segment 10 was)\n> \n> - Segment 12 (was (5,5)) moves to (4,5) (where segment 11 was)\n> \n> - Segment 13 (was (6,5)) moves to (5,5) (where segment 12 was)\n> \n> - Segment 14 (tail, was (6,4)) moves to (6,5) (where segment 13 was)\n> \n> New tail at (6,5)\n> \n> In this new position, (1,2) is head, and all cells are occupied except (6,4) is vacated since tail moved to (6,5).\n> \n> But (6,4) is now free.\n> \n> Importantly, no collision because head moved to (1,2), which was free, and no body segment was there.\n> \n> If it had moved to (2,3), which was occupied, it would be collision.\n> \n> Back to turn 68: from (1,3), only possible safe move is D to (1,2), since L to wall, R to body, U to body and also reverse invalid.\n> \n> U is invalid because reverse and occupied.\n> \n> So for turn 68, must move D to (1,2).\n> \n> But the action is for the move, so on turn 68, action is D.\n> \n> Then, after that, we plan future turns.\n> \n> But I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's list the food:\n> \n> Food at (4,5): value 1, life span 3, so present on turn 68,69,70. But (4,5) is currently occupied by snake at index 11. So to eat it, the snake body must move away, and head move to it.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2): free, value 1, life span 6, present until turn 73.\n> \n> (5,3): free, value 1, life span 9, present until turn 76.\n> \n> Also, (4,5) has food under it, but snake is on it, so it can be eaten only if snake moves away and head comes later.\n> \n> Now, after turn 68 move to D, head at (1,2), and body as above.\n> \n> Then for turn 69, head at (1,2), direction is now D (since we moved down).\n> \n> Possible moves from (1,2):\n> \n> - D: to (1,1) - y=1, but y=0 is wall, so (1,1) is bottom row, within bounds. Is it free? Snake positions after 68 move: head (1,2), body: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5) tail at (6,5)\n> \n> (1,1) not occupied, no wall, so free.\n> \n> - L: to (0,2) x=0 wall, invalid\n> \n> - R: to (2,2) - (2,2) not in positions, so free? Positions: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), etc. No (2,2), so free.\n> \n> - U: to (1,3) - but (1,3) is occupied by body, the segment that was head, now at index 1? After move, positions: index 0: (1,2) head, index 1: (1,3), index 2: (1,4), etc. So (1,3) is body segment, not tail. Tail is (6,5). So moving to (1,3) would be collision. Also, U is opposite to current direction D, so invalid reverse.\n> \n> So possible moves: D to (1,1) or R to (2,2).\n> \n> Both seem safe.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan multiple turns to maximize score, avoiding risks.\n> \n> Food at (3,2) and (5,3) are available, (4,5) is under snake but can be eaten if head goes there after body leaves.\n> \n> (4,5) has life span 3, so only until turn 70. After turn 68 move, on turn 69, (4,5) still has food? Life span decreases each turn.\n> \n> At turn 68, food (4,5) has life span 3, so present on 68,69,70.\n> \n> After turn 68 move, the snake body at (4,5) was segment 11, which moved to (3,5) as per earlier calculation? After turn 68 move to D, head at (1,2), and segment 11 was at (4,5), but after move, segment 11 moves to where segment 10 was, which was (3,5), so (4,5) is now occupied by segment 12, which moved to (4,5) from (5,5)? Let's clarify positions after turn 68 action D:\n> \n> - Head moved to (1,2)\n> \n> - Then body segments:\n> \n> - Segment 1: was (1,4), moves to previous head position (1,3)\n> \n> - Segment 2: was (1,5), moves to where segment 1 was, (1,4)\n> \n> - Segment 3: was (2,5), moves to where segment 2 was, (1,5)\n> \n> - Segment 4: was (2,4), moves to where segment 3 was, (2,5)\n> \n> - Segment 5: was (2,3), moves to where segment 4 was, (2,4)\n> \n> - Segment 6: was (3,3), moves to where segment 5 was, (2,3)\n> \n> - Segment 7: was (4,3), moves to where segment 6 was, (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 8: was (4,4), moves to where segment 7 was, (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 9: was (3,4), moves to where segment 8 was, (4,4)\n> \n> - Segment 10: was (3,5), moves to where segment 9 was, (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 11: was (4,5), moves to where segment 10 was, (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 12: was (5,5), moves to where segment 11 was, (4,5)\n> \n> - Segment 13: was (6,5), moves to where segment 12 was, (5,5)\n> \n> - Segment 14: was (6,4), moves to where segment 13 was, (6,5)\n> \n> So new positions: head (1,2), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5) tail at (6,5)\n> \n> (4,5) is now occupied by segment 12, which moved there. But food is at (4,5), so it's still under the snake body, at segment 12.\n> \n> To eat this food, the body must move away from (4,5), and head must move to it later.\n> \n> Life span: on turn 69, (4,5) food still there, life span decreases to 2?

That can't be.\n> \n> I think I have confusion.\n> \n> Standard snake growth: when head moves to food, the head is at the food cell, and the tail does not shorten, so a new segment is added at the tail end, but since tail doesn't move, the new segment is attached, so the position of the tail remains, and the snake extends.\n> \n> For example, before move, tail at position P. After eating, head moves to new cell, tail stays at P, and a new segment is inserted before the tail or something. But in terms of positions, the tail position doesn't change; the new segment is at the tail position, and the old tail is now the second last.\n> \n> In list: positions before move: [head, ..., tail]\n> \n> After move without food: new head at new position, then [old head, ..., old second last], tail moves to old second last position.\n> \n> With food: new head at food position, then [old head, ..., old tail], and old tail position has a new segment, so the new tail is at old tail position, but since we add a segment, the list is new head, then old head, then rest, and finally old tail, with the position unchanged.\n> \n> For example, before eating, positions: H, B1, B2, ..., T\n> \n> After moving to food: new head at F, then old head becomes B1 at H position, B1 moves to where it was? No.\n> \n> When moving, the head moves to the new cell. If no food, all segments shift: B1 to H, B2 to B1, ..., T to new position.\n> \n> If food, head moves to F, and the segments from B1 to T remain in place, but since head moved, B1 is now connected to new head, and T stays, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail.\n> \n> So positions: new head at F, then B1 at its position, B2 at its, ..., T at its position, and since T doesn't move, it's like adding a segment.\n> \n> In terms of the list: the new position list is [F, H, B1, B2, ..., T] where H, B1, etc. are the positions before move.\n> \n> In this case, before turn 70 move, positions: head (2,2), B1 (1,2), B2 (1,3), B3 (1,4), B4 (1,5), B5 (2,5), B6 (2,4), B7 (2,3), B8 (3,3), B9 (4,3), B10 (4,4), B11 (3,4), B12 (3,5), B13 (4,5), B14 (5,5) tail.\n> \n> Now, move head to (3,2) which has food, so after move:\n> \n> New head at (3,2)\n> \n> Then the body: B1 at (1,2) remains? No, the positions: B1 is at (1,2), it doesn't move, so segment 1 is still at (1,2), but now it's part of body after head.\n> \n> The new positions: head at (3,2), then segment 1 at (2,2) (which was head, now body), segment 2 at (1,2) (was B1), segment 3 at (1,3) (was B2), segment 4 at (1,4) (was B3), segment 5 at (1,5) (was B4), segment 6 at (2,5) (was B5), segment 7 at (2,4) (was B6), segment 8 at (2,3) (was B7), segment 9 at (3,3) (was B8), segment 10 at (4,3) (was B9), segment 11 at (4,4) (was B10), segment 12 at (3,4) (was B11), segment 13 at (3,5) (was B12), segment 14 at (4,5) (was B13), segment 15 at (5,5) (was B14), and new segment 16 at (5,5) because tail doesn't move, so the new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> So (5,5) now has segment 15 and 16? That can't be; it must be one cell.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> When food is eaten, the tail does not move, so the cell that was tail remains occupied, and a new segment is added there, but since it's the same cell, it's fine, but in the list, the tail position is still (5,5), and it's now segment 16, with segment 15 being the one before? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically, in snake, when you eat, the head moves to the food, and the tail stays in place for that turn, so the snake grows by one; the new length is old length +1, with the tail position unchanged.\n> \n> So positions: new head at food cell, then the previous head position, then the previous body positions up to the tail, which remains at its position.\n> \n> So the position list has one more element: the new head position, and the tail position is the same as before.\n> \n> For example, before: [H, B1, B2, ..., T] 15 segments.\n> \n> After eating: [new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., T] 16 segments, with T at same position.\n> \n> In this case, new_head = (3,2), H = (2,2), B1 = (1,2), B2 = (1,3), ..., up to B14 = (5,5), and T = (5,5), but B14 is (5,5), T is (5,5), so in list, it's [ (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) ] with (5,5) being the tail.\n> \n> (5,5) is occupied by one segment, the tail.\n> \n> Previously, (5,5) was tail, now it's still tail, but with a new segment index.\n> \n> Positions: head (3,2), then (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) tail.\n> \n> Yes, 16 positions.\n> \n> Now, for turn 71, head at (3,2), direction R (since moved right last turn).\n> \n> Possible moves: from (3,2)\n> \n> - U to (3,3) - but (3,3) is occupied by body, segment 10 at (3,3)?

It's turn 69, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and obstacles. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6) since walls occupy the edges. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (1,2), and the body segments follow: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5). That's 15 segments. The head direction is down, so moving D means increasing y, but in coordinates, D is (x, y-1)? No, let's clarify the movement directions.\n> \n> The problem says: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). So U is up (increasing y), D is down (decreasing y), L left (decreasing x), R right (increasing x). But in grid coordinates, often y increases downward, but here it's specified: U (x,y+1) so y+1 is up? Let me read carefully.\n> \n> \"U(x,y+1)\" – so if y+1 is up, that means the coordinate system has y increasing upwards, like in mathematics. But in many games, y increases downward. I need to be consistent. Let's see the snake positions: head at (1,2), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), so as we go from head to tail, y is increasing: from 2 to 5, so y=2,3,4,5 – so higher y is downward if we think of the grid with (0,0) at bottom left or top left? Walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders. Snake at y=2 to y=5, so y=5 is closer to y=7, which is a border. If y=0 is bottom and y=7 is top, or vice versa?\n> \n> The walls are given: \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" It doesn't specify which is top or bottom, but for movement, it doesn't matter as long as I know the boundaries. From the movement definitions: U (x,y+1) – if U is up, then y+1 should be higher row number if rows increase downward, but here U is (x,y+1), and D is (x,y-1), so y-1 would be down.\n> \n> In the snake positions, head at (1,2), direction D, which is down. If D is (x,y-1), moving down would decrease y. But from positions, the head is at (1,2), and previous position must be such that it came from somewhere. The positions are listed head first: (1,2) is head, then (1,3), which is directly below if y increases downward? (1,2) to (1,3) – if y increases downward, (1,3) has higher y, so it's below (1,2). But the direction is given as D, down.\n> \n> Snake head direction is D, meaning it moved to (1,2) by going down. So from where? The positions are [(1,2), (1,3), ...], so (1,2) is head, then body at (1,3), which has same x, higher y, so if y increases downward, (1,3) is below (1,2), so moving to (1,2) from above would be down, but the head is at (1,2), and it came from the previous head position. The list is current positions, so the head moved to (1,2) from the previous turn's position.\n> \n> Since direction is D, and head is at (1,2), it must have come from (1,3) or something? Let's see the full list: positions: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)\n> \n> So the head is (1,2), next segment is (1,3), which is directly below if y increases down. Since direction is D (down), the snake was moving down to (1,2), so from (1,1) or something? (1,2) is head, and it moved down to there, so previous head was at (1,1) or (1,3)? I'm confused.\n> \n> Perhaps the positions are listed in order: index 0 is head, index 1 is the first body segment, which is where the head was one turn ago, and so on.\n> \n> So at turn t, head is at pos[0], at turn t-1, head was at pos[1], and so on.\n> \n> So here, head at (1,2) at turn 69, so at turn 68, head was at (1,3), and it moved from (1,3) to (1,2), which is decreasing y, so down, since D is (x,y-1). Yes, from (1,3) to (1,2) is y-1, so down. Similarly, at turn 67, head was at (1,4), moved to (1,3), down, and so on.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (4,5) with value 1, life span 2\n> \n> - (3,2) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (5,3) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> All are positive food since value=1, and no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn, including current. So for (4,5), life span 2, so after 2 more turns it disappears, meaning on turn 71 it will be gone if not eaten. Similarly, (3,2) life span 5, gone after turn 73, (5,3) life span 8, gone after turn 76.\n> \n> Current turn is 69, so for (4,5), if not eaten by turn 70, it disappears before turn 71? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 69, life span 2, after turn 69, it becomes 1, after turn 70, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 69 or 70.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) life span 5, can be eaten from turn 69 to 73, disappears before turn 74.\n> \n> (5,3) life span 8, can be eaten from turn 69 to 76.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (1,2), direction D, so it can move U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is D, so opposite is U. So it cannot move U next turn because that would be instant reverse. Allowed moves: since direction is D, it can move D, L, or R, but not U.\n> \n> Possible actions from (1,2):\n> \n> - U: (1,3) but that's where the body is?

Turn 69 and 70, head can move at most 2 steps.\n> \n> From (1,2), after one move to say (2,2) or (1,1), then second move to adjacent, so at best to (3,2) or (2,1) or (1,0) invalid, so positions like (2,2) or (3,2) or (2,1), all far from (4,5), which is at (4,5), so |4-3| + |5-2| =1+3=4 or more, still far, cannot reach in two moves.

When the body moves away, it might be freed, but in the same turn, when I move the head, the body moves simultaneously, I think.\n> \n> I need to clarify the turn sequence.\n> \n> In one turn:\n> \n> - I choose a direction for the head to move.\n> \n> - The head moves to the new cell.\n> \n> - If that cell has food, it is eaten, and the snake grows, so the tail does not move.\n> \n> - If no food, the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> - Body segments shift: each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> For a cell under the body, it can be freed if the segment that was there moves away.\n> \n> But in the turn when the head moves, the body also moves at the same time, so the occupancy changes.\n> \n> For food at (4,5), it is currently occupied. If I move such that the segment at (4,5) moves to a different cell, then (4,5) might be free after the move.\n> \n> But when the head moves, it moves first to a new cell, then the body shifts.\n> \n> Sequence:\n> \n> 1. Head moves to new position.\n> \n> 2. If new position has food, eat it (snake grows, tail stays).\n> \n> 3. Else, tail is removed (moves forward).\n> \n> 4. Body segments shift to the next position.\n> \n> In terms of freeing a cell, if a body segment was on a cell and it moves away, that cell becomes free after the move.\n> \n> But for the head to move to a cell, it must be free at the time of movement.\n> \n> At the start of the turn, before movement, the grid has certain occupancies.\n> \n> When I decide to move the head to a cell, that cell must be empty or have food, but if it has a body segment, it's a collision, I think, unless it's the tail, but even tail, if I move to tail, it might be ok if the tail moves away.\n> \n> Rules say: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> For other body segments, it's collision.\n> \n> In this case, (4,5) is not the tail; tail is at (5,5). (4,5) is index 13, which is not tail; tail is index 14 (5,5).\n> \n> So (4,5) is a body segment, not tail, so if I try to move head to (4,5), it would be collision with body, death.\n> \n> Therefore, I cannot move directly to (4,5) because it's occupied by non-tail body.\n> \n> Moreover, since life span is 1, after this turn, it disappears, so I cannot eat it at all. It's impossible to eat this food because it's under the body and will vanish before I can free it.\n> \n> Because to free it, I need the segment at (4,5) to move away, which would happen if the snake moves, but in that case, when it moves, the food might still be there, but the head is not on it, so not eaten. Then next turn, it disappears.\n> \n> For example, if I move in a way that the segment at (4,5) moves to another cell, say, if the snake moves right or something, the body shifts, so (4,5) might be vacated, but in the same turn, the head is moving to a different cell, so (4,5) is not eaten. Then after the move, (4,5) is free, but the food has life span decreasing, so at the end of turn, life span 1 to 0, disappears. So I never have a chance to eat it.\n> \n> Therefore, the food at (4,5) with life span 1 cannot be eaten; it's a lost cause. I should ignore it.\n> \n> Similarly, for other food under body, but here only (4,5) is listed, and it's occupied.\n> \n> Now, other food: (3,2), (5,3), (3,6)\n> \n> (3,2) is at (3,2), which is not occupied; let's check positions: head (2,2), body (1,2), (1,3), etc., no (3,2), so free.\n> \n> (5,3) not in positions, free.\n> \n> (3,6) not in positions, but (3,6) is near the internal wall at (4,6), but (3,6) is different cell.\n> \n> Also, walls: (3,6) is x=3,y=6, not border, not (4,6), so should be free.\n> \n> Now, back to immediate move.\n> \n> From head (2,2), possible moves: D to (2,1) or R to (3,2)\n> \n> (3,2) has food! (3,2) is one of the food positions: (3,2) with value 1, life span 4.\n> \n> So moving right to (3,2) would eat the food there, since it's free.\n> \n> Moving down to (2,1) is empty, no food.\n> \n> If I move right to (3,2), I eat the food, so snake grows: new head at (3,2), and the tail stays, so the snake length increases by 1.\n> \n> Then the body: the segment that was tail at (5,5) remains, and new positions: head to (3,2), then the first body segment moves to old head (2,2), then next to (1,2), and so on, up to the tail which was (5,5) but since we ate food, tail doesn't move, so now tail is still (5,5), but the segment before that was (4,5), which is now part of body.\n> \n> After eating, positions: head at (3,2), then body: (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) — since tail doesn't move, length is now 16.\n> \n> Before move, positions had 15 segments, after eating, 16.\n> \n> If I don't eat, move down to (2,1), no food, so tail moves: head to (2,1), then body: (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), ..., up to (4,5), and tail was (5,5) moves to where? The segment before tail is (4,5), which moves to (5,5)? Let's see: the body shifts: each segment moves to the position of the previous one.\n> \n> After move down: head to (2,1), then index 1 moves to old head (2,2), index 2 to old index 1 (1,2), index 3 to old index 2 (1,3), ..., index 14 (tail) to old index 13 (4,5). So tail is now at (4,5), and (5,5) is free.\n> \n> But food at (4,5) was there, but since we didn't move head to it, not eaten, and after move, it might be free, but life span decreases to 0, disappears, so not eaten.\n> \n> Now, for turn 70, I have two choices:\n> \n> Option 1: Move R to (3,2) - eat food at (3,2), grow to 16, head now at (3,2), direction R?

Walls on borders, so cells (x,0), (x,7) for all x, and (0,y), (7,y) for all y are walls. Also internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> So accessible cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (4,6) is blocked.\n> \n> x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls, so snake can be on x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but (4,6) is obstacle, so not accessible.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: let's list all occupied cells to avoid collisions.\n> \n> Snake: (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)\n> \n> (4,5) is the tail?

(4,3): x=4,y=3, not wall. (4,1): x=4,y=1, not wall.\n> \n> Now, check for body collisions: when moving, the head moves to a new cell, and if that cell is occupied by body except the tail, it dies. But tail is special because tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (5,2): is (5,2) in snake positions? Look at list: (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), etc. No (5,2), so empty. Similarly, (4,3): is it in snake? Yes, (4,3) is a body segment, 11th position: (4,3). So moving to (4,3) would collide with body.\n> \n> (4,3) is occupied by the snake body, so moving up to (4,3) would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1): is it in snake? Positions: all y=2 or above, (1,2) to (1,5), etc., no y=1, so (4,1) is empty.\n> \n> So from (4,2), possible safe moves: R to (5,2) or D to (4,1).

Rule: when eating positive food, length +1, so head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the end, so tail stays or something? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, head moves to food, and a new segment is added to the tail, so the tail doesn't move that turn. But in terms of positions, after eating, the head is at food, and tail remains, so the body extends.\n> \n> In collision, if head touches body, it dies, except if it's the tail cell that is moving away.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (5,3) from (5,2), (5,3) has food, so I eat it.\n> \n> But is (5,3) occupied? Currently, at turn 72, (5,3) is food, not occupied by snake. Snake positions don't include (5,3).\n> \n> After moving head to (5,3), I eat the food, so new position: head at (5,3), and the body follows, but since I ate, the tail doesn't move, so the last segment stays, meaning the snake grows by one.\n> \n> Original positions: head (4,2), then body (3,2), (2,2), etc. to tail (4,5).\n> \n> After moving right to (5,2): head to (5,2), then body: the first body segment moves to (4,2), which was head, and so on, tail moves from (4,5) to where? The tail was (4,5), but when snake moves, if no food eaten, tail moves off its position.\n> \n> But in this move to (5,2), I didn't eat food, so after move: new head at (5,2), body segments: position 1: (4,2) (previous head), position 2: (3,2), etc., and tail moves to the previous second last, which was (3,5)? Positions: let's list the new positions after moving right to (5,2).\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: (4,2) head, 1: (3,2), 2: (2,2), 3: (1,2), 4: (1,3), 5: (1,4), 6: (1,5), 7: (2,5), 8: (2,4), 9: (2,3), 10: (3,3), 11: (4,3), 12: (4,4), 13: (3,4), 14: (3,5), 15: (4,5) tail.\n> \n> After moving right, head to (5,2), then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it. So:\n> \n> - New head: (5,2)\n> \n> - New segment 1: (4,2)  // old head\n> \n> - Segment 2: (3,2)  // old seg1\n> \n> - Segment 3: (2,2)  // old seg2\n> \n> - Segment 4: (1,2)  // old seg3\n> \n> - Segment 5: (1,3)  // old seg4\n> \n> - Segment 6: (1,4)  // old seg5\n> \n> - Segment 7: (1,5)  // old seg6\n> \n> - Segment 8: (2,5)  // old seg7\n> \n> - Segment 9: (2,4)  // old seg8\n> \n> - Segment 10: (2,3)  // old seg9\n> \n> - Segment 11: (3,3)  // old seg10\n> \n> - Segment 12: (4,3)  // old seg11\n> \n> - Segment 13: (4,4)  // old seg12\n> \n> - Segment 14: (3,4)  // old seg13? Old seg13 is (3,4), but old positions: seg12 is (4,4), seg13 is (3,4), seg14 is (3,5), seg15 is (4,5)\n> \n> After moving, the tail (old seg15) is removed, so new segments from 0 to 14? No, the snake has 16 segments, but when moving without eating, length same, so tail is removed.\n> \n> Number of segments: 16 positions, so when moving, new head position, and the last position is discarded, so 16 segments but the last one is new.\n> \n> After move to (5,2) without eating:\n> \n> - New head: (5,2)\n> \n> - New body: old head to old second last, but the body segments shift.\n> \n> New position 0: (5,2) head\n> \n> New position 1: old pos0 = (4,2)\n> \n> New position 2: old pos1 = (3,2)\n> \n> New position 3: old pos2 = (2,2)\n> \n> New position 4: old pos3 = (1,2)\n> \n> New position 5: old pos4 = (1,3)\n> \n> New position 6: old pos5 = (1,4)\n> \n> New position 7: old pos6 = (1,5)\n> \n> New position 8: old pos7 = (2,5)\n> \n> New position 9: old pos8 = (2,4)\n> \n> New position 10: old pos9 = (2,3)\n> \n> New position 11: old pos10 = (3,3)\n> \n> New position 12: old pos11 = (4,3)\n> \n> New position 13: old pos12 = (4,4)\n> \n> New position 14: old pos13 = (3,4)\n> \n> New position 15: old pos14 = (3,5)  // new tail, since old tail (4,5) is discarded\n> \n> Old pos14 is (3,5), old pos15 is (4,5) discarded.\n> \n> So new tail is (3,5) at position 15.\n> \n> Old positions: pos14 (3,5) becomes new pos15, and old pos15 (4,5) is gone.\n> \n> So now snake at: [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5)]\n> \n> Tail at (3,5).\n> \n> Now, at this point, turn 73, head at (5,2), direction R (since moved right).\n> \n> Food at (5,3) is still there, life span now 5 (since decreased by 1).\n> \n> I can move U to (5,3) to eat the food.\n> \n> (5,3) is not occupied by snake, as per above positions, all y=3 are (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), no (5,3), so empty except for food.\n> \n> Move U to (5,3): eat food, so snake grows.\n> \n> After moving head to (5,3), since ate food, new head at (5,3), and the body: the previous positions are kept, but a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move.\n> \n> So new positions: head at (5,3), then body: position 1: (5,2)  // previous head\n> \n> Position 2: (4,2)  // previous pos1\n> \n> ... up to position 15: (3,5)  // previous tail, and since ate, new segment added, so position 16: (3,5) again? No.\n> \n> When eating, the head moves to food, the body segments move as usual except the tail stays, so a new segment is added at the end.\n> \n> So from previous state before move: positions were [(5,2), (4,2), ..., (3,5)] for 16 segments? No, before moving to (5,3), at turn 73 after first move, we have positions: let's list indices.\n> \n> At turn 73 after move to (5,2): positions: 0:(5,2), 1:(4,2), 2:(3,2), 3:(2,2), 4:(1,2), 5:(1,3), 6:(1,4), 7:(1,5), 8:(2,5), 9:(2,4), 10:(2,3), 11:(3,3), 12:(4,3), 13:(4,4), 14:(3,4), 15:(3,5)\n> \n> Now, move U to (5,3): head to (5,3), which has food, so eat it. Then, the body moves: segment 1 moves to previous head position (5,2), segment 2 to previous pos1 (4,2), and so on, up to segment 15 moves to previous pos14 (3,4)? Previous positions: when moving, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> New head: (5,3)\n> \n> New position 1: old pos0 = (5,2)\n> \n> New position 2: old pos1 = (4,2)\n> \n> New position 3: old pos2 = (3,2)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New position 15: old pos14 = (3,4)  // old pos14 was (3,4)\n> \n> But old pos15 was (3,5), and since we ate food, we add a new segment at the end, so new position 16: (3,5)  // the old tail position, not moved.\n> \n> So now snake has 17 segments: head (5,3), then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5)\n> \n> Tail at (3,5).\n> \n> And the food at (5,3) is consumed.\n> \n> Now, direction is now U (since moved up).\n> \n> But this is for turn 73 action.\n> \n> Back to turn 72 decision.\n> \n> If I go R to (5,2) on turn 72, then on turn 73 I can go U to (5,3) to eat the food.\n> \n> But on turn 72, if I go R to (5,2), that's one action, then on turn 73 go U.\n> \n> But I need to think further.\n> \n> What if on turn 72 I go down to (4,1)?\n> \n> Then head to (4,1), direction down.\n> \n> Then possible moves: L to (3,1), R to (5,1), U to (4,2) but (4,2) will be body after move, so collision if I go up? After moving down to (4,1), the new positions: similar to before, head at (4,1), body: previous head (4,2) becomes segment 1, etc., and tail moves, so (4,2) is now occupied by body, so if I go up to (4,2) from (4,1), it would collide.\n> \n> From (4,1), moving U to (4,2) is impossible because (4,2) is now body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, moving L to (3,1) or R to (5,1) or D to (4,0) but y=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> So from (4,1), possible moves: L to (3,1) or R to (5,1), assuming they are empty.\n> \n> (3,1): not in snake positions, probably empty.\n> \n> (5,1): empty.\n> \n> But no food there.\n> \n> Now, the food at (5,3) is only available for a few turns, and (3,6) is further.\n> \n> Also, there is a danger with tail.\n> \n> Another thing: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 72, tail is at (4,5), head at (4,2), not adjacent.

So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and these borders are walls. There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6). So I can't move into these cells.\n> \n> - **Snake Positions**: The snake is a list of coordinates starting from the head: [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5)].

(2,3) is already listed, but let's plot:\n> \n> - Row y=2: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2) — that's a horizontal line from x=1 to 5 at y=2.\n> \n> Then from (1,2) to (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) — so up the left side to y=5.\n> \n> Then from (1,5) to (2,5) — right to x=2.\n> \n> Then down to (2,4)? (2,4) is listed after (2,5), so from (2,5) to (2,4) down? y decreases, so down.\n> \n> Then from (2,4) to (2,3)? (2,3) is listed, but (2,3) is at y=3, so down to (2,3)? No: from (2,4) to (2,3) is down, but (2,3) is at y=3, x=2.\n> \n> Then from (2,3) to (3,3) — right to x=3.\n> \n> Then (3,3) to (4,3) — right to x=4.\n> \n> Then (4,3) to (4,4) — up to y=4.\n> \n> Then (4,4) to (3,4) — left to x=3.\n> \n> Then (3,4) to (3,5) — up to y=5?

But I need to check if it's safe.\n> - Down (D): to (5,1) — y=1, not wall, but is it occupied? Snake positions: let's see if (5,1) is in the list. Snake has (5,2), (4,2), etc., no (5,1), so it should be free, but y=1 is not border? Borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is inside, but walls are only borders and (4,6), so (5,1) should be empty.\n> - Left (L): to (4,2) — but (4,2) is the second segment of the snake, so body collision? But the tail might move, so I need to see if it's safe.\n> \n> Movement rules: I cannot move into a body segment unless it's the tail and the tail will move. But here, (4,2) is not the tail; tail is at (3,5). So moving left to (4,2) would collide with body.\n> \n> Similarly, right (R): to (6,2) — x=6, y=2. Borders: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=6 is not wall, and (6,2) not in snake positions? Snake has x from 1 to 5, y from 2 to 5, so (6,2) should be free.\n> \n> Down (D) to (5,1): y=1, not wall, not in snake, so free.\n> \n> Up (U) to (5,3): has food, but is it safe? (5,3) is a food cell, and snake can eat if head moves there, but only if the cell is free when head arrives. But (5,3) is not occupied by snake body? Let's check snake positions: positions are (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5). (5,3) is not in this list, so it should be free, except for food. Food is on the cell, but the cell is not occupied by snake, so moving to (5,3) should eat the food.\n> \n> But there's a rule about tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here tail is at (3,5), head at (5,2), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (5,2) and (3,5) are not adjacent; they are far apart. So no issue.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: current direction R, so I cannot move left (L) because that would be opposite. So from current position, possible moves: U, D, R. L is invalid because it's reverse and also leads to body.\n> \n> So options for turn 73:\n> - U to (5,3): eat food, but need to see consequences.\n> - D to (5,1): empty cell.\n> - R to (6,2): empty cell.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> First, if I go U to (5,3) on turn 73:\n> - I eat the food at (5,3), which has life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 77, but I eat it now on turn 73, so it's gone.\n> - Snake grows by one segment, so new head position (5,3), and tail stays where it is? No, when snake eats, it grows, so the tail doesn't move immediately. When you eat food, the snake grows, so on the next move, the tail doesn't advance, so the snake gets longer.\n> \n> Mechanics: when head moves to a food cell, it eats it, and the snake grows. So the segment is added immediately, but the tail doesn't move on that turn. So positions: after eating, head is at (5,3), and the previous head (5,2) becomes part of body, so the new segment is added at the head position? No.\n> \n> Standard Snake: when head moves to food, it eats, and on that turn, the head moves to food, but the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one. Then on subsequent turns, when moving, the tail moves forward.\n> \n> In terms of positions: on turn 73, if head moves to (5,3) and eats, then the snake positions become: head at (5,3), then the previous positions from index 1 to end, but since it grows, the body includes all previous, and no tail movement, so positions: [(5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), ..., (3,5)] and since it grew, the tail is still (3,5), but now the snake has 17 segments.\n> \n> Then on next turn, when I move, the tail will move according to the path.\n> \n> Similarly for other moves.\n> \n> Now, after moving U to (5,3), head at (5,3), direction now U? I need to set new direction.\n> \n> Direction is based on the move, I think.\n> \n> Now, from there, I need to plan future moves.\n> \n> But let's see the other food.\n> \n> Food at (3,6) and (5,5).\n> \n> (3,6): x=3,y=6. Is this accessible? y=6, and there's a wall at (4,6), so (3,6) is adjacent, but not blocked directly. But (4,6) is obstacle, so I can go to (3,6) from left or above/below.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5): x=5,y=5.\n> \n> Current head at (5,2), so (5,5) is directly above, at distance 3 in y-direction.\n> \n> Life spans: (5,3) life 5, disappears after turn 77? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 73, life span 5, so it has 5 turns left, meaning it disappears at the end of turn 77? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically, \"disappears after N turns\" with countdown decreasing each turn. So if life span is L at turn t, it will be gone at turn t + L - 1 or something.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (5,3) with life_span=5 at turn 73:\n> - Turn 73: countdown=5\n> - Turn 74: countdown=4\n> - ...\n> - Turn 77: countdown=1? Then after turn 77, it disappears, so available until turn 77 inclusive? I think so.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) life_span=7: available until turn 73+6=79? Countdown from 7 at turn 73:\n> - T73: 7\n> - T74: 6\n> - ...\n> - T79: 1, so after T79, gone? T79 is turn 79, countdown=1, so on turn 80 it would be gone, but since it decreases on the turn, it should be available up to turn 79 if life_span=7 at t=73.\n> \n> Let's define: if life_span L at turn t, it is present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at the start of turn t+L or something. But to be safe, since it says \"disappears after N turns\", and N decreases each turn including current, I think at turn t with L, it can be eaten on turns t to t+L-1.\n> \n> For example, L=5 at t=73: can be eaten on turns 73,74,75,76,77. On turn 78, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, L=7 at t=73: eaten on 73 to 79.\n> \n> L=10 at t=73: eaten on 73 to 82.\n> \n> In this case, for (5,3), I can eat it now on turn 73, or later up to turn 77.\n> \n> But if I don't eat it now, it might be riskier or I might not get another chance.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, back to turn 73 options.\n> \n> Option 1: Move U to (5,3) - eat food immediately.\n> \n> Then head at (5,3), direction U.\n> \n> From there, possible moves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2) but (5,2) is now body (since after move, (5,2) is the second segment), so moving down would be reverse? Current direction after move is U, so down D is opposite, so invalid? No instant reverse rule.\n> \n> After moving U, direction is U, so I cannot move D next turn.\n> \n> Similarly, L to (4,3), R to (6,3).\n> \n> (4,3): is it occupied? After moving to (5,3), snake positions: head (5,3), then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), ..., (3,5). (4,3) is in the list, it's a body segment. (4,3) is the 13th position or something? Positions: index 0: head (5,3), index 1: (5,2), index 2: (4,2), index 3: (3,2), ..., let's find (4,3).\n> \n> From the list: (5,3) new head, then (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), then (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5).\n> \n> (3,3) is there, then (4,3), which is the 13th segment or something.

At t73, life span 7, so on t75, it has 5 turns left (73:7, 74:6, 75:5, etc.), so I have until t79 to eat it.\n> \n> But if I go to (5,5) on t75, then on t76 I can go L to (4,5), t77 to (3,5), t78 to (3,6) to eat on t78.\n> \n> t78 is within life span, since disappears after t79, so can eat on t78.\n> \n> But let's see if (3,6) is accessible.\n> \n> Also, after eating, the snake is longer, so I need space to move.\n> \n> But first, let's consider other options for turn 73.\n> \n> If on turn 73 I don't go U, but go R to (6,2).\n> \n> Then head at (6,2), direction R.\n> \n> From there, possible moves: U to (6,3), D to (6,1), R to (7,2) but x=7 is wall, so invalid.

It's turn 74, and the grid has walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and one internal obstacle at (4,6). The snake positions are given in order from head to tail: head is at (5,3), then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), and tail at (3,5). The head direction is Up (U).\n> \n> Food items: one at (3,6) with life span 6 and value +1, and another at (5,5) with life span 9 and value +1. Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid. It's 8x8 since borders are x=0 to 7 and y=0 to 7, so cells from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (4,6) means that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake head at (5,3), moving Up. So from (5,3), moving Up would go to (5,4), but let's see the current direction is U, so it was moving up to get to (5,3)? Positions: head is at (5,3), and previous was (5,2) since positions are head first. Snake positions: [(5,3), (5,2), ...] so head at (5,3), and it came from (5,2), which is down, but direction is given as U. Direction is \"Snake Head Direction: U\", which means the current movement direction is Up. But from the positions, head is at (5,3) and before that at (5,2), so if it was at (5,2) and moved to (5,3), that would be moving Up, from (5,2) to (5,3) is +y, so Up, yes. So current direction is Up, so it just moved up to (5,3).\n> \n> Now, from (5,3), possible moves: Up to (5,4), Down to (5,2), Left to (4,3), Right to (6,3).\n> \n> But Down to (5,2) is the body segment, specifically the second segment. (5,2) is occupied by the snake body, so moving Down would collide with body, which is deadly. So Down is not possible.\n> \n> Also, cannot move opposite to current direction immediately. Current direction is Up, so opposite is Down. Since Down is not possible anyway, but the rule is no instant reverse, so even if it were empty, it might not be allowed, but here it's occupied, so definitely not.\n> \n> Now, walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so moving Right to (6,3): x=6, y=3, is that within bounds? Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, I think, since borders are walls.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7 are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Similarly, internal obstacle (4,6) is wall.\n> \n> So for (6,3): x=6, y=3, y=3 is not 0 or 7, x=6 is not 0 or 7? x=7 is wall, but x=6 is not x=7, so (6,3) should be free, but let's confirm.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are free, except for obstacles. Similarly y=1 to y=6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (4,6), which is x=4,y=6.\n> \n> So (6,3): x=6, y=3, not a wall, and not occupied by snake except possibly.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake: (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5)\n> \n> (3,5) is the tail.\n> \n> Also, food at (3,6) and (5,5).\n> \n> (3,6): x=3,y=6, which is not a wall? y=6 is not y=0 or y=7? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is not wall, but internal obstacle at (4,6), which is different.\n> \n> (4,6) is obstacle, (3,6) is not listed as wall, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) is free.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from head (5,3):\n> \n> - Up: to (5,4). Is this free? (5,4) is not in snake positions? Snake has (5,3), (5,2), but not (5,4). Positions: (5,3), (5,2), then (4,2), etc. No (5,4), so (5,4) should be empty. Also not wall.\n> \n> - Down: to (5,2). But (5,2) is the second segment of snake, so collision, deadly. Not possible.\n> \n> - Left: to (4,3). (4,3) is in snake positions? Snake has (4,3) as the 14th segment? List: index 0: (5,3) head, 1: (5,2), 2: (4,2), 3: (3,2), 4: (2,2), 5: (1,2), 6: (1,3), 7: (1,4), 8: (1,5), 9: (2,5), 10: (2,4), 11: (2,3), 12: (3,3), 13: (4,3), 14: (4,4), 15: (3,4), 16: (3,5) tail.\n> \n> So (4,3) is position 13, which is a body segment, not the head. So moving to (4,3) would be collision with body. Deadly. Not possible.\n> \n> - Right: to (6,3). (6,3) not in snake positions? Snake positions: all have x from 1 to 5, y from 2 to 5 except (1,2) etc., but (6,3) not listed, so should be free. Also, not wall, since x=6 <7, y=3>0.\n> \n> x=6 is not border wall, border walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is playable.\n> \n> So possible moves: Up to (5,4) or Right to (6,3). Down and Left are impossible due to collision.\n> \n> Also, cannot move opposite, but Down is opposite and impossible anyway.\n> \n> So choices: U or R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food.\n> \n> Food at (3,6) with life span 6, value +1. It will disappear after 6 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so on turn 74, life span 6, so it will be there for 6 more turns? Let's see the rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So on turn 74, life span is 6, meaning after 6 turns, on turn 80, it will disappear? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 74, life span 6, after turn 74, it becomes 5, then 4, etc., down to 0. When life span reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or something?\n> \n> The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"Disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> I think it means that when the countdown reaches 0, it disappears. Since it decreases every turn including current, on the turn it is spawned, life span N, after that turn it becomes N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and then it disappears.\n> \n> For this food at (3,6), life span 6 on turn 74. So:\n> \n> - Turn 74: life span 6\n> \n> - Turn 75: life span 5\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 79: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 80: life span 0, disappears after this turn? Or during?\n> \n> Typically, it might disappear at the end of the turn when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> But for planning, we can assume it's available until turn 79 inclusive, and disappears on turn 80.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (5,5) life span 9 on turn 74:\n> \n> - Turn 74: 9\n> \n> - Turn 75: 8\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 82: 1\n> \n> - Turn 83: 0, disappears.\n> \n> Now, both foods are positive, so we want to eat them if possible without risk.\n> \n> But there's a special case: tail reward danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, where is the tail? Tail is at (3,5).\n> \n> Head at (5,3), tail at (3,5), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (5,3) and (3,5) are not adjacent; distance |5-3| + |3-5| = 2+2=4, not 1. So no issue now.\n> \n> But after moves, it might be.\n> \n> Now, let's plan possible sequences.\n> \n> First, from (5,3), I can go Up to (5,4) or Right to (6,3).\n> \n> Case 1: Move Up to (5,4) on turn 74.\n> \n> Then head at (5,4), direction Up.\n> \n> From there, possible moves: Up to (5,5), but (5,5) has food, but let's see. (5,5) is food position, but is it occupied? Food can be eaten only if head moves onto it, and body is not there or moves away.\n> \n> Currently, (5,5) has food, not occupied by snake, so moving to (5,5) would eat it.\n> \n> But after eating, snake grows, so length increases by one.\n> \n> Now, from (5,4), moving Up to (5,5) is possible, since no wall, not occupied.\n> \n> Other moves: Down to (5,3), but (5,3) is now the second segment? After moving to (5,4), the snake positions: head was at (5,3), moved to (5,4), so new head at (5,4), and the body: the previous head (5,3) becomes part of body, and tail moves or stays? When snake moves without eating, the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when moving to a new cell, if no food, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, tail is removed.\n> \n> If food eaten, head moves to food, body segments follow, but tail does not move, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, if we move to (5,4) on turn 74, no food there, so snake moves: head to (5,4), then body: the segment that was at (5,2) moves to (5,3), which was head position, but let's trace.\n> \n> Current positions before move: head (5,3), then (5,2), (4,2), etc. to tail (3,5).\n> \n> After moving head to (5,4): new head at (5,4). Then the first body segment, which was at (5,2), moves to where head was, (5,3). Then the segment at (4,2) moves to (5,2)? No.\n> \n> The body segments follow: the segment that was at position i moves to position i-1.\n> \n> After head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So positions: before move, indices: 0: (5,3), 1: (5,2), 2: (4,2), 3: (3,2), ..., 16: (3,5)\n> \n> After moving head to (5,4), new head at (5,4). Then segment 1 moves to where segment 0 was, (5,3). Segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (5,2). Segment 3 moves to where segment 2 was, (4,2). And so on, up to segment 16 moves to where segment 15 was? Segment 15 is (3,4), segment 16 is (3,5) tail.\n> \n> Segment 16 moves to where segment 15 was, (3,4). And segment 15 was at (3,4), but it moves to where segment 14 was? Let's not confuse.\n> \n> After head move, the tail is removed, so the snake shortens if no food eaten.\n> \n> Since no food at (5,4), after moving to (5,4), the new positions: head at (5,4), then the body: segment that was at index 0 is now head, but index 1 moves to index 0's position (5,3), index 2 moves to index 1's position (5,2), index 3 moves to index 2's position (4,2), ..., and the last segment, index 16 at (3,5), is removed since tail moves forward.\n> \n> So new tail is where index 15 was, which is (3,4)? Index 15 is (3,4), but after move, index 15 moves to where index 14 was?

Let me confirm.\n> \n> The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6). But there's also an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,4), and direction is Up (U). So moving up increases y, I assume? Typically in grids, y increases upwards or downwards? The movement says U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), so U means increasing y, so y-axis points up? Let's see: U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up. D is (x,y-1), so y decreases when going down.

Head at (5,4), then (5,3) which is down, but direction is U, which is confusing. Direction is the current moving direction. So at turn 75, head is at (5,4) and it's moving Up, so next move would be to (5,5) if it continues.\n> \n> But the positions show (5,4) then (5,3), which is below, so the head moved to (5,4) from (5,3) on previous turn? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Snake positions are listed head first, so (5,4) is head, then body: (5,3), (5,2), etc. Since it was moving Up to reach (5,4), that means from (5,3) to (5,4), which is up, so y increased.\n> \n> Now, direction is U, so for next move, if it continues U, it goes to (5,5).\n> \n> But let's see the body: after (5,2), it goes to (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4).

Life span decreases every turn including current, so on turn 75, life_span=5, after turn 75, it becomes 4, and so on, until life_span=0, it disappears. So it will be gone after turn 79, since turn 75:5, 76:4, 77:3, 78:2, 79:1, turn 80:0, so gone at start of turn 80 or end? Probably at the end of the turn when life_span reaches 0.\n> \n> The rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, with life_span L, after turn t, it becomes L-1.

From positions, (5,3) is the second segment, directly behind head. So if head moves to (5,3), but (5,3) is currently occupied by the body, and since it's not the tail (tail is (3,4)), it will cause collision, because that segment doesn't move away immediately; the tail moves only after the head moves.\n> \n> When head moves, if it moves to a cell not occupied, body follows, tail leaves. If head moves to tail position, tail moves away, so head is ok.\n> \n> But here, (5,3) is not tail; tail is (3,4).

Current turn 76, so it has 4 turns left: 76,77,78,79. After turn 79, it disappears, so must be eaten on or before turn 79.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) life span 7, so disappears after turn 82 (76+6? Let's calculate: life span N means it disappears after N turns, including current, so if life span L, it can be eaten on turns t where t <= t1 + L - 1? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, including current turn. So on turn t1, life span decreases to N-1, and so on, until turn t1 + N - 1 it has life span 1, then after that turn, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns from t1 to t1 + N - 1 inclusive.\n> \n> For (3,6): life span 4, current turn 76, so can be eaten on turns 76,77,78,79.

Snake positions: (6,5) will be new head, but body is still at (6,4) which will be neck, etc. When I move to (6,5), the tail moves, so the cell (4,4) is freed if no food eaten, but since no food eaten, snake moves, tail end is removed.\n> \n> General snake movement: when moving, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the next position, tail cell is vacated unless food eaten.\n> \n> But here, no food at (6,5), so moving to (6,5), head now at (6,5), neck at (6,4), and tail at (4,4) is removed, so (4,4) is free now.\n> \n> Cells: (6,5) is new head, (6,4) is now body, (5,4) is body, and so on, down to (4,3) or something, but tail was (4,4), which is removed, so positions update.\n> \n> But for collision, we care about where the body will be after the move.\n> \n> After moving U to (6,5), snake positions: head (6,5), then (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3). (4,4) is gone, so 16 segments now? Original 17 positions, after move without eating, length same, so 17 segments but tail moves.\n> \n> Positions: new head at (6,5), then the previous head (6,4) becomes second segment, and so on, up to the previous segment before tail, and tail (4,4) is removed, so the new snake is positions 0 to 16 except the last one is removed, but indices shift.\n> \n> Easier: snake was [ (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), ..., (4,3), (4,4) ] 17 elements.\n> \n> After moving to (6,5) without eating, new positions: head (6,5), then the rest of the body minus tail: so [ (6,5) ] + [ (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) ] and (4,4) is removed. So 16 segments? Original 17 positions, after move, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position, so the last position (tail) is vacated. So new positions: new head at (6,5), then the first body segment at (6,4), then (5,4), (5,3), ..., up to (4,3), and (4,4) is gone. So the body segments from index 1 to 16 of original become the new body, but index 1 was (5,4), which is now second segment, and the last body segment is original index 15 (4,3), and original tail (4,4) index 16 is removed.\n> \n> Original positions: index 0: (6,4) head, 1: (5,4), 2: (5,3), 3: (5,2), 4: (4,2), 5: (3,2), 6: (2,2), 7: (1,2), 8: (1,3), 9: (1,4), 10: (1,5), 11: (2,5), 12: (2,4), 13: (2,3), 14: (3,3), 15: (4,3), 16: (4,4) tail.\n> \n> After moving U to (6,5): new head (6,5), then body: (6,4) [prev head], (5,4) [prev index 1], (5,3) [prev 2], (5,2) [3], (4,2) [4], (3,2) [5], (2,2) [6], (1,2) [7], (1,3) [8], (1,4) [9], (1,5) [10], (2,5) [11], (2,4) [12], (2,3) [13], (3,3) [14], (4,3) [15].

Current head direction is U, but after move, new direction is what I choose.\n> \n> The snake head direction for next turn depends on the move I make.\n> \n> Now, food considerations.\n> \n> First, food at (5,5) has life span 6, so it will be around for a while, but it's close.\n> \n> Food at (3,6) has only life span 3, so it might disappear soon if not eaten.\n> \n> Food at (2,5) has life span 9, plenty of time.\n> \n> But (2,5) is also a snake position? Snake positions: (1,5) is there, and (2,5) is also in the list. Look: positions include (1,5) and (2,5). (1,5) is index 11, and (2,5) is index 12? Let's index:\n> \n> 0: (6,5) head\n> \n> 1: (6,4)\n> \n> 2: (5,4)\n> \n> 3: (5,3)\n> \n> 4: (5,2)\n> \n> 5: (4,2)\n> \n> 6: (3,2)\n> \n> 7: (2,2)\n> \n> 8: (1,2)\n> \n> 9: (1,3)\n> \n> 10: (1,4)\n> \n> 11: (1,5)\n> \n> 12: (2,5)\n> \n> 13: (2,4)\n> \n> 14: (2,3)\n> \n> 15: (3,3)\n> \n> 16: (4,3) tail\n> \n> So (2,5) is position 12, which is part of the body, not head or tail.\n> \n> But food is at (2,5), and it's occupied by the snake body.

So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> - Snake Positions: The snake has 17 segments. Head is at (6,6), and the direction is Up (U). The tail is at (3,3), I think? Let me list the positions to understand the body:\n> - Head: (6,6)\n> - Next: (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3) — that's 17 segments, yes.\n> - Food Items:\n> - (3,6) with value 1, life span 2 (so it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is 2 at turn 78, it will be gone after turn 79? Let me confirm.\n> - Life span: Disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn 78, life span 2 means it will disappear after turn 79 (since after this turn, life span becomes 1, and after next turn, it becomes 0 and disappears). Similarly, for others.\n> - (3,6): value 1, life span 2 — so available for this turn and next turn (turn 78 and 79).\n> - (5,5): value 1, life span 5 — available for 5 more turns (turns 78 to 82).\n> - (2,5): value 1, life span 8 — available for 8 more turns (turns 78 to 85).\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive food, no negative food mentioned. That simplifies things; I don't have to worry about penalties.\n> \n> **Current Snake Head:** (6,6), direction Up. So from (6,6), moving Up would go to (6,7), but y=7 is a wall, so that's invalid. Let me think about possible moves.\n> \n> **Possible Directions from (6,6):**\n> - Up (U): (6,7) — but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> - Down (D): (6,5) — but (6,5) is occupied by the snake's body? Snake positions: head is (6,6), then (6,5) is the second segment. So moving down to (6,5) would cause a collision with the body, which is deadly. So Down is invalid.\n> - Left (L): (5,6) — is this free? Let's see: walls? x=0 to x=7, y=0 to y=7, internal obstacle at (4,6). (5,6) is not listed as wall or obstacle, so it should be free. Snake positions: is (5,6) occupied? From the list: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), etc. No (5,6), so it should be empty.\n> - Right (R): (7,6) — x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move from current position is Left to (5,6)?

(4,6) is an obstacle, but (5,6) is different.\n> \n> Also, direction constraint: current head direction is Up. But movement is based on grid, not direction, but there's \"no instant reverse\" rule.\n> \n> **No instant reverse:** Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is Up, so opposite is Down. Down is invalid anyway, but for other moves, it should be fine as long as not opposite.\n> \n> Current direction: Up. Possible moves: Up is invalid (wall), Down is invalid (body), Left and Right? Left to (5,6), Right to (7,6) invalid wall. So only Left is possible? But (5,6) seems free.\n> \n> But let's think: from (6,6), moving Left decreases x by 1, so (5,6). Yes.\n> \n> But is there any food or something? I need to plan multiple turns.\n> \n> First, I must choose an action for turn 78. Since only Left seems possible, is that right?\n> \n> What about the tail? The tail is at (3,3), and it will move when I move, but since I'm moving, the snake will advance.\n> \n> When I move, the head goes to a new position, and the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail might become free.\n> \n> But in this case, for turn 78, from (6,6), only Left to (5,6) is possible? Let me double-check.\n> \n> - Up: (6,7) - y=7 wall, invalid.\n> - Down: (6,5) - occupied by body segment (6,5), which is the second position. Since head is moving to it, and body is there, it's collision. So yes, invalid.\n> - Left: (5,6) - not occupied, not wall (walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (4,6) is obstacle, so (5,6) is free.\n> - Right: (7,6) - x=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only Left is possible for turn 78. But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Current head direction is Up, but I'm moving Left, which is not opposite, so it should be fine. No instant reverse only prevents moving opposite, like if moving right, can't move left next, etc. Here, from Up, moving Left is perpendicular, so ok.\n> \n> So for turn 78, I think I have to move Left to (5,6).\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid. Grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), so (5,6) is within bounds, not wall except borders.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (4,6), which is different from (5,6).\n> \n> So action for turn 78: L to (5,6).\n> \n> Now, after moving, new head position is (5,6), and the tail will move. Current tail is (3,3), so after move, the last segment (3,3) will be removed, and new head added at (5,6), so body segments shift.\n> \n> New snake positions: head (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) — and (3,3) is gone?

Positions: new head (5,6), then previous head (6,6) becomes first body, then (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), ..., up to (2,4), (2,3), and (3,3) is gone, so the last body segment is now (2,3), which was index 15.\n> \n> After move: head: (5,6), body: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)] — that's 16 segments? Original 17 segments, after move, length unchanged since no food eaten, so snake should have 17 segments still? No.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, tail moves off, so length remains same, number of segments decreases? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you move, if no food, head goes to new cell, tail cell is vacated, so snake has same number of segments, but positions shift.\n> \n> In terms of positions: new head position, then the previous positions except the tail is removed.\n> \n> So from list of positions: new head at (5,6), then the first N-1 positions of old, but without the last one.\n> \n> Old positions: 17 positions. After move, new positions: [ (5,6) ] + [ old positions 0 to 15 ]? Old position 0 is head (6,6), which becomes first body segment.\n> \n> Better to think: the new head is at the new position, then the old head becomes the first body segment, old segment 1 becomes segment 2, ..., up to old segment 15 becomes the new last body segment, and old tail (segment 16) is removed.\n> \n> Old segments: index 0: head (6,6), 1: (6,5), 2: (6,4), 3: (5,4), 4: (5,3), 5: (5,2), 6: (4,2), 7: (3,2), 8: (2,2), 9: (1,2), 10: (1,3), 11: (1,4), 12: (1,5), 13: (2,5), 14: (2,4), 15: (2,3), 16: (3,3) tail.\n> \n> After moving to (5,6), new head is (5,6), then new segment 1: old head (6,6), segment 2: old segment 1 (6,5), segment 3: old segment 2 (6,4), ..., up to segment 16: old segment 15 (2,3), and old segment 16 (3,3) is removed. So new positions: head (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3). That's 17 positions: from 0 to 16.\n> \n> (2,3) is the new tail.\n> \n> Now, for turn 79, head is at (5,6), direction: since I moved Left, the new head direction is Left? The head direction is based on the move, I think. In the state, it's given, but after move, it updates.\n> \n> For planning, at turn 79, head at (5,6), and I can choose next move.\n> \n> But first, for turn 78, I have to move Left, as it's the only choice.\n> \n> But is there food at (5,6)? Food positions: (3,6), (5,5), (2,5). (5,6) is not food, so no eating, length unchanged.\n> \n> Life span of food decreases: at turn 78, all food life span decrease by 1? The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", but when does it decrease? At the end of the turn or beginning?\n> \n> Typically, life span decreases at the start of the turn or end?

Old snake has 18 segments (after eating at turn 79). When moving without eating, head moves to new cell, tail cell is vacated, so the new snake has head at new position, and the body from old head to the segment before tail, so one less segment? No.\n> \n> Example: suppose snake length 2: head A, tail B. Move to C, no food: new head C, new tail A (since B is removed). So positions: C, A — still 2 segments.\n> \n> Similarly, here: after turn 79, 18 segments. Move to (4,5) no food, new head (4,5), new body: old head (5,5) becomes first body, old body segments except the last one, so from old index 0 to 16: (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4) — that's 17 positions, and old tail (2,3) removed.

Also, there's food at (3,6) with life span 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. But to eat it, I need to move to (3,6). But from (5,6), moving to (3,6) directly isn't possible; I have to move step by step.\n> \n> Current position (5,6), (3,6) is two cells left, but I can't move left to (4,6) because it's a wall. So I can't reach (3,6) this turn; it's impossible. (3,6) is at x=3,y=6, and to get there, I'd need to go through (4,6), but (4,6) is wall, so (3,6) is unreachable this turn. Since life span is 1, it will disappear after turn 79, so I can't eat it anyway. So I should ignore (3,6) food; it's not achievable.\n> \n> Now, other foods: (5,5) down, which I can reach this turn by moving down.\n> \n> (2,5) with life span 7, and (1,1) with life span 10.\n> \n> But first, I need to plan the sequence.\n> \n> Since only D is possible, I must move down to (5,5) this turn.\n> \n> After moving, snake head will be at (5,5), and since I eat food, the tail doesn't move, so the new position: head at (5,5), then the previous head (5,6) becomes body, so snake becomes: [(5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)] but (2,5) and (2,4) are body segments? Let's list the positions after move.\n> \n> Current positions before move: head (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)\n> \n> After moving down to (5,5):\n> \n> - New head: (5,5)\n> \n> - Then the body: since food eaten, tail stays, so the segment that was at (2,3) remains, and all segments shift, but the last segment stays because of growth.\n> \n> When snake eats food, it grows, so the tail doesn't move. So new positions:\n> \n> Head moves to (5,5)\n> \n> Then the first body segment is the previous head: (5,6)\n> \n> Then (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) and the tail (2,3) stays, so now there are 18 segments.\n> \n> Length was 17, after eating, length 18.\n> \n> The positions: index 0: (5,5), 1: (5,6), 2: (6,6), 3: (6,5), 4: (6,4), 5: (5,4), 6: (5,3), 7: (5,2), 8: (4,2), 9: (3,2), 10: (2,2), 11: (1,2), 12: (1,3), 13: (1,4), 14: (1,5), 15: (2,5), 16: (2,4), 17: (2,3)\n> \n> (2,5) is a body segment, but there is food at (2,5) with value 1. But (2,5) is currently occupied by the snake body? In the food list, (2,5) has food, but in snake positions, (2,5) is the 15th segment? Let's see positions: before move, (2,5) is in the list as the 14th position? Positions: index 0: head (5,6), 1: (6,6), 2: (6,5), 3: (6,4), 4: (5,4), 5: (5,3), 6: (5,2), 7: (4,2), 8: (3,2), 9: (2,2), 10: (1,2), 11: (1,3), 12: (1,4), 13: (1,5), 14: (2,5), 15: (2,4), 16: (2,3) — so (2,5) is index 14, which is a body segment.\n> \n> Food at (2,5) is under the snake body. According to rules, food under body can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> After moving down to (5,5), the snake body shifts. The segment at (2,5) will move to where? After growth, the tail stays, but since we ate food, tail doesn't move, so (2,5) remains occupied? Let's clarify.\n> \n> After moving to (5,5) and eating food:\n> \n> - New head: (5,5)\n> \n> - Body: previous head (5,6) is now segment 1\n> \n> - Then (6,6) segment 2\n> \n> - (6,5) segment 3\n> \n> - (6,4) segment 4\n> \n> - (5,4) segment 5\n> \n> - (5,3) segment 6\n> \n> - (5,2) segment 7\n> \n> - (4,2) segment 8\n> \n> - (3,2) segment 9\n> \n> - (2,2) segment 10\n> \n> - (1,2) segment 11\n> \n> - (1,3) segment 12\n> \n> - (1,4) segment 13\n> \n> - (1,5) segment 14\n> \n> - (2,5) segment 15? No, after growth, the segment that was at (2,3) is still there, and (2,5) is occupied.\n> \n> Positions after move: the body segments from before except the tail doesn't advance.\n> \n> Before move: segments S0: (5,6), S1: (6,6), S2: (6,5), S3: (6,4), S4: (5,4), S5: (5,3), S6: (5,2), S7: (4,2), S8: (3,2), S9: (2,2), S10: (1,2), S11: (1,3), S12: (1,4), S13: (1,5), S14: (2,5), S15: (2,4), S16: (2,3)\n> \n> After move down to (5,5) and eat food:\n> \n> - New S0: (5,5)  // new head\n> \n> - S1: old S0 = (5,6)\n> \n> - S2: old S1 = (6,6)\n> \n> - S3: old S2 = (6,5)\n> \n> - S4: old S3 = (6,4)\n> \n> - S5: old S4 = (5,4)\n> \n> - S6: old S5 = (5,3)\n> \n> - S7: old S6 = (5,2)\n> \n> - S8: old S7 = (4,2)\n> \n> - S9: old S8 = (3,2)\n> \n> - S10: old S9 = (2,2)\n> \n> - S11: old S10 = (1,2)\n> \n> - S12: old S11 = (1,3)\n> \n> - S13: old S12 = (1,4)\n> \n> - S14: old S13 = (1,5)\n> \n> - S15: old S14 = (2,5)\n> \n> - S16: old S15 = (2,4)\n> \n> - S17: old S16 = (2,3)  // tail stays, no move\n> \n> So (2,5) is now S15, occupied by snake body. Food at (2,5) is under the body, so it can't be eaten yet; the body needs to move away first.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods.\n> \n> Now, back to planning. This turn, turn 79, I must move down to (5,5) since it's the only choice, and eat the food there.\n> \n> Then, for turn 80, head is at (5,5), and head direction is now down (since I moved down).\n> \n> Current head direction after move: I moved down, so direction is D.\n> \n> From (5,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But no instant reverse, so since I just moved down, I can't move up immediately. So U is invalid.\n> \n> Possible: D (down to (5,4)?), L (left to (4,5)?), R (right to (6,5)?)\n> \n> Now, check walls and collisions.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7; internal (4,6). (5,4) is at x=5,y=4, not wall.\n> \n> (4,5) is x=4,y=5, not wall? Internal obstacle only at (4,6), so (4,5) should be ok.\n> \n> (6,5) is x=6,y=5, not wall.\n> \n> Also, check if moving to these cells causes collision.\n> \n> After turn 79, snake positions: head at (5,5), body at (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), etc.\n> \n> If I move down to (5,4): (5,4) is currently segment S5? After move, S5 is (5,4)? In the list above, after turn 79 move, S5 is (5,4)? Let's list positions again:\n> \n> After turn 79: snake: S0: (5,5), S1: (5,6), S2: (6,6), S3: (6,5), S4: (6,4), S5: (5,4), S6: (5,3), S7: (5,2), S8: (4,2), S9: (3,2), S10: (2,2), S11: (1,2), S12: (1,3), S13: (1,4), S14: (1,5), S15: (2,5), S16: (2,4), S17: (2,3)\n> \n> So (5,4) is S4? S4 is (6,4), S5 is (5,4) — yes.\n> \n> If I move down to (5,4), (5,4) is currently occupied by S5, which is a body segment. But S5 is not the tail; the tail is S17 at (2,3). When head moves to (5,4), it will be where S5 is, but S5 will have moved by then? No, in snake movement, when head moves, the body shifts.\n> \n> If I move down to (5,4) on turn 80:\n> \n> - New head: (5,4)\n> \n> - Then body: previous head (5,5) becomes S1\n> \n> - S1 (5,6) becomes S2\n> \n> - S2 (6,6) becomes S3\n> \n> - S3 (6,5) becomes S4\n> \n> - S4 (6,4) becomes S5\n> \n> - S5 (5,4) was here, but now head is moving to (5,4), so this cell will be occupied by new head, but S5 was here, and after move, S5 will be at the position of S4 or something. Let's think.\n> \n> Standard snake movement without eating: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it. But when no food, tail moves away.\n> \n> Here, since I didn't eat food on turn 80 (assuming no food at (5,4)), then tail moves.\n> \n> Positions before turn 80 move: S0:(5,5), S1:(5,6), S2:(6,6), S3:(6,5), S4:(6,4), S5:(5,4), S6:(5,3), ..., up to S17:(2,3)\n> \n> If I move down to (5,4), and if no food there, then:\n> \n> - New head: (5,4)\n> \n> - S1: old S0 = (5,5)\n> \n> - S2: old S1 = (5,6)\n> \n> - S3: old S2 = (6,6)\n> \n> - S4: old S3 = (6,5)\n> \n> - S5: old S4 = (6,4)\n> \n> - S6: old S5 = (5,4) but (5,4) is now the head, so S6 moves to where S5 was, which is (5,4), but head is there—confusion.\n> \n> When head moves to a cell, if it's not food, the body shifts, so the tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> Specifically, for cell (5,4): before move, it is occupied by S5.\n> \n> After move: head moves to (5,4), so S5 is no longer at (5,4); instead, new head is at (5,4). Then S5 moves to the next position.\n> \n> The segment that was S5 will move to where S6 was or something.\n> \n> Let's sequence:\n> \n> - After head move to (5,4), the new segment 0 is (5,4)\n> \n> - Then segment 1 is the old segment 0: (5,5)\n> \n> - Segment 2 is old segment 1: (5,6)\n> \n> - Segment 3 is old segment 2: (6,6)\n> \n> - Segment 4 is old segment 3: (6,5)\n> \n> - Segment 5 is old segment 4: (6,4)\n> \n> - Segment 6 is old segment 5: (5,4) — but (5,4) is now head, so segment 6 moves to where old segment 5 was, which is (5,4), but that's occupied? No.\n> \n> Old segment 5 was at (5,4). After head moves to (5,4), old segment 5 (which was at (5,4)) is no longer there; the head takes it. Then, when body shifts, segment 6 (which was at (5,3)) moves to the position of old segment 5, which is (5,4), but (5,4) is now occupied by head—this is a problem.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> In snake games, when the head moves to a new cell, if it's not food, the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is vacated.\n> \n> For example, before move, cells occupied: S0, S1, S2, ..., S17 at their positions.\n> \n> Head moves to new cell, say C.\n> \n> If C is not food, then the new snake is: head at C, then S0, S1, ..., S16 at their positions, but S17 is removed, so the tail cell is free.\n> \n> The body segments shift: new S0 = C (head)\n> \n> New S1 = old S0\n> \n> New S2 = old S1\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New S17 = old S16\n> \n> Old S17 is left, so that cell is free.\n> \n> In this case, for turn 80, if I move to (5,4), and (5,4) is not food (since we ate the food at (5,5) on turn 79, and no new food mentioned there), so (5,4) should be empty.\n> \n> In the positions, before turn 80 move, S5 is at (5,4), but that's a body segment, so (5,4) is occupied, so moving head to (5,4) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Yes, exactly. (5,4) is currently occupied by S5, so moving head there would mean head touches body, collision, death.\n> \n> Therefore, I cannot move down to (5,4) because it's occupied by the body.\n> \n> Similarly, for other moves.\n> \n> From (5,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: up to (5,6), but (5,6) is S1, body segment, so collision. Also, U is reverse of current direction D? Current direction after turn 79 move is D, so moving U would be reverse, not allowed. But even if allowed, collision.\n> \n> - D: down to (5,4), which is S5, body, collision.\n> \n> - L: left to (4,5)\n> \n> - R: right to (6,5)\n> \n> Now, (4,5): what is there? From positions, is it occupied? Positions: S0:(5,5), S1:(5,6), S2:(6,6), S3:(6,5), S4:(6,4), etc. (4,5) is not in the list, so should be empty? Let's check all: x from 1 to 6, y from 2 to 6, but (4,5) not listed, so empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) is S3, occupied.\n> \n> (6,5) is S3, body segment.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - Move L to (4,5): (4,5) not occupied, and not wall, so possible.\n> \n> - Move R to (6,5): (6,5) is S3, body segment, so collision if I move there.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move from (5,5) is left to (4,5).\n> \n> Head direction is D, moving left is not reverse; reverse would be U. L and R are perpendicular, so should be allowed.\n> \n> No instant reverse only for opposite direction. Opposite of D is U, so L and R are fine.\n> \n> So on turn 80, I must move left to (4,5).\n> \n> Now, (4,5) has no food, I assume, so no eating, tail moves.\n> \n> After move to (4,5):\n> \n> - New head: (4,5)\n> \n> - S1: old S0 = (5,5)\n> \n> - S2: old S1 = (5,6)\n> \n> - S3: old S2 = (6,6)\n> \n> - S4: old S3 = (6,5)\n> \n> - S5: old S4 = (6,4)\n> \n> - S6: old S5 = (5,4)\n> \n> - and so on, up to S17: old S16 = (2,4)  // old S16 was (2,4), but after shift, S17 is old S16.\n> \n> Old positions before move: S0:(5,5), S1:(5,6), S2:(6,6), S3:(6,5), S4:(6,4), S5:(5,4), S6:(5,3), S7:(5,2), S8:(4,2), S9:(3,2), S10:(2,2), S11:(1,2), S12:(1,3), S13:(1,4), S14:(1,5), S15:(2,5), S16:(2,4), S17:(2,3)\n> \n> After move to (4,5) no eat:\n> \n> - New S0: (4,5)\n> \n> - S1: old S0 = (5,5)\n> \n> - S2: old S1 = (5,6)\n> \n> - S3: old S2 = (6,6)\n> \n> - S4: old S3 = (6,5)\n> \n> - S5: old S4 = (6,4)\n> \n> - S6: old S5 = (5,4)\n> \n> - S7: old S6 = (5,3)\n> \n> - S8: old S7 = (5,2)\n> \n> - S9: old S8 = (4,2)\n> \n> - S10: old S9 = (3,2)\n> \n> - S11: old S10 = (2,2)\n> \n> - S12: old S11 = (1,2)\n> \n> - S13: old S12 = (1,3)\n> \n> - S14: old S13 = (1,4)\n> \n> - S15: old S14 = (1,5)\n> \n> - S16: old S15 = (2,5)\n> \n> - S17: old S16 = (2,4)  // tail, and old S17 (2,3) is vacated\n> \n> So now snake at turn 80: head (4,5), and body down to tail (2,4)\n> \n> Head direction now left (L), since I moved left.\n> \n> Now, for turn 81, from (4,5), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> No instant reverse, so cannot move right (opposite of L).\n> \n> So possible: U (up to (4,6)), D (down to (4,4)), L (left to (3,5))\n> \n> Now, check cells:\n> \n> - U to (4,6): but (4,6) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - D to (4,4): what is (4,4)?

Since food eaten, no segment is removed, so the new snake has one more segment: head at (2,5), then body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), ..., (1,5), and then (2,5) is head, so (1,5) is still there, and (2,5) head.\n> \n> The segment that was at (2,5) is now the head position, and since food eaten, no tail removed, so the previous tail segment is now part of the body, and a new segment is added at head, so length increases.\n> \n> Positions after eating: head at (2,5), then the first body segment is (3,5), then (4,5), and so on, up to (1,5), which was index 15 or something, and then since no tail removed, the last body segment is (1,5), and the tail is still (1,5)?

Collision only if head touches body, but tail is part of body, but since it's the tail, and head is not on it, it should be fine.\n> \n> The danger is when eating food on tail cell, and after growth, the head and tail are adjacent, but in this case, they are adjacent, but not colliding.

If we eat it by moving to (2,5), then after eating, head is at (2,5), and new tail is at (1,5), which is adjacent to head, but not colliding. However, the rule says \"the head and newly grown tail will collide\" — why?\n> \n> After growth, the head is at (2,5), and the tail is at (1,5), they are adjacent, but not on the same cell.

No.\n> \n> I think I need to clarify the growth.\n> \n> Assume that when head moves to a food cell, it consumes the food, and the snake grows by one segment. This means that during this move, the tail does not move; it stays in place. So the new snake has the head at the food cell, the body as before, and the tail remains, so length increases.\n> \n> For example:\n> \n> - Before move: head at A, tail at Z.\n> \n> - Move head to food cell F (which might be Z or other).\n> \n> - If F is not tail, then after move, head at F, body from A to Z, but since food eaten, no tail removed, so positions: F (head), A, B, C, ..., Z.\n> \n> - If F is the tail Z, then head moves to Z, eats food, no tail removed, so positions: Z (head), A, B, C, ..., Y, Z? But Z is now head, so the body is A to Y, and Z is head, but Z was tail, so the segment that was at Z is now head, and the previous segment Y becomes the new tail.\n> \n> In this case, before move, head at A, tail at Z.\n> \n> Move head to Z (which is tail and food).\n> \n> After: head at Z, then the previous head A becomes first body, then the rest up to the previous second-to-last segment, say Y, which is now tail.\n> \n> So positions: head at Z, body: A, B, C, ..., Y, with Y new tail.\n> \n> In the adjacent case: if head was adjacent to tail, meaning A adjacent to Z, then after move, head at Z, and new tail at Y.\n> \n> But Y and Z may or may not be adjacent; it depends on the snake shape.\n> \n> In our case, at turn 81, head at (3,5), tail at (2,5), so A = (3,5), Z = (2,5), adjacent.\n> \n> After moving to (2,5), head at (2,5), body includes (3,5), (4,5), etc., up to (1,5), which is new tail.\n> \n> (1,5) and (2,5) are adjacent, so head at (2,5) and tail at (1,5) are adjacent.\n> \n> But no collision; they are different cells.\n> \n> The rule says \"the head and newly grown tail will collide\" — but they are not colliding; they are adjacent.\n> \n> Perhaps it means that after growth, if the head and new tail are on the same cell, but that can't happen.\n> \n> I think there might be a miswording or misunderstanding.\n> \n> Perhaps \"collide\" means that in the next move, if the head moves towards the tail, it might hit, but it's not immediate death.\n> \n> The rule says \"eating it kills the snake\", so it must be immediate.\n> \n> Another possibility: when the head moves to the tail cell to eat the food, at the moment of move, the head and tail are on the same cell, causing collision.\n> \n> But according to the rules, moving to tail cell is allowed because the tail moves away, but when there is food, it's different.\n> \n> Rules: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" But when there is food on the tail cell, and you move to it, you eat the food, so the tail does not move away; it stays, but the head occupies it, so at that instant, if the tail is there, and head moves to it, before the tail moves, it might be considered collision.\n> \n> But the rules for food say: \"can only be eaten if the body moves away, and the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> For food under body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away first, then head moves on.\n> \n> In this case, for food on tail, when the tail moves away, the cell is vacated, then head can move to it to eat.\n> \n> But if head moves to it while tail is still there, it might not be eaten or cause collision.\n> \n> Let's read the special cases:\n> \n> \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can *only be eaten* if:\n> 1. The body moves away, *and*\n> 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> For the tail cell, when the snake moves, the tail moves away, vacating the cell, then if head moves to that cell later, it can eat if food is there.\n> \n> But in this case, at turn 81, if we move to (3,5), then at turn 82, the tail is at (2,5), and if we move to (2,5), but at that time, the tail will move to its next position, so the cell (2,5) is vacated when the tail moves.\n> \n> At turn 81, after move to (3,5), positions have tail at (2,5).\n> \n> Then at turn 82, when we move the head, say to (2,5), at the same time, the tail moves to the next position in the path. Since the tail was at (2,5), and the body was connected, the tail will move to where the second-to-last segment was or something.\n> \n> In the position list, at turn 81, the segment before tail is (1,5), so when the head moves, the tail will move to the position of the previous segment, which is (1,5) in this case.\n> \n> So when head moves to (2,5) at turn 82, the tail moves from (2,5) to (1,5), so the cell (2,5) is vacated at that turn, and head moves to it, so if food is there, it can be eaten.\n> \n> No collision.\n> \n> But the tail reward danger might be a different scenario.\n> \n> The rule says: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n> \n> In this case, before eating, head at (3,5) is adjacent to tail at (2,5), and tail cell has food.

        "score": 17,
        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\nFirst, let's summarize the current state at Turn 81:\n\n- **Grid Boundaries**: Playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, with walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n- **Snake Positions**: The snake's head is at (4,5), moving left (L). The body segments follow, ending with the tail at (2,4). The snake has 18 segments.\n- **Food**:\n  - (2,5): Value +1, Life span 6 (will disappear after Turn 86).\n  - (1,1): Value +1, Life span 8 (will disappear after Turn 88).\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 81\nThe snake is currently moving left (L). The possible moves without reversing (which would be right (R)) are:\n- **Left (L)**: (3,5)\n- **Up (U)**: (4,6) – blocked by internal obstacle at (4,6).\n- **Down (D)**: (4,4)\n\nSo, the valid immediate moves are **Left (L)** to (3,5) or **Down (D)** to (4,4).\n\n### Evaluating Move Left (L) to (3,5)\n1. **Immediate Move**: \n   - New head position: (3,5)\n   - Tail moves away from (2,4), so the new tail is (2,5), which now has food underneath it.\n2. **Next Turn (Turn 82)**:\n   - Head at (3,5), adjacent to tail at (2,5) with food.\n   - Cannot eat (2,5) directly because it's adjacent to the tail with food, which would cause a collision.\n   - Must move away: \n     - Up (U) to (3,6) – valid.\n     - Down (D) to (3,4) – valid.\n   - Choosing Up (U) to (3,6):\n     - At Turn 83, head at (3,6), can move Left (L) to (2,6).\n     - At Turn 84, from (2,6), can move Down (D) to (2,5) to eat the food safely (not adjacent to tail anymore).\n3. **Outcome**: \n   - Eats (2,5) at Turn 84.\n   - Then can proceed towards (1,1), but the path might be longer.\n\n### Evaluating Move Down (D) to (4,4)\n1. **Immediate Move**: \n   - New head position: (4,4)\n   - Tail moves away from (2,4), so the new tail is (2,5), which now has food underneath it.\n2. **Next Turn (Turn 82)**:\n   - Head at (4,4), not adjacent to tail at (2,5).\n   - Can move Left (L) to (3,4) to approach (2,5).\n3. **Subsequent Moves**:\n   - Turn 82: Left (L) to (3,4)\n   - Turn 83: Left (L) to (2,4)\n   - Turn 84: Up (U) to (2,5) to eat the food.\n4. **Outcome**: \n   - Eats (2,5) at Turn 84.\n   - Then can proceed towards (1,1) more directly by moving down the left column.\n\n### Comparing Both Options\n- **Move Left (L)**:\n  - Eats (2,5) at Turn 84.\n  - Path to (1,1) is less direct, might take longer.\n- **Move Down (D)**:\n  - Also eats (2,5) at Turn 84.\n  - Positions the snake closer to (1,1) early, making the path to (1,1) more straightforward.\n  - Seems more efficient for long-term score maximization.\n\n### Avoiding Tail-Reward Danger\nIn both options, after the initial move at Turn 81, the tail moves to (2,5) with food. The key is to ensure that when eating (2,5), the head is not adjacent to the tail to avoid collision. This is safely handled in both plans by moving away first if necessary.\n\n### Choosing the Optimal Move\nGiven that both options allow eating (2,5) by Turn 84, but moving Down (D) at Turn 81 positions the snake better for reaching (1,1), **Down (D)** is the better initial move.\n\n### Action Sequence\nBased on the above reasoning, the optimal sequence starting at Turn 81 is:\n\n1. **Turn 81**: Move Down (D) to (4,4).\n2. **Turn 82**: Move Left (L) to (3,4).\n3. **Turn 83**: Move Left (L) to (2,4).\n4. **Turn 84**: Move Up (U) to (2,5) to eat the food.\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake eats the time-sensitive food at (2,5) safely and positions itself well to reach (1,1) next.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{D}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 81 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(4, 6)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: L\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (2, 5, 6, 1)\n\t- (1, 1, 8, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 81 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 81. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (4,6).

That's 18 segments. Head direction is left (L), so it's moving towards decreasing x.\n> \n> Food: two pieces:\n> \n> - (2,5) with value 1 and life span 6. So, it will disappear after turn 81 + 6 = turn 87? Life span decreases each turn, including current. So at turn 81, life span is 6, meaning it has 6 turns left, including turn 81. After turn 81, life span becomes 5, and so on, until turn 86 it has life span 1, and after turn 86, it disappears. Let me confirm: life span N means it disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be there for L more turns, including turn t. So it disappears at the start of turn t + L or something? I need to be careful.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life span is N, then:\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown becomes N-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, N-2, ..., until after turn t + N - 1, it becomes 0, and disappears before turn t + N or after? Typically, it should be that at the end of turn t + N - 1, if not eaten, it disappears. But let's see the input: for food at (2,5), life span 6 at turn 81. So it will be available for turns 81,82,83,84,85,86, and disappear before turn 87. Similarly, the other food at (1,1) with life span 8, so available until turn 88.\n> \n> Food positions are given as (x,y, life_span, value). In the input: (2, 5, 6, 1) and (1, 1, 8, 1). Both have value 1, so both are positive food.

Also, (5,5) is occupied by the snake body, but we can move to tail if it moves, but since it's not the tail, it might be collision. Let's see snake positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (4,5), then (5,5) is the first body segment. If I move right to (5,5), that's directly into the body, which would cause collision because the body is there and won't move away immediately. Only the tail cell can be moved into because when head moves there, tail moves away, so no collision. But here (5,5) is not the tail; it's the segment right after head.\n> \n> Snake segments: index 0: head (4,5)\n> \n> Index 1: (5,5)\n> \n> Index 2: (5,6)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Index 17: (2,4) that's the tail.\n> \n> Tail is (2,4).

Let's see if any snake segment or wall. Walls are only borders and (4,6). (4,4) is not listed as wall, and not in snake positions? Snake positions: (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4). So (4,4) is not in the list, so free.\n> \n> - L: (3,5) – not in snake positions, not wall, so free.\n> \n> - R: (5,5) – occupied by snake body at index 1, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> Also, direction constraint: R is opposite, so invalid anyway.\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,5): D to (4,4) or L to (3,5).\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead to maximize score and survive.\n> \n> Food available: (2,5) with life span 6, value +1, and (1,1) with life span 8, value +1.\n> \n> (2,5) is actually occupied by the snake! Let's see: snake positions include (2,5). (2,5) is listed as the 16th segment? Positions: index 0: (4,5), 1:(5,5), 2:(5,6), 3:(6,6), 4:(6,5), 5:(6,4), 6:(5,4), 7:(5,3), 8:(5,2), 9:(4,2), 10:(3,2), 11:(2,2), 12:(1,2), 13:(1,3), 14:(1,4), 15:(1,5), 16:(2,5), 17:(2,4) tail.\n> \n> (2,5) is index 16, which is body, not tail. And food is at (2,5), but it's under the snake body.\n> \n> The rule says: food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> So currently, (2,5) has food, but it's covered by snake body. To eat it, we need the snake to move so that the body leaves (2,5), then head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) has food, which is free.\n> \n> Life span: (2,5) food has life span 6, so must be eaten within 6 turns, by turn 86. (1,1) has life span 8, by turn 88.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (4,5), and we need to plan 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Possible actions now: move D to (4,4) or L to (3,5).\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid for clarity.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so playable: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal wall at (4,6).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Let's list cells:\n> \n> Row y=6: x=1,2,3,4,5,6 but (4,6) wall, so snake: (5,6), (6,6)\n> \n> y=5: (4,5) head, (5,5), (6,5), (1,5), (2,5)\n> \n> y=4: (6,4), (5,4), (1,4), (2,4) tail\n> \n> y=3: (5,3), (1,3)\n> \n> y=2: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2)\n> \n> y=1: free except (1,1) has food\n> \n> Also, (1,1) food.\n> \n> Now head at (4,5).\n> \n> If I move L to (3,5), that's free.\n> \n> If I move D to (4,4), free.\n> \n> Now, need to think about eating food.\n> \n> First, (2,5) food is under body at (2,5), which is segment 16.

It's turn 82. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (4,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), and (4,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,4), then body segments: (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5). That's 18 segments. Let me count: starting from head: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5). That's 18 positions, so snake length is 18.\n> \n> Head direction is Down (D), which is decreasing y, since (x,y-1). Current head is (4,4), direction D, so moving down would go to (4,3).\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (2,5) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (4,4) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> (4,4) is the head position? Snake head is at (4,4), and there's food at (4,4). But according to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. Currently, the head is on (4,4), so if I move away and then back, I might eat it, but I need to be careful.\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, let's list all food:\n> \n> - Food at (2,5): value 1, life 5. But (2,5) is also the tail position? Snake positions end with (2,5), which is the tail. Let's see the snake positions: head (4,4), ..., ends with (2,5). So tail is at (2,5), and there's food at (2,5) with value 1.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (1,1) and at (4,4).\n> \n> Life spans: food at (2,5) has life 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 82, life span 5 means it will disappear after turn 86? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So if at turn t, life span is N, then:\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown becomes N-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, N-2, and so on, until after turn t + (N-1), countdown is 1, then after turn t + N, it disappears? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the start of turn t, if food has life span L, then after this turn, if not eaten, life span becomes L-1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or after?\n> \n> The rule: \"disappears after N turns\" – so after N turns from now, it's gone. Since countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t, with life span L, it will be present for L more turns? No.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, for example, at turn t, food has life span N. After turn t is executed (i.e., after the action for turn t), countdown decreases to N-1. Similarly, after turn t+1, to N-2, ..., after turn t + (N-1), countdown becomes 0, and it disappears. So it is present during turns t to t + N - 1, and disappears before turn t + N.\n> \n> In this case, for food at (2,5): at turn 82, life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 86. Present on turns 82,83,84,85, gone on turn 86.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) life span 7: present turns 82 to 88, gone turn 89.\n> \n> (4,4) life span 10: present turns 82 to 91, gone turn 92.\n> \n> Now, snake head direction is D (down), so from (4,4), possible moves: since direction is D, I can move D, L, or R, but not U (up, opposite).\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is D, so cannot move U (which would be up, increasing y).\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,4): down to (4,3), left to (3,4), right to (5,4). But I need to check walls and body collisions.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (4,3) is y=3, not 0, so ok. (3,4) x=3>0, (5,4) x=5<7, all within bounds.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (4,6), not relevant here.\n> \n> Now, body collisions: snake body segments: let's list all positions to avoid.\n> \n> Snake positions: (4,4) head, (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)\n> \n> Now, after moving, the tail will move, so I can move to the tail position if it's vacated.\n> \n> But for collision, when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by body except the tail, it collides. If it moves to the tail cell, it's ok because tail moves away.\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,4):\n> \n> - Down to (4,3): is (4,3) occupied? Snake positions: (5,3) is there, but (4,3) not listed. Positions: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), etc. (4,3) is not in the list, so free? Let's check: from (4,4) down to (4,3). (4,3) is not in the snake positions, so no body there. Also not wall. So safe.\n> \n> - Left to (3,4): (3,4) not in positions, positions have (3,2), but not (3,4), so free. Safe.\n> \n> - Right to (5,4): (5,4) is in positions? Snake has (5,4) as the 8th position? List: index 0: (4,4) head, 1: (4,5), 2: (5,5), 3: (5,6), 4: (6,6), 5: (6,5), 6: (6,4), 7: (5,4), 8: (5,3), etc. So (5,4) is position 7, which is a body segment. If I move right to (5,4), that is currently occupied by a body segment, not the tail. Tail is (2,5). Since (5,4) is not the tail, moving there would cause collision, because the body there doesn't move away instantly; the head moves first to the cell, and if it's occupied by body except tail, it dies.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So for (5,4), it's a body segment, not tail, so moving there would collide and die.\n> \n> Similarly, moving down to (4,3) or left to (3,4) should be safe, as those are free.\n> \n> (4,3): not in positions, free.\n> \n> (3,4): not in positions, free.\n> \n> (5,4): occupied by body, not tail, so collision.\n> \n> So possible actions: D or L, not R.\n> \n> Now, there is food at (4,4), which is under the head. To eat it, I need to move away and then back when it's exposed.\n> \n> But currently, I'm on it, so if I move away, the body might still be there or not.\n> \n> The food is at (4,4), and head is there, so when I move, the head leaves, but the next body segment is (4,5), which is above, so (4,4) might be occupied by the next body or not.\n> \n> After I move, the snake moves: head goes to new position, and each segment moves to the previous position of the one before it.\n> \n> So if I move down to (4,3), then new head is (4,3), and the segment that was at (4,4) becomes the new position for the second segment, but since head moved, the body follows.\n> \n> Current positions: let's denote: head: S0 = (4,4), S1 = (4,5), S2 = (5,5), S3 = (5,6), S4 = (6,6), S5 = (6,5), S6 = (6,4), S7 = (5,4), S8 = (5,3), S9 = (5,2), S10 = (4,2), S11 = (3,2), S12 = (2,2), S13 = (1,2), S14 = (1,3), S15 = (1,4), S16 = (1,5), S17 = (2,5) tail.\n> \n> If I move down to (4,3), new head is (4,3). Then S1 moves to S0 old position (4,4), S2 moves to S1 old (4,5), and so on, down to tail S17 moves to S16 old (1,5).\n> \n> So after move, (4,4) is now occupied by the segment that was S1, so the cell (4,4) has a body segment on it, not food anymore? The food is still there, but covered by the body.\n> \n> The food at (4,4) is under the snake, but to eat it, I need the head to move onto it when it's exposed, meaning no body on it.\n> \n> Currently, after moving down, (4,4) is occupied by S1, so not exposed.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move left to (3,4), new head (3,4), S1 moves to (4,4), so (4,4) still occupied.\n> \n> So the food at (4,4) is under a body segment now, not head.\n> \n> To eat it, I need to move such that the body moves away from (4,4), then head moves back.\n> \n> For example, if I move away, and later when (4,4) is free, I move head there.\n> \n> But it might take several moves.\n> \n> There is also food at (2,5), which is the current tail position.

It's turn 83, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, let's clarify.\n> \n> The border cells are walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6). So the snake can only move within x from 1 to 6 and y from 1 to 6, except where blocked by obstacles.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,4), then body: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). So the tail is at (1,5).\n> \n> Head direction is L, which means left, so the snake is moving left. Last move was to the left, so from (4,4) to (3,4)? Positions: head is (3,4), previous was (4,4), so it moved from (4,4) to (3,4), which is left, so direction L is consistent.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,5) with value 1 and life span 4\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1 and life span 6\n> \n> - (4,4) with value 1 and life span 9\n> \n> All food has value 1, so positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,5), life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if we don't eat it now, it has 3 more turns after this, I think. Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (2,5), life_span=4. At turn 83, countdown is 4. After turn 83, it decreases to 3, and so on, until it reaches 0, then disappears. So it will be gone after turn 86 (since turn 83:4, 84:3, 85:2, 86:1, 87:0 gone? But after N turns, so if life_span=N, it appears at turn t, disappears after turn t + N - 1? I need to clarify.\n> \n> Standard way: if life_span is N at turn t, it will disappear after N more turns, meaning it lasts for N turns including the current one. For example, at turn t, life_span=N, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears at the start of turn t+N or something. But the countdown decreases every turn.\n> \n> To be precise: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at the beginning of turn t, if life_span is S, during the turn, after the move, if head eats it, it's consumed. Then at the end of the turn, life_span decreases by 1. I think that's how it works.\n> \n> But for planning, we just need to know how many turns it will be available. For (2,5) at turn 83, life_span=4, so it will be available for 4 turns: turns 83, 84, 85, 86. After turn 86, it disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 86.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) life_span=6, available turns 83 to 88.\n> \n> (4,4) life_span=9, available turns 83 to 91.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (3,4), moving left. So possible moves from here: since direction is L, we can move L (continue left), U (up), or D (down), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is L, so cannot move R.\n> \n> So from (3,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - L to (2,4)\n> \n> - U to (3,5)\n> \n> - D to (3,3)\n> \n> Now, need to check for collisions or walls.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (2,4): x=2,y=4, both between 1 and 6, not wall.\n> \n> (3,5): x=3,y=5, y=5<7, not wall.\n> \n> (3,3): x=3,y=3, not wall.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (4,6), not affecting these.\n> \n> Now, body collisions: snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake: (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n> \n> So cells occupied: (3,4) head, (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n> \n> Now, for move L to (2,4): is (2,4) occupied? From list: (2,2), (1,2), etc., no (2,4). Positions: x=2: (2,2), and that's it for x=2. (2,2) is occupied, but (2,4) is not in the list. So (2,4) is free? Let's see: snake has (3,4), (4,4), etc., but (2,4) is not listed, so it should be empty.\n> \n> Similarly, U to (3,5): (3,5) not in positions, so empty.\n> \n> D to (3,3): (3,3) not in positions, empty.\n> \n> But (4,4) is occupied, but that's not where we're moving; we're moving to (2,4), (3,5), or (3,3), all empty.\n> \n> Now, also, food at (2,5), (1,1), (4,4). (4,4) is occupied by the snake body, specifically the second segment.\n> \n> Important: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> For (4,4), there is food, but it's under the snake body. So to eat it, we need to move the body away from (4,4) and then have the head move there later.\n> \n> Currently, head is at (3,4), so we can't eat (4,4) now because it's under body.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (2,5) and (1,1) are not under snake, I think.\n> \n> (2,5): is it occupied? Snake positions: let's check, (2,5) not in the list, so it's free, with food.\n> \n> (1,1) free.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid for clarity.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (3,4)\n> \n> Body: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) tail.\n> \n> So the snake is quite long, 18 segments?

From (3,4), (2,5) is one step left and one up, but not adjacent; adjacent cells are (2,4), (3,5), (4,4), (3,3). (2,5) is diagonally adjacent but not directly reachable in one move; to reach (2,5), I need to go to (2,4) or (3,5) first, then to (2,5) from there.\n> \n> From (3,4), to go to (2,5), I need to move U to (3,5), then L to (2,5), or L to (2,4), then U to (2,5). Similarly for others.\n> \n> (2,5) has life 4, so I have until turn 86 to eat it.\n> \n> (1,1) is farther, life 6, more time.\n> \n> (4,4) is under body, so I need to free it first.\n> \n> But (4,4) has long life, 9 turns.\n> \n> Now, also, tail is at (1,5), which might move soon.\n> \n> Let's think about the path.\n> \n> Since head direction is L, moving left to (2,4) might be straightforward.\n> \n> But let's consider risks.\n> \n> First, if I move L to (2,4), what happens.\n> \n> Turn 83: move to (2,4). Now, is there food? (2,4) has no food listed, so no eat. Snake grows? No, no food eaten. So tail moves: tail was at (1,5), which moves to where? When snake moves, head to new position, each segment moves to previous position of the one ahead, tail is removed if no growth.\n> \n> So after moving to (2,4), new head position (2,4), then body: (3,4) becomes new segment 1, (4,4) segment 2, and so on, up to (1,5) which was tail, but since no growth, tail is removed, so (1,5) is freed.\n> \n> New positions: head (2,4), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) and tail was (1,5), removed, so tail is now (1,4).\n> \n> Length decreased? No, since no growth, length same, but tail moved.\n> \n> Original length 18 positions, after move, head new, tail removed, so still 18 segments? Positions: before move, 18 cells occupied.\n> \n> After move: head moves to (2,4), which was empty, so now (2,4) occupied, and tail (1,5) is vacated, so snake occupies new set: (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) — that's 18 positions, yes.\n> \n> (1,5) is gone, (2,4) added.\n> \n> Now, from there, I can consider going to (2,5) for food.\n> \n> (2,5) has food, and it's adjacent to (2,4).\n> \n> But let's not get ahead; I need to plan sequence.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move U to (3,5), or D to (3,3).\n> \n> Now, also, the food at (4,4) is under the body. Currently, (4,4) is occupied by the second segment. When the snake moves, if we don't eat, the body might move away.\n> \n> For example, if I move L to (2,4), then the segment at (4,4) will move to (3,4) or something? Let's see the movement.\n> \n> After moving L to (2,4), the snake is: head (2,4), then the first body segment is the old head (3,4), then next was (4,4), which moves to where? Each segment takes the place of the previous one.\n> \n> Before move: positions: index 0: (3,4) head, 1: (4,4), 2: (4,5), etc.\n> \n> After move head to (2,4): new position 0: (2,4)\n> \n> Position 1: old position 0, (3,4)\n> \n> Position 2: old position 1, (4,4)\n> \n> Position 3: old position 2, (4,5)\n> \n> And so on, up to position 17: old position 17, (1,5), but since no growth, we don't add a new segment, so the last segment is removed, which is the tail (1,5), so the new tail is what was position 16: (1,4).\n> \n> In terms of cells: (4,4) is still occupied, by the segment that was at (4,4), but after move, the segment that was at (4,4) is now at position 2, and it moved to where? The segment doesn't move to a new cell; each segment shifts to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> When head moves to (2,4), the segment that was at index 1 (4,4) will now be at the position that was index 0, which is (3,4)? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the cell where the previous segment was. So:\n> \n> - The head moves to new position, say P_new.\n> \n> - Then the segment that was behind head moves to where head was.\n> \n> - The next segment moves to where the first body segment was, and so on.\n> \n> - The tail segment is removed if no growth.\n> \n> So for this case, head moves from (3,4) to (2,4).\n> \n> Then, the segment that was at (4,4) (index 1) moves to where head was, (3,4).\n> \n> Then, the segment that was at (4,5) (index 2) moves to where index 1 was, (4,4).\n> \n> Then, (5,5) (index 3) moves to (4,5), and so on.\n> \n> Finally, the tail at (1,5) is removed.\n> \n> So after move to (2,4), the cell (4,4) is now occupied by the segment that was at (4,5), which moved to (4,4). So (4,4) is still occupied, but by a different segment. The food at (4,4) is still under the snake body, because the body is still there; it's just that the segment changed.\n> \n> To free the food, we need a move where no segment is at (4,4) after the move, meaning that when the snake moves, the body part that was on (4,4) moves away, and no new segment comes to (4,4).\n> \n> For example, if the snake moves in such a way that the segment on (4,4) moves to another cell, and the new position isn't filled immediately.\n> \n> But in this case, since (4,4) is not the tail, when the snake moves, the segment on (4,4) will move to where the previous segment was, so (4,4) might be vacated only if that segment moves and no one moves into it.\n> \n> In the movement, when a segment moves from its cell, that cell is vacated, and the segment moves to a new cell, which might have been occupied or not.\n> \n> But in this case, for (4,4), it is currently occupied by a body segment. When the snake moves, that segment will move to a different cell (depending on the move), and then the cell (4,4) will be empty if no other segment moves into it.\n> \n> After the move, the cell that was occupied by that segment is now free, unless the tail grows or something.\n> \n> For instance, in the move to (2,4) as above: after move, the segment that was at (4,4) moves to (3,4), so (4,4) is vacated, and then the next segment moves to (4,4)? No.\n> \n> Let's list the positions after move.\n> \n> Before move: positions: 0:(3,4), 1:(4,4), 2:(4,5), 3:(5,5), 4:(5,6), 5:(6,6), 6:(6,5), 7:(6,4), 8:(5,4), 9:(5,3), 10:(5,2), 11:(4,2), 12:(3,2), 13:(2,2), 14:(1,2), 15:(1,3), 16:(1,4), 17:(1,5) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (2,4):\n> \n> New head: (2,4)\n> \n> Then, the body segments:\n> \n> - The segment that was at index 1 moves to where index 0 was, so to (3,4)\n> \n> - The segment that was at index 2 moves to where index 1 was, so to (4,4)\n> \n> - Index 3 moves to where index 2 was, (4,5)\n> \n> - Index 4 to where index 3 was, (5,5)\n> \n> - Index 5 to (5,6)\n> \n> - Index 6 to (6,6)\n> \n> - Index 7 to (6,5)\n> \n> - Index 8 to (6,4)\n> \n> - Index 9 to (5,4)\n> \n> - Index 10 to (5,3)\n> \n> - Index 11 to (5,2)\n> \n> - Index 12 to (4,2)\n> \n> - Index 13 to (3,2)\n> \n> - Index 14 to (2,2)\n> \n> - Index 15 to (1,2)\n> \n> - Index 16 to (1,3)\n> \n> - Index 17 would move to where index 16 was, (1,4), but since no growth, we stop, and index 17 is removed, so tail is not added.\n> \n> New positions: head (2,4), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)\n> \n> And (1,5) is free now.\n> \n> Now, (4,4) is occupied by the segment that was previously at (4,5), so (4,4) is still occupied. The food is still under the body.\n> \n> To free (4,4), we need a move where the segment on (4,4) moves away and no segment moves to (4,4). That would happen if (4,4) is the tail or something, but currently it's not.\n> \n> The tail is at (1,5), which is far.\n> \n> When the tail moves, cells are freed, but (4,4) is in the middle.\n> \n> To free a body cell, we need the snake to move such that the segment on that cell moves to a different position, and no other segment moves in, which is always the case for internal segments when no growth; the cell is vacated when the segment leaves, and not reoccupied immediately unless it's the head or something, but in standard movement, each cell is left and then might be empty or occupied by the next segment.\n> \n> In the above, when the segment at (4,4) (index 1) moves to (3,4), the cell (4,4) is empty for a moment, but then the next segment moves to (4,4) from (4,5), so it is reoccupied immediately. So for internal segments, the cell is never free; it's always occupied by some body part when the snake moves without growing.\n> \n> Only when a segment at the end is removed, like the tail, that cell is freed.\n> \n> For (4,4), it is an internal cell, so it will be occupied as long as the snake is there, unless the snake grows or shrinks, but here no shrinking except tail removal.\n> \n> But when the snake moves, the cell (4,4) is briefly empty, but then filled by the next segment. For the purpose of food, the food under body can only be eaten when the head moves there after the body has moved away, meaning that the cell must be free before the head moves in.\n> \n> From the rule: \"the body moves away, and the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for food at (4,4), it can be eaten only if at some turn, (4,4) is not occupied by any snake segment, and then the head moves to it.\n> \n> Currently, (4,4) is occupied, so we need to move the snake such that at some point, (4,4) is vacated.\n> \n> That happens when the segment on (4,4) moves away and no segment moves in, but as above, for internal segments, when the segment moves out, the next segment moves in, so it's not vacated.\n> \n> Only for the tail cell, when it moves, the cell is vacated and not reoccupied.\n> \n> For example, the tail at (1,5), when the snake moves without growing, (1,5) is vacated and free.\n> \n> For (4,4), it is not the tail, so it will be occupied until the snake shortens or something, but here the snake doesn't shorten; it only grows or stays same length.\n> \n> Since no negative food, length can only increase or stay same.\n> \n> To free (4,4), we need the snake to move in such a way that the segment on (4,4) becomes the tail or something, but that might take time.\n> \n> Perhaps after several moves, as the snake moves, the position (4,4) might be vacated when the tail passes or something, but it's complicated.\n> \n> Let's see the current position of (4,4): it's the second segment, index 1.\n> \n> After each move without growth, the tail is removed, so the snake effectively moves forward, and cells behind the tail are freed, but (4,4) is not near the tail.\n> \n> The tail is at (1,5), head at (3,4), so (4,4) is close to head.\n> \n> As the snake moves, the body shifts, but (4,4) will be occupied until the part of the body that is on it moves away, but since it's a continuous body, it's always occupied.\n> \n> In fact, for a snake of fixed length, when it moves, the set of occupied cells changes, but each cell that was occupied may be vacated if it was the tail position, or if the snake turns, some internal cells might be vacated.\n> \n> For example, if the snake makes a turn, some cells can be freed.\n> \n> In this case, the snake is coiled, so it might be possible to free (4,4) by moving appropriately.\n> \n> Let's list the current positions to see the shape.\n> \n> Grid y from 1 to 6, x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Snake: (3,4) head, (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) tail.\n> \n> So let's plot this:\n> \n> At y=6: (5,6), (6,6)\n> \n> y=5: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)\n> \n> y=4: head (3,4), (4,4), (6,4), (5,4)?

Walls at y=7 and y=0, but y=6 is within 1-6, so (3,6) should be ok, but let's check if occupied or wall.\n> \n> y=6 is not a wall; walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to 6 are playable. Similarly x=1 to 6.\n> \n> (3,6): is it occupied? Snake positions: let's see, (3,5) is head, (3,4) is next, but (3,6) not in list. Also not wall. Obstacle at (4,6), but (3,6) is different. So (3,6) should be free.\n> \n> - Down: (3,4) - but that's the body segment right behind the head. Moving down would go to (3,4), which is occupied by the body. But in snake, when you move, the head moves to new position, and tail moves, so if you move to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it might be ok, but generally, moving into a body segment that is not the tail is deadly.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is N at turn t, it means after N turns, it disappears. But \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, when we are about to move, the food has life span N, and after this turn, it decreases to N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears.\n> \n> For (2,5), life span 3 at turn 84. After turn 84, if not eaten, life span becomes 2. After turn 85, life span 1. After turn 86, life span 0, disappears before turn 87 or on turn 87? But it says \"disappears after N turns\", and countdown decreases each turn.\n> \n> I think it's safe to assume that on the turn when life span reaches 0, it disappears before the turn starts or something. But for planning, we need to know when it will be gone.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (1,1) life span 5, (4,4) life span 8.\n> \n> Now, back to moves.

collision risks, while still allowing the snake to eat the short-life food at (2,5) by turn 86.

There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> Current turn is 85. Snake positions: head at (3,6), then body segments: (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3). That's 18 segments. Head direction is Up, which is (x,y+1), but since it's moving Up, the next position would be y increasing, but in grid terms, y=0 is bottom or top? Typically in such games, y increases upwards, so U would be (x, y+1), meaning moving to higher y values.\n> \n> Head is at (3,6), and direction is U, so it was moving upwards. But (3,6) is at y=6, and y=7 is wall, so moving Up would hit the wall if it goes to (3,7), but y=7 is wall, so that's invalid. Let me check the grid boundaries.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive. Similarly y from 1 to 6 inclusive? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> But (3,6) has y=6, which is adjacent to y=7 wall. Moving Up to (3,7) would be invalid since it's a wall. But the snake head is at (3,6) with direction U, but it can't move Up because (3,7) is wall. But in the state, it says head direction is U, but it must be that it moved to (3,6) from below, so previous position was (3,5) or something. Let's see the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (3,6), then (3,5), (3,4), etc. So it moved from (3,5) to (3,6), which is Up, since y increased from 5 to 6. Now at (3,6), direction U, but moving Up to (3,7) is impossible, so the only possible moves are Left, Right, or Down? But Down would be to (3,5), which is the body, but let's see.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,6):\n> \n> - Up: (3,7) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - Down: (3,5) - but that's the body segment, specifically the second segment. But in snake, moving into the cell that will be vacated by the tail might be okay, but here (3,5) is occupied now, but when the snake moves, the tail moves, so if I move Down to (3,5), it would collide because the body is there, and the tail hasn't moved yet.\n> \n> Collision rules: head touches any body segment except the tail if it's moving away, but generally, moving into a cell occupied by the body is deadly, except for the tail cell if the tail moves.\n> \n> From the rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving into the tail cell is safe only if the tail moves away, meaning that after movement, that cell is free.\n> \n> In this case, from (3,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: (3,7) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - Down: (3,5) - currently occupied by body, but (3,5) is the second segment. The tail is at (1,3), so (3,5) is not the tail; it's a body part. So moving to (3,5) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> - Left: (2,6) - let's check if this is free. From positions, (2,6) is not listed; positions are: (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3). So (2,6) is not occupied, and not wall? x=2, y=6 is within 1-6, and no obstacle mentioned except internal at (4,6), so (2,6) should be free.\n> \n> - Right: (4,6) - but (4,6) is the internal obstacle! Walls include internal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> So from (3,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - Left to (2,6) - free\n> \n> - Down to (3,5) - body occupied, collision\n> \n> - Up: wall\n> \n> - Right: wall (since (4,6) obstacle)\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move is Left to (2,6). But head direction is U, and no instant reverse, but moving Left is not reverse of Up; reverse would be Down, which is not possible anyway.\n> \n> Reverse means opposite direction: U and D are opposites, L and R are opposites. So from current direction U, I cannot move D on next turn, but L or R are allowed.\n> \n> Here, moving D is not possible due to body, so only L is possible? Down is invalid due to body, so only Left is valid move.\n> \n> But let's confirm the positions. Snake head at (3,6), body: (3,5), etc. (3,5) is occupied, so moving to (3,5) is death. (2,6) is free, as per positions list. (4,6) is wall. (3,7) wall. So yes, only move is L to (2,6).\n> \n> But the food list has (2,5,2,1) which is at (2,5), and life span 2, value 1. Also (1,1,4,1), (4,4,7,1), (1,4,10,1). All food have value 1, so all positive, no negative food here.\n> \n> Life spans: (2,5) has life 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns including current? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Current turn is 85, so for food at (2,5) with life span 2, it will disappear after turn 86? Life span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> So at turn 85, life span 2, so after turn 85, countdown to 1, then after turn 86, countdown to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 85 or 86, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) life span 4, can be eaten until turn 88? Let's see:\n> \n> - Turn 85: life span 4, countdown 4\n> \n> - After turn 85: countdown 3\n> \n> - After turn 86: countdown 2\n> \n> - After turn 87: countdown 1\n> \n> - After turn 88: countdown 0, disappears. So can be eaten on turns 85,86,87,88.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) life span 7, disappears after turn 91.\n> \n> (1,4) life span 10, disappears after turn 94.\n> \n> Now, back to movement. From (3,6), I must move to (2,6) because it's the only option. But is (2,6) safe? Yes, it's free.\n> \n> Then, after moving to (2,6), the new head position is (2,6), and the tail moves, so the last segment (1,3) is removed, and new head at (2,6), so the body shifts.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's list the current state:\n> \n> Grid: 6x6, walls at borders and (4,6) obstacle.\n> \n> Snake: head (3,6), body: (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3) — 18 segments.\n> \n> Food: (2,5) value 1, life 2 (disappears after turn 86)\n> \n> (1,1) value 1, life 4 (disappears after turn 88)\n> \n> (4,4) value 1, life 7 (disappears after turn 91)\n> \n> (1,4) value 1, life 10 (disappears after turn 94)\n> \n> At turn 85, I must move from (3,6).

When snake moves, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so tail is removed.\n> \n> After move: head at (2,6), then the first body segment is previous head (3,6), then (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2). The tail was (1,3), which is removed, so positions now: [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2)] — still 18 segments? No, length should be same since no food eaten.\n> \n> Original positions: 18 segments. After move, head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so length same. Yes, 18 cells.\n> \n> Now head at (2,6), direction L (since moved left).\n> \n> Now possible moves from (2,6):\n> \n> - Left: (1,6) — is this free?

Standard snake: when you eat, the tail doesn't move that turn, so the snake grows.\n> \n> In snake mechanics, when you eat food, on that turn, the head moves to the food cell, and a new body segment is added where the head was, so the tail doesn't move; the snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> But in terms of positions, after moving head to food, the body follows, but since food is eaten, a new segment is added at the end.\n> \n> The positions list: head first, so if I move to (2,5), which has food, then new positions: head is now (2,5), and the previous head (2,6) becomes body, so positions become: [(2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), ... and so on, with the tail still at (1,2) but since I ate, a new segment is added? No.\n> \n> When you eat food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; it stays in place, and a new segment is added where the tail was or something? I need to clarify.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: each turn, the head moves to a new cell. If that cell has food, then the snake grows, so the tail does not move; thus, the new segment is added at the tail end. If no food, tail moves forward.\n> \n> In terms of positions: suppose current positions: [head, body1, body2, ..., tail]\n> \n> After moving to a new cell:\n> \n> - If no food, new head at new position, body segments shift: new body1 is old head, body2 is old body1, ..., and tail is removed or moved? The last segment (tail) is removed, so the snake moves forward.\n> \n> Specifically: head moves to new cell. Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the tail segment is left empty.\n> \n> But when food is eaten, no segment is removed; instead, a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> So after eating, positions: new head at food cell, then old head, then old body segments, and the tail stays, with a new segment added? Let's think.\n> \n> Example: suppose positions [A, B, C] with head A. Move to new cell D with food.\n> \n> New positions: [D, A, B, C] – head at D, then A (which was head, now body), B, C, and since ate, C remains and no removal, so snake grows to [D, A, B, C].\n> \n> If no food, move to D, no food: new positions [D, A, B] – C is removed.\n> \n> In this case, tail was C, after move with food, tail is still C, but now it's part of the body, and a new tail is not added; the tail remains, so the snake is longer.\n> \n> Similarly, here, if I move to (2,5) with food, new head at (2,5), then previous head (2,6) becomes body, and all other segments shift, but since ate, the last segment (tail) stays, so the tail is still there, but the snake is longer.\n> \n> Current tail is at (1,2).

Positions list: head (2,5), then body: (2,6), then (3,6), etc. down to (1,2). So (1,2) is still the tail, but since I ate, the tail didn't move, so the snake has one more segment.\n> \n> But in terms of collision, after moving, the head is at (2,5), and body segments are (2,6), (3,6), etc.\n> \n> Now, (2,5) was food, but now it's occupied by head.\n> \n> But I need to check if moving to (2,5) causes collision.\n> \n> (2,5) is currently food, not occupied by body, so moving there is fine, as long as after move, no collision.\n> \n> After move, head at (2,5), body at (2,6), which is adjacent, but not colliding since it's not the same cell.

Is (2,5) in this list? No, (2,5) is not in the body positions.

(2,5) and (1,2): delta x=1, delta y=3, not adjacent; adjacent means sharing edge, so up/down/left/right, so |dx| + |dy| =1?

Food is at (2,5), (1,1), (4,4), (1,4). No food at (1,6).\n> \n> So if I move to (1,6), no food eaten, so snake moves: head to (1,6), then body: (2,6) becomes body, and tail (1,2) is removed, so positions: [(1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), ..., up to (2,2), (1,2) but tail removed, so new tail is (2,2) or something.\n> \n> Current positions: head (2,6), then (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2) — 18 segments?

But in snake game, length only increases when eating; otherwise, it stays the same length while moving.\n> \n> I think I have confusion.\n> \n> Standard snake: the snake has a fixed length unless it eats food. When it eats, length increases.\n> \n> Movement: each turn, the head moves to a new cell. If that cell has food, the snake grows, so the tail does not move, and length increases by one. If no food, the tail moves forward, so the snake slides, length remains the same.\n> \n> In terms of cells: when no food, head moves to new cell, and tail is removed from its cell, so the number of cells remains the same.\n> \n> When food eaten, head moves to new cell, tail is not removed, so number of cells increases by one.\n> \n> In this case, current snake: 18 cells.\n> \n> If move to (2,5) with food: new head at (2,5), and all 18 body segments shift, but since ate, no removal, so new positions: 19 cells, length 19.\n> \n> If move to (1,6) no food: new head at (1,6), then the first body segment is old head (2,6), and so on, up to the second last segment, and tail is removed. Current positions: index 0 head (2,6), 1: (3,6), 2: (3,5), ..., 17: (1,2) tail.\n> \n> After move to (1,6) no food: new head (1,6), new body0: old head (2,6), new body1: old body0 (3,6), ..., new body16: old body16 (2,2)?

So 17 cells: head and 16 body, but body segments are from old head to old second last.\n> \n> Number: new head + old positions 0 to 16, which is 17 cells, tail at (2,2).\n> \n> Length decreases only if no food and moving, but in terms of count, from 18 to 17, so length decreased by one? That can't be right.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> In snake, the length is constant unless eating. When you move without eating, the head moves forward, the tail moves forward, so the number of cells remains the same; the tail leaves its position.\n> \n> In the positions list, after move without eating, the new list has the new head, and then the previous positions from index 0 to n-2, so it has the same number of elements, but shifted.\n> \n> For example, initial: [A,B,C] length 3.\n> \n> Move to D no food: new positions [D, A, B] — C is gone, length 3.\n> \n> Move to D with food: new positions [D, A, B, C] length 4.\n> \n> In this case, current 18 cells: let S = [H, B1, B2, ..., B16, T] where H=(2,6), B1=(3,6), ..., up to T=(1,2).\n> \n> After move to new cell P:\n> \n> - If no food, new positions: [P, H, B1, B2, ..., B16] but this has 18 elements, but T is missing, so it's [P, H, B1, ..., B16], which is 18 elements, with new tail B16.\n> \n> B16 is (2,2), which was the second last.\n> \n> Current B16 is (2,2), and T is (1,2).\n> \n> After move to (1,6) no food: new head (1,6), then old H (2,6), then old B1 (3,6), ..., old B15 (3,2)?

Typically, it should be available until the end of turn when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at the start of turn t, if life_span is L, after the turn, it becomes L-1. When it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> For example, at turn 87, food with life_span 1: at the start of turn 87, life_span=1. After turn 87, if not eaten, it disappears. So it can only be eaten on turn 87.\n> \n> Similarly, life_span 1 means it must be eaten now or lost.\n> \n> In this case, all three foods have life_span 1: (1,1,2,1), (4,4,5,1), (1,4,8,1). So they must be eaten on this turn, turn 87, or they disappear.\n> \n> But the snake head is at (2,5), moving down.\n> \n> Current head position: (2,5), direction D (down), so moving to (x,y-1), so down would be to (2,4)? y=5, down decreases y, so (2,5) down to (2,4).\n> \n> But let's confirm coordinates: y=0 is bottom? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom row, y=7 top? Typically in grids, y=0 might be top or bottom, but here it says walls at y=0 and y=7, so let's assume y increases upwards or downwards?\n> \n> The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so if U is up, then y increases upwards, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> So head at (2,5), direction D, so moving down to (2,4).\n> \n> But what are the possible moves from (2,5)?

Also internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> So playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (4,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Now snake body: positions from (2,5) head to (1,2) tail.\n> \n> List of all occupied cells by snake:\n> \n> (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2)\n> \n> Now, from (2,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - Left (L): to (1,5)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (3,5)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (2,4)\n> \n> Now, check if these are valid:\n> \n> (1,5): is it within bounds? x=1, y=5, x from 1-6, y from 1-6, yes. Is it a wall? No walls at (1,5). Is it occupied by snake body? Snake body has (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), etc. (1,5) not in the list, so free? But (1,5) might be empty, but let's see the positions: head is (2,5), body has (2,6), (3,6), etc., no (1,5), so (1,5) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5): is it occupied? Snake has (3,5) in the list: positions include (3,5), which is the fourth segment? List: index 0: (2,5) head, 1: (2,6), 2: (3,6), 3: (3,5), so (3,5) is occupied by body. So cannot move to (3,5), collision.\n> \n> (2,4): is it occupied? Snake positions: (3,4), (4,4), etc. (2,4) not listed, so should be free? Let's see: positions are (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), so (3,4) is there, but (2,4) not in list, so free.\n> \n> Also, walls: (2,4) is within 1-6, not wall.\n> \n> Now, but there is food to consider.\n> \n> Food at (1,1), (4,4), (1,4).\n> \n> (4,4) is occupied by snake body? Snake positions include (4,4), which is the sixth segment? Positions: 0:(2,5), 1:(2,6), 2:(3,6), 3:(3,5), 4:(3,4), 5:(4,4), yes, (4,4) is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> But food at (4,4) with value 5, life span 1.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (1,1) and (1,4).\n> \n> Now, for food under body: rule says food can spawn under body but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves on.\n> \n> So for (4,4), it's occupied by body, so to eat it, the body must move away first.\n> \n> Since life span is 1, it must be eaten this turn or lost.\n> \n> But if the body is on it, and we move such that the body moves away, but head moves on only if possible.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> At turn 87, head is at (2,5), moving down.\n> \n> Possible actions: L to (1,5), R to (3,5) but (3,5) is occupied, so invalid, collision.

Life span 1, at turn 87, it disappears after this turn, so only available on turn 87.\n> \n> Similarly for all food, life span 1, so must be eaten now or lost.\n> \n> But can I eat any food this turn?\n> \n> (1,1) is at (1,1), head at (2,5), not adjacent, so impossible to eat this turn.\n> \n> (4,4) is at (4,4), but occupied by snake body. To eat it, the head needs to move to (4,4), but it's occupied, so cannot move there directly. And since body is on it, even if I move such that body moves away, but for head to move to it, I need to be adjacent and move to it, but currently head is at (2,5), not adjacent to (4,4). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (2,5) adjacent to (1,5), (3,5), (2,4), (2,6). (4,4) is not adjacent; it's two steps away.\n> \n> So impossible to eat (4,4) on this turn.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4) is at (1,4). From head (2,5), adjacent cells are (1,5), (3,5), (2,4), (2,6). (1,4) is not adjacent; it's diagonal or something. (1,4) and (2,5) are not adjacent; difference in x and y, so not directly reachable.\n> \n> Therefore, none of the food can be eaten on turn 87 because:\n> \n> - (1,1) too far\n> \n> - (4,4) occupied and not adjacent\n> \n> - (1,4) not adjacent to head\n> \n> So all food will disappear after this turn since life span 1.\n> \n> But let's confirm life span: at turn 87, food with life span 1, after turn 87, it disappears. So if not eaten during turn 87, it's gone.\n> \n> Since head cannot reach any food cell in one move, no food can be eaten this turn. So all food will be lost.\n> \n> Therefore, for turn 87, I don't need to worry about eating food; I should just move to a safe position.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (2,5):\n> \n> - L to (1,5): (1,5) is free?

It's turn 88, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so that's 8x8 cells, but walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm.\n> \n> The walls are defined as border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6). So, the snake can only move on cells where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6, except for (4,6) which is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (2,4), and direction is D (down). The positions are listed from head to tail: [(2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)]. So, the head is at (2,4), and the tail is at (2,2).\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 1\n> \n> - (4,4) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (1,4) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (2,3) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value 1, so they are all positive food, no negative food here. Value is +1 for all, and life span given.\n> \n> Now, life span: it decreases every turn, including the current turn. So for food at (1,1), life span 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn, so if life span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it can be eaten for N more turns including the current one? Let me read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, for food with life span L, it will disappear after L turns from now. For example, at turn t, if life span is 1, it can be eaten on turn t, but disappears after turn t, so not available on turn t+1. If life span is 2, it can be eaten on turn t or t+1, disappears after turn t+1, and so on.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> - (1,1): life span 1, so must be eaten on turn 88 or it's gone.\n> \n> - (4,4): life span 4, so can be eaten on turns 88, 89, 90, 91.\n> \n> - (1,4): life span 7, can be eaten from turn 88 to 94.\n> \n> - (2,3): life span 10, can be eaten from turn 88 to 97.\n> \n> But (4,4) is occupied by the snake's body? Snake positions: (4,4) is part of the snake, it's the 7th segment: positions index from 0: head (2,4), then (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), etc. So (4,4) is occupied by the snake's body.\n> \n> Food at (4,4) is on a cell that has a snake body segment. But according to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, other food might be accessible.\n> \n> Current head position: (2,4), direction is D (down). Since direction is down, moving down would be to (2,3), but (2,3) has food with life span 10.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,4): since direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up because that would be reverse, and no instant reverse is allowed. Current direction is D, so moving up (U) is opposite, not allowed. So possible actions: D (down), L (left), R (right).\n> \n> - Down: to (2,3)\n> \n> - Left: to (1,4)\n> \n> - Right: to (3,4)\n> \n> Now, (1,4) has food with life span 7.\n> \n> (2,3) has food with life span 10.\n> \n> (3,4) is part of the snake body? Snake positions: (3,4) is the 5th segment?

So moving right to (3,4) would be moving into a body segment, which is a collision and deadly. Unless it's the tail, but the tail is at (2,2), so (3,4) is not the tail; it's a middle segment, so moving there would cause collision and death.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,3) is not in the snake positions; let's see all positions: from above, (2,3) is not listed, so it should be empty or food.\n> \n> Food is at (1,1), (4,4), (1,4), (2,3).

Grid: x from 0 to 7 are walls, so playable x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Cells occupied by walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall.

(4,6) is a wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Now, (1,4): x=1, y=4, so 1<=x<=6, 1<=y<=6, and not (4,6), so it's free, has food.\n> \n> (2,3): x=2,y=3, free, has food.\n> \n> (3,4): occupied by snake body, not free.\n> \n> Also, moving down to (2,3): y=3, which is within bounds.\n> \n> But I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's list all food and their life spans:\n> \n> - (1,1): life span 1, must eat on turn 88 or gone.\n> \n> - (4,4): life span 4, can eat on turns 88-91\n> \n> - (1,4): life span 7, can eat on turns 88-94\n> \n> - (2,3): life span 10, can eat on turns 88-97\n> \n> (1,1) is about to disappear, but it's at (1,1), which is far from head at (2,4). To reach (1,1) from (2,4), I need to go left and down, but in one turn, I can only move one step. From (2,4), I can move left to (1,4) or down to (2,3) or right to (3,4) but right is invalid.\n> \n> To reach (1,1) this turn, I need to be at (1,1), but I'm at (2,4), so I can't reach it this turn.

So I should ignore (1,1).\n> \n> Now, other food: (1,4) is adjacent left, (2,3) is adjacent down, and (4,4) is at (4,4), which is occupied by snake body.\n> \n> (4,4) has food, but it's under the snake body. To eat it, the body must move away and head move there.\n> \n> Currently, (4,4) is position index 6 in snake list, which is a body segment. The head is at (2,4). To eat (4,4), I need to have the head move to (4,4) when it's free.\n> \n> But right now it's occupied, so I need to move the snake such that the segment at (4,4) moves away, and then head comes back.\n> \n> But that might take several turns.\n> \n> Since all food is +1, I should consider which one to go for, but also avoid risks.\n> \n> First, immediate actions.\n> \n> From (2,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - Left (L) to (1,4): that has food, so if I move there, I eat the food, snake grows to 20 segments?

It's turn 89. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (2,3), and it's moving down (direction D). The body segments are listed: [(2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)]. That's 20 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (4,4) with value 1 and life span 4. But (4,4) is occupied by the snake's body! According to the snake positions, (4,4) is the 8th segment (index 7, since head is index 0: (2,3)=0, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=2, (2,6)=3, (3,6)=4, (3,5)=5, (3,4)=6, (4,4)=7). So food at (4,4) is under the snake body.\n> \n> - (1,4) with value 1 and life span 6. Life span 6 means it disappears after 6 turns, including current turn, so it has 6 turns left now? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 89, life span 6 means it will disappear after turn 94 (since 89 + 6 - 1 = 94? Let's clarify: if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, so it can be eaten from turn t to t + N - 1. At turn t + N, it's gone.\n> \n> For food at (1,4): value 1, life span 6 at turn 89. So it can be eaten from turn 89 to turn 94 inclusive? Turn 89 is when it's present, and it disappears after turn 94, meaning it's not there on turn 95. So it can be eaten on turns 89,90,91,92,93,94. Life span decreases each turn, so after 6 decreases, it's gone. Starting from turn 89 with life span 6, after turn 89, life span becomes 5; after turn 90, 4; ... after turn 94, life span 0, so it disappears before turn 95.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,4) has life span 4 at turn 89, so it can be eaten until turn 92 (after turn 92, it disappears before turn 93).\n> \n> But (4,4) is under the snake body. According to rules, food under body can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it. So for (4,4), since it's occupied, the snake needs to move so that (4,4) is free, then head can move there to eat it.\n> \n> Current head position: (2,3), direction down. From direction down, possible moves: since moving down, I can't instantly reverse to up, so I can go left, right, or down? No instant reverse: if current direction is D, I cannot move U on next turn.

Let's see if (1,4) is occupied: snake positions: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,2), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,2), (4,4), (4,5), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). (1,4) is not in the list, so it should be free, and no wall, so it's accessible.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) is occupied.\n> \n> I need to plan 5+ turns ahead. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's find possible moves from current position (2,3) with direction D.\n> \n> Possible moves: L (left to (1,3)?), R (right to (3,3)?), D (down to (2,2)?).\n> \n> Check each:\n> \n> - L: to (1,3). Is this valid? x=1, y=3. Walls: border walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 is not wall. Internal obstacle at (4,6), not here. Snake body: is (1,3) occupied? Snake positions: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), etc. (1,3) not listed, so free? But (1,3) might be within bounds.\n> \n> y=3, x=1. No wall, and not in snake positions, so should be safe to move, unless collision.\n> \n> But moving to (1,3): after move, head is at (1,3), and tail is at (2,2), but since snake moves, the tail will move, so no immediate collision. When head moves to a cell, if that cell is not occupied by body except possibly the tail, it's ok. Here, (1,3) is empty, so safe.\n> \n> - R: to (3,3). Is (3,3) occupied? Snake positions: (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,2), (4,2), etc. (3,3) not listed, so free. Safe.\n> \n> - D: down to (2,2). But (2,2) is the current tail position. When head moves to tail position, it should be ok because the tail will move away, so no collision. So moving to (2,2) is safe, as long as it's only the tail.\n> \n> (2,2) is tail, and after head moves there, the tail moves, so it should be fine.\n> \n> But let's confirm: head moves to (2,2), at that moment, (2,2) was tail, but tail is part of body, but since it's the tail and it moves, the cell is vacated, so head can occupy it without dying. Yes, according to rules.\n> \n> Now, also, there might be food, but (2,2) has no food mentioned, so just a move.\n> \n> But food at (4,4) and (1,4), not here.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about eating food.\n> \n> First, food at (1,4): at position (1,4), value +1, life span 6.\n> \n> Food at (4,4): under body, value +1, life span 4.\n> \n> Since (4,4) is under body, to eat it, the snake needs to move so that body leaves (4,4), then head can move there.\n> \n> Currently, (4,4) is occupied by segment, so when the snake moves, that segment might move or not, depending on the path.\n> \n> Let's think about the snake's movement.\n> \n> The snake is long, 20 segments. Head at (2,3), moving down.\n> \n> If I move down to (2,2), then head is at (2,2), tail was at (2,2), but tail moves to the next segment. After move, snake positions: head to (2,2), then body: previous head (2,3) becomes new segment 1, then (2,4), etc., and tail (2,2) moves off? Let's simulate.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: (2,3), 1: (2,4), 2: (2,5), 3: (2,6), 4: (3,6), 5: (3,5), 6: (3,4), 7: (4,4), 8: (4,5), 9: (5,5), 10: (5,6), 11: (6,6), 12: (6,5), 13: (6,4), 14: (5,4), 15: (5,3), 16: (5,2), 17: (4,2), 18: (3,2), 19: (2,2) tail.\n> \n> If head moves down to (2,2): so new head position (2,2). Then the body segments shift: segment 1 becomes (2,3), segment 2: (2,4), ..., up to segment 19: (3,2)? Let's see: after head moves to (2,2), the first body segment is the old head (2,3), then old segment 1 (2,4), old segment 2 (2,5), ..., old segment 18 (3,2), and the tail was old segment 19 (2,2), but since head moved to (2,2), and tail moves to old segment 18 position? Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the tail leaves its cell, so the cell is free.\n> \n> Specifically: new positions: head at new position, then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So after moving down to (2,2):\n> \n> - New head: (2,2)\n> \n> - New segment 1: old head position (2,3)\n> \n> - New segment 2: old segment 1 position (2,4)\n> \n> - New segment 3: old segment 2 (2,5)\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - New segment 19: old segment 18 position (3,2)\n> \n> - Tail: old segment 19 position (2,2) is now head, so tail is new segment 19 at (3,2)?

Old segment 7 was (4,4), so new segment 8 is at (4,4)\n> \n> - Segment 9 at old segment 8 (4,5)\n> \n> - And so on, up to segment 19 at old segment 18 position (3,2)\n> \n> - The tail old segment 19 (2,2) is now the head, so it's gone, and new tail is at (3,2)\n> \n> So (4,4) is still occupied by the snake body (new segment 8).\n> \n> The food at (4,4) is still under the body, so not accessible yet.\n> \n> If I move left to (1,3): new head at (1,3), then body: segment 1 at (2,3), segment 2 at (2,4), ..., segment 7 at (3,4), segment 8 at (4,4), etc. So (4,4) still occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, move right to (3,3): new head at (3,3), body segment 1 at (2,3), segment 2 at (2,4), segment 3 at (2,5), ..., segment 7 at (3,4)? Old segment 6 was (3,4), so new segment 7 at (3,4), new segment 8 at old segment 7 (4,4), so (4,4) still occupied.\n> \n> So no matter where I move now, (4,4) remains occupied because it's not the tail; the tail is at (2,2), far away.\n> \n> To free (4,4), I need the snake to move so that the segment at (4,4) moves away, which would happen when the snake moves and that part advances.\n> \n> Currently, the segment at (4,4) is part of the body, and when the snake moves, it will shift, but since it's not the tail, it will be replaced by the next segment in line.\n> \n> Specifically, the cell (4,4) will be free only when the segment that was there moves to the next position, and no new segment comes, but since it's not the tail, when that segment moves, the previous segment comes to (4,4), so it stays occupied until the tail passes through.\n> \n> For a body cell to be freed, the snake must move in such a way that that cell is no longer occupied, which happens when the tail leaves it or when the snake turns and the body shifts.\n> \n> In this case, (4,4) is occupied by a segment, and it will remain occupied until that specific segment moves away, but when it moves, the segment behind it takes its place, so the cell (4,4) might be occupied by different segments but it stays filled until the tail end passes through.\n> \n> The cell (4,4) will be empty only if the segment that is there moves out and no other segment moves in, which for a straight path, it doesn't happen; it only happens at the tail.\n> \n> So for (4,4) to be free, the tail needs to be at (4,4) and when it moves, it leaves the cell free.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (2,2), so it will take many moves for the tail to reach (4,4).\n> \n> Let's see the path. From tail at (2,2) to (4,4): the snake goes from (2,2) to (3,2) to (4,2) to (4,3)? Positions: (2,2) tail, then (3,2), (4,2), then (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4) — (4,4) is segment 7.\n> \n> The tail is at (2,2), and the snake moves, tail will move to (3,2) when head moves, etc.\n> \n> To have (4,4) free, the segment that is there must move away and no new segment come, which means that (4,4) must be the tail position when it moves.\n> \n> So when the tail is at (4,4) and the snake moves, the tail leaves (4,4) free.\n> \n> Currently tail at (2,2), and the distance to (4,4) is not direct; the snake body is coiled.\n> \n> From tail to head: tail (2,2) to (3,2) to (4,2) to (5,2) to (5,3) to (5,4) to (6,4) to (6,5) to (6,6) to (5,6) to (5,5) to (4,5) to (4,4) — so (4,4) is 12 segments away from tail? Tail is index 19: (2,2), index 18: (3,2), 17: (4,2), 16: (5,2), 15: (5,3), 14: (5,4), 13: (6,4), 12: (6,5), 11: (6,6), 10: (5,6), 9: (5,5), 8: (4,5), 7: (4,4).\n> \n> So from tail to (4,4): tail (19) at (2,2), then 18 at (3,2), 17 at (4,2), 16 at (5,2), 15 at (5,3), 14 at (5,4), 13 at (6,4), 12 at (6,5), 11 at (6,6), 10 at (5,6), 9 at (5,5), 8 at (4,5), 7 at (4,4). So (4,4) is segment 7, which is 12 segments from tail (since 20 segments, index 0 to 19, tail is 19, head 0, so distance from tail: segment 7 is 12 positions away? Index 19 is tail, 18 is one before, ..., index 7 is 12 steps from tail (19-7=12).\n> \n> When the snake moves, the tail advances to the position of segment 18, and so on. So it will take 12 moves for the current segment at (4,4) to become the tail and leave the cell.\n> \n> After 12 moves, the tail will be at the current position of segment 7, which is (4,4), and when it moves, (4,4) is freed.\n> \n> But after 12 moves, the food at (4,4) may have expired, since life span is 4 at turn 89, so it disappears after turn 92. Turn 89: life span 4, after turn 89 it becomes 3, after 90:2, after 91:1, after 92:0, so on turn 93 it is gone. So it can be eaten only on turns 89,90,91,92.\n> \n> But it will take at least 12 turns to free (4,4), which is too late; by turn 89+12=101, food is long gone.\n> \n> Therefore, it's impossible to eat the food at (4,4) because it's under the body and we can't free it in time before it expires. Life span 4, only 4 turns left, but it takes min 12 turns to free, so yes, impossible. So we should ignore this food; it's not reachable.\n> \n> So only food available is at (1,4).\n> \n> Now, (1,4) has life span 6, so it can be eaten until turn 94.\n> \n> Current position: head at (2,3), direction down.\n> \n> (1,4) is at x=1,y=4, which is left and up from current head?

But (4,4) is currently occupied by the snake's body. Specifically, in the list, (4,4) is the 9th segment: positions index from head: 0:(3,3), 1:(2,3), 2:(2,4), 3:(2,5), 4:(2,6), 5:(3,6), 6:(3,5), 7:(3,4), 8:(4,4), etc.\n> \n> (4,4) is occupied by the snake, so the food there can only be eaten if the snake moves away and then the head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4) is not occupied; let's check if it's empty. (1,4): is it in snake positions? Snake has (2,4) and (1,4) isn't listed, so it should be free, but we need to see if it's accessible.\n> \n> (1,4) is at x=1,y=4, which should be within bounds.\n> \n> Now, life spans: Food at (4,4) has life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns from now. Since turn 90, it will be present on turns 90, 91, 92, and gone on turn 93.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4) has life span 5, so present on turns 90 to 94, gone on 95.\n> \n> Current turn is 90, so for (4,4), it has 3 turns left including this one? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 90, life_span=3 means it can be eaten on turn 90,91,92; after that it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly for (1,4), can be eaten on turns 90 to 94.\n> \n> But (4,4) is under the snake body, so we can't eat it immediately.\n> \n> Head is at (3,3), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: Since head direction is R, I can move R, U, or D, but not L because that would be opposite, but L is left, which is opposite to right, so I cannot move left immediately.

But in snake, moving to the tail is allowed because the tail will move away, so it's safe as long as no other body part is there.\n> \n> Collision rules: head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail moves. So moving to tail position is safe if it's the only segment there.\n> \n> In this case, (3,2) is the tail, so if head moves to (3,2), and tail moves, it should be fine, as long as no other part is at (3,2).\n> \n> Is (3,2) only occupied by tail? Yes, from the list, (3,2) is the last one.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4) is occupied by body segment?

Snake positions: (4,3) is not listed. Snake has (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), etc., no (4,3). Also, walls: x=4,y=3 is within bounds, not wall. Obstacle at (4,6), not (4,3). So (4,3) should be free.\n> \n> - Up: (3,4) — this is occupied by snake body at index 7: (3,4)\n> \n> - Down: (3,2) — occupied by snake tail at index 19: (3,2)\n> \n> - Left: (2,3) — but left is opposite to current direction R, so cannot move left. Reverse not allowed.\n> \n> So possible moves: R to (4,3), U to (3,4), or D to (3,2).\n> \n> But U to (3,4) is occupied by body, so if I move there, it would be a collision because (3,4) is a body segment, not the tail, and it won't move away immediately? No.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each segment moves to the next position, so the tail vacates its spot.\n> \n> Specifically, if head moves to a cell that was occupied by the tail, it's safe because the tail moves away.\n> \n> But if head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it's a collision because that segment doesn't move away; only the tail does.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> - If I move U to (3,4): (3,4) is currently occupied by the 7th segment. After movement, the head moves to (3,4), but that segment was already there, so it's like the head is colliding with the body at (3,4) before it moves? I need to think carefully.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when the snake moves, the head goes to a new position, and each body segment shifts to the position of the previous segment. The tail segment is left behind.\n> \n> So, for a cell that was occupied by a body segment, if the head moves there, it depends on which segment it is.\n> \n> Specifically, if the head moves to the current position of segment i, then after movement, segment i will have moved to segment i-1 position, so the cell is now occupied by the head, and segment i is gone if it's not the tail.\n> \n> But collision occurs if after movement, the head is on a cell that has another body segment.\n> \n> To avoid confusion: it's deadly if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by any body segment except the current tail segment. Because when the head moves to the tail position, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> But if head moves to a non-tail body segment, that segment is still there when head arrives, so collision.\n> \n> In this case, for (3,4), it is occupied by segment 7, which is not the tail (tail is segment 19 at (3,2)), so moving to (3,4) would cause collision because segment 7 is still there when head moves in.\n> \n> Similarly, for (3,2), it is occupied by the tail, segment 19. When head moves to (3,2), the tail will move away to the previous segment position, so the cell is vacated, and no collision.\n> \n> Similarly, for (4,3), it's empty, so safe.\n> \n> So for current position (3,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - R to (4,3): empty, safe\n> \n> - U to (3,4): occupied by body (segment 7), not tail, so collision, deadly\n> \n> - D to (3,2): occupied by tail, so safe, since tail moves\n> \n> - L to (2,3): but cannot, reverse direction not allowed, and (2,3) is also body segment 1, not tail.\n> \n> So only safe moves are R to (4,3) or D to (3,2).\n> \n> Now, food: we have food at (4,4) and (1,4).\n> \n> (4,4) is currently occupied by snake body segment 8: (4,4). So we can't eat it now; we need to move away and come back later.\n> \n> (1,4) is free, but not adjacent; it's at (1,4), head at (3,3), so not directly accessible yet.\n> \n> Now, life spans: (4,4) food will disappear after turn 92, so we have until turn 92 to eat it.\n> \n> (1,4) until turn 94.\n> \n> I need to plan 5+ turns ahead: from turn 90 to at least 95.\n> \n> But action sequence should start from turn 90.\n> \n> First, I need to choose an action for turn 90.\n> \n> Options: move R or move D.\n> \n> If move R to (4,3), then head at (4,3), direction now R (since moved right).\n> \n> If move D to (3,2), head at (3,2), direction D.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the food at (4,4).

No.\n> \n> After move, the cell (4,4) may be occupied or not.\n> \n> Specifically, after moving on turn 91, the snake body segments are updated.\n> \n> For example, if I move to a new head position, say to (3,1) for down.\n> \n> Then new head: (3,1)\n> \n> New body: segment 1: old head (3,2)\n> \n> Segment 2: old segment 1 (3,3)\n> \n> Segment 3: old segment 2 (2,3)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Up to segment 19: old segment 18 (5,2)\n> \n> Segment 20: old segment 19 (4,2) but tail is segment 19, now the last segment is at old segment 18 position? Let's index properly.\n> \n> Snake has 20 segments. After move, the new snake: head is new position, then segment 1 is old head, segment 2 is old segment 1, ..., segment 19 is old segment 18, segment 20 is old segment 19 (tail).\n> \n> In positions list: new head, then the previous positions from index 0 to 18 become the new body, with new index 1 to 19.\n> \n> So the cell that was occupied by index 9 (4,4) is now free, because index 9 has moved to the position of old index 8, which is (3,4), so (4,4) is no longer occupied by snake, unless some other segment moves there, but in this case, since we're shifting, (4,4) is vacated.\n> \n> Generally, when snake moves, the tail position is vacated, and head occupies a new cell, intermediate cells shift but don't vacate except tail.\n> \n> Specifically, only the tail cell is freed if no food, but for body cells, when snake moves, the cell that was tail is freed, and all other body cells are still occupied but by different segments.\n> \n> For a cell that was occupied by a non-tail segment, after move, it is now occupied by the next segment or freed? No.\n> \n> For example, take a cell occupied by segment i.\n> \n> After move, segment i moves to the position of segment i-1 (for i>0), so the cell that was segment i is now free only if no other segment moves there, but since segments are moving to previous positions, the only cell freed is the one that was the tail position.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 91 start, (4,4) is occupied by segment 9.\n> \n> After move, segment 9 moves to the position of segment 8, which is (3,4), so (4,4) is no longer occupied by segment 9, and since no other segment moves to (4,4) (because segments move to previous positions), (4,4) is free after the move.\n> \n> Similarly, the tail position (4,2) is also vacated, but that's separate.\n> \n> So after any move, all cells that were occupied are vacated except that the new positions are occupied.\n> \n> But for (4,4), after turn 91 move, it should be free, because segment 9 moves away to (3,4), and no segment comes to (4,4) unless the head moves there, but head is moving to a new cell.\n> \n> In general, when snake moves, the only cells that change are: head moves to new cell, tail leaves its cell, and all other segments shift to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the cell that was tail is freed, and the new cell is occupied by head.\n> \n> For other cells, they may be occupied by different segments but the cell is still occupied.\n> \n> For example, cell (3,4) was occupied by segment 8. After move, segment 8 moves to position of segment 7, which is (3,5), so (3,4) is now occupied by segment 9, who moved there from (4,4).\n> \n> So (3,4) is still occupied, but by a different segment.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) was occupied by segment 9, who moves to (3,4), so (4,4) is no longer occupied, and it becomes free.\n> \n> Yes, so after each move, the cell that was the position of the last segment (tail) is freed, and also any cell that was occupied only by a segment that moved away, but in this case, since segments move to adjacent cells, only the tail cell is freed, and the head occupies a new cell.\n> \n> In the shifting, the cell that was the tail is freed, and the new head cell is occupied; for other cells, they remain occupied by the body.\n> \n> But in terms of grid cells, for a specific cell, if it was occupied by a segment that is not the tail, after move, that segment moves to another cell, and the cell may be occupied by another segment or free.\n> \n> In this case, for (4,4), it was occupied by segment 9. After move, segment 9 moves to (3,4), so (4,4) is vacated. Is there another segment moving to (4,4)? No, because segments are moving to the previous positions of earlier segments, so (4,4) is not the target for any other segment. Therefore, (4,4) becomes free after the move.\n> \n> Similarly for any body cell except the tail: when the segment moves away, the cell is freed, and no one moves in, so it's free.\n> \n> The tail cell is also freed when tail moves away.\n> \n> Only if a segment moves into that cell, but in snake movement, segments only move to the position of the previous segment, so they don't move to a new cell except the head.\n> \n> So yes, after each move, all cells that were occupied are vacated except that the new positions are occupied, but for the grid, the set of occupied cells changes: the old tail cell is removed, and the new head cell is added. Other cells remain occupied by the same or different segments, but the occupancy is the same for collision purposes.\n> \n> For collision detection, we care about which cells are occupied at a given time.\n> \n> After a move, the new set of occupied cells is determined.\n> \n> For (4,4), at turn 91 start, it is occupied.\n> \n> After turn 91 move, it is no longer occupied, because segment 9 has moved to (3,4), and no segment is at (4,4) anymore.\n> \n> Therefore, at the beginning of turn 92, (4,4) is free and has food, so I can potentially move there.\n> \n> Similarly for other cells.\n> \n> So for (4,4) food, since it has life span 2, present at turn 91 and 92.\n> \n> At turn 91, it is occupied, so I cannot eat it on turn 91.\n> \n> At turn 92, it will be free (after turn 91 move), so I can eat it on turn 92 by moving head to (4,4) on turn 92.\n> \n> Similarly, for (6,6), it is at index 13, which is not tail, so after any move, it will be freed eventually, but I need to plan to move head there.\n> \n> But (6,6) has long life, so not urgent.\n> \n> Now, back to turn 91 actions.\n> \n> I want to eat (4,4) on turn 92.\n> \n> To do that, on turn 92, I need to move head to (4,4).\n> \n> But on turn 92, the head position depends on where I am after turn 91.\n> \n> So I need to choose turn 91 action such that after moving, on turn 92, I can move to (4,4).\n> \n> First, after turn 91 move, (4,4) is free, as we established.\n> \n> Now, where will the head be after turn 91 move?\n> \n> That depends on what action I take on turn 91.\n> \n> Current head at (3,2), direction D.\n> \n> Possible actions: D, L, R (U not possible)\n> \n> If I move D to (3,1), then new head is (3,1), and positions shift: new body starts from old head (3,2), then (3,3), etc.\n> \n> If I move L to (2,2), new head (2,2), body: old head (3,2), then (3,3), etc.\n> \n> If I move R to (4,2), new head (4,2), body: old head (3,2), then (3,3), etc.\n> \n> Now, on turn 92, I want to move to (4,4).\n> \n> (4,4) is at (4,4).\n> \n> From the new head position on turn 92, I need to be able to move to (4,4) in one step.\n> \n> So the new head after turn 91 must be adjacent to (4,4).\n> \n> Adjacent cells to (4,4): (4,3), (4,5), (3,4), (5,4)\n> \n> (4,5) is occupied?

(3,3), new segment 3: (2,3), new segment 4: (2,4), new segment 5: (2,5), new segment 6: (2,6), new segment 7: (3,6), new segment 8: (3,5), new segment 9: (3,4), new segment 10: (4,4), so (4,4) occupied by segment 10.\n> \n> Same.\n> \n> Perhaps I need to move multiple times.\n> \n> For instance, if I move the head down, then the body follows, and (4,4) might be free after several moves, but for (4,4), with life span 2, I only have this turn and next to eat, so I can't.\n> \n> Turn 91 and 92 are the only chances, but on turn 91 it's occupied, on turn 92 after move it's still occupied, so I think it's impossible to eat (4,4) because it's under the body and I can't free it in time.\n> \n> But that can't be right; the rules imply it's possible.\n> \n> Another possibility: when the snake moves, if the segment at (4,4) moves away, and the cell is not occupied immediately, but in the next turn, it could be free.\n> \n> At the start of turn 92, after the turn 91 move, the positions are set, and if (4,4) is not occupied then, it is free.\n> \n> But in our case, after move, it is occupied.\n> \n> Unless the segment that was at (4,4) moves, and no one moves in, but in the shifting, someone does move in.\n> \n> For example, if the snake is moving in a way that the body is not straight.\n> \n> In this case, around (4,4), the snake is at (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), so it's like a corner.\n> \n> From (3,4) to (4,4) to (4,5), so it turned from left to up or something.\n> \n> If I move the head, the segment at (4,4) will move to where segment 8 was, which is (3,4), so to (3,4), and then the segment that was at (4,5) will move to (4,4), so (4,4) is occupied by the next segment.\n> \n> So always, when the body moves, the cells are filled by the following segments.\n> \n> The only way to free a cell is if it was the tail.\n> \n> Therefore, for a food under a non-tail body segment, it can only be eaten if that segment becomes the tail, which requires the snake to shorten, or if the snake moves so that the body leaves that cell uncovered, which might happen if the snake is coiled and uncoils, but in this case with fixed length, it's difficult.\n> \n> For example, if the snake makes a loop and then straightens, but here the snake is long and the grid is small, it might not be practical.\n> \n> For (4,4), with only 2 turns left, it's impossible to eat it, so I should ignore it and focus on other food.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,6), it has long life, so I can plan to eat it later.\n> \n> So for now, I should focus on the available food at (1,4) or other moves.\n> \n> Also, (6,6) is under body, same issue, but I can free it later.\n> \n> First, let's accept that (4,4) cannot be eaten due to time constraints, so I won't try for it.\n> \n> Then, food at (1,4) is free and can be eaten.\n> \n> Also, (6,6) can be targeted later.\n> \n> Now, current position (3,2), direction D.\n> \n> Possible actions: D, L, R.\n> \n> If I move D to (3,1): this is close to bottom

right area.\n> \n> Also, need to avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's think about the tail reward danger.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,2), head at (3,2), so they are adjacent, but not on the same cell, so no issue unless I move to tail.\n> \n> If I move R to (4,2), I move to tail position, which is safe because tail moves away.\n> \n> But there is no food at (4,2), so no danger.\n> \n> Now, after moving, the tail position changes.\n> \n> I should plan a sequence to eat (1,4) or (6,6).\n> \n> (1,4) has life span 4, so I have until turn 94 to eat it.\n> \n> (6,6) has 10, plenty of time.\n> \n> Also, the

That makes sense with the numbers.\n> \n> In the text: \" (1, 4, 3, 1) \" – I think it's (x,y, value, life_span), so (1,4) has value 3, life_span 1.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) has value 1, life_span 1, and (6,6) has value 9, life_span 1.\n> \n> All food has life_span 1, meaning they will all disappear after this turn if not eaten now.\n> \n> Life_span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t1=92, for a food with life_span 1, it will be present during turn 92, but after turn 92, before turn 93, it disappears.

Let's list the positions in order: head (2,1), then (2,2), (3,2), etc. Since head direction is D, and previous move was down, I assume.\n> \n> Food: two items:\n> \n> - (1,4) with value 1 and life span 3\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1 and life span 8\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1. Life span means they disappear after that many turns, including current turn. So for (1,4), life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 93 + 3 - 1? Life span decreases every turn including current. So at turn 93, life span is 3, then turn 94 it becomes 2, turn 95 it becomes 1, and on turn 96 it disappears. Similarly for (6,6), life span 8, disappears after turn 93 + 8 - 1 = turn 100? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn t: life span N\n> \n> - After turn t, it decreases to N-1\n> \n> - When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or after?

So from head to second segment, (2,1) to (2,2), which is same x, y increased by 1. If head direction is D (down), but moving to (2,2) with higher y, that suggests that y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, so moving down decreases y.\n> \n> But here, from (2,1) to (2,2), y increased, so it moved up, not down. But head direction is given as D, down. Contradiction.\n> \n> Perhaps the direction is the current moving direction, but the positions are listed with head first, so the movement from previous turn brought it to (2,1) with direction D, meaning it came from above? Let's see the previous position.\n> \n> The snake positions are the current positions at turn 93. Head is at (2,1), and the second segment is at (2,2). That means the head was at (2,2) previously and moved down to (2,1)? Let's think.\n> \n> In snake games, the positions list is ordered from head to tail.

So at turn 92, head was at (2,2), and it moved to (2,1) for turn 93, which is down if y=0 is bottom. So from (2,2) to (2,1), y decreased, so direction down is decreasing y.\n> \n> Therefore, in this grid, y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top row.

Since we are at (4,1) at start of turn 95, and (1,4) is 3 cells away, we can't reach it in one move. So impossible to eat (1,4) on turn 95.

or L to (5,1), but not left to row 5 or down.\n> \n> To reach (1,1), we need to go to (1,1) from (1,2) or (2,1), but (2,1) occupied, so only from (1,2).\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) can be reached from (1,2) or (1,4) or (2,3), but (2,3) occupied, so from (1,2) or (1,4).\n> \n> But (1,4) has food but disappearing.\n> \n> The point is, to access (1,2), we must first be at (1,1) or (1,3), and to be at (1,1), we must come from (1,2) or from outside, but since row 2 blocked, we can only come from (1,1) itself or from adjacent in row 1.\n> \n> So the only way to enter row 1 is from the right, from (2,1) but (2,1) occupied, or from (1,1) to (1,2), etc., but we are not on row 1.\n> \n> Currently, the snake head is at (4,1), which is on row 1, x=4,y=1.\n> \n> (4,1) is on row 1.\n> \n> From (4,1), we can move to (4,2) or (5,1), both not on row 1 except (5,1) is row 1.\n> \n> (5,1) is also row 1.\n> \n> From (4,1), if we move R to (5,1), we are still on row 1.\n> \n> Then from (5,1), we can move R to (6,1) or U to (5,2).\n> \n> If we move to (6,1), then from (6,1), we can move U to (6,2) or L to (5,1).\n> \n> To go to (1,1), we need to move left on row 1.\n> \n> From (4,1), we can only move right to (5,1), not left.\n> \n> From (5,1), we can only move right to (6,1) or up to (5,2), not left to (4,1) occupied.\n> \n> From (6,1), we can only move up or left to (5,1), not further left.\n> \n> So once we move right from (4,1), we cannot go back left on row 1 because the cells are occupied or we can't move opposite.\n> \n> Specifically, from (4,1), only R to (5,1).\n> \n> From (5,1), only U or R.\n> \n> If R to (6,1), then from (6,1), only U or L to (5,1).\n> \n> No way to go to (3,1) or left.\n> \n> The left part of row 1, (1,1) to (3,1), is blocked because (3,1) is occupied, and we can't access it.\n> \n> (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), etc. are free, but we can only reach them if we are already on row 1 and move left, but we can't move left from (4,1) or (5,1).\n> \n> Therefore, it is impossible to reach the food at (1,2) because the snake body blocks access to the left part of row 1.\n> \n> Similarly for (1,4).\n> \n> Since we are at (4,1) and can only go right or up, we cannot go left to reach (1,2) or (1,4).\n> \n> So the foods on the left are unreachable for the snake.\n> \n> Is that correct?\n> \n> For example, if we move U to (4,2) at turn 95, then we are on row 2, but row 2 is fully occupied except we are at (4,2), which is free.\n> \n> From (4,2), we can go to (4,3) or (5,2), both not row 1.\n> \n> To go to row 1, from (4,2), we could move D to (4,1), but (4,1) is occupied by body, and opposite direction if we came from U, so not allowed.\n> \n> Similarly, from other positions, no way to enter row 1 from above because row 2 is solid snake except at (4,2) or (5,2), but from there, moving down to row 1 is to (4,1) or (5,1), which may be occupied or not.\n> \n> At turn 95 after moving U to (4,2), (4,1) is occupied by body, so we can't move down to it.\n> \n> Similarly, if we were at (5,2), (5,1) might be free or occupied depending on position.\n> \n> But in any case, to reach (1,2), we need to be on (1,1) or (1,3), which are on row 1, and we can't get there.\n> \n> So yes, the left food at (1,2) and (1,4) are unreachable because the snake body blocks the access, and we can't go back.\n> \n> Therefore, we should forget about those foods and focus on the other food or survival.\n> \n> Food at (6,6) is on the body, so we need to free it.\n> \n> Also, there might be other areas.\n> \n> But (6,6) has food, life span 7.\n> \n> Now, the tail is at

current snake, after turn 94, positions include (6,6).\n> \n> As the snake moves, the segment at (6,6) will move to where the previous segment was, but it's a chain.\n> \n> To free (6,6), we need the snake to move in such a way that the part of the body on (6,6) leaves it, and no other body is there, then head can move to it.\n> \n> But it's complicated.\n> \n> Perhaps we can go to the free areas on the right.\n> \n> Free cells include (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (4,2), (4,3), etc.\n> \n> From current position (4,1), at turn 95, we can move U to (4,2) or R to (5,1).\n> \n> Moving U to (4,2) gets us to a central area, from which we can explore the free space.\n> \n> Moving R to (5,1) also.\n> \n> But since we need to think long-term, and (1,4) is disappearing, but unreachable, so ignore.\n> \n> For the food at (6,6), it is under the body, so to eat it, we need the head to be able to move to (6,6) after it is free.\n> \n> Currently, (6,6) is occupied by the 16th segment or something.\n> \n> Let's see the snake movement.\n> \n> Suppose we want to move the tail away from (6,6).\n> \n> The tail is at (6,4) after turn 94 move, but (6,6) is occupied.\n> \n> As the snake moves, the body segments shift.\n> \n> For example, if we move right or up, the segment at (6,6) will move to where the next segment was, but it's messy.\n> \n> Perhaps we should focus on not dying and eating available food, but in this case, no food is easily accessible except by freeing (6,6).\n> \n> There is food at (1,2), but unreachable.\n> \n> Another idea: the snake can move into the free space and possibly food will spawn later, but the rules don't say new food spawns, only the existing food with life span.\n> \n> In this state, only three food items, and two will disappear or are unreachable.\n> \n> (1,4) disappears after turn 95, so gone.\n> \n> (1,2) has life span 10, but unreachable.\n> \n> (6,6) has food under body.\n> \n> So we need to free (6,6).\n> \n> How to do that?\n> \n> The cell (6,6) will be freed when the segment that is on it moves away.\n> \n> In the snake body, the segment at (6,6) will move to the position of the segment before it in the next turn, depending on the movement.\n> \n> Let's denote the positions after turn 94: let's index them for clarity.\n> \n> Set positions at start of turn 95, after action of turn 94.\n> \n> Head at (4,1), body: let's list in order:\n> \n> 0: (4,1) head\n> \n> 1: (3,1)\n> \n> 2: (2,1)\n> \n> 3: (2,2)\n> \n> 4: (3,2)\n> \n> 5: (3,3)\n> \n> 6: (2,3)\n> \n> 7: (2,4)\n> \n> 8: (2,5)\n> \n> 9: (2,6)\n> \n> 10:

position 17.\n> \n> To free (6,6), we need position 17 to move away.\n> \n> Position 17 will move to where position 16 is, but position 16 is (5,6), so if the snake moves, position 17 will become position 16's position, which is (5,6), but (5,6) is occupied by position 16, which will move to position 15's position, etc.\n> \n> When the head moves, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So after a move, position i new = position i-1 old.\n> \n> For example, after head moves to new head, body 1 new = head old, body 2 new = body 1 old, ..., tail new = body 19 old.\n> \n> So for cell (6,6), it is currently occupied by body 17.\n> \n> After one move, body 17 new = body 16 old position, which is (5,6).\n> \n> So (6,6) is no longer occupied by body 17; instead, body 17 is at (5,6).\n> \n> But (5,6) was occupied by body 16, which moves to body 15 old, etc.\n> \n> So after one move, (6,6) is free, unless the tail was there, but tail is at (6,4), so after move, (6,6) is empty.\n> \n> Let's see.\n> \n> At turn 95, we move the head.\n> \n> Suppose we move head to (4,2) U.\n> \n> Then new head: (4,2)\n> \n> New body: 1: old head (4,1)\n> \n> 2: old

old body16 (5,6)\n> \n> 18: old body17 (6,6)\n> \n> 19: old body18 (6,5)\n> \n> And tail is old body19 (6,4), removed.\n> \n> So now, (6,6) is occupied by new body 18, which is old body17 at (6,6)? New body 18 is old body17, which was at (6,6), so new body 18 is at (6,6)? Old body17 was at (6,6), and new body 18 = old body17, so new body 18 is at (6,6), same position.\n> \n> After moving head to (4,2), the body segments shift, so the segment that was at (6,6) (old body17) is now at new position for body 18, but since it moves to the position of the previous segment, new body 18 position = old body17 position = (6,6), so it stays at (6,6) if the snake doesn't move in a way that changes, but in this case, since the head moved away, the body shifts, but the position (6,6) might still be occupied if the segment doesn't move.\n> \n> In this shift, for body 18 new, it is set to old body17 position, which is (6,6), so yes, (6,6) is still occupied by body 18 new.\n> \n> Similarly, if the head moves in any direction, the body segment at (6,6) may stay or move depending on the chain.\n> \n> To free (6,6), we need the segment that is on it to move to a different cell.\n> \n> That happens when the snake moves and the segment before it moves, but in a straight line, it might not change.\n> \n> For example, if the snake is moving in a way that the body is shifting, but if the segment before (6,6) is moving, it might cause (6,6) to move.\n> \n> In this case, the segment at (6,6) is body 17, which will move to where body 16 is now.\n> \n> Body 16 is at (5,6), so if body 16 moves, but body 16 moves to where body 15 is, etc.\n> \n> But when the head moves, all body segments move to the position of the previous one.\n> \n> So the new position of the segment that was at (6,6) is the old position of the segment before it, which is body 16 at (5,6).\n> \n> So after any move, the segment that was at (6,6) will be at (5,6) if body 16 was at (5,6) and didn't move, but body 16 may have moved.\n> \n> After one move, the cell (6,6) is occupied by the segment that was at (6,5) or something.\n> \n> Let's calculate.\n> \n> Old positions:\n> body 16: (5,6)\n> body 17: (6,6)\n> body 18: (6,5)\n> body 19: (6,4)\n> \n> After head move, new body 17 = old body16 position = (5,6)\n> new body 18 = old body17 position = (6,6)\n> new body 19 = old body18 position = (6,5)\n> \n> And tail removed.\n> \n> So new body 18 is at (6,6), so (6,6) is still occupied.\n> \n> If we move again, new body 18 will be at new body 17 old position, which is (5,6), and so on.\n> \n> To free (6,6), we need the segment that is on it to move away, and no other segment to move in, but since the snake is connected, it will be occupied until the tail passes.\n> \n> Specifically, (6,6) will be freed when the tail moves away from it, but the tail is at (6,4), not on (6,6).\n> \n> The segment on (6,6) will move when the snake moves, but it may take several moves for that segment to be the tail and move away.\n> \n> Currently, body 17 is at (6,6), and there are segments after it: body 18 at (6,5), body 19 at (6,4).\n> \n> When the snake moves, body 17 will move to (5,6), body 18 to (6,6), body 19 to (6,5), so (6,6) is still occupied.\n> \n> After another move, body 17 to where body16 was, etc., but body 17 will eventually move to positions closer to head, but (6,6) may be occupied by later segments.\n> \n> The point (6,6) will be occupied until the tail is at (6,6) and moves away.\n> \n> But the tail is at (6,4), so it will take several turns for the tail to reach (6,6).\n> \n> The distance: from body 17 at (6,6) to tail body 19 at (6,4), but they are not in line; body 17 (6,6), body 18 (6,5), body 19 (6,4), so it's a straight line down.\n> \n> When the snake moves, each segment moves to the previous position.\n> \n> So after one move, new body 17 at (5,6), new body 18 at (6,6), new body 19 at (6,5)\n> \n> After two moves, new body 17 at where body16 was two moves ago, but it's messy.\n> \n> The cell (6,6) will be occupied as long as there is a body segment assigned to it in the chain.\n> \n> Specifically, since body 18 is now at (6,6) after first move, and it will stay until it moves to the position of body 17, which is moving.\n> \n> But to free (6,6), we need the segment that is on it to be the tail and the tail to move away.\n> \n> Currently, the tail is at (6,4), and (6,6) is occupied by body 17.\n> \n> The number of segments between head and (6,6) is 17 segments away? Head is at 0, body 17 is at index 17, so there are 17 segments before it, so it will take at least 17 moves for that segment to become the tail, but as the snake moves, the tail shortens only if no food eaten, but since no food eaten, tail moves, so the segment at (6,6) will be the tail after 19 moves or something.\n> \n> It's complicated, and we have only 5+ turns to think, but for the food, we can eat it when it's free.\n> \n> But life span is 7, so we have time.\n> \n> Perhaps for now, we should focus on moving to safe areas and surviving.\n> \n> At turn 95, from (4,1), we can move U or R.\n> \n> Moving U to (4,2) might be better to access the center free cells like (4,3), (5,3), etc.\n> \n> Moving R to (5,1) accesses (5,2), (6,1), etc.\n> \n> Both are possible.\n> \n> But we need to avoid risks.\n> \n> Also, there is the tail danger, but not now.\n> \n> Let's look at the food at (1,2), but we decided it's unreachable, so ignore.\n> \n> Similarly for (1,4).\n> \n> So only food is at (6,6), under body.\n> \n> But we can eat other food if it spawns, but no new food mentioned, so only existing.\n> \n> Perhaps we should move towards the free areas to have space.\n> \n> For example, from (4,1), move U to (4,2).\n> \n> Then at (4,2), we can move U to (4,3) or R to (5,2).\n> \n> Say move U to (4,3).\n> \n> Then at (4,3), only possible move R to (5,3) because U to (4,4) occupied, D to (4,2) occupied and opposite, L to (3,3) occupied.\n> \n> So move R to (5,3).\n> \n> Head at (5,3), direction R.\n> \n> Then possible moves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2), L to (4,3) occupied, R to (6,3).\n> \n> U, D, R possible.\n> \n> (5,4) is free, (5,2) is free, (6,3) free.\n> \n> And so on.\n> \n> From (5,3), we can go to (5,4) or (6,3) or (5,2).\n> \n> (5,4) is free, etc.\n> \n> Similarly, if we moved R from (4,1) to (5,1) at turn 95, then from (5,1), move U to (5,2) or R to (6,1).\n> \n> Then to (5,2) or (6,1), etc.\n> \n> Both paths lead to the free area on the right.\n> \n> Since we need to provide an action sequence for 5+ turns, but the state changes, so we need to plan a path.\n> \n> But with the body moving, it's dynamic.\n> \n> Perhaps for the answer, we can choose a safe sequence.\n> \n> Since for turn 94, only possible action is R, as we established.\n> \n> Then for turn 95, we can choose U or R.\n> \n> Let's choose to move U at turn 95 to (4,2) to go up.\n> \n> Then turn 96, from (4,2), move U to (4,3) as above.\n> \n> Turn 97, from (4,3), move R to (5,3).\n> \n> Turn 98, from (5,3), we can move U to (5,4), for example.\n> \n> Turn 99, from (5,4), move U to (5,5) but (5,5) is occupied by snake body, collision?

There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (4,1), and the body segments follow. The head direction is R, meaning it's moving right.

No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's look at the snake's current position and possible moves. Head is at (4,1), direction R. From here, possible moves are U (up), D (down), L (left), or R (right). But since current direction is R, moving L would be an instant reverse, which is not allowed. So I cannot move left; only U, D, or R are possible.\n> \n> Now, check for collisions or dangers.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,1):\n> - U: to (4,2)\n> - D: to (4,0) but y=0 is a wall, so that's invalid. D would be (x,y-1) = (4,1-1)=(4,0), which is a wall cell. So D is not possible.\n> - L: to (3,1), but (3,1) is occupied by the second segment of the snake. Snake positions: head (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), etc. So (3,1) is the body, but it's the segment right after the head. Since the snake is moving, when the head moves, the tail will also move, so moving to (3,1) might be possible if it's the tail, but let's see.\n> \n> General rule: moving into a body segment is deadly, except if it's the tail segment, because when you move, the tail moves away, so it's safe to move into the tail cell as long as it's not occupied after the move.\n> \n> In this case, the tail is at (6,4), I think. Let's list the positions:\n> \n> Snake positions: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)]\n> \n> So head: (4,1)\n> \n> Body: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), ..., up to tail: (6,4)\n> \n> Now, from head (4,1), moving L to (3,1): (3,1) is occupied by the second segment. Since it's not the tail, and after moving, that segment will still be there or move, it's a collision. Specifically, if head moves to (3,1), but (3,1) is currently occupied by a body part, and since the body doesn't disappear instantly, it would cause a collision unless it's the tail and we're eating food or something, but here no food is involved.\n> \n> Rule: body collision if head touches any body segment except when moving into the tail cell, because the tail moves.\n> \n> But (3,1) is not the tail; it's the second segment. Tail is at (6,4). So moving to (3,1) would cause a collision because (3,1) will be occupied by the second segment when the head moves there, but the second segment might move to where the head was? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> When the snake moves:\n> - Head moves to a new cell.\n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> - The tail segment is removed if no food eaten, or if food eaten, a new segment is added at the end.\n> \n> But for collision, the head should not collide with any part of the body that will exist after the move.\n> \n> Standard snake rules: if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by any body segment except the very last one (tail), it collides. But if it moves to the tail cell, it's safe because the tail will move away.\n> \n> In this case, from (4,1), moving left to (3,1): (3,1) is currently occupied by the second segment. After the move:\n> - Head moves to (3,1)\n> - The second segment (currently at (3,1)) will move to where the head was, (4,1), so when head moves to (3,1), that cell is now free because the segment that was there is moving to (4,1). But at the moment of move, if (3,1) has a body part, it's a collision.\n> \n> I think there's ambiguity. But from the core rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, it says you can move into the tail cell because the tail moves, implying that for other body segments, you cannot move into them because they don't move away instantly.\n> \n> In this position, (3,1) is not the tail; it's the second segment. Tail is (6,4). So moving to (3,1) should cause a collision because (3,1) is occupied by a body segment (index 1) and it's not the tail.\n> \n> Similarly, moving down to (4,0) is a wall, invalid.\n> \n> Moving up to (4,2): what is at (4,2)? From the list, (4,2) is not in the snake positions; positions are: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), ... so (4,2) is not listed, so it should be empty.\n> \n> Let's list all occupied cells to avoid:\n> \n> Snake cells: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal (4,6)\n> \n> So (4,6) is a wall, not part of snake.\n> \n> Now, (4,2): not in snake positions, not wall, so should be free.\n> \n> (4,0) is wall.\n> \n> (5,1) is not listed, so should be free? Moving right to (5,1).\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,1):\n> - U: (4,2) - y+1, so (4,1) to (4,2)\n> - D: (4,0) - but y=0 wall, invalid\n> - L: (3,1) - occupied by snake body (second segment), so collision if move there\n> - R: (5,1) - not occupied, not wall, so valid.\n> \n> Also, since direction is R, moving L is reverse, which is not allowed anyway. So only U and R are possible valid moves? D is wall, L is invalid due to reverse and body, so only U and R.\n> \n> U to (4,2) and R to (5,1).\n> \n> Now, I need to consider the food.\n> \n> Food at:\n> - (1,4) with life span 1, so it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now.\n> - (6,6) with life span 6\n> - (1,2) with life span 9\n> \n> (1,4) is at (1,4), which is not adjacent to head. Head is at (4,1), so (1,4) is 3 units away in x and 3 in y, so not reachable in one move.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) is at (1,2), also not adjacent.\n> \n> (6,6) is at (6,6), which is occupied by the snake! Snake positions include (6,6), which is the 17th segment or something. Positions: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4) — so (6,6) is part of the snake body.\n> \n> But food can spawn under the snake's body, as per rules. So (6,6) has food with value 1, life span 6.\n> \n> But to eat it, the snake must move away from that cell, and then the head must move onto it when it's free.\n> \n> Currently, (6,6) is occupied by a body segment, so the head cannot move there directly; it must be vacated first.\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> Now, for turn 95, I need to choose an action.\n> \n> Options: U to (4,2) or R to (5,1).\n> \n> If I go U to (4,2), what happens? (4,2) is free, no issue.\n> \n> Then snake head moves to (4,2), and the tail will move, but no food eaten, so tail at (6,4) is removed, new positions: head (4,2), then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) — (6,4) is gone since no growth.\n> \n> The segment that was at (6,4) is removed, so positions from index 1 to 19: (4,1) becomes new body, (3,1), etc., up to (6,5) as tail.\n> \n> Similarly, if I go R to (5,1), head to (5,1), then body: (4,1), (3,1), ..., up to (6,5) as tail, (6,4) removed.\n> \n> Now, food at (1,4) has life span 1, so if not eaten this turn, it disappears. But head is at (4,1), cannot reach (1,4) in one move, so impossible to eat it this turn. So it will disappear after this turn regardless.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) has life span 9, so plenty of time.\n> \n> (6,6) has food under it, life span 6, so it will be there for 6 turns including this one.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about eating (6,6) food. But it's under the body, so I need to move the snake such that (6,6) is vacated, then head can move there.\n> \n> Currently, (6,6) is occupied by a body segment. In the position list, it's the 17th segment: indices 0=head, 1= (3,1), ..., 16= (5,6), 17= (6,6), 18= (6,5), 19= (6,4) tail.\n> \n> When the snake moves without eating, the tail moves away. So if I move, the tail (6,4) is removed, and the segment at (6,5) becomes new tail, (6,6) becomes (6,5)? Let's see movement.\n> \n> After one move without eating, head moves to new position, each segment shifts forward, tail is removed.\n> \n> So for example, if head moves to (4,2), new positions: head (4,2), then body: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) — so (6,6) is still occupied, by the 18th segment now? Index: 0=(4,2), 1=(4,1), 2=(3,1), ..., 17=(6,6), 18=(6,5) tail.

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state of the game at Turn 96:\n\n- **Grid Dimensions**: The playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), with walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n- **Snake**: \n  - Positions (head first): [(4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)]\n  - Head Direction: Up (U)\n- **Food**:\n  - (6,6): Value = +1, Life Span = 6\n  - (1,2): Value = +1, Life Span = 8\n\n### Possible Immediate Actions\n\nThe snake's head is at (4,2), moving Up (U). The possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (4,3)\n   - (4,3) is not occupied by the snake's body and is within bounds.\n2. **Left (L)**: (3,2)\n   - (3,2) is occupied by the snake's body (index 5), so this is invalid.\n3. **Right (R)**: (5,2)\n   - (5,2) is not occupied and is within bounds.\n4. **Down (D)**: (4,1)\n   - (4,1) is occupied by the snake's body (index 1), and moving Down is the opposite of the current direction (Up), which is not allowed.\n\nThus, the valid immediate actions are **Up (U)** or **Right (R)**.\n\n### Evaluating the Food\n\nThere are two pieces of food:\n\n1. **(6,6)**:\n   - Currently occupied by the snake's body (index 18).\n   - To eat it, the snake must move so that the body leaves (6,6), and then the head moves onto it.\n   - Life Span: 6 turns remaining (will disappear after Turn 102).\n2. **(1,2)**:\n   - Not occupied by the snake.\n   - Life Span: 8 turns remaining (will disappear after Turn 104).\n\nGiven the shorter life span of the food at (6,6), it's more urgent to target this food first.\n\n### Planning the Path to (6,6)\n\nTo reach (6,6), the snake needs to move right and then up. Here's a possible sequence:\n\n1. **Turn 96**: Move Right (R) to (5,2)\n   - New head position: (5,2)\n   - Direction: Right (R)\n2. **Turn 97**: Move Right (R) to (6,2)\n   - New head position: (6,2)\n   - Direction: Right (R)\n3. **Turn 98**: Move Up (U) to (6,3)\n   - New head position: (6,3)\n   - Direction: Up (U)\n4. **Turn 99**: Move Up (U) to (6,4)\n5. **Turn 100**: Move Up (U) to (6,5)\n6. **Turn 101**: Move Up (U) to (6,6) and eat the food.\n\nThis sequence ensures that by Turn 101, the snake's head reaches (6,6) when the food's life span is still 1 (just before it disappears at Turn 102).\n\n### Verifying Safety of the Path\n\nLet's check for collisions at each step:\n\n- **Turn 96**: Move R to (5,2)\n  - (5,2) is free.\n- **Turn 97**: Move R to (6,2)\n  - (6,2) is free.\n- **Turn 98**: Move U to (6,3)\n  - (6,3) is free.\n- **Turn 99**: Move U to (6,4)\n  - (6,4) is free.\n- **Turn 100**: Move U to (6,5)\n  - (6,5) is free.\n- **Turn 101**: Move U to (6,6)\n  - (6,6) has food and is free (since the body segment moved away in previous turns).\n\nNo collisions occur in this path.\n\n### Alternative Path: Starting with Up (U)\n\nAlternatively, starting with Up:\n\n1. **Turn 96**: Move Up (U) to (4,3)\n   - New head position: (4,3)\n   - Direction: Up (U)\n2. **Turn 97**: Must move Right (R) to (5,3) (other moves are blocked or opposite)\n   - New head position: (5,3)\n   - Direction: Right (R)\n3. **Turn 98**: Move Right (R) to (6,3)\n4. **Turn 99**: Move Up (U) to (6,4)\n5. **Turn 100**: Move Up (U) to (6,5)\n6. **Turn 101**: Move Up (U) to (6,6) and eat.\n\nThis also reaches (6,6) by Turn 101 but offers less flexibility after the initial move.\n\n### Deciding Between U and R at Turn 96\n\nStarting with **Right (R)** seems slightly better because:\n\n- It positions the snake closer to the right side early, allowing more flexibility in subsequent moves.\n- The path is straightforward with clear moves to the target.\n\nStarting with **Up (U)** forces a right move at Turn 97, which is less flexible.\n\n### Considering the Other Food at (1,2)\n\nThe food at (1,2) has a longer life span (8 turns), but given the snake's current position and the grid's constraints, reaching it within the remaining life span is impractical:\n\n- Distance from (4,2) to (1,2): 3 left and 0 up/down, but (3,2) and (2,2) are occupied.\n- Even if we maneuver around, it would take more than 8 turns to reach (1,2) from (6,6) after eating there.\n\nThus, focusing on (6,6) is the optimal choice.\n\n### Final Action Sequence\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the optimal immediate action at Turn 96 is to move **Right (R)** to (5,2), initiating the sequence to reach (6,6) by Turn 101.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells like (0,y) for y=0 to 7, (7,y) for y=0 to 7, (x,0) for x=0 to 7, (x,7) for x=0 to 7. But since it's a grid, the playable cells are probably from (1,1) to (6,6). Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (4,2), and direction is Up (U). So moving up increases y-coordinate? In the movement constraints, U is (x,y+1), so y increases upward. Let me list the snake positions:\n> \n> Snake: [(4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)]\n> \n> Head is (4,2), and since direction is U, it must have come from below, so previous position was (4,1), which is the second segment. Let's trace the snake to understand its shape.\n> \n> List of positions in order: head to tail.\n> \n> Index 0: (4,2) - head\n> \n> Index 1: (4,1)\n> \n> Index 2: (3,1)\n> \n> Index 3: (2,1)\n> \n> Index 4: (2,2)\n> \n> Index 5: (3,2)\n> \n> Index 6: (3,3)\n> \n> Index 7: (2,3)\n> \n> Index 8: (2,4)\n> \n> Index 9: (2,5)\n> \n> Index 10: (2,6)\n> \n> Index 11: (3,6)\n> \n> Index 12: (3,5)\n> \n> Index 13: (3,4)\n> \n> Index 14: (4,4)\n> \n> Index 15: (4,5)\n> \n> Index 16: (5,5)\n> \n> Index 17: (5,6)\n> \n> Index 18: (6,6)\n> \n> Index 19: (6,5) - tail\n> \n> Now, plot this on a grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and (4,6) obstacle.\n> \n> Playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (4,6) is blocked.\n> \n> (4,6) is an obstacle, so cannot go there.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (6,6,6,1) I think this is (x,y,value,life_span) so (6,6) with value 6, life span 1? But food values are supposed to be +1 or -1 for positive or negative, but here it says value 6? That might be a mistake.\n> \n> Look: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: (6, 6, 6, 1)\" and \"(1, 2, 8, 1)\"\n> \n> But in the core rules, food has value +1 or -1. Here it says value 6 and 8? That can't be right.\n> \n> Perhaps I misread. Let me check the state input.\n> \n> \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\n> - (6, 6, 6, 1)\n> - (1, 2, 8, 1)\"\n> \n> But in the description, it says \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\" but the tuple has four numbers. Probably it's (x,y, value, life_span). But value should be +1 or -1, but 6 and 8 are given. That seems odd.\n> \n> Perhaps it's a typo or I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the core rules again.\n> \n> \"Food Mechanics: Positive Food Reward Value = +1 | Length of snake +1 Negative Food Penalty Value = -1 | Length of snake unchanged\"\n> \n> But in the state, for (6,6,6,1), value is 6? That doesn't match. Similarly, (1,2,8,1) value 8.\n> \n> That must be a mistake. Perhaps the value is the life span or something. Let's see the format.\n> \n> In the state input format: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\"\n> \n> But in the text, it's written as (6,6,6,1) which might be (x,y,value,life_span) but value is 6, which is not +1 or -1.\n> \n> Perhaps it's (x,y, life_span, value) or something. But it says \"Value and Life Span\" in that order.\n> \n> Look: \" (6, 6, 6, 1) \" and it says \"Life Span and Value\" in the header? No, the header says \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\" for the list, but each item is (x,y,?,?).\n> \n> I think there's inconsistency. In the core rules, it should be value +1 or -1, but here numbers like 6 and 8 are given. Perhaps for this game, values can be different, but the rules say +1 or -1. Let me read the user message.\n> \n> \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\n> - (6, 6, 6, 1)\n> - (1, 2, 8, 1)\"\n> \n> And in core rules: \"Positive Food Reward Value = +1\" etc.\n> \n> But here, for (6,6,6,1), if it's (x,y,value,life_span), value is 6, which is not +1. Similarly for (1,2,8,1), value 8.\n> \n> Perhaps it's a typo, and it's meant to be (x,y, life_span, value) with value +1 or -1. But life span 6 and value 1? That doesn't make sense because life span is a countdown.\n> \n> Another possibility: the first number after coordinates is value, second is life span, but value 6 is high.\n> \n> I think I should assume that for this state, the food has different values, but the rules say only +1 or -1. Let me check the user message carefully.\n> \n> User said: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (6, 6, 6, 1)\" but in the core rules, it's defined as value +1 or -1. Perhaps for this instance, it's different.\n> \n> But in the \"Special Cases\" it doesn't mention different values, so I think it's a mistake in the input.\n> \n> Perhaps the tuple is (x,y, life_span, value) with value being the reward.\n> \n> For (6,6,6,1), if it's (x,y, life_span, value), then life span 6, value 1, which could be +1.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2,8,1) life span 8, value 1.\n> \n> But value 1, which is +1, since -1 would be negative.\n> \n> In the core rules, positive food has value +1, negative has -1, so value 1 is +1, value -1 is negative.\n> \n> But here, for (6,6,6,1), if it's (x,y, life_span, value), then value is 1, so +1 food.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2,8,1) value 1, +1 food.\n> \n> But life span is given as 6 and 8, which are the numbers.\n> \n> In the tuple, it's written as (6,6,6,1), so x=6,y=6, then 6 and 1. If value is the last one, then value=1 for both, so both are positive food with life span 6 and 8 respectively.\n> \n> For (6,6,6,1): x=6,y=6, life_span=6, value=1\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2,8,1): x=1,y=2, life_span=8, value=1\n> \n> Both are positive food with +1 reward.\n> \n> Life span means they disappear after that many turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, so for food at (6,6), life span 6, at turn 96, so it will disappear after 6 turns, so on turn 102 it's gone, but since it decreases every turn including current, after 6 turns it reaches 0 and disappears.\n> \n> Similarly for (1,2), life span 8, disappears on turn 104.\n> \n> But we are at turn 96.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,2), direction U.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so valid cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to6.\n> \n> But internal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Also, food at (6,6) and (1,2).\n> \n> (6,6) has food, but let's see if it's occupied.\n> \n> Snake positions include (6,6) at index 18: (6,6) is part of the snake body?

It's turn 97, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid (since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with internal obstacles).\n> \n> Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning I can't go to those coordinates. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: The snake has 20 segments. Head is at (5,2), and it's moving right (R). So the direction is R, meaning last move was to the right.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1 and life span 5. Life span decreases every turn, including current turn, so at turn 97, it has 5 turns left, meaning it will disappear after turn 101? Let me clarify life span.\n> \n> Life span: Disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 97, life span 5 means it will be gone after turn 101, since:\n> \n> - Turn 97: life span 5 (present)\n> \n> - Turn 98: life span 4\n> \n> - Turn 99: life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 100: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 101: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 102: not present? Or after N turns means it disappears when life span reaches 0.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is N at turn t, it disappears at turn t + N. Let's see the rule: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn 97, food at (6,6) has life span 5, so:\n> \n> - After turn 97, life span becomes 4 (at start of turn 98)\n> \n> - After turn 98, life span 3\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn 101, life span 0, so it disappears before turn 102? I think it's better to think that at the beginning of each turn, the life span is decremented, and if it reaches 0, the food is removed before the snake moves.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – but it doesn't specify when it decreases relative to the turn.\n> \n> To be safe, I'll assume that during turn t, if food has life span L, after the turn, L decreases by 1. So for eating, if the head moves to a food cell during turn t, it is eaten, and then life span decreases for the next turn.\n> \n> But for disappearance, when life span reaches 0 after decrement, it's gone.\n> \n> Standard in such games: at the start of turn, before snake moves, life span decreases, and food with life span 0 is removed. Then snake moves, and if it eats, etc.\n> \n> But the rule says \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", which might mean that at turn t, when we process, we decrease life span first or something.

The food is not accessible because the cell is still occupied.\n> \n> The food at (3,5) is under the cell, but as long as any snake segment is on it, it can't be eaten. Only when no snake segment is on that cell, and head moves there, it can be eaten.\n> \n> So for (3,5), to make it free, the snake must move such that no segment is at (3,5), which means that when the segment that was there moves away, and no other segment moves to it immediately.\n> \n> In the movement, when the snake moves, the cell (3,5) might be vacated if it was the tail position, but here it's not tail.\n> \n> The tail is at (6,6).\n> \n> For a body segment cell to be vacated, it must be that the segment moves and no new segment comes in, but in snake movement, when moving without growth, the tail cell is vacated, but body cells are not vacated; they are just occupied by different segments.\n> \n> For example, position p_i is occupied by s_i at turn t. At turn t+1, after move, s_i is now at p_{i-1} (position where s_{i-1} was), so the cell p_i is now empty if no segment moves to it, but in standard snake, when moving, the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, so the cell that was occupied by the tail is vacated, and all other cells remain occupied by some segment, just shifted.\n> \n> Specifically, for a cell that is not the tail position, it will be occupied after the move by the segment that was behind it.\n> \n> In this case, for cell (3,5), it is currently occupied by s_k for some k. After a move without growth, s_k moves to the position where s_{k-1} was, so (3,5) is now occupied by s_{k+1}, the segment that was behind s_k.\n> \n> So the cell (3,5) is still occupied, just by a different segment. The food under it cannot be accessed because the cell is never empty; it's always occupied by some body segment until the tail passes or something.\n> \n> The only way for a body cell to be vacated is if it becomes the tail position and then the tail moves away without growth.\n> \n> But in this case, (3,5) is not the tail; it's in the middle.\n> \n> To free (3,5), I need the snake to move such that (3,5) becomes the tail position at some point, then when tail moves, it vacates the cell.\n> \n> But that might take many moves.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,6), it is the tail now, so if I move without eating food, the tail will move, vacating (6,6), and if food is still there, it becomes accessible.\n> \n> Then head can move to (6,6) to eat it.\n> \n> But head is at (5,2), far from (6,6).\n> \n> First, for (6,6) food, life span 5 at turn 97, so it will disappear after turn 101.\n> \n> That means it will be gone at turn 102.\n> \n> So I have from turn 97 to turn 101 to eat it.\n> \n> At turn 97, it is under tail, so I need to move the tail away first.\n> \n> If I don't eat any food for the next few moves, the tail will move each turn.\n> \n> Current tail at (6,6).\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, tail moves to the position of the second last segment.\n> \n> Current positions: tail (6,6), second last is (5,6).\n> \n> So if head moves and no food eaten, tail will move to (5,6), and (6,6) is vacated.\n> \n> Then, if head can move to (6,6) later, it can eat the food.\n> \n> But the food life span decreases each turn.\n> \n> Similarly for (3,5), it's harder because it's not tail.\n> \n> (3,5) has life span 10, so more time.\n> \n> Food at (1,2) is free and accessible, life span 7.\n> \n> So possible targets: (1,2) and (6,6) if I can get to it soon.\n> \n> (3,5) might be difficult to eat.\n> \n> Now, head at (5,2), moving right.\n> \n> Possible moves turn 97: U, D, R.\n> \n> Let's evaluate each:\n> \n> - If I go R to (6,2): then head to (6,2), which is free.

Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are borders, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, I think? x from 1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to 6 are valid, similarly y=1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (4,6), which is on the top row, y=6.\n> \n> y=6 is not wall, but (4,6) is obstacle, so cannot go there.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0 and x=7, so valid x: 1 to 6. y from 0 to 7, walls at y=0 and y=7, so valid y: 1 to 6. But (4,6) is obstacle, so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> So playable cells: (x,y) with x=1,2,3,4,5,6 and y=1,2,3,4,5,6, except (4,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Now snake body: let's list all occupied cells to avoid.\n> \n> Head: (6,2)\n> \n> Body: (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)\n> \n> (5,6) is the tail.\n> \n> Food: (6,6), (1,2), (3,5)\n> \n> (3,5) has food, but (3,5) is occupied by the snake body? Let's see: snake positions include (3,5), which is the 15th segment or so. (3,5) is in the body.\n> \n> From the list: positions: index 0: (6,2) head, 1: (5,2), 2: (4,2), 3: (4,1), 4: (3,1), 5: (2,1), 6: (2,2), 7: (3,2), 8: (3,3), 9: (2,3), 10: (2,4), 11: (2,5), 12: (2,6), 13: (3,6), 14: (3,5), 15: (3,4), 16: (4,4), 17: (4,5), 18: (5,5), 19: (5,6) tail.\n> \n> So (3,5) is position 14, which is a body segment. And there is food at (3,5) with value 1 and life span 9.\n> \n> But the food is on a body segment. According to rules, food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) has food, and (1,2) might be free? Let's see if (1,2) is occupied.\n> \n> Snake positions: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), etc. (1,2) is not in the list, so it should be free.\n> \n> (6,6) is not in snake positions, so free.\n> \n> (3,5) is occupied by body.\n> \n> Food at (3,5) is on the body, so to eat it, the snake must move so that the body segment at (3,5) moves away, and then head moves to (3,5) when it's free.\n> \n> Similarly for other food.\n> \n> Now, current turn 98.\n> \n> I need to plan actions for turn 98, 99, 100, etc., at least 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> First, from head (6,2), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: U (up to (6,3)), D (down to (6,1)), R (right to (7,2)? But x=7 is wall, so invalid. x=7 is wall, so cannot go right.\n> \n> x=7 is wall, so moving right from (6,2) to (7,2) is wall collision, death.\n> \n> Similarly, left to (5,2), but (5,2) is body segment, and since it's not the tail, moving there would cause collision? When moving, if head moves to a cell occupied by body, it collides, except if it's the tail, because tail moves.\n> \n> But (5,2) is the second segment, not tail, so moving left to (5,2) would cause collision.\n> \n> Let's see: from (6,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (6,3) — is this free? Check if occupied or wall.\n> \n> y=3, x=6. Walls: x=6 is not wall, x=6 is valid since walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is ok. y=3, between 1 and 6, ok. Obstacle at (4,6), not here. Snake body: is (6,3) occupied? Positions: (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), etc. No (6,3), so (6,3) is free. So U is possible.\n> \n> - D: to (6,1) — y=1, which is not wall (y=0 wall), so ok. (6,1) occupied? Snake: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), but no (6,1), so free. So D possible.\n> \n> - L: to (5,2) — but (5,2) is occupied by body, and it's not tail, so collision. Also, L is reverse? Current direction R, moving L is opposite, but rule says \"no instant reverse\", so cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so moving L is reverse, not allowed. So L invalid for two reasons: reverse and collision.\n> \n> - R: to (7,2) — x=7 is wall, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible actions: U or D.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose between up or down.\n> \n> But I must think long-term.\n> \n> Food locations:\n> \n> - (6,6): life span 4, so must be eaten by turn 101, else gone.\n> \n> - (1,2): life span 6, by turn 103.\n> \n> - (3,5): on body, life span 9, by turn 106.\n> \n> (3,5) is currently occupied, so to eat it, the body must move away first.\n> \n> Since the snake is long, moving might free up space.\n> \n> Also, the tail is at (5,6), which is near (6,6) food.\n> \n> (5,6) to (6,6) is adjacent right.\n> \n> But head is at (6,2), far away.\n> \n> Now, let's consider paths.\n> \n> First, if I go up to (6,3).\n> \n> Then from (6,3), I can go U, D, L, R, but direction would be U, so cannot D next?

But (6,6) is not wall, but is it free? Currently, snake has (5,6) at tail, but (6,6) is free, as per food position.\n> \n> But (6,5): is it occupied? Snake positions: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6). No (6,5), so free.\n> \n> (6,4): not in positions, free.\n> \n> (6,3) free, as above.\n> \n> So a direct path up: (6,2) -> (6,3) -> (6,4) -> (6,5) -> (6,6).\n> \n> Each move up.\n> \n> But when I reach (6,6), I eat food, snake grows, so tail doesn't move, new segment added.\n> \n> But (6,6) has life span 4, so I need to be there by turn 101.\n> \n> If I go up now, turn 98: to (6,3), then 99: to (6,4), 100: to (6,5), 101: to (6,6) — on turn 101, I can eat it just before it disappears? Turn 101 it is still there since life span decreases, at turn 98: L=4, turn 99: L=3, turn 100: L=2, turn 101: L=1, turn 102: gone. So on turn 101, L=1, still present, I can eat it.\n> \n> Similarly, if I go down first, I might not make it in time.\n> \n> Go down to (6,1): then to where? (6,1) to (6,6) is further, need to go up later.\n> \n> But let's see other food.\n> \n> (1,2) is at left bottom, head at (6,2), same y, x difference 5, so 5 moves left.\n> \n> But path: from (6,2) to (5,2) is body, occupied. So cannot go directly left.\n> \n> Need to go around.\n> \n> For example, go down to (6,1), then left to (5,1), but (5,1) occupied? Snake: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), no (5,1), so free? Positions: head (6,2), then (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), so (5,1) not occupied, free.\n> \n> Then to (4,1), but (4,1) is body, occupied.\n> \n> (4,1) is position 3.\n> \n> So from (6,1), I can go L to (5,1), then from (5,1), I can go U to (5,2) but (5,2) is body, or D to (5,0) wall, or L to (4,1) body, or R to (6,1) reverse or same? Messy.\n> \n> Better to go up to (6,3) first.\n> \n> (3,5) food is on body, so I need to wait for it to be free.\n> \n> (3,5) is position 14 in the snake. When the snake moves, the body moves, so after some moves, (3,5) will be vacated.\n> \n> The snake moves, each turn head moves, tail moves unless eating food.\n> \n> Since no food eaten now, tail moves each turn.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,6), and it will move when snake moves.\n> \n> To free (3,5), since it's a body segment, when the snake moves, the segment at (3,5) will move to the next position, so (3,5) becomes free only if that segment moves away.\n> \n> The position (3,5) is occupied by the 14th segment. When the snake moves, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the head moves to new position, segment 1 moves to where head was, segment 2 to where segment 1 was, and so on, tail moves to where second last was, and vacates the old tail cell.\n> \n> For (3,5), it will be vacated when the snake moves enough that the segment that was there has moved.\n> \n> But it's hard to track exactly.\n> \n> Since the snake is long, and I need to plan, I should consider the available space and paths.\n> \n> Back to immediate choice: at (6,2), I must go U or D.\n> \n> If I go U to (6,3), then I can continue up to (6,4), etc., to reach (6,6) by turn 101.\n> \n> If I go D to (6,1), then from there, I might go left towards (1,2).\n> \n> But (1,2) has longer life, turn 103.\n> \n> Also, (3,5) food is there, but occupied.\n> \n> Let's see the grid layout to understand free cells.\n> \n> List all occupied cells by snake:\n> \n> (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6)\n> \n> Free cells: all other cells in 1-6 x 1-6 except obstacle (4,6) and snake.\n> \n> For example, (1,1) to (1,6): (1,1) free?

that (1,2) might not be reachable in time, and focus on other food.\n> \n> There is food at (3,5) under body, which I can eat later.\n> \n> Also, after moving, the body at (3,5) will move.\n> \n> For example, if I move the snake, the segment at (3,5) will shift.\n> \n> Currently, the body segment at (3,5) is part of the snake.\n> \n> When the snake moves, that position will be vacated after some moves.\n> \n> For instance, if I move in a way that the tail moves away from there.\n> \n> But the tail is at (5,5), which is not near.\n> \n> Let's see the order.\n> \n> The snake will move, so the body at (3,5) will move to the next position when the head moves.\n> \n> For example, on each move, all segments shift, so the cell (3,5) will be occupied by the next segment in line.\n> \n> Positions are in order, so when head moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous one.\n> \n> So the cell (3,5) will be vacated when the segment that was there moves to the next position, and no new segment comes, but since the tail moves, it vacates.\n> \n> Specifically, the cell (3,5) is occupied by the 15th segment (index 15, if head 0).\n> \n> When the snake moves, the segment that was at (3,5) moves to the position of the 14th segment, and so on, and the head moves to new cell, tail is removed.\n> \n> So the cell (3,5) is vacated after the move if the segment that was there is not replaced by another segment moving to it.\n> \n> In general, when the snake moves, the cell that was the tail is vacated, and other cells may be vacated or occupied by different segments.\n> \n> But the cell (3,5) is not the tail, so it will be occupied by the segment that was before it, after move.\n> \n> For example, in current positions, segment at index 15: (3,5)\n> \n> After move, the new position at index 15 will be the old position of index 14, which is (3,6) or something.\n> \n> It's better not to think per cell.\n> \n> To vacate (3,5), I need the segment that is currently there to move away, and no other segment to move to it, which happens naturally as the snake moves, but the cell may be occupied by the incoming segment from the previous position.\n> \n> The cell (3,5) will be empty only when the tail passes through it or something, but it's not the tail.\n> \n> In practice, for food under body, it can be eaten after the snake moves enough that the body leaves that cell and the head arrives.\n> \n> But it might take many turns.\n> \n> For now, since (3,5) has long life span, I can ignore it for now.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) has short life span, so I should eat it soon.\n> \n> And (1,2) has medium life span, but hard to reach.\n> \n> So perhaps the best is to eat (6,6) on turn 101, as planned.\n> \n> Then after that, I can navigate to eat other food or just survive.\n> \n> But let's think about the tail reward danger for other cases.\n> \n> For example, when I eat at (6,6), no problem.\n> \n> Now for the sequence.\n> \n> Turn 99: U to (6,4)\n> \n> Turn 100: U to (6,5)\n> \n> Turn 101: U to (6,6) eat food, length increases.\n> \n> Now, after that, on turn 102, from (6,6), I can only move L to (5,6), since U and R invalid, D to (6,5) body collision.\n> \n> So move L to (5,6)\n> \n> Then on turn 103, from (5,6), I can move D to (5,5) or L to (4,6) wall, U invalid, R to (6,6) body, so only D to (5,5)\n> \n> (5,5) is not occupied, as per
