Direction: Left (L).\n- **Walls**: Borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacles at [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)].\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,1): Value +1, life span 3 (disappears after Turn 9).\n  - (3,5): Value +1, life span 4 (disappears after Turn 10).\n  - (6,2): Value +1, life span 7 (disappears after Turn 13).\n  - (3,2): Value +1, life span 10 (disappears after Turn 16).\n\n### Possible Moves from (4,5):\nCurrent direction is L, so we cannot move R (reverse). Possible moves:\n1. **Left (L) to (3,5)**:\n   - (3,5) has food (+1). Eating it grows the snake to length 4.\n   - New positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)].\n   - Direction becomes L.\n   - Next moves: Can go U, D, or L (not R).\n2. **Up (U) to (4,6)**:\n   - No food here. Snake length remains 3.\n   - New positions: [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5)].\n   - Direction becomes U.\n   - Next moves: Can go L or R (not D).\n3. **Down (D) to (4,4)**:\n   - (4,4) is a wall. Invalid move.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n1. **Move L to (3,5)**:\n   - Immediate reward: +1 (eat food at (3,5)).\n   - Snake grows, which may limit maneuverability but opens paths to other foods.\n   - From (3,5), can move down to (3,4), then (3,3), then (3,2) to eat another food (+1) by Turn 10.\n   - Cannot reach (6,2) in time (expires at Turn 13) due to obstacles.\n\n2. **Move U to (4,6)**:\n   - No immediate reward.\n   - From (4,6), can move R to (5,6), then D to (5,5), etc., to reach (6,2) by Turn 13.\n   - Will miss (3,5) (expires at Turn 10) because it's too far away after moving up.\n\n### Decision:\n- Prioritize eating (3,5) now because:\n  - It expires sooner (Turn 10).\n  - Eating it now allows us to potentially eat (3,2) later (longer lifespan).\n  - Missing (6,2) is acceptable because (3,5) and (3,2) provide equivalent total reward (+2) and are easier to reach.\n\n### Action Sequence (for Turns 7-11):\n1. **Turn 7**: Move L to (3,5) (eat food).\n2. **Turn 8**: Move D to (3,4).\n3. **Turn 9**: Move D to (3,3).\n4. **Turn 10**: Move D to (3,2) (eat food).\n5. **Turn 11**: Move R to (4,2).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Let's carefully analyze the current state and possible moves to determine the best immediate action for the snake at turn \\( t_0 = 12 \\).\n\n### Current State:\n- **Snake Positions**: Head at (3,1), body segments at (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), tail at (3,5). The snake is vertically aligned with the head at the top (lower y-values) and tail at the bottom (higher y-values).\n- **Head Direction**: D (down). This means the snake was moving downward to reach (3,1) from (3,2) in the previous turn. Thus, the current direction is D, and the opposite direction (U) is not allowed for the next move.\n- **Walls**: Border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4).\n- **Food**:\n  - (6,2): value +1, life_span = 3 (will disappear after turn 14).\n  - (1,3): value +1, life_span = 8 (will disappear after turn 19).\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 12:\nFrom the head position (3,1), the possible moves are:\n1. **U (Up)**: (3,0) → Invalid (y=0 is a wall).\n2. **D (Down)**: (3,2) → Invalid (occupied by the body segment at (3,2)).\n3. **L (Left)**: (2,1) → Check if free:\n   - Not a wall (x=2 > 0, y=1 > 0).\n   - Not an internal obstacle (internal obstacles are at (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (5,2), (4,4)).\n   - Not occupied by the snake (snake is at x=3).\n   - Valid move.\n4. **R (Right)**: (4,1) → Check if free:\n   - Not a wall (x=4 < 7, y=1 > 0).\n   - Not an internal obstacle.\n   - Not occupied by the snake.\n   - Valid move.\n\nThus, the only valid moves are **L (Left)** to (2,1) or **R (Right)** to (4,1).\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n#### Move L to (2,1):\n- New head position: (2,1).\n- Body segments: [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)] (tail at (3,4)).\n- Next possible moves from (2,1):\n  - U: (2,0) → Invalid (wall).\n  - D: (2,2) → Free (not wall, not obstacle, not snake).\n  - L: (1,1) → Free (not wall, not obstacle, not snake).\n  - R: (3,1) → Occupied by body (invalid).\n  - Cannot move R (opposite of current direction L is R, which is invalid).\n  - So possible: D to (2,2) or L to (1,1).\n\n#### Move R to (4,1):\n- New head position: (4,1).\n- Body segments: [(4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)] (tail at (3,4)).\n- Next possible moves from (4,1):\n  - U: (4,0) → Invalid (wall).\n  - D: (4,2) → Free (not wall, not obstacle, not snake).\n  - L: (3,1) → Occupied by body (invalid).\n  - R: (5,1) → Free (not wall, not obstacle, not snake).\n  - Cannot move L (opposite of current direction R is L, which is invalid).\n  - So possible: D to (4,2) or R to (5,1).\n\n### Food Considerations:\n- **(6,2)**: Cannot be reached in time (disappears after turn 14). From (3,1), it takes at least 3 moves to reach (6,2), but by turn 14, it will be gone. Thus, ignore this food.\n- **(1,3)**: Can be reached, but eating it leads to a dead end (no safe moves afterward). Thus, avoid this food for now.\n\n### Survival Priority:\nSince neither food can be safely eaten without risking death, the priority is to avoid collisions and stay alive. Both L and R moves are safe, but we should choose the one that opens up more future options.\n\n- **Move L to (2,1)**:\n  - Opens a path toward the left side of the board, where there are fewer obstacles.\n  - From (2,1), can move D to (2,2) or L to (1,1), both safe.\n  - Avoids the internal obstacles on the right side.\n\n- **Move R to (4,1)**:\n  - Moves toward the right side, closer to the internal obstacles (e.g., (4,4), (5,2)).\n  - From (4,1), can move D to (4,2) or R to (5,1), but (5,1) is near the obstacle (5,2).\n\n### Decision:\n**Move L (Left) to (2,1)** is the safer choice, as it avoids immediate danger and provides more flexibility for future moves.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Valid.\n   - **Up (U)**: Move to (3,7). \n     - (3,7) is a border wall (y=7). Invalid (collision).\n   - **Down (D)**: Move to (3,5). \n     - (3,5) is occupied by the snake's body (not the tail). Invalid (collision).\n   - **Right (R)**: Opposite of current direction (L). Invalid (instant reverse).\n\n   **Only valid move is Left (L) to (2,6)**.\n\n3. **Food Analysis**:\n   - Food at (2,5): Value +1, life span 6 (available until turn 28).\n   - Food at (1,6): Value +1, life span 9 (available until turn 31).\n   - Neither food is under the snake's body or tail, so no special cases apply.\n\n4. **Immediate Decision**:\n   - Only possible action is to move Left (L) to (2,6). No other moves are valid without causing a collision.\n\n### Verification of Future Moves (from Guidance):\n- The guidance suggests moving Left (L) on turn 23, which aligns with the above analysis.\n- Subsequent moves (turns 24-27) are not relevant for the immediate action at turn 23, as the AI is a non-thinking executor and must only decide the current move.\n\n### Potential Risks:\n- Moving Left (L) to (2,6) is safe as it does not lead to any immediate collision or trap.\n- The food at (2,5) can be targeted in future moves (e.g., turn 24) by moving Down (D) from (2,6).\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe only valid and safe move at turn 23 is Left (L).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state at Turn 40:\n\n- **Grid Size**: 8x8 (x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7)\n- **Walls**: \n  - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n  - Internal Obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n- **Snake Positions**: \n  - Head: (3,1)\n  - Body: [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] (total length = 12)\n- **Snake Head Direction**: Right (R)\n- **Food**:\n  - (4,1): value = +1, life_span = 2\n  - (3,1): value = +1, life_span = 10\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves at Turn 40\n\nThe snake's head is at (3,1), moving right (from (2,1) to (3,1)). The possible moves are Up (U), Down (D), or Right (R). Moving Left (L) is not allowed because it's the opposite of the current direction (R).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U) to (3,2)**:\n   - (3,2) is occupied by the snake's body (from the positions list).\n   - **Result**: Collision with body → Death.\n\n2. **Down (D) to (3,0)**:\n   - y=0 is a border wall.\n   - **Result**: Wall collision → Death.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (4,1)**:\n   - (4,1) is not occupied by the snake's body.\n   - (4,1) has positive food (+1).\n   - **Result**: Move to (4,1), eat the food, snake grows by 1 segment.\n\n### Evaluating the Right (R) Move\n\nMoving right to (4,1) is the only viable option to avoid immediate death. Here's what happens:\n\n- **Action**: Move R to (4,1).\n- **Food at (4,1)**:\n  - Value: +1 (positive food)\n  - Life_span: 2 (will decrease to 1 after this turn)\n- **Snake Growth**:\n  - Head moves to (4,1).\n  - New segment added at the head's previous position (3,1).\n  - Tail does not move (since food is eaten).\n  - New length: 13.\n\n### Subsequent Moves (Turns 41-44)\n\nAfter moving to (4,1) at Turn 40, the snake's head is at (4,1), direction R. Now, let's plan the next moves to ensure survival:\n\n1. **Turn 41: From (4,1), direction R**\n   - Possible moves: U, D, R (L is opposite of R, not allowed).\n     - U to (4,2): Occupied by body → Death.\n     - D to (4,0): Wall → Death.\n     - R to (5,1): \n       - Not a wall.\n       - Not occupied by body.\n       - No food.\n     - **Action**: R to (5,1).\n\n2. **Turn 42: From (5,1), direction R**\n   - Possible moves: U, D, R.\n     - U to (5,2): Wall → Death.\n     - D to (5,0): Wall → Death.\n     - L to (4,1): Occupied by body → Death.\n     - R to (6,1):\n       - Not a wall.\n       - Not occupied by body.\n       - No food.\n     - **Action**: R to (6,1).\n\n3. **Turn 43: From (6,1), direction R**\n   - Possible moves: U, D, R.\n     - U to (6,2):\n       - Not a wall.\n       - Not occupied by body.\n       - No food.\n     - D to (6,0): Wall → Death.\n     - L to (5,1): Occupied by body → Death.\n     - R to (7,1): Wall → Death.\n     - **Action**: U to (6,2).\n\n4. **Turn 44: From (6,2), direction U**\n   - Possible moves: U, L, R (D is opposite of U, not allowed).\n     - U to (6,3):\n       - Not a wall.\n       - Not occupied by body.\n       - No food.\n     - D to (6,1): Occupied by body → Death.\n     - L to (5,2): Wall → Death.\n     - R to (7,2): Wall → Death.\n     - **Action**: U to (6,3).\n\n### Verifying Safety of Moves\n\nAt each step, the moves are chosen to avoid:\n- Collision with the snake's body.\n- Collision with walls.\n- Instant reverse moves.\n\nThe sequence ensures the snake moves towards open spaces, avoiding immediate dangers.\n\n### Handling the Food at (3,1)\n\nThe food at (3,1) is currently under the snake's head. According to the rules:\n- Food under the body can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n- Since the head is moving away to (4,1), the food at (3,1) will be under a body segment after the move.\n- To eat it later, the snake would need to maneuver the body away and return the head to (3,1), which is complex and risky given the current position and obstacles.\n\nGiven the food's life_span of 10, it will disappear by Turn 50 if not eaten. Given the distance and the snake's current path, it's impractical to attempt eating this food without risking death.\n\n### Final Action Sequence\n\nBased on the above analysis, the immediate and subsequent safe moves are:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 40: R\nTurn 41: R\nTurn 42: R\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\n}\n\n### Main Thinking Conclusion\n\nAt Turn 40, moving Right to (4,1) is the only safe action, allowing the snake to eat the positive food there and avoid collisions. The subsequent moves (Turns 41-44) are carefully chosen to navigate the snake towards open spaces in the grid's bottom-right, prioritizing survival over attempting to reach the inaccessible food at (3,1). This sequence ensures the snake avoids walls and its own body, maximizing the chances of longer survival.",

The food at (3,1) will disappear after Turn 49, but reaching it in time is impossible given the distance and the snake's length. The food at (4,2) has a longer lifespan, but eating it would require complex maneuvering that may not be safe given the snake's current length and the grid's constraints.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nThe only safe and valid move at Turn 45 is **U (Up)** to (6,4). This avoids collisions and walls, and keeps the snake moving in a direction that doesn't immediately trap it.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\n### Immediate Moves:\nFrom the current head position (5,5) with direction U, the possible moves are:\n1. **U (Up)**: (5,6) - Valid (within bounds, not occupied by snake or obstacle).\n2. **L (Left)**: (4,5) - Valid.\n3. **R (Right)**: (6,5) - Valid.\n4. **D (Down)**: (5,4) - Invalid (opposite of current direction U).\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Food at (3,1)**:\n   - Occupied by a body segment, cannot be eaten immediately.\n   - Life_span is 2 (disappears after turn 49). Cannot be freed in time to eat it. Ignore.\n\n2. **Food at (4,2)**:\n   - Currently the tail position.\n   - To eat it, we need to free (4,2) by moving the tail away (i.e., move without eating on turn 48).\n   - After freeing, we can plan to move the head to (4,2) in subsequent turns (before turn 52).\n\n3. **Food at (5,1)**:\n   - Occupied by a body segment, cannot be eaten immediately.\n   - Life_span is 8 (disappears after turn 55). Can plan to free it later if needed.\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Primary Goal**: Free (4,2) by moving the tail away (i.e., move without eating on turn 48).\n- **Secondary Goal**: Position the snake to reach (4,2) in subsequent turns to eat the food before it disappears (by turn 52).\n\n### Immediate Action (Turn 48):\nTo free (4,2), we need to move the snake such that the tail moves away. Any move that doesn't eat food will achieve this. We should choose a move that also positions the snake favorably to reach (4,2) in future turns.\n\nPossible moves:\n- **U (5,6)**: Moves away from (4,2), not ideal.\n- **L (4,5)**: Moves closer to (4,2) in the x-direction.\n- **R (6,5)**: Moves away from (4,2), not ideal.\n\n**Best Move**: L to (4,5). This moves the head closer to the x-coordinate of (4,2) and sets up a path to reach (4,2) in subsequent turns.\n\n### Verification:\nAfter moving L to (4,5) on turn 48:\n- New head: (4,5).\n- Tail moves away from (4,2), freeing it.\n- On turn 49, we can plan to move towards (4,2) via (3,5), (3,4), etc.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe immediate action is to move left (L) to (4,5).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n- **Snake**:\n  - Positions: [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)]\n  - Head at (3,3), direction is D (down)\n- **Food**:\n  - (4,2): value=2, life_span=1\n  - (5,1): value=4, life_span=1\n  - (6,1): value=7, life_span=1\n  - (5,4): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head position (3,3) with current direction D, the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Down (D)**: (3,2)\n   - Check if (3,2) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: y=2 is not y=0\n     - Not an obstacle: (3,2) is not in the obstacle list\n     - Not occupied by snake body: (3,2) is not in the snake positions\n   - Valid move.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: (2,3)\n   - Check if (2,3) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=2 is not x=0\n     - Not an obstacle: (2,3) is not in the obstacle list\n     - Not occupied by snake body: (2,3) is not in the snake positions\n   - Valid move.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: (4,3)\n   - Check if (4,3) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=4 is not x=7\n     - Not an obstacle: (4,3) is not in the obstacle list\n     - Not occupied by snake body: (4,3) is not in the snake positions\n   - Valid move.\n\n4. **Up (U)**: (3,4)\n   - Opposite to current direction D, so invalid by movement constraints.\n   - Also, (3,4) is occupied by the snake's body (second segment), so it would cause a collision.\n\nThus, the valid immediate moves are D, L, or R.\n\n### Evaluating Food Accessibility\n\nAll food items have a life_span of 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn (turn 52). Therefore, to eat any food, the snake's head must move to that food's position in this turn.\n\nLet's check each food item:\n\n1. **(4,2)**:\n   - Distance from head (3,3): Manhattan distance is |4-3| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2\n   - Cannot reach in one move (only adjacent cells can be reached in one move).\n   - Cannot be eaten this turn.\n\n2. **(5,1)**:\n   - Occupied by snake body at position (5,1) (index 10 in snake positions).\n   - Only the tail can move away to free a cell, but the tail is at (3,1), not (5,1).\n   - Cannot be eaten this turn.\n\n3. **(6,1)**:\n   - Occupied by snake body at position (6,1) (index 9 in snake positions).\n   - Not the tail, so cannot be freed this turn.\n   - Cannot be eaten this turn.\n\n4. **(5,4)**:\n   - Occupied by snake body at position (5,4) (index 5 in snake positions).\n   - Not the tail, so cannot be freed this turn.\n   - Cannot be eaten this turn.\n\n**Conclusion**: None of the food items can be eaten this turn because:\n- The reachable food is not adjacent to the head.\n- The adjacent food is under the snake's body and cannot be freed in one move.\n\n### Choosing the Safest Move\n\nSince no food can be eaten this turn, the priority is to choose a move that keeps the snake safe and allows for future flexibility. Let's evaluate each valid move:\n\n1. **Down (D) to (3,2)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (3,2):\n     - D to (3,1): free (tail moves away)\n     - L to (2,2): free\n     - R to (4,2): free (food will be gone)\n   - Moves the snake towards the bottom, which has more open space.\n\n2. **Left (L) to (2,3)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (2,3):\n     - U to (2,4): free\n     - D to (2,2): free\n     - L to (1,3): free (but adjacent to obstacles)\n   - Moves the snake left, but may lead to dead ends near obstacles.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (4,3)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (4,3):\n     - D to (4,2): free\n     - R to (5,3): free\n   - Moves the snake right, but may lead to collisions with obstacles or body in future moves.\n\n**Best Choice**: Moving Down (D) to (3,2) seems the safest as it opens up more space towards the bottom and avoids immediate dead ends.\n\n### Verifying Future Moves After D to (3,2)\n\nAfter moving to (3,2), the snake's new positions would be:\n- Head: (3,2)\n- Body: [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)]\n- Tail: (3,1) is removed, new tail is (4,1)\n\nFrom (3,2), possible moves:\n- D to (3,1): free (old tail position, now free)\n- L to (2,2): free\n- R to (4,2): free\n\nThis provides flexibility for future moves without immediate risks.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven that no food can be eaten this turn and moving Down (D) to (3,2) provides the safest path with future flexibility, the best immediate action is:\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Valid.\n   - **Down (D)**: (2, 4)\n     - Check: Part of the snake's body and reverse direction. Invalid.\n   - **Left (L)**: (1, 5)\n     - Check: Internal obstacle. Invalid.\n   - **Right (R)**: (3, 5)\n     - Check: Part of the snake's body (not the tail). Invalid.\n\n3. **Conclusion for Turn 61**:\n   - The only valid move is **Up (U)** to (2, 6).\n\n### Verification of Moves\n\n- **Move U to (2, 6)**:\n  - New head position: (2, 6)\n  - Direction remains U (since the move is in the same direction).\n  - The tail at (5, 4) will move forward, so the snake's body will shift accordingly.\n  - No food is eaten at (2, 6), so the snake's length remains the same.\n\n### Next Steps (Turn 62)\n\nFrom (2, 6), direction U:\n- **Possible Moves**:\n  - **Up (U)**: (2, 7) → Wall (y=7). Invalid.\n  - **Down (D)**: (2, 5) → Part of the body and reverse direction. Invalid.\n  - **Left (L)**: (1, 6) → Not an obstacle or body. Valid.\n  - **Right (R)**: (3, 6) → Food present (value 1, life span 7). Valid.\n\n**Optimal Move for Turn 62**:\n- Moving **Right (R)** to (3, 6) allows the snake to eat the food, increasing the score and length.\n- Moving Left (L) to (1, 6) leads to a dead end as no further moves are possible from there (as analyzed in the previous response).\n\n### Final Decision for Turn 61\n\nGiven the analysis, the only safe and optimal immediate action for Turn 61 is to move **Up (U)**.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

The food will remain for 5 more turns (until turn 71), so we can delay eating it if needed.\n- **Food at (2, 6)**: Currently under the snake's body but will become free when the snake moves away. It has a longer life span (until turn 73), so we can plan to eat it later.\n- **Survival Priority**: Avoid moves that corner the snake (like going right to (6,5)). The left and bottom areas offer more space to maneuver.\n\n### Decision:\n- **Best Immediate Action**: Move **D (down)** to (5, 4).\n  - Avoids the risky right move.\n  - Keeps options open for future turns (can go left or down next).\n  - Allows the snake to navigate toward the bottom-left, where there is more space and potential to reach the food at (2,6) later.\n\n### Next Steps (for future turns):\n1. After moving to (5,4), the snake can:\n   - Move D to (5,3) to continue downward.\n   - Move L to (4,4) (but (4,4) is an obstacle, so invalid).\n   - Move R to (6,4) (but this risks cornering again).\n   - Thus, D to (5,3) is the safer choice next.\n2. This path avoids immediate danger and keeps the snake in open space.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}",

Possible: D, L, R.\n- **Food**:\n  - (6, 5): value +1, life span 4 (can be eaten until turn 71).\n  - (2, 6): value +1, life span 6 (can be eaten until turn 73).\n  - (3, 4): value +1, life span 9 (can be eaten until turn 76).\n\n### Immediate Moves from (5, 3):\n1. **Move D (down) to (5, 2)**:\n   - (5, 2) is an internal obstacle (wall). **Deadly collision**. Invalid.\n2. **Move L (left) to (4, 3)**:\n   - (4, 3) is free (not wall or body). Valid.\n3. **Move R (right) to (6, 3)**:\n   - (6, 3) is free (not wall or body). Valid.\n\n### Evaluating L vs. R:\n#### Option 1: Move L to (4, 3)\n- Next moves:\n  - From (4, 3), direction L. Possible: L, U, D (not R).\n  - U to (4, 4): wall (internal obstacle). Invalid.\n  - D to (4, 2): occupied by body. Invalid.\n  - Only L to (3, 3) is possible.\n- Leads to a constrained path and potential dead end.\n\n#### Option 2: Move R to (6, 3)\n- Next moves:\n  - From (6, 3), direction R. Possible: R, U, D (not L).\n  - R to (7, 3): wall (border). Invalid.\n  - U to (6, 4): free.\n  - D to (6, 2): free.\n- Allows flexibility to approach (6, 5) food:\n  - Sequence: R to (6, 3), U to (6, 4), U to (6, 5) to eat at turn 70 (within life span 4).\n\n### Risk of Dead End:\n- Moving R leads to (6, 5) food but may trap the snake afterward (as analyzed in the guidance). However, this is the only viable path to score soon.\n- Moving L avoids immediate dead ends but delays scoring and may not free (2, 6) food in time.\n\n### Decision:\nPrioritize scoring the (6, 5) food now (life span 4) and handle future turns adaptively. The immediate move R to (6, 3) is the best option to maximize score while avoiding collisions.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Possible moves from (6,2):\n\n1. **Up (U) to (6,3)**:\n   - (6,3) is occupied by the snake's body (next segment after head).\n   - **Invalid**: Cannot move into own body.\n\n2. **Down (D) to (6,1)**:\n   - (6,1) is within bounds (y=1 is not a border).\n   - Not an internal obstacle.\n   - Not occupied by the snake's body.\n   - **Valid**.\n\n3. **Left (L) to (5,2)**:\n   - (5,2) is an internal obstacle (wall).\n   - **Invalid**.\n\n4. **Right (R) to (7,2)**:\n   - x=7 is a border wall.\n   - **Invalid**.\n\n**Conclusion**: The only possible move at Turn 70 is Down (D) to (6,1).\n\n### Verifying Subsequent Moves\n\nAfter moving Down to (6,1) at Turn 70, the snake's head will be at (6,1), and the direction is Down (D).

Possible moves at Turn 72:\n\n1. **Up (U) to (5,2)**:\n   - (5,2) is an internal obstacle.\n   - **Invalid**.\n\n2. **Down (D) to (5,0)**:\n   - y=0 is a border wall.\n   - **Invalid**.\n\n3. **Left (L) to (4,1)**:\n   - (4,1) is within bounds.\n   - Not a wall or internal obstacle.\n   - Not occupied by the snake's body (tail was at (4,1) but moves away).\n   - **Valid**.\n\n4. **Right (R) to (6,1)**:\n   - (6,1) is occupied by the snake's body (previous head position).\n   - **Invalid**.\n\n**Conclusion**: At Turn 72, the only possible move is Left (L) to (4,1).\n\n### Planning Towards Food\n\nAt Turn 72, the head is at (4,1), direction Left (L). Now, we have a choice at Turn 73:\n\n1. **Up (U) to (4,2)**:\n   - (4,2) is free.\n   - **Valid**.\n\n2. **Left (L) to (3,1)**:\n   - (3,1) is free.\n   - **Valid**.\n\n3. **Down (D) to (4,0)**:\n   - y=0 is a border wall.\n   - **Invalid**.\n\n4. **Right (R) to (5,1)**:\n   - (5,1) is occupied by the snake's body.\n   - **Invalid**.\n\n**Choosing Between U and L**:\n\n- **Option 1: Up to (4,2)**:\n  - Then at Turn 74, from (4,2), can go Up to (4,3) or Left to (3,2).\n  - From (4,3), can go Left to (3,3), then Up to (3,4) to eat the food at (3,4) by Turn 76.\n\n- **Option 2: Left to (3,1)**:\n  - Then at Turn 74, from (3,1), can go Up to (3,2).\n  - From (3,2), can go Up to (3,3), then Up to (3,4) to eat by Turn 76.\n\nBoth options lead to eating the food at (3,4) by Turn 76. However, moving Left first (Option 2) seems more straightforward as it aligns the snake closer to the food's column (x=3).\n\n### Finalizing the Action Sequence\n\nGiven the above analysis, the optimal sequence to reach the food at (3,4) by Turn 76 is:\n\n1. **Turn 70**: Down (D) to (6,1) — only possible move.\n2. **Turn 71**: Left (L) to (5,1) — only possible move.\n3. **Turn 72**: Left (L) to (4,1) — only possible move.\n4. **Turn 73**: Left (L) to (3,1) — choice to align towards food.\n5. **Turn 74**: Up (U) to (3,2) — towards food.\n6. **Turn 75**: Up (U) to (3,3) — adjacent to food.\n7. **Turn 76**: Up (U) to (3,4) — eat the food.\n\nHowever, since the task is to decide the immediate action for Turn 70, and the sequence is to think ahead, the immediate action is clear:\n\n### Immediate Action for Turn 70\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Occupied by the snake's body (cannot be eaten now).\n2. **(3,4)**: Value +1, Life Span 4 (disappears after Turn 76).

Occupied by the snake's body.\n\n### Immediate Moves:\nFrom (4,1), the valid moves are:\n- **Left (`L`) to (3,1)**:\n  - Next moves: Can go `U` to (3,2) or `L` to (2,1) (risky dead end).\n  - Path to (3,4): (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) → (3,4) (eat at Turn 76).\n  - Risk: After eating (3,4), the snake gets stuck at (4,5).\n- **Up (`U`) to (4,2)**:\n  - Next moves: Can go `L` to (3,2) or `U` to (4,3).\n  - Path to (3,4): (4,2) → (3,2) → (3,3) → (3,4) (eat at Turn 76).\n  - Same risk of getting stuck after eating (3,4).\n\n### Decision:\nBoth `L` and `U` lead to eating (3,4) at Turn 76, but result in a dead end. However, `U` to (4,2) provides slightly more flexibility to explore other paths (e.g., avoiding (3,4) and aiming for (6,6) later). \n\n### Action:\n\\boxed{U}",

The tail is at (2, 3).\n  \n- **Snake Head Direction**: The head is currently moving **Up (U)**.\n\n- **Food Items**:\n  - (2, 6): value = 1, life_span = 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n  - (3, 4): value = 1, life_span = 3\n  - (6, 6): value = 1, life_span = 6\n  - (5, 3): value = 1, life_span = 9 (currently under the snake's body)\n\n- **Walls and Obstacles**:\n  - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n  - Internal obstacles: (5, 2), (4, 4), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 4)\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (4, 2) with Direction U\n\nGiven the current direction is Up (U), the possible moves without instant reverse (cannot move Down) are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (4, 3)\n   - Check if (4, 3) is free:\n     - Not in snake body: Yes (snake body is at (4, 2), (4, 1), etc., not (4, 3))\n     - Not a wall or obstacle: Yes (no obstacle at (4, 3))\n   - Valid move.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: (3, 2)\n   - Check if (3, 2) is free:\n     - Not in snake body: Yes\n     - Not a wall or obstacle: Yes\n   - Valid move.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: (5, 2)\n   - Check if (5, 2) is free:\n     - Obstacle at (5, 2): No, it's an internal obstacle.\n   - Invalid move.\n\nSo, valid immediate moves: **U (Up) or L (Left)**.\n\n### Evaluating Moves Based on Food and Survival\n\n#### Food at (2, 6)\n- Position: (2, 6)\n- Currently occupied by the snake's body (part of the body segments).\n- To eat it:\n  - The body must move away from (2, 6), then the head moves onto it.\n- Life_span = 1: will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n- Given the snake's current position, it's impossible to free (2, 6) in this turn because the segment at (2, 6) is not the tail (tail is at (2, 3)), and freeing it would require the tail to be at (2, 6), which is several moves away.\n- **Conclusion**: Cannot eat (2, 6) this turn; it will disappear.\n\n#### Food at (3, 4)\n- Position: (3, 4)\n- Not under the snake's body.\n- Life_span = 3: can be eaten up to turn 76.\n- Path to reach (3, 4):\n  - From (4, 2), possible sequence:\n    - Turn 74: L to (3, 2)\n    - Turn 75: U to (3, 3)\n    - Turn 76: U to (3, 4) → eat\n  - After eating, the snake grows, and the tail doesn't move.\n  - Then, from (3, 4), possible moves:\n    - U to (3, 5)\n    - Then R to (4, 5)\n    - At (4, 5), all adjacent cells are blocked:\n      - U: (4, 6) - body\n      - D: (4, 4) - obstacle\n      - L: (3, 5) - body\n      - R: (5, 5) - body\n    - **Dead end**: Snake would die at (4, 5).\n\n#### Food at (6, 6)\n- Position: (6, 6)\n- Not under the snake's body.\n- Life_span = 6: can be eaten up to turn 79.\n- Path to reach (6, 6):\n  - From (4, 2), moving towards the right is challenging because:\n    - Current direction is U, cannot move R immediately (would require changing direction).\n    - The right side is blocked by the snake's body and obstacles.\n  - It would take many turns to free up space to reach (6, 6), likely exceeding the life_span.\n\n#### Food at (5, 3)\n- Position: (5, 3)\n- Currently under the snake's body.\n- Life_span = 9: can be eaten up to turn 82.\n- To eat, need to move the body away from (5, 3), which would take several turns as the tail is at (2, 3).\n\n### Survival Considerations\n\nGiven the snake's current position and the obstacles, the space is very constrained. The snake is long (16 segments), and many paths lead to dead ends. \n\n- **Eating (3, 4)** leads to a dead end after a few moves, resulting in death but with a score of +1.\n- **Avoiding (3, 4)** means no immediate score, and other foods are either inaccessible or will disappear before being reachable.\n\n### Decision for Turn 74\n\nGiven the analysis, the best immediate action is to **move towards (3, 4)** to secure the +1 score, even though it leads to an eventual dead end. This is because other options do not yield any score and also lead to dead ends.\n\n**Immediate Move at Turn 74**:\n- From (4, 2), moving **Left (L)** to (3, 2) is the first step towards (3, 4).\n\n### Action Sequence\n\nFollowing the plan to eat (3, 4):\n\n1. **Turn 74**: L to (3, 2)\n2. **Turn 75**: U to (3, 3)\n3. **Turn 76**: U to (3, 4) → eat (+1 score)\n4. **Turn 77**: U to (3, 5)\n5. **Turn 78**: R to (4, 5)\n   - At (4, 5), all adjacent cells are blocked → die.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

This leads to certain death on Turn 77.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- Moving **R (Right)** to (4, 3) is suicidal (no escape on Turn 77).\n- Moving **L (Left)** to (2, 3) avoids immediate risks but misses the food at (3, 4), which is a wasted opportunity.\n- Moving **U (Up)** to (3, 4) is the only move that:\n  - Eats positive food (+1 score, +1 length).\n  - Avoids immediate collision.\n  - The food (3, 4) will disappear soon, so delaying risks missing it entirely.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check:\n- Tail is at (2, 5), head is at (3, 3). They are not adjacent (distance >1), so no risk of collision after eating.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate action is to move **U (Up)** to (3, 4) to eat the food and maximize the score while avoiding risks.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Cannot be reached in time (distance too far with obstacles).\n2. **(5,3)**: Value +1, life span 6 (disappears after turn 82). Occupied by body segment, cannot be eaten before it disappears.\n3. **(5,6)**: Value +1, life span 9 (disappears after turn 85). Occupied by body segment, will be vacated on turn 81 if no growth occurs. Plan to eat it on turn 82.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nTo set up for eating (5,6) on turn 82:\n1. **Avoid eating food now** to ensure the tail advances and (5,6) is vacated on turn 81.\n2. **Choose a move that keeps the snake alive and doesn't trap it**:\n   - Moving Up (U) to (3,5) is safe and central.\n   - Moving Left (L) to (2,4) is also safe but may limit future mobility.\n\nGiven the complexity, the safest immediate move is **Up (U)** to (3,5), as it keeps more options open for future moves towards (5,6).\n\n### Final Decision:\n\\boxed{U}",

The snake's body segments are long (17 segments), and the tail is at (4,6).\n2. **Walls**: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4).\n3. **Food**:\n   - (5,3): Value = +1, Life Span = 4 (will disappear after turn 83).\n   - (5,6): Value = +1, Life Span = 6 (will disappear after turn 85).\n   - (6,3): Value = +1, Life Span = 9 (will disappear after turn 88).\n   - All food is currently under the snake's body (not directly accessible).\n\n### Possible Moves from (2,6):\n- **Up (U)**: (2,7) is a wall (y=7). Invalid.\n- **Down (D)**: (2,5) is the snake's second segment. Moving here would cause a collision (not the tail). Invalid.\n- **Left (L)**: (1,6). Check:\n  - Not a wall (x=1 is not a border, and (1,6) is not an internal obstacle).\n  - Not occupied by the snake (not in the snake's positions).\n  - Valid, but let's see the consequences.\n- **Right (R)**: (3,6). Check:\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Not occupied by the snake.\n  - Valid.\n\n### Consequences of Moving Left (L) to (1,6):\n- New head: (1,6).\n- Body: Old head (2,6) becomes the first body segment, and the tail (4,6) is removed (since no food is eaten).\n- Next moves from (1,6):\n  - Up: (1,7) is a wall. Invalid.\n  - Down: (1,5) is an internal obstacle. Invalid.\n  - Left: (0,6) is a wall. Invalid.\n  - Right: (2,6) is now the first body segment. Moving here would cause a collision (not the tail). Invalid.\n- **Result**: The snake would be trapped with no valid moves on the next turn. This is suicidal.\n\n### Consequences of Moving Right (R) to (3,6):\n- New head: (3,6).\n- Body: Old head (2,6) becomes the first body segment, and the tail (4,6) is removed.\n- Next moves from (3,6):\n  - Up: (3,7) is a wall. Invalid.\n  - Down: (3,5) is the third body segment. Collision. Invalid.\n  - Left: (2,6) is the first body segment. Collision. Invalid.\n  - Right: (4,6) is not occupied and not a wall. Valid.\n- **Result**: The snake can continue moving right to (4,6) on the next turn, which is safe.\n\n### Food Considerations:\n- All food is currently under the snake's body, so we cannot eat it immediately. We need to move the snake to vacate those cells first.\n- The food at (5,3) has the shortest life span (disappears after turn 83), so we should prioritize eating it. However, this requires careful planning over multiple turns.\n\n### Immediate Decision:\nAt \\( t_0 = 80 \\), the only safe move is **Right (R)** to (3,6). Moving Left (L) leads to immediate trapping, and other directions are invalid. \n\n### Next Steps (for future turns):\nAfter moving to (3,6), the next move would be to (4,6), and then we can consider eating the food at (5,6) or maneuvering to free up (5,3). However, this is beyond the immediate decision for \\( t_0 \\).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{R}",

So, the only valid move is Right to (4, 6).\n\n### Verifying the Move to (4, 6)\n\nAfter moving to (4, 6):\n\n- **New Head Position**: (4, 6)\n- **New Body**:\n  - Previous head (3, 6) becomes the first body segment.\n  - The rest of the body shifts, and the tail (5, 6) is removed (since no food is eaten).\n- **New Tail**: The segment before the old tail, which is (5, 5).\n\n### Checking for Food at (4, 6)\n\n- There is no food at (4, 6), so the snake does not grow, and the tail is removed.\n\n### Next Possible Moves from (4, 6)\n\nFrom (4, 6), with the direction from the previous move being Right (R), possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (4, 7)\n   - y=7 is a border wall → Invalid\n2. **Down (D)**: (4, 5)\n   - (4, 5) is not occupied or a wall → Valid\n3. **Left (L)**: (3, 6)\n   - (3, 6) is occupied by the snake's body → Collision → Invalid\n4. **Right (R)**: (5, 6)\n   - (5, 6) has food (value 1, life span 5) and is not occupied by the snake (since the tail moved) → Valid\n\n**No instant reverse**: Current direction is Right, so Left would be reverse, but Left is invalid. Thus, possible moves are Down or Right.\n\n### Deciding Between Down (D) and Right (R)\n\n**Option 1: Move Right to (5, 6)**\n- Eat the food at (5, 6), increasing score by +1 and snake length by 1.\n- New head at (5, 6), body includes (4, 6), (3, 6), etc., and the tail remains (since food is eaten).\n\n**Option 2: Move Down to (4, 5)**\n- No food eaten, tail is removed.\n- New head at (4, 5), body includes (4, 6), (3, 6), etc., tail is (5, 4).\n\n**Evaluating the Options:**\n\n- **Food Lifespans**:\n  - (5, 3): life span 3 → disappears after Turn 83\n  - (5, 6): life span 5 → disappears after Turn 85\n  - (6, 3): life span 8 → disappears after Turn 88\n\n- **Accessing (5, 3)**:\n  - Currently, (5, 3) is occupied by the snake's body.\n  - To eat it, the body must move away, and the head must move onto it by Turn 83.\n  - Given the current position, it's unlikely to free (5, 3) in time without risking the snake's safety.\n\n- **Accessing (5, 6)**:\n  - Immediately accessible by moving Right at Turn 81.\n  - Eating it secures +1 score and allows planning for (6, 3) next.\n\n- **Accessing (6, 3)**:\n  - Has a longer lifespan (until Turn 88), so can be targeted after securing (5, 6).\n\n**Conclusion**: It's optimal to eat (5, 6) now at Turn 81 to secure the score, as (5, 3) is likely unattainable safely within its lifespan.\n\n### Immediate Action at Turn 81\n\nGiven the above analysis, the best immediate action is to move Right to (5, 6) to eat the food there.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State (Turn 84)\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state at Turn 84 based on the provided information:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6 (since x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls).\n   - Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4).\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake positions (head first): [(5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)].\n   - Head at (5,5), direction is Down (D).\n\n3. **Food Information**:\n   - (6,3): value = 1, life_span = 6 (disappears at turn 89).\n   - (1,1): value = 1, life_span = 8 (disappears at turn 91).\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves at Turn 84\n\nFrom the head position (5,5) and current direction D, the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Continue Down (D)**: (5,4)\n   - Check (5,4): It's part of the snake's body (last segment before the tail). \n   - Rule: Can move into the tail's current position because the tail will move away.\n   - So, moving to (5,4) is safe.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: (4,5)\n   - Check (4,5): \n     - Not a wall or obstacle.\n     - Not occupied by the snake's body (current snake positions don't include (4,5)).\n     - Valid move.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: (6,5)\n   - Check (6,5):\n     - Not a wall or obstacle.\n     - Not occupied by the snake's body.\n     - Valid move.\n\n4. **Up (U)**: (5,6)\n   - Check (5,6):\n     - Occupied by the snake's body (second segment).\n     - Cannot move into a body segment (except the tail).\n     - Invalid move.\n\n**No Instant Reverse**: Current direction is D, so opposite is U, which is already invalid here.\n\nThus, valid moves at Turn 84: D, L, R.\n\n### Evaluating Moves Based on Food and Survival\n\n1. **Move D to (5,4)**:\n   - New head at (5,4), which is currently the tail.\n   - Tail will move away, so no collision.\n   - No food at (5,4), so length remains the same.\n   - Next moves: From (5,4), possible directions would be L to (4,4) (obstacle), R to (6,4), D to (5,3) (body), U to (5,5) (body). Only R to (6,4) is valid.\n   - This seems limiting as it quickly leads to a dead end.\n\n2. **Move L to (4,5)**:\n   - New head at (4,5).\n   - Next moves: From (4,5), possible directions:\n     - U to (4,6) (body), D to (4,4) (obstacle), L to (3,5) (body), R to (5,5) (body).\n     - All invalid, leading to immediate death next turn.\n   - Not a good option.\n\n3. **Move R to (6,5)**:\n   - New head at (6,5).\n   - Next moves: From (6,5), possible directions:\n     - U to (6,6), D to (6,4), L to (5,5) (body), R invalid (wall).\n     - U to (6,6): \n       - (6,6) is free, not occupied by body or obstacle.\n       - Valid move.\n     - D to (6,4):\n       - (6,4) is free.\n       - Valid move.\n   - This seems more flexible, allowing further movement.\n\n### Considering Food\n\n- **(6,3) Food**:\n  - Currently under the snake's body (segment at (6,3)).\n  - To eat it, the body must move away, then head moves onto it.\n  - Life_span: 6 (from turn 84, so disappears at turn 89). We have until turn 88 to eat it.\n  - If we move in a way that the segment at (6,3) moves away, we can eat it later.\n\n- **(1,1) Food**:\n  - Far from current position.\n  - Life_span: 8 (disappears at turn 91). More time to reach it.\n\nGiven that (6,3) has a shorter life_span, it might be more urgent to try to eat it if possible.\n\n### Planning Moves to Eat (6,3) Food\n\nCurrent snake positions show (6,3) is occupied by a body segment. To eat it:\n\n1. The body segment must move away from (6,3).\n2. Then, the head must move onto (6,3).\n\nLooking at the snake's body, the segment at (6,3) is not the tail, so it will move as the snake progresses.\n\nIf we move R to (6,5) at turn 84:\n\n- Head moves to (6,5).\n- Body segments shift: (5,5) moves to (5,6), etc., and the segment at (6,3) moves to (6,2) (assuming the body shifts accordingly).\n- Then, at turn 85, from (6,5), we can move D to (6,4).\n  - Now, (6,3) is vacated (since the segment moved to (6,2)), and food is exposed.\n- At turn 86, from (6,4), we can move D to (6,3) to eat the food.\n  - But we must check if the tail is at (6,3) when we move to eat it, which would be dangerous.\n  \nHowever, in the current state, the tail is at (5,4). After moving R to (6,5) at turn 84, the tail moves to (5,3). Then at turn 85, moving D to (6,4), the tail moves to (6,3). \n\nAt turn 86, from (6,4), moving D to (6,3) would mean the head is moving to the tail's position where there's food. This is the \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- Head at (6,4), tail at (6,3) with food.\n- Moving D to (6,3) to eat food causes the head and tail to collide after growth, resulting in death.\n\nThus, we cannot safely eat (6,3) food in this path.\n\n### Alternative Path to Eat (6,3) Food\n\nIs there another sequence where (6,3) is not the tail when we eat it?\n\nSuppose at turn 84, we move R to (6,5).\nAt turn 85, move U to (6,6).\nAt turn 86, move D to (6,5).\nAt turn 87, move D to (6,4).\nAt turn 88, move D to (6,3) to eat.\n\nBut this is too late (food disappears at turn 89, but we eat at turn 88). Also, the tail might still be at (6,3) when we try to eat.\n\nThis seems risky and likely not feasible within the life_span.\n\n### Choosing the Safest Move\n\nGiven that eating (6,3) is dangerous and (1,1) is too far, the best strategy is to maximize survival by choosing moves that keep the snake alive longest.\n\nFrom earlier, moving R to (6,5) at turn 84 allows more flexibility:\n\n- Turn 84: R to (6,5).\n- Turn 85: D to (6,4).\n- Turn 86: L to (5,4).\n- Turn 87: From (5,4), no valid moves (all directions blocked or body), so die at turn 87.\n\nThis gives us 3 more moves before death.\n\nAlternatively, moving D to (5,4) at turn 84:\n\n- Turn 84: D to (5,4).\n- Turn 85: From (5,4), possible moves:\n  - R to (6,4).\n  - Others are blocked.\n- Turn 85: R to (6,4).\n- Turn 86: From (6,4), possible moves:\n  - D to (6,3) (dangerous if tail is there), or L to (5,4) (body).\n  - So only D to (6,3), which is dangerous.\n  \nThis seems worse as it leads to potential immediate death.\n\nThus, moving R to (6,5) at turn 84 is slightly better as it allows surviving until turn 87.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the analysis, the safest immediate move at Turn 84 is to move **Right (R)** to (6,5), as it provides the most extended\n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{S}",
