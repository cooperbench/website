The next position if it continues left is (2, 3).\n- **Available Moves**: Since the snake is moving left, it cannot instantly reverse to right (R). So, possible moves are U, D, or continue L.\n  \n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\n#### Option 1: Continue Left (L) to (2, 3)\n- **Food Check**: There's food at (2, 3). \n  - **Tail Check**: The snake is only one segment long, so no tail collision risk.\n  - **Wall Check**: (2, 3) is within bounds and not a wall.\n- **Outcome**: \n  - Move to (2, 3).\n  - Eat the food (since it's positive, score increases, and length becomes 2).\n  - New snake positions: [(2, 3), (3, 3)].\n\n**Pros**: Immediate score gain.\n**Cons**: None in this scenario.\n\n#### Option 2: Move Up (U) to (3, 4)\n- **Food Check**: No food at (3, 4).\n- **Wall Check**: (3, 4) is within bounds and not a wall.\n- **Outcome**: \n  - Move to (3, 4).\n  - No food eaten, snake remains length 1.\n\n**Pros**: Keeps options open for future moves.\n**Cons**: No immediate gain.\n\n#### Option 3: Move Down (D) to (3, 2)\n- **Food Check**: No food at (3, 2).\n- **Wall Check**: (3, 2) is within bounds and not a wall.\n- **Outcome**: \n  - Move to (3, 2).\n  - No food eaten, snake remains length 1.\n\n**Pros**: Keeps options open.\n**Cons**: No immediate gain.\n\n### Comparing Options\n\n- **Option 1 (L)** is the most beneficial because it immediately increases the score and length.\n- **Options 2 (U) and 3 (D)** don't provide any immediate benefit but might be useful if there were risks or better future rewards.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- **Tail Collision**: Not applicable here since the snake is only one segment.\n- **Wall Collision**: All moves considered are within bounds and avoid walls.\n- **Food Under Body**: Not relevant as the snake is only one segment.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the current state, moving left (L) to (2, 3) is the optimal choice because it allows the snake to eat the positive food, increasing both the score and the length of the snake without any immediate risks.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario presented:\n\n1. **Game Grid**: It's a 2D grid with borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n2. **Snake**: \n   - Current positions: Head at (2,3), body segment at (3,3).\n   - Current direction: Left (L).\n3. **Food**:\n   - (3,5): value=9, life_span=1\n   - (6,6): value=9, life_span=1\n   - (6,4): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Snake Movement Basics\n\nThe snake moves one cell per turn in one of four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). The key constraints are:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is Left (L), the next move cannot be Right (R).\n2. **Collision Rules**:\n   - **Body Collision**: Head cannot touch any body segment except the tail, which moves away as the head moves forward.\n   - **Wall Collision**: Cannot move into walls or borders.\n\n### Available Moves\n\nGiven the current direction is Left, the possible moves are:\n- **Continue Left (L)**: (2,3) → (1,3)\n- **Turn Up (U)**: (2,3) → (2,4)\n- **Turn Down (D)**: (2,3) → (2,2)\n\nRight (R) is invalid because it's the opposite of the current direction.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) to (1,3)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Wall**: x=0 is a border. (1,3) is not a wall.\n  - **Body**: Next segment is at (3,3). (1,3) is not a body segment.\n- **Food**: No food at (1,3).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (2,4)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Wall**: y=7 is a border. (2,4) is safe.\n  - **Body**: (2,4) is not a body segment.\n- **Food**: No food at (2,4).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (2,2)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Wall**: y=0 is a border. (2,2) is safe.\n  - **Body**: (2,2) is not a body segment.\n- **Food**: No food at (2,2).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no reward.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nLooking at the food positions:\n1. **(3,5)**: \n   - Distance from head (2,3): Manhattan distance is |3-2| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n   - Value: 9, but life_span is 1, meaning it disappears after this turn.\n   - To reach (3,5) from (2,3):\n     - First move: Up to (2,4).\n     - Second move: Right to (3,4).\n     - Third move: Up to (3,5).\n   But life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn. Cannot reach it in time.\n\n2. **(6,6)**:\n   - Distance: |6-2| + |6-3| = 4 + 3 = 7.\n   - Life_span: 1 → disappears after this turn. Cannot reach.\n\n3. **(6,4)**:\n   - Distance: |6-2| + |4-3| = 4 + 1 = 5.\n   - Life_span: 10 → remains for 10 turns.\n   - To reach (6,4):\n     - First move: Right to (3,3) → but current direction is Left, and Right is invalid (opposite direction).\n     - Alternative path: \n       - Move Up to (2,4), then Right to (3,4), then Right to (4,4), etc.\n     - But it's a long path, and other food might appear.\n\n### Immediate Strategy\n\nSince none of the food can be reached in the immediate next move, the priority is to avoid collisions and position the snake for future food collection.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Danger\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: The tail is at (3,3). Is there any food under the tail? No, because food positions are at (3,5), (6,6), (6,4). So no risk here.\n\n### Decision\n\nAll three possible moves (L, U, D) are safe but don't lead to immediate food. However, considering the snake's current direction is Left, continuing Left seems reasonable to maintain a straight path, which might be beneficial for future maneuvers.\n\nBut, looking at the grid:\n- Moving Left keeps the snake near the left border (x=0), which might limit future options.\n- Moving Up or Down keeps the snake more centered.\n\nBetween Up and Down:\n- Moving Up to (2,4) is closer to the food at (3,5), but as established, it's not reachable.\n- Moving Down to (2,2) might be better to explore the lower part of the grid where there's food at (6,4).\n\nHowever, (6,4) is still far. \n\n### Final Choice\n\nSince all moves are equally safe and no immediate food is accessible, I'll choose to continue Left to maintain simplicity.\n\nBut, looking again, the food at (6,4) has a higher value (10 vs. 9 for others). Maybe it's better to start moving towards it, even if it's not immediate.\n\nTo move towards (6,4):\n- Current position: (2,3)\n- Target: (6,4)\n- Need to increase x and y.\n- First move: Right is invalid (opposite of Left).\n- So, need to change direction to Up or Down first.\n\nMoving Up to (2,4):\n- Next move could be Right to (3,4), then Right to (4,4), etc.\n\nMoving Down to (2,2):\n- Next move could be Right to (3,2), then Right to (4,2), etc.\n\nUp seems better because (6,4) is above the current y position.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the options, moving Up (U) is a safe choice and starts the snake on a path towards the higher-value food at (6,4).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state provided:\n\n1. **Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 2 \\)\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. This means the grid is 8x8 (from (0,0) to (7,7)), and the borders are walls.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: (3, 6) is a wall inside the grid.\n3. **Snake Positions**: \n   - Head: (2, 4)\n   - Body segment: (2, 3)\n   - So, the snake is two segments long, currently moving upwards (direction U).\n4. **Food Items**:\n   - (3, 5): value = 1, life_span = 8\n   - (6, 6): value = 1, life_span = 8\n   - (6, 4): value = 1, life_span = 9\n\n### Visualizing the Grid\n\nTo better understand, let's visualize the grid (8x8, with (0,0) at bottom-left):\n\n- Walls: All borders (x=0,7; y=0,7) and (3,6).\n- Snake:\n  - Head at (2,4)\n  - Body at (2,3)\n- Food:\n  - (3,5)\n  - (6,6)\n  - (6,4)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving Up (U). The possible moves are U, D, L, R, but:\n\n1. **No instant reverse**: Cannot move opposite to current direction (D is opposite to U, so D is invalid).\n2. So, valid moves: U, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U):\n\n- New head position: (2, 4) + U = (2, 5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (2,5) is not a wall (borders are at y=7, and no internal wall here).\n  - Body: Snake body is at (2,3). New head (2,5) doesn't collide.\n- Food at (2,5)? No, food is at (3,5), (6,6), (6,4).\n- So, this is a safe move, but doesn't eat food.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L):\n\n- New head position: (2,4) + L = (1,4)\n- Check collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is a wall, but (1,4) is not a wall.\n  - Body: (1,4) vs (2,3) - no collision.\n- Food at (1,4)? No.\n- Safe move, no food.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R):\n\n- New head position: (2,4) + R = (3,4)\n- Check collisions:\n  - Walls: (3,4) is not a wall (internal wall is at (3,6)).\n  - Body: (3,4) vs (2,3) - no collision.\n- Food at (3,4)? No.\n- Safe move, no food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nCurrently, none of the immediate moves lead to food. But let's see if moving towards food is possible in future turns.\n\nFood positions:\n1. (3,5): To reach this, we could go U then R, or R then U.\n   - From (2,4):\n     - U to (2,5), then R to (3,5): But next turn, after U, direction is U, so R is allowed.\n     - R to (3,4), then U to (3,5): After R, direction is R, so U is allowed.\n2. (6,6): Far away, not immediately reachable.\n3. (6,4): Also far, not immediately reachable.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe need to check if the tail has positive food that could be dangerous. Currently, tail is at (2,3), and there's no food there. So no danger.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nSince no immediate food is accessible, we should choose a move that keeps options open for future food collection.\n\n- Moving U to (2,5):\n  - Next moves could be L to (1,5), R to (3,5) (food), or U to (2,6).\n- Moving L to (1,4):\n  - Next moves could be U to (1,5), D to (1,3) (but D is opposite to new direction L, so invalid), or L to (0,4) (wall).\n  - So only U or L, but L hits wall.\n- Moving R to (3,4):\n  - Next moves could be U to (3,5) (food), D to (3,3), or R to (4,4).\n\nMoving R seems best because next turn we can go U to (3,5) to eat food.\n\n### Verifying Move R\n\nLet's simulate:\n\n- Turn 2: Move R to (3,4). New head direction is R.\n  - Snake: [(3,4), (2,4)] (tail (2,3) is removed).\n- Turn 3: Can move U, D, or R (not L, opposite to R).\n  - U to (3,5): eats food (3,5).\n    - New snake: [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)] (length +1).\n    - No collision: (3,5) not in body [(3,4), (2,4)].\n    - Not adjacent to new tail (which would be (2,4) after growth, but head is at (3,5), not adjacent).\n\nThis seems safe and gets food next turn.\n\n### Alternative: Move U then R\n\n- Turn 2: Move U to (2,5). New head direction is U.\n  - Snake: [(2,5), (2,4)].\n- Turn 3: Can move U, L, or R (not D).\n  - R to (3,5): eats food.\n    - New snake: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)].\n    - Check tail reward danger: new tail is (2,4), head at (3,5) - not adjacent (they are diagonally adjacent, but adjacency is up/down/left/right, so no).\n    - Safe.\n\nThis also works, but takes same number of turns to reach food as moving R then U.\n\n### Deciding Between R then U vs U then R\n\nBoth sequences reach food in two turns. But moving R first may be better because:\n\n- After R to (3,4), next move U to (3,5) eats food.\n- After U to (2,5), next move R to (3,5) eats food.\n- Both are safe, but moving R first might position the snake better for future moves after eating, since the body will be [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)], allowing more flexibility in next moves.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Danger\n\nCurrently, no immediate danger in any move. All possible moves (U, L, R) are safe this turn.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven that moving R now allows us to eat food next turn safely, and keeps the snake's position more flexible for future moves, I'll choose R.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Current Turn**: 3\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. This means the grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7), and the snake can't go outside these bounds.\n   - Internal obstacle: (3, 6) — so the snake can't move to this cell.\n3. **Snake Positions**:\n   - Head: (3, 4)\n   - Next segment: (2, 4)\n   - So, the snake is currently two segments long: head at (3,4) and tail at (2,4).\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: R (right). This means the last move was to the right (from (2,4) to (3,4)).\n5. **Food Items**:\n   - (3, 5): value = 1 (positive), life_span = 7\n   - (6, 6): value = 1, life_span = 7\n   - (6, 4): value = 1, life_span = 8\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No instant reverse**: Since the last move was R (right), the snake cannot move L (left) next. So, possible moves are U, D, R.\n   \n   Wait, let's verify the no instant reverse rule:\n   - Current direction is R (meaning the head moved from (2,4) to (3,4)).\n   - Opposite of R is L. So, cannot move L.\n   - Therefore, allowed moves: U, D, R.\n\n2. **Wall and Obstacle Collisions**:\n   - Moving U (Up) from (3,4): new head position would be (3,5). \n     - Is (3,5) a wall? Border walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=5 is not a wall.\n     - Internal obstacle is at (3,6), not (3,5). So, safe.\n   - Moving D (Down) from (3,4): new head position would be (3,3).\n     - y=3 is not a wall, and no internal obstacle there. Safe.\n   - Moving R (Right) from (3,4): new head position would be (4,4).\n     - x=4 is not a wall, no internal obstacle there. Safe.\n\n3. **Body Collision**:\n   - Snake body segments: only one segment at (2,4).\n   - For U to (3,5): not touching (2,4).\n   - For D to (3,3): not touching (2,4).\n   - For R to (4,4): not touching (2,4).\n   - So, no immediate body collision risk for any move.\n\n4. **Food Considerations**:\n   - Food at (3,5): moving U would eat this.\n   - Food at (6,6) and (6,4): currently not reachable in one move.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Move U (Up) to (3,5)**:\n   - Would eat food at (3,5) (value +1, length increases by 1).\n   - Need to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n     - Current tail is at (2,4).\n     - Is (2,4) a positive food? No, the foods are at (3,5), (6,6), (6,4).\n     - So, no danger from tail reward.\n   - After eating, new snake: head at (3,5), body at (3,4), tail at (2,4) — but length increases, so new tail is (3,4), and old tail (2,4) disappears.\n   - Safe move with +1 score.\n\n2. **Move D (Down) to (3,3)**:\n   - No food there.\n   - Snake moves: head to (3,3), tail moves from (2,4) to (3,4).\n   - New positions: [(3,3), (3,4)].\n   - No score change, just moving.\n\n3. **Move R (Right) to (4,4)**:\n   - No food there.\n   - Snake moves: head to (4,4), tail to (3,4).\n   - New positions: [(4,4), (3,4)].\n   - No score change, just moving.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- **Move U**: +1 score, length increases, no immediate risks.\n- **Move D or R**: No score gain, just repositioning.\n\nGiven that the goal is to maximize score, moving U to eat the food at (3,5) is the best immediate action. \n\n### Checking for Potential Future Risks\n\nAfter moving U to (3,5):\n- New snake: [(3,5), (3,4)]\n- Next turn, possible moves (from direction U):\n  - Cannot move D (opposite of U), so can move U, L, R.\n  - Food at (6,6) and (6,4) are still present, but not immediately reachable.\n  - Need to ensure no immediate collisions next turn, but that's for future planning.\n\n### Verifying Food Under Snake\n\nIs there any food under the snake's body currently?\n- Snake segments: (3,4) and (2,4).\n- Foods at: (3,5), (6,6), (6,4).\n- No food under the snake's body now, so no need to consider moving away to reveal hidden food.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up (U) to eat the positive food at (3,5), increasing the score by 1 and the snake's length by 1, with no immediate risks.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n   - Internal obstacle: (3, 6) is also a wall.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (3,5), then (3,4), then (2,4).\n   - Current direction: Up (U).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (6,6): value=1, life_span=6.\n   - (6,4): value=1, life_span=7.\n   - (3,2): value=1, life_span=10.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Up, the snake cannot instantly reverse to Down (D) on the next move. So, possible moves are U, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U)\n- New head position: (3,5) + U = (3,6).\n- Check for collisions:\n  - (3,6) is an internal obstacle (wall) → Collision! Deadly.\n- **Conclusion**: Cannot move Up.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L)\n- New head position: (3,5) + L = (2,5).\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is a wall, but x=2 is not.\n  - Body segments: Current body is at (3,4) and (2,4). (2,5) is not in the body.\n- Check for food:\n  - Is (2,5) a food position? No.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move. No immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R)\n- New head position: (3,5) + R = (4,5).\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is a wall, x=4 is not.\n  - Body segments: (4,5) is not in the body.\n- Check for food:\n  - Is (4,5) a food position? No.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move. No immediate reward.\n\n### Comparing L and R\n\nBoth Left and Right are safe moves with no immediate food to eat. Now, let's think about future moves and proximity to food.\n\n- **Food at (6,6)**: Distance from head (3,5):\n  - Manhattan distance: |6-3| + |6-5| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n- **Food at (6,4)**: Distance from head (3,5):\n  - |6-3| + |4-5| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n- **Food at (3,2)**: Distance from head (3,5):\n  - |3-3| + |2-5| = 0 + 3 = 3.\n\nThe closest food is at (3,2), which is directly below the head's current position (3,5). To reach it, the snake would need to move Down eventually, but currently, it's moving Up, and we can't reverse direction immediately.\n\nIf we move Left to (2,5), next possible moves would be:\n- From (2,5), direction L: can't reverse to R immediately, so can go U, D, L.\n- To reach (3,2), we'd need to go down, but that's not directly helpful yet.\n\nIf we move Right to (4,5), next possible moves:\n- From (4,5), direction R: can't reverse to L immediately, so can go U, D, R.\n- To reach (3,2), we'd need to go left and down, which is possible but not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, moving Left to (2,5) might allow us to circle around to approach (3,2) from the left side.\n\nHowever, since both moves are safe and don't lead to immediate food, and given that (3,2) is the closest food, moving Left might be slightly better because it positions the snake to potentially go down in future moves to approach (3,2).\n\nBut actually, moving Right to (4,5) also doesn't block any immediate paths. Both moves are equally safe with no immediate advantage.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the choice between L and R is arbitrary at this point. But looking at the snake's body:\n- Current body is at (3,4) and (2,4).\n- If we move Left to (2,5), the body will follow to (3,5), (3,4).\n- If we move Right to (4,5), the body will follow to (3,5), (3,4).\n\nNeither move immediately threatens the snake's body.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThis is a special case where if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrent tail is at (2,4). Adjacent cells to tail:\n- (1,4), (3,4), (2,3), (2,5).\nHead is at (3,5), which is adjacent to (2,5) (but (2,5) is not the tail), and (3,5) is adjacent to (3,4) (which is the body, not tail), etc.\n\nActually, the tail is at (2,4), and head is at (3,5). Adjacent to tail:\n- (1,4), (3,4), (2,3), (2,5).\nHead is at (3,5), which is not adjacent to (2,4) (distance is |3-2| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2, not 1). So no adjacency to tail.\n\nTherefore, no tail reward danger in this move.\n\n### Decision\n\nBoth Left and Right are safe with no immediate advantages. Since the food at (3,2) is closest, moving Left might slightly help in eventually moving down towards it, but it's not a strong preference.\n\nAlternatively, moving Right could be better to explore more space since moving Left might corner the snake near the left wall (x=0).\n\nGiven that, I think moving Right is slightly better to keep more options open.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

The possible moves are U (Up), D (Down), L (Left), R (Right), but we must consider:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is R, we cannot move L (Left) next.\n   - So, possible moves: U, D, R\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (5, 5)\n- New head position: (5, 5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is a wall, but (5,5) is not a wall.\n  - Body: The body segments are at (3,5) and (3,4). (5,5) is not a body segment.\n- Food at (5,5)? No.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (4, 6)\n- New head position: (4, 6)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is a wall, (4,6) is not a wall.\n     - Internal obstacle at (3,6): Not at (4,6), so safe.\n  - Body: (4,6) is not in [(3,5), (3,4)].\n- Food at (4,6)? No.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (4, 4)\n- New head position: (4, 4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is at bottom, (4,4) is not a wall.\n  - Body: (4,4) is not in [(3,5), (3,4)].\n- Food at (4,4)? No.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable soon and if it's beneficial to go towards them.\n\n1. **Food at (6,6)**:\n   - Current distance from head (4,5): dx=2, dy=1 (Manhattan distance = 3)\n   - To reach it, could go R then U or U then R.\n   - Life_span = 5, current turn =5, so it disappears after turn 10 (since countdown decreases each turn including current).\n   - It's positive food (+1), so worth eating if safe.\n\n2. **Food at (6,4)**:\n   - Distance: dx=2, dy=1 (Manhattan distance = 3)\n   - Life_span =6, disappears after turn 11.\n   - Positive food, worth eating if safe.\n\n3. **Food at (3,2)**:\n   - Distance: dx=1, dy=3 (Manhattan distance = 4)\n   - Life_span =9, disappears after turn 14.\n   - Positive food, but further away.\n\n### Potential Paths to Food\n\nLet's consider paths to the closest foods:\n\n1. **Path to (6,6)**:\n   - Current head at (4,5), direction R.\n   - Next move R to (5,5), then U to (5,6), then R to (6,6).\n     - But (5,6) is safe? \n       - Walls: No walls at (5,6).\n       - Body after move R to (5,5): body segments would be (4,5), (3,5), tail at (3,4).\n         - Then move U to (5,6): body at (5,5), (4,5), (3,5).\n           - (5,6) not in body.\n       - Then R to (6,6): body at (5,6), (5,5), (4,5).\n         - (6,6) not in body.\n   - Safe path: R -> U -> R.\n\n2. **Path to (6,4)**:\n   - Current head at (4,5), direction R.\n   - Next move R to (5,5), then D to (5,4), then R to (6,4).\n     - Check safety:\n       - After R to (5,5): body at (4,5), (3,5), tail at (3,4).\n       - Then D to (5,4): body at (5,5), (4,5), (3,5).\n         - (5,4) not in body.\n       - Then R to (6,4): body at (5,4), (5,5), (4,5).\n         - (6,4) not in body.\n   - Safe path: R -> D -> R.\n\n3. **Path to (3,2)**:\n   - Further away, less immediate priority.\n\n### Immediate Decision at Turn 5\n\nAt turn 5, we need to choose the first move towards the most promising food.\n\n- Both (6,6) and (6,4) are equally distant (Manhattan distance 3), but (6,6) has a shorter life_span (disappears at turn 10 vs. turn 11 for (6,4)).\n- However, both have enough time (5 and 6 turns left respectively).\n- Let's choose to go towards (6,6) first since it's slightly more urgent.\n\nFirst move towards (6,6): R to (5,5).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nBefore finalizing R, let's ensure no immediate dangers:\n\n- Moving R to (5,5):\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Not a body segment.\n  - No food at (5,5), so no risk of tail reward danger (since tail is at (3,4), not adjacent to (5,5)).\n\nAlternative moves U and D are also safe but don't progress towards food as directly.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the above analysis, the best immediate action is to move **Right (R)** to position (5,5), initiating the path towards the food at (6,6).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

So, the snake can't move to these coordinates.\n   - Internal obstacle: (3, 6). The snake can't move here.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (5,5), then (4,5), then (3,5). So, the snake is moving to the right (east direction) with its body following.\n   - Current direction: R (right).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (6,6): value=4, life_span=1\n   - (6,4): value=5, life_span=1\n   - (3,2): value=8, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,5) moving right (R), the possible next moves are:\n\n- **Right (R)**: (6,5)\n- **Up (U)**: (5,6)\n- **Down (D)**: (5,4)\n  \nCannot move Left (L) because that's the opposite of the current direction (R), which is not allowed.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Move Right (R) to (6,5)**:\n   - Check for walls: x=6 is a border wall (x=7 is the rightmost, but x=6 is allowed unless specified). Wait, the border is x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is fine.\n   - Check for body collision: Snake body is at (4,5) and (3,5). (6,5) is not in the body, so safe.\n   - Food at (6,5)? No, the foods are at (6,6), (6,4), (3,2). So no food here.\n   - This move is safe but doesn't get food.\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (5,6)**:\n   - Check walls: y=6 is not a border (y=7 is), so okay.\n   - Check body: (5,6) is not in [(4,5), (3,5)], so safe.\n   - Food at (5,6)? No.\n   - Safe, no food.\n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (5,4)**:\n   - Check walls: y=4 is not a border (y=0 is), so okay.\n   - Check body: (5,4) is not in body, safe.\n   - Food at (5,4)? No, but nearby at (6,4).\n   - Safe, no immediate food.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions and their values:\n\n1. **(6,6)**: value=4, life_span=1\n   - Current turn is 6, so it will disappear at turn 7 (since countdown decreases every turn including current).\n   - To reach (6,6) from (5,5):\n     - First move: U to (5,6)\n     - Then next move could be R to (6,6)\n     - But life_span is 1, so after this turn (turn 6), it's gone. Can't reach in one move.\n   - Cannot eat this food.\n\n2. **(6,4)**: value=5, life_span=1\n   - Disappears at turn 7.\n   - From (5,5):\n     - First move: D to (5,4)\n     - Then next move: R to (6,4)\n     - But again, life_span is 1, so can't reach in one move.\n   - Cannot eat this food.\n\n3. **(3,2)**: value=8, life_span=1\n   - Disappears at turn 7.\n   - From (5,5):\n     - Need to move left twice, but current direction is R, can't reverse immediately.\n     - Not reachable in one move.\n   - Cannot eat this food.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if any food is under the tail and if moving onto it would cause collision:\n\n- Tail is at (3,5).\n- Food at (3,2) is not under the tail.\n- Other foods are not under the tail.\n- So no danger from this.\n\n### Best Immediate Action\n\nSince none of the foods can be reached in this immediate move (all require at least two moves and will disappear after this turn), the best action is to move in a direction that:\n\n- Doesn't collide with walls or body.\n- Keeps options open for future moves.\n\nPossible safe moves: R, U, D.\n\n- Moving R to (6,5):\n  - Next moves could be R to (7,5) which is a wall (x=7), so not good.\n  - Or U to (6,6) or D to (6,4), but both are walls (y=6 is not a wall, but y=7 is; y=4 is not a wall).\n  - Not ideal as it limits future options.\n\n- Moving U to (5,6):\n  - Next moves could be R to (6,6) (food but will be gone), or L to (4,6), or U to (5,7) which is a wall.\n  - Not great but keeps some options.\n\n- Moving D to (5,4):\n  - Next moves could be R to (6,4) (food but gone), L to (4,4), or D to (5,3).\n  - Better as it opens more space.\n\nBetween U and D, D seems better because:\n\n- From (5,4), can move L to (4,4) or D to (5,3), both safe.\n- From (5,6), moving L to (4,6) is okay, but moving U is wall.\n\n### Avoiding Future Collisions\n\nAlso, moving D to (5,4) moves away from the body at (4,5) and (3,5), reducing immediate collision risks in future moves.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the safest and most flexible immediate move is **Down (D)** to (5,4).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 9  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 6)\n\n**Snake Positions**:\n- Head: (6, 5)\n- Body segments: (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5)\n\nSo, the snake's body forms this shape:\n- (6,5) - head\n- (6,4) - directly below head\n- (5,4) - to the left of (6,4)\n- (5,5) - above (5,4)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: U (Up, which is increasing y-coordinate)\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (6, 6), value=1, life_span=1\n   - Positive food (+1 score, snake length +1)\n   - Will disappear after this turn (since life_span decreases this turn)\n2. (3, 2), value=5, life_span=1\n   - Positive food (+5 score, snake length +1)\n   - Will disappear after this turn\n3. (5, 1), value=8, life_span=1\n   - Positive food (+8 score, snake length +1)\n   - Will disappear after this turn\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Up, it cannot instantly reverse to Down (D) in the next move.\n\nSo, possible moves: U, L, R\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move's outcome.\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) - (x, y+1)\nCurrent head: (6,5) → New head: (6,6)\n\nCheck:\n- Is (6,6) a wall? No.\n- Is (6,6) occupied by snake body? Let's see snake body: (6,4), (5,4), (5,5). No.\n- Is there food at (6,6)? Yes, value=1, life_span=1.\n\nEating this food:\n- Score +1, length +1.\n- New snake: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5)]\n- Check for Tail Reward Danger: Is the head adjacent to the tail after eating?\n   - New tail is (5,5).\n   - Adjacent to (6,6)? (6,6) is adjacent to (5,5) (diagonally adjacent counts? Wait, adjacency in snake is usually up, down, left, right, not diagonal. So (6,6) is adjacent to (6,5), (5,6), (7,6), (6,7). (5,5) is not adjacent in this sense. So no danger.\n\nSo moving Up is safe and gets +1 score.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) - (x-1, y)\nCurrent head: (6,5) → New head: (5,5)\n\nCheck:\n- Is (5,5) a wall? No.\n- Is (5,5) occupied by snake body? Yes, it's the current tail.\n   - Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves away, but we have to check if there's food there.\n   - Is there food at (5,5)? Looking at food positions: no, food is at (6,6), (3,2), (5,1). So no food here.\n   - So it's safe to move here; the tail will move away, and the head takes (5,5), body becomes [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)].\n\nNo score gain from this move.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) - (x+1, y)\nCurrent head: (6,5) → New head: (7,5)\n\nCheck:\n- Is (7,5) a wall? Border walls include x=7, so yes. This is a wall collision → death.\nSo cannot move Right.\n\n### Comparing Possible Moves\n\n- Up (U): +1 score, safe\n- Left (L): no score, safe\n- Right (R): death\n\nOther foods are too far to reach this turn (since we can only move one cell):\n- (3,2): distance from (6,5) is |6-3| + |5-2| = 3 + 3 = 6, can't reach in one move.\n- (5,1): distance is |6-5| + |5-1| = 1 + 4 = 5, can't reach in one move.\n\nSo the only food we can eat this turn is at (6,6) by moving Up.\n\n### Checking for Optimality\n\nIs moving Up the best choice? \n- It gives +1 score, and is safe.\n- Moving Left gives no score but is safe; maybe useful if we're planning a path to higher-value food next turn, but given that all foods disappear after this turn, we can't reach others next turn either.\n- Other foods will disappear after this turn regardless, so no point planning for them.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to move Up to eat the +1 food at (6,6).\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger Again\n\nAfter eating (6,6):\n- New snake: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5)]\n- Tail is at (5,5).\n- Is (6,6) adjacent to (5,5)? As per movement adjacency (U/D/L/R), no:\n   - Adjacent to (6,6) are (6,5), (5,6), (7,6), (6,7). (5,5) is not in this list.\nSo no danger.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move **Up (U)** to eat the positive food at (6,6) safely.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

The possible moves are Up, Left, or Right (cannot move Down because that would be an instant reverse).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (6,6) → (6,7)\n   - (6,7): Check if this is a wall or body.\n     - y=7 is a border wall → collision → death.\n   - **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: (6,6) → (5,6)\n   - Check (5,6):\n     - Not a wall (walls are at x=0,7; y=0,7; and (3,6)).\n     - Not in snake body: body is at (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5).\n   - Safe move.\n   - Is there food at (5,6)? No.\n   - Next head direction would be Left.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: (6,6) → (7,6)\n   - (7,6): x=7 is a border wall → collision → death.\n   - **Invalid move**.\n\nSo, the only valid move is **Left (L)** to (5,6).\n\n### Checking for Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if moving Left can lead us toward any food in future turns, even if not immediately:\n\n- Current food positions:\n  - (3,2): Far away, life_span=1 (will disappear next turn).\n  - (5,1): Below current position, life_span=1 (will disappear next turn).\n  - (2,6): To the left, life_span=1 (will disappear next turn).\n\nAll food will disappear after this turn (since their life_span is 1 and countdown decreases this turn). Therefore, none of the food can be eaten in this move.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nWe need to ensure that moving Left doesn't put us in a position where the tail has positive food that could kill us next turn.\n\nCurrent tail is at (5,5). After moving Left to (5,6), the tail will move from (5,5) to (5,4) (since the body is [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5)], and the tail is the last segment).\n\nIs there food at (5,5)? No, the foods are at (3,2), (5,1), (2,6). So no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the above analysis:\n\n- Only valid move is Left (L).\n- No immediate food to eat.\n- No danger from tail reward.\n- Other moves lead to death.\n\nTherefore, the best action is to move Left.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

(2, 6), value=1, life_span=9\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,6), and given the snake was moving left (L), the possible moves are:\n- Left (L): (4,6)\n- Up (U): (5,7)\n- Down (D): (5,5)\n\nWe cannot move Right (R) because that would be the opposite of the current direction (L), which is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move for safety and potential rewards.\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) to (4,6)\n\nCheck for collisions:\n- Walls: x=0 is at x=0, so x=4 is safe. y=6 is not a border wall.\n- Internal obstacle: (3,6) is not (4,6), so safe.\n- Body collision: \n  - Current body segments: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)\n  - (4,6) is not in the body, so safe.\n\nCheck for food:\n- No food at (4,6).\n\nSo, moving left is safe but doesn't get any food.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (5,7)\n\nCheck for collisions:\n- Walls: y=7 is a border wall, so (5,7) is a wall. **Danger!**\n  \nSo, moving up is not safe.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (5,5)\n\nCheck for collisions:\n- Walls: y=5 is not a border wall (y=0 and y=7 are borders).\n- Internal obstacle: (3,6) is not (5,5), so safe.\n- Body collision:\n  - (5,5) is not in the body segments [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)], so safe.\n\nCheck for food:\n- No food at (5,5).\n\nSo, moving down is safe but doesn't get any food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nCurrently, none of the immediate moves lead to food. But let's see where the food is and if we can plan to reach them soon.\n\nFood positions:\n1. (3,2): To reach here from (5,6), we'd need to go left twice and down four times, but that's not immediate.\n2. (5,1): From (5,6), down five times.\n3. (2,6): From (5,6), left three times.\n\nNone are immediately accessible in the next move.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nIs the tail adjacent to the head with positive food?\n- Tail is at (5,4).\n- Adjacent cells to head (5,6): (4,6), (6,6), (5,5), (5,7)\n- Tail is at (5,4), which is not adjacent to head (it's two cells down), so no danger here.\n\n### Choosing the Safest Move\n\nFrom the possible moves:\n- Left (L): safe, no food\n- Up (U): wall collision\n- Down (D): safe, no food\n\nBetween left and down, both are safe with no immediate benefit. Let's see which one might set us up better for future moves.\n\nCurrent head direction is L (left). If we continue left to (4,6), next moves could be left again to (3,6), but (3,6) is an internal obstacle, so that's not possible. Alternatively, from (4,6), we could go down to (4,5), etc.\n\nIf we go down to (5,5), from there we can go left to (4,5), down to (5,4) (but tail is at (5,4), which will move away), or right to (6,5) (but (6,5) is a body segment, which will move away unless the tail is there, but it's not the tail).\n\nGoing down seems to open up more options for future moves without immediate danger.\n\n### Decision\n\nBoth left and down are safe, but down might offer slightly more flexibility in the next moves. Also, moving down moves the snake away from the top wall, reducing future collision risks.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to move **Down (D)**.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

No food listed there.\n   - After moving, the tail (6,4) moves away, so new body: [(5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)].\n   - Safe move, but no immediate food benefit.\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (4,5)**:\n   - Check collisions:\n     - Body: (4,5) is not in [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)], safe.\n     - Walls: No wall at (4,5).\n   - Food at (4,5)? No.\n   - New body: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)].\n   - Safe, no food.\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (6,5)**:\n   - Check collisions:\n     - Body: (6,5) is in the body segments [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4)] — but it's the tail's current position.\n       - Tail is at (6,4), moving to (6,5) is where the tail currently is, but the tail will move away to (6,5) as the head moves in.\n       - However, the segment at (6,5) is not the tail; the tail is at (6,4). So moving to (6,5) would collide with the body segment at (6,5).\n       - Wait, let's clarify: current body is [(5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)].\n         - Moving to (6,5): is (6,5) in the body? Yes, it's the 4th segment.\n         - But the tail is at (6,4), which will move to (6,5) after the head moves.\n         - So moving to (6,5) would mean the head is where the new tail will be, causing a collision.\n       - Hence, this is unsafe.\n   - So, moving R is not safe.\n\n### Checking for Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food is adjacent to the head (5,5):\n\n1. (3,2): Distance from (5,5) is |5-3| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5 (not adjacent).\n2. (5,1): Distance is |5-5| + |5-1| = 0 + 4 = 4 (not adjacent).\n3.

Which is better?\n\n- **Down to (5,4)**:\n  - Next moves from (5,4): can go L to (4,4), R to (6,4), or continue D to (5,3).\n  - (6,4) is where the tail currently is, but after this move, tail moves to (6,5), so (6,4) is safe next turn.\n- **Left to (4,5)**:\n  - Next moves from (4,5): can go D to (4,4), U to (4,6), or continue L to (3,5).\n  - (4,6) is not a wall, but need to check body next turn.\n\nBoth seem safe, but moving Down might keep more options open since it's moving away from the body cluster.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any food under the tail? Tail is at (6,4). Is there food at (6,4)?

No.\n   - Outcome: Just move.\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (6,4):**\n   - Check walls: (6,4) is not a wall.\n   - Check body collision: Not in body segments.\n   - Safe to move.\n   - Food at (6,4)? No.\n   - Outcome: Just move.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nLet's see if any food is adjacent to the head (5,4):\n\nAdjacent cells:\n- Up (5,5): body segment (5,5) - can't go there (U is invalid anyway).\n- Down (5,3): no food.\n- Left (4,4): no food.\n- Right (6,4): no food.\n\nNo immediate food adjacent. So, we need to consider paths to reach food in future moves.\n\n**Available Foods:**\n1. (3,2): value=1, life=1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten).\n   - Distance from (5,4): |5-3| + |4-2| = 2 + 2 = 4.\n   - Can't reach in one move, will disappear after this turn, so irrelevant.\n2. (5,1): value=4, life=1.\n   - Distance: |5-5| + |4-1| = 0 + 3 = 3.\n   - Can't reach in one move, will disappear, irrelevant.\n3. (2,6): value=7, life=1.\n   - Distance: |5-2| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 = 5.\n   - Can't reach, disappears, irrelevant.\n4. (4,1): value=10, life=1.\n   - Distance: |5-4| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n   - Can't reach, disappears, irrelevant.\n\nAll foods will disappear after this turn, so none are reachable in the immediate move.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if the tail has positive food that could be dangerous:\n- Tail is at (6,5).\n- Adjacent to head (5,4)? \n  - Distance: |6-5| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2 (not adjacent, diagonally adjacent doesn't count as adjacent in this context, assuming adjacent means directly up/down/left/right).\n- So, no immediate danger from tail food.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nSince no food is reachable this turn, and all foods will disappear, the goal is to stay alive and position for future food (though none is specified beyond this turn).\n\nPossible moves: D, L, R.\n\n**Move Down (D) to (5,3):**\n- Keeps moving down, no immediate benefit or risk.\n\n**Move Left (L) to (4,4):**\n- Moves towards the center-left, might be safer from walls.\n\n**Move Right (R) to (6,4):**\n- Moves towards the right, but the body is at (6,6) and (6,5), so not immediately risky.\n\nBetween L and R, moving left seems slightly better as it's towards the center where there's more space to maneuver in future turns.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all options, the safest move is **Left (L)** to (4,4).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (can't move beyond these).\n   - Internal obstacle: (3, 6) — can't move here.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (4,4), then (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6).\n   - Current direction: Left (L).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (5,1): value=1, life_span=4.\n   - (2,6): value=1, life_span=6.\n   - (4,1): value=1, life_span=9.\n\n### Snake's Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4,4) and moving Left (L), the possible next moves are:\n\n- **Left (L)**: (3,4)\n- **Up (U)**: (4,5)\n- **Down (D)**: (4,3)\n\nCannot move Right (R) because that would be the opposite of Left (instant reverse is not allowed).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) to (3,4)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is at x=0, so x=3 is safe. y=4 is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacle: (3,6) — not (3,4), so safe.\n  - Body collision:\n    - Snake body segments: (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6).\n    - (3,4) is not in the body, so safe.\n- Food at (3,4)? No, none of the food is at (3,4).\n- Outcome: Just move left, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (4,5)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is at y=7, so y=5 is safe. x=4 is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacle: (3,6) — not (4,5), so safe.\n  - Body collision:\n    - (4,5) is not in the body [(5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6)], so safe.\n- Food at (4,5)? No.\n- Outcome: Just move up, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (4,3)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is at y=0, so y=3 is safe. x=4 is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacle: (3,6) — not (4,3), so safe.\n  - Body collision:\n    - (4,3) is not in the body, so safe.\n- Food at (4,3)? No.\n- Outcome: Just move down, no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nCurrently, none of the food is adjacent to the head (4,4). The closest foods are:\n\n1. (5,1): Distance is |5-4| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. (2,6): Distance is |2-4| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4.\n3. (4,1): Distance is |4-4| + |1-4| = 0 + 3 = 3.\n\nThe closest is (4,1), which is 3 moves away (down, down, down). But currently, moving down to (4,3) doesn't get us closer to any food directly.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nIs any food adjacent to the head (4,4)?\n\n- (5,1): (5-4,1-4) = (1,-3) — not adjacent.\n- (2,6): (2-4,6-4) = (-2,2) — not adjacent.\n- (4,1): (4-4,1-4) = (0,-3) — not adjacent.\n\nNo adjacent food, so no immediate eating opportunity.\n\n### Checking for Future Moves\n\nSince no immediate food is available, we should choose a move that keeps options open and avoids getting trapped.\n\nCurrent snake body:\n- Head: (4,4)\n- Body: (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6)\n\nAfter moving, the tail (6,6) will move forward, so the new body will be:\n- If move Left (L): new head (3,4), body (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6).\n- If move Up (U): new head (4,5), body (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6).\n- If move Down (D): new head (4,3), body (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6).\n\nLooking ahead, moving Left seems safe as it moves away from the body cluster at (5,4)-(5,6).\n\nMoving Up to (4,5) is also safe, but moving Down to (4,3) might be better to eventually reach (4,1) food.\n\nHowever, (4,1) has a life_span of 9, and current turn is 14, so it will disappear at turn 23. Plenty of time.\n\n### Avoiding Dead Ends\n\nWe should avoid moving into positions where the snake might get trapped. Moving Left to (3,4):\n\n- Next moves from (3,4):\n  - Left: (2,4) — safe.\n  - Up: (3,5) — check body: new body would be (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). (3,5) is safe.\n  - Down: (3,3) — safe.\n\nNo immediate traps.\n\nMoving Down to (4,3):\n\n- Next moves from (4,3):\n  - Left: (3,3) — safe.\n  - Right: (5,3) — but current direction is Left, so Right is opposite, not allowed next.\n  - Down: (4,2) — safe.\n  \nSo, moving Down allows Left or Down next, but not Right (which is fine since we're moving Left now).\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that no food is immediately accessible, and all moves are safe, I think moving Down is slightly better because:\n\n1. It moves towards the food at (4,1), which is the closest food.\n2. It doesn't restrict future moves more than necessary.\n3. Moving Left is also safe but doesn't progress towards any food.\n\nMoving Up is safe but doesn't seem to have an advantage over Down.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the tail (6,6) adjacent to the head (4,4)? \n\nDistance: |6-4| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4. Not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1). So no danger from tail food.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all options, the best immediate action is to move **Down** to (4,3), as it safely moves towards the closest food at (4,1) without any immediate risks.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the scenario:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning the grid is 8x8 (from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n2. **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (3,6).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (4,3), followed by body segments at (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6).\n   - Current direction: Down (D), meaning the snake was moving downward in the previous turn.\n4. **Food**:\n   - (5,1): value=1, life_span=3\n   - (2,6): value=1, life_span=5\n   - (4,1): value=1, life_span=8\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake's position and the food locations:\n\n- Snake:\n  - Head: (4,3)\n  - Body: (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)\n  \n  Drawing this:\n  - (5,6) is the tail.\n  - The snake's body makes a sort of \"L\" shape from (4,3) to (5,6).\n\n- Food:\n  - (5,1): Below the current head, near the bottom wall (y=0 is at the bottom).\n  - (2,6): Near the top-right, close to the wall at y=7.\n  - (4,1): Directly below the head, near the bottom wall.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake's current direction is Down (D). The possible moves are:\n\n1. **Continue Down (D)**: \n   - New head position: (4,2)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=0 is at y=0, so (4,2) is safe (y=2 > 0).\n     - Body: Snake body is at (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). (4,2) is not in these.\n     - Obstacle: Internal wall at (3,6), no conflict.\n   - Food: \n     - (4,1) is below (4,2), not directly at (4,2).\n     - No food at (4,2).\n\n2. **Turn Left (L)**:\n   - Current direction is D, so left is relative to down, which is to the right when looking from the head's perspective (this seems confusing; let's clarify).\n   - Actually, if the snake is moving down (D), turning left (L) would mean changing direction to left relative to the current down direction, which is to the right in terms of the grid's left. Wait, this is ambiguous.\n   - Standard interpretation: Left (L) is decreasing x, Right (R) is increasing x, Up (U) is increasing y, Down (D) is decreasing y.\n   - So from D, possible turns are L or R (can't reverse to U).\n   - Left (L): new head at (3,3)\n     - Check collisions:\n       - Walls: x=0 is at x=0, (3,3) is safe (3 > 0).\n       - Body: (3,3) is not in body segments.\n       - Obstacle: (3,6) is not at (3,3).\n     - Food: No food at (3,3).\n\n3. **Turn Right (R)**:\n   - New head at (5,3)\n     - Check collisions:\n       - Walls: x=7 is at x=7, (5,3) is safe (5 < 7).\n       - Body: (5,4) is part of the body, but (5,3) is not.\n       - Obstacle: No issue.\n     - Food: No food at (5,3).\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions and their distances from the head (4,3):\n\n1. (5,1):\n   - Distance: |5-4| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n   - Life span: 3 (will disappear after 3 more turns, including current).\n   - To reach it:\n     - Need to go right to x=5, then down to y=1.\n     - From (4,3), can go R to (5,3), then D to (5,2), then D to (5,1).\n     - But life span is 3, so if we start moving towards it now, it will disappear at turn 18 (current is 15), so we can reach it by turn 17 (D at 16 to (5,2), D at 17 to (5,1)).\n\n2. (2,6):\n   - Distance: |2-4| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = 5\n   - Life span: 5\n   - To reach:\n     - Need to go left to x=2, up to y=6.\n     - From (4,3), L to (3,3), L to (2,3), then U to (2,4), U to (2,5), U to (2,6).\n     - Life span is 5, disappears at turn 20, can reach by turn 19.\n\n3. (4,1):\n   - Distance: |4-4| + |1-3| = 0 + 2 = 2\n   - Life span: 8\n   - To reach:\n     - Directly down: D to (4,2), D to (4,1).\n     - Can reach by turn 16 (D at 15 to (4,2), D at 16 to (4,1)).\n\n### Considering Immediate Action at Turn 15\n\nAt turn 15, we need to decide the immediate move: D, L, or R.\n\n**Option 1: D to (4,2)**\n- Moves towards (4,1) food.\n- Next turn (16), can D to (4,1) to eat it.\n- (4,1) has life span 8, will be there until turn 23, so no rush.\n- But eating it grows the snake, which might limit future movements.\n\n**Option 2: L to (3,3)**\n- Starts path towards (2,6).\n- But (2,6) is far, and we have closer food.\n- Not immediately beneficial.\n\n**Option 3: R to (5,3)**\n- Starts path towards (5,1).\n- (5,1) disappears at turn 18, can reach by turn 17.\n- After R to (5,3), next moves would be D to (5,2), D to (5,1).\n- This seems efficient.\n\n**Comparing Options**:\n- (4,1) is safe but not urgent; can get it later.\n- (5,1) is more urgent due to shorter life span.\n- (2,6) is too far and not urgent.\n\n### Checking for Dangers\n\nWe must ensure that moving towards food doesn't lead to a trap or immediate danger.\n\nFor (5,1):\n- After eating at (5,1), the snake grows, adding a new tail where the current tail is (5,6).\n- The new tail will be at (5,6), and the body will extend.\n- Need to ensure that after growth, the snake can move safely.\n\nBut for now, immediate move to R seems safe:\n- No collision at (5,3).\n- Next move can be D to (5,2), then D to (5,1).\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nSpecial rule: If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the new tail would collide with the head.\n\nCurrent tail is at (5,6). Head is at (4,3), not adjacent to (5,6) (distance is |5-4| + |6-3| = 1 + 3 = 4 > 1). So no danger here.\n\n### Decision\n\nBest immediate action is to start moving towards (5,1) by going Right (R) to (5,3).\n\n### Verifying Other Options\n\nJust to be thorough:\n\nIf we go D to (4,2):\n- Next turn can D to (4,1) to eat.\n- But then snake grows, and next moves might be limited.\n- Also, (5,1) will disappear soon, missing opportunity.\n\nIf we go L to (3,3):\n- Not leading to immediate food, and (2,6) is not urgent.\n\nThus, R is the best choice.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Current Turn**: 16\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n   - Internal obstacle: (3, 6)\n3. **Snake Positions**:\n   - Head: (5, 3)\n   - Body segments: (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5)\n   - So the snake's length is 5.\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Right (R).\n5. **Food Items**:\n   - (5, 1): value = 2, life_span = 1\n   - (2, 6): value = 4, life_span = 1\n   - (4, 1): value = 7, life_span = 1\n   - (3, 1): value = 10, life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5, 3) moving Right (R), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (5, 4)\n- **Down (D)**: (5, 2)\n- **Left (L)**: (4, 3)\n- **Right (R)**: (6, 3)\n\nBut we cannot instantly reverse the direction. Current direction is R, so we cannot move Left (L) next. So possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (5, 4)\n- Current body segments: (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n- After move:\n  - New head: (5,4)\n  - Body becomes: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)\n  - Tail (5,5) moves away, so (5,5) is no longer part of the snake.\n- Check for collisions:\n  - (5,4) is currently part of the body (4th segment), but since the tail is moving away, it's okay as long as the head isn't moving into the segment that was just before the tail (which it isn't here).\n  - Wait, no: the body after move is (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4). So head is at (5,4), which is the same as the last body segment before the move, but since the tail moves away, it's not a collision. But actually, the new head is where the 4th segment was, but the tail was at (5,5), which is moving away, so (5,4) is now free. So no collision.\n- Food at (5,4)? No, food is at (5,1), (2,6), (4,1), (3,1).\n- So moving U is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n#### 2. Move Down (D) to (5, 2)\n- Check walls: y=0 is wall, (5,2) is within bounds.\n- Check body: (5,2) is not in current body [(4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)].\n- Food at (5,2)? No.\n- Food at (5,1) is below (5,2), so next move could go down to eat it, but life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn. So we can't reach it in time.\n- So moving D is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (6, 3)\n- Check walls: x=7 is wall, (6,3) is within bounds.\n- Check body: (6,3) is not in current body.\n- Food at (6,3)? No.\n- So moving R is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n### Food Analysis\n\nAll food has life_span = 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn. So we can't reach any of them this turn because we can only move one step, and none are adjacent to the head (5,3):\n\n- (5,1): distance is |5-5| + |3-1| = 2 (need two moves)\n- (2,6): distance is |5-2| + |3-6| = 3 + 3 = 6\n- (4,1): distance is |5-4| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- (3,1): distance is |5-3| + |3-1| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nNone are adjacent (distance 1), so we can't eat any this turn.\n\n### Avoiding Future Collisions\n\nWe should also consider future moves to avoid getting stuck. Currently, the snake is in a bit of a loop:\n\n- Positions: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n  \nMoving Up to (5,4) would make the body: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) — which is a tighter loop. Maybe not ideal.\n\nMoving Right to (6,3) opens up more space to the right.\n\nMoving Down to (5,2) also opens space downward, but then next move could go left to (4,2) or right to (6,2), but left is towards the body.\n\n### Best Move\n\nSince we can't eat any food this turn, the priority is to move to a safe position that keeps options open for future moves. Moving Right to (6,3) seems best as it moves away from the current body loop and towards the open right side of the grid.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail with positive food on the tail? \n\nTail is at (5,5). Head is at (5,3). Distance is |5-5| + |3-5| = 2, not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1). So no danger here.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the safest move that keeps future options open is to move Right.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

This means the snake cannot move outside these boundaries.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (3, 6).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented as a list from head to tail:\n     - Head: (6, 3)\n     - Segment 1: (5, 3)\n     - Segment 2: (4, 3)\n     - Segment 3: (4, 4)\n     - Segment 4: (5, 4)\n   - **Direction**: The snake's head is currently moving to the Right (\"R\").\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are four food items on the grid:\n     1. (5, 1): value = 1, life_span = 1\n     2. (2, 6): value = 1, life_span = 3\n     3. (4, 1): value = 1, life_span = 6\n     4. (3, 1): value = 1, life_span = 9\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nTo better understand, let's visualize the snake and food positions:\n\n- **Snake**:\n  - Head at (6, 3)\n  - Body segments at (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)\n  \n  Drawing this:\n  - (6,3) - head\n  - (5,3) - body\n  - (4,3) - body\n  - (4,4) - body\n  - (5,4) - tail\n\n- **Food**:\n  - (5,1)\n  - (2,6)\n  - (4,1)\n  - (3,1)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Right (R), the snake cannot instantly reverse to Left (L) in the next move (no instant reverse rule). So, possible moves are U, D, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Right (R)**: Move to (7, 3)\n   - Check if (7,3) is a wall: x=7 is a border wall → collision → deadly.\n   - **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: Move to (6, 4)\n   - Check if (6,4) is occupied by the snake's body:\n     - Snake body segments: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)\n     - (6,4) is not in the body → safe.\n   - Check if (6,4) is a wall: No walls at (6,4).\n   - **Valid move**.\n   - Is there food at (6,4)? No food listed there.\n   - Outcome: Move to (6,4), no food eaten.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: Move to (6, 2)\n   - Check if (6,2) is occupied by the snake's body: No.\n   - Check if (6,2) is a wall: No.\n   - **Valid move**.\n   - Is there food at (6,2)? No food listed there.\n   - Outcome: Move to (6,2), no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable or if moving towards food is beneficial.\n\nCurrent head at (6,3). Possible moves: U to (6,4), D to (6,2).\n\nFood positions:\n1. (5,1): distance from head (6,3) is |6-5| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3\n   - To reach (5,1), possible path: Down to (6,2), then Left to (5,2), then Down to (5,1).\n   - But life_span is 1, and current turn is 17. It will disappear at turn 18, so we can't reach it in time (need at least 2 moves).\n   - **Cannot eat this food**.\n\n2. (2,6): distance is |6-2| + |3-6| = 4 + 3 = 7\n   - Life_span is 3, so disappears at turn 20.\n   - Need at least 7 moves to reach, which would be turn 24 → too late.\n   - **Cannot eat this food**.\n\n3. (4,1): distance is |6-4| + |3-1| = 2 + 2 = 4\n   - Life_span is 6, disappears at turn 23.\n   - Need at least 4 moves: e.g., Down to (6,2), Left to (5,2), Down to (5,1), Left to (4,1).\n   - Possible to reach by turn 21 (within life_span).\n   - **Potential target**.\n\n4. (3,1): distance is |6-3| + |3-1| = 3 + 2 = 5\n   - Life_span is 9, disappears at turn 26.\n   - Need at least 5 moves.\n   - **Potential target, but farther than (4,1)**.\n\nBetween (4,1) and (3,1), (4,1) is closer and can be reached within its life_span.\n\n### Planning Path to (4,1)\n\nTo reach (4,1):\n- Current head at (6,3).\n- Need to move towards decreasing x and decreasing y.\n- Possible first move: Down to (6,2) or Left to (5,3).\n\nBut Left to (5,3) is the body segment → collision.\nSo first move must be Down to (6,2).\n\nThen next moves:\n1. Turn 17: Down to (6,2)\n2. Turn 18: Left to (5,2)\n3. Turn 19: Down to (5,1)\n4. Turn 20: Left to (4,1) → eat food at (4,1), which disappears at turn 23.\n\nThis is feasible.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nIs there any food adjacent to the head that can be eaten immediately?\n\nAdjacent cells to head (6,3):\n- Right (7,3): wall\n- Up (6,4): no food\n- Down (6,2): no food\n- Left (5,3): body segment, but has no food (food is at (5,1), not (5,3))\n\nNo immediate food to eat.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if the tail has positive food that could be dangerous:\n- Tail is at (5,4).\n- Adjacent to head (6,3)? \n  - Distance: |6-5| + |3-4| = 1 + 1 = 2 (not adjacent, adjacent means distance 1)\n  - Adjacent cells to head: (6,4), (6,2), (5,3), (7,3)\n  - Tail is at (5,4), which is not adjacent to head (distance is sqrt(2), but in grid terms, not directly adjacent unless same x or y with distance 1).\n  - So no danger from tail food.\n\n### Decision for Current Turn (t=17)\n\nGiven that:\n- Right is invalid (wall).\n- Up and Down are safe but don't lead to immediate food.\n- Best strategy is to start moving towards (4,1), which requires first moving Down to (6,2).\n\n### Verifying Down Move\n\nMove Down to (6,2):\n- New head position: (6,2)\n- Body segments shift: new body is [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)]\n- Tail was at (5,4), which moves to (5,4) is now gone (since the snake doesn't grow, length stays same unless eating food).\n\nThis is safe and starts the path towards (4,1).\n\n### Alternative Consideration: Up Move\n\nMove Up to (6,4):\n- New head: (6,4)\n- Body: [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)]\n- This doesn't help in reaching any food quickly.\n- (4,1) is better approached by moving down first.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down to start the path towards the closest reachable positive food at (4,1).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

(2, 6) - value: +1, life_span: 3\n2. (4, 1) - value: +1, life_span: 5\n3. (3, 1) - value: +1, life_span: 8\n\n### Possible Moves:\nThe snake's current direction is Down (D). The possible moves are U, D, L, R, but we cannot instantly reverse (so U is not allowed). Thus, possible moves: D, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move.\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D):\n- New head position: (6, 2) + (0, -1) = (6, 1)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is at y=0, so (6,1) is within bounds.\n  - Internal obstacles: (3,6) is not (6,1).\n  - Body collision: Check if (6,1) is in snake body.\n    - Snake body: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) — no collision.\n- Food at new head position:\n  - No food at (6,1).\n- After moving, tail moves forward: new tail is (6,3), (5,3), (4,3).\n  - New snake: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)]\n- Is there any food under the tail that could be dangerous next turn?\n  - Current tail is at (4,4). No food there.\n- Next turn considerations:\n  - Direction is D, so cannot move U next turn.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L):\n- New head position: (6, 2) + (-1, 0) = (5, 2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is at x=0, so (5,2) is within bounds.\n  - Internal obstacles: (3,6) is not (5,2).\n  - Body collision: Check if (5,2) is in snake body.\n    - Snake body: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) — no collision.\n- Food at new head position:\n  - No food at (5,2).\n- After moving, tail moves forward: new tail is (6,3), (5,3), (4,3).\n  - New snake: [(5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)]\n- Is there any food under the tail that could be dangerous next turn?\n  - Current tail is at (4,4). No food there.\n- Next turn considerations:\n  - Direction is L, so cannot move R next turn.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R):\n- New head position: (6, 2) + (1, 0) = (7, 2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is a border, so (7,2) is a wall — collision!\n  - Cannot move here.\n\n### Evaluating Food:\nCurrently, the snake is not adjacent to any food. The closest foods are:\n1. (2,6) - distance: |6-2| + |2-6| = 4 + 4 = 8\n2. (4,1) - distance: |6-4| + |2-1| = 2 + 1 = 3\n3. (3,1) - distance: |6-3| + |2-1| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nThe closest is (4,1). Let's see how to reach it.\n\nFrom (6,2), to reach (4,1):\n- Need to move left twice and down once, or down once and left twice.\nCurrent move options are D or L.\n\nIf we move D to (6,1):\n- Next moves could be L to (5,1), then L to (4,1).\n\nIf we move L to (5,2):\n- Next moves could be L to (4,2), then D to (4,1).\n\nBoth sequences take 3 moves to reach the food. However, moving D first seems safer because:\n- Moving L first brings us closer to the left wall, limiting future options.\n- Moving D first keeps us more central.\n\nAlso, moving D doesn't immediately restrict our next move (can still go L or R next turn, not U), whereas moving L restricts us from moving R next turn.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers:\n- No food is under the tail or adjacent to the head that could cause a collision next turn.\n- Both D and L moves are safe in terms of immediate collisions.\n\n### Life Span of Food:\n- (2,6): life_span=3 (will disappear in 3 turns)\n- (4,1): life_span=5\n- (3,1): life_span=8\n\n(4,1) is the closest and has a reasonable life span, so targeting it is feasible.\n\n### Decision:\nBetween D and L, moving D seems slightly better because:\n- It doesn't restrict the next move as much (can still go L or R next turn).\n- It's a step towards the closest food (4,1) via a safe path.\n\nMoving L is also safe but restricts next move to not be R.\n\n### Final Choice:\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Current Turn**: 19\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n   - Internal obstacle: (3, 6)\n3. **Snake Positions**:\n   - Head: (6, 1)\n   - Body: [(6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3)]\n   - So the snake is 5 segments long.\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: D (Down)\n   - This means the snake was moving downward in the previous move.\n5. **Food Items**:\n   - (2, 6): value=2, life_span=1\n   - (4, 1): value=4, life_span=1\n   - (3, 1): value=7, life_span=1\n   - (6, 1): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (6,1) and direction D, the possible moves are:\n- **Down (D)**: (6, 0) → But y=0 is a wall, so this would be a wall collision → Deadly.\n- **Left (L)**: (5, 1)\n- **Right (R)**: (7, 1) → x=7 is a wall → Deadly.\n  \nSince we can't reverse direction instantly (from D to U is reverse), the only legal non-deadly move is **Left (L)** to (5,1).\n\nBut let's check if there's any food at (5,1). Looking at the food positions:\n- (2,6), (4,1), (3,1), (6,1) → None at (5,1), so moving left is safe in terms of not eating anything.\n\nHowever, let's also consider if moving left could lead to any immediate dangers in the next steps, but since we're only deciding the immediate action, we don't need to look ahead.\n\n### Checking for Food Under the Snake's Body\n\nThe food at (6,1) is under the snake's head right now. According to the rules:\n- To eat food under the body, the body must move away, and then the head moves onto it.\n- Currently, the head is at (6,1), and the food is also at (6,1). The head can't move onto itself, so we can't eat this food now.\n  \nThe other foods are:\n- (4,1) and (3,1) are to the left of the head, but moving left would take us to (5,1), not directly to them.\n- (2,6) is far away and not reachable in one move.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe tail is at (4,3). The head is at (6,1), which is not adjacent to the tail (distance is more than 1), so no danger from tail reward here.\n\n### Immediate Action\n\nGiven all this:\n- Only safe move is Left (L) to (5,1).\n- Moving Down or Right leads to walls.\n- Moving Up is a reverse, which is not allowed.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Collision After Move\n\nAfter moving left to (5,1), the new positions would be:\n- Head: (5,1)\n- Body: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]\n  \nCheck if (5,1) collides with any body part:\n- (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) are all different from (5,1) → No collision.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe and legal move is Left (L).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Snake grows by 1, so new tail is the old tail (5,3), and new segment is added where head was (5,1), but head moves to (4,1), so body becomes [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)].\n\nIs (4,1) adjacent to (5,3)?

(6,1): value = +1, life_span = 8\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4,1) moving left (L), the possible next moves are:\n- **Left (L)**: (3,1) — this is the current direction.\n- **Up (U)**: (4,2)\n- **Down (D)**: (4,0) — but y=0 is a wall, so this is invalid.\n  \nWe cannot move Right (R) because that would be an instant reverse (opposite of current direction L), which is not allowed.\n\nSo, valid immediate moves are: Left (L) or Up (U).\n\n### Evaluating Left (L) to (3,1)\n\n**Checking for Collisions**:\n- (3,1) is not part of the snake's body (current body positions are (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)).\n- (3,1) is not a wall (walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (3,6)).\n\n**Food at (3,1)**:\n- There is positive food at (3,1) with value +1.\n- Eating this would increase the snake's length by 1.\n  \n**Tail Reward Danger Check**:\n- After moving left, the new head is at (3,1), and the tail is currently at (5,3).\n- The new tail would be at (5,1) because the snake moves forward (the tail segment at (5,3) moves to the next segment's previous position).\n- The distance between new head (3,1) and new tail (5,1) is not adjacent (they are two units apart in x), so no danger.\n\n**Conclusion for Left (L)**:\n- Safe move.\n- Eats positive food (+1 score, length +1).\n\n### Evaluating Up (U) to (4,2)\n\n**Checking for Collisions**:\n- (4,2) is not part of the snake's body.\n- (4,2) is not a wall.\n\n**Food at (4,2)**:\n- There is no food listed at (4,2).\n\n**Tail Reward Danger Check**:\n- Not applicable since no food is eaten.\n\n**Conclusion for Up (U)**:\n- Safe move.\n- No food eaten, so no score change or length increase.\n\n### Comparing Left (L) and Up (U)\n\n- **Left (L)**: Eats positive food, increases length, safe.\n- **Up (U)**: Safe but no immediate benefit.\n\nGiven that eating positive food is beneficial unless it leads to a collision, and in this case, Left is safe and beneficial, it seems the better choice.\n\n### Checking for Other Considerations\n\n**Food at (6,1)**:\n- This is under the snake's body segment (6,1).\n- To eat this, the body would have to move away first, which isn't happening immediately.\n- So, not a concern for the current move.\n\n**Life Span of Foods**:\n- (3,1): life_span = 6 — will disappear after 6 more turns (including current).\n- (6,1): life_span = 8 — will disappear after 8 more turns.\n- Not immediately relevant for the current move decision.\n\n### Potential Future Moves After Left (L)\n\nAfter moving left to (3,1), the snake's new positions would be:\n- Head: (3,1)\n- Body: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n  \nNext possible moves from (3,1):\n- Left (L): (2,1) — but x=0 is a wall, so next left would be (1,1), etc.\n- Up (U): (3,2)\n- Down (D): (3,0) — y=0 is a wall, invalid.\n  \nNo immediate threats seen after this move.\n\n### Potential Future Moves After Up (U)\n\nAfter moving up to (4,2), the snake's new positions would be:\n- Head: (4,2)\n- Body: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n  \nNext possible moves from (4,2):\n- Left (L): (3,2)\n- Up (U): (4,3)\n- Right (R): (5,2) — but current direction is L, so R is instant reverse, invalid.\n  \nAgain, no immediate threats, but also no immediate benefit.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that Left (L) leads to eating positive food safely, and Up (U) is safe but doesn't provide immediate benefit, the optimal immediate action is to move Left.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger Again\n\nJust to be thorough, let's confirm the tail reward danger:\n- Current tail: (5,3)\n- After moving left, the tail moves to (5,1) (since the segment before tail is (6,3), and tail follows).\n- New head: (3,1)\n- Distance: (3,1) and (5,1) — x difference is 2, y is same, so not adjacent.\n- No collision possible from this.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully evaluating both possible moves, the best immediate action is to move Left to eat the positive food at (3,1) safely.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 22  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. This means the grid is 8x8 (from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n- Internal obstacle at (3, 6).\n\n**Snake Positions**: \nHead at (3, 1), followed by body segments at (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3).  \nSo, the snake's body is:  \n(3,1) <- head  \n(4,1)  \n(5,1)  \n(6,1)  \n(6,2)  \n(6,3)  \n(5,3) <- tail\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Left (L). This means the last move was to the left, so the head moved from (4,1) to (3,1).\n\n**Food**:\n1. (6,1) with value 7, life span 1\n2. (5,4) with value 10, life span 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However:\n- It cannot reverse its direction instantly. Since the current direction is Left (L), the opposite is Right (R), so R is not allowed next.\n- So, possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) from (3,1) to (2,1)\n- New head position: (2,1)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is a wall, but (2,1) is not a wall.\n  - Body: Snake body segments are at (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). (2,1) is not in this list, so no body collision.\n- Food at (2,1)? No food listed there.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) from (3,1) to (3,2)\n- New head position: (3,2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is the top wall, (3,2) is safe.\n  - Body: (3,2) is not in the body segments list.\n- Food at (3,2)? No food listed there.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) from (3,1) to (3,0)\n- New head position: (3,0)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is a wall, so (3,0) is a wall cell → collision!\n- Outcome: Deadly move, cannot choose this.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's see if any food can be eaten in the next move.\n\n**Food at (6,1)**:\n- Current head at (3,1). To reach (6,1), need to move right, but right is opposite to current left direction, so not allowed.\n- Also, (6,1) is currently occupied by the snake's body (4th segment). To eat this:\n  - The body must move away from (6,1), and then the head must move onto it.\n  - Currently, the body at (6,1) will move to (6,2) if the head moves left or up (since the tail is at (5,3), the body will shift forward).\n  - But to get the head to (6,1) in one move from (3,1) is impossible (would require moving right 3 steps in one turn).\n  - So, cannot eat (6,1) this turn.\n\n**Food at (5,4)**:\n- Current head at (3,1). Distance is +2 in x (from 3 to 5), +3 in y (from 1 to 4).\n- Cannot reach in one move.\n- So, cannot eat (5,4) this turn.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule mentions: if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\n- Tail is at (5,3).\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (5,2), (5,4), (4,3), (6,3).\n- Head is at (3,1), which is not adjacent to (5,3) (distance is 2 in x and 2 in y).\n- So, no immediate danger here.\n\n### Life Span of Food\n\nBoth foods have life span 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten. But since we can't eat either this turn, they will disappear after this turn regardless.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nFrom possible safe moves:\n- Left (L) to (2,1): safe, no food.\n- Up (U) to (3,2): safe, no food.\n- Down (D): deadly, can't choose.\n\nBetween L and U, both are safe with no immediate benefit. We should choose a move that keeps options open for future moves.\n\n- Moving Left (L) to (2,1):\n  - Next turn, cannot move right (reverse), can move U, D, L.\n  - From (2,1), moving left would go to (1,1), which is towards the wall but still safe.\n  \n- Moving Up (U) to (3,2):\n  - Next turn, cannot move down (reverse), can move U, L, R.\n  - From (3,2), moving up to (3,3) is safe, moving right to (4,2) is safe (but (4,1) is body, so need to check), left to (2,2) is safe.\n\nBoth seem okay. Maybe moving up is slightly better because it moves the snake towards the center where there might be more options in the future.\n\n### Verifying Body Movement After Move\n\nLet's see where the body moves if we choose Up (U):\n\nCurrent body:\n(3,1) <- new head if move U\n(4,1)\n(5,1)\n(6,1)\n(6,2)\n(6,3)\n(5,3) <- tail\n\nAfter move U:\nHead moves to (3,2).\nBody segments shift:\n- (3,1) becomes new body segment 1 (from head)\n- (4,1) becomes body segment 2\n- (5,1) becomes body segment 3\n- (6,1) becomes body segment 4\n- (6,2) becomes body segment 5\n- (6,3) becomes body segment 6\n- Tail (5,3) is removed (since length stays the same, no food eaten).\n\nNew body: [(3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]\n\nThis seems safe, no overlaps.\n\nSimilarly, if we move Left (L):\n\nHead to (2,1).\nBody shifts:\n- (3,1) becomes body segment 1\n- (4,1) becomes body segment 2\n- (5,1) becomes body segment 3\n- (6,1) becomes body segment 4\n- (6,2) becomes body segment 5\n- (6,3) becomes body segment 6\n- Tail (5,3) is removed.\n\nNew body: [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]\n\nAlso safe.\n\n### Decision\n\nBoth moves are safe, but moving Up might position the snake better for future moves by moving towards the center. Moving Left keeps it near the left wall, which might limit options.\n\nHowever, looking at the internal obstacle at (3,6), it's not immediately affecting us, but moving Up starts moving towards that area, which might be useful later.\n\nGiven that both moves are equally safe and neither can eat food this turn, I'll choose to move Up to potentially have more options next turn.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game to understand the positions and constraints:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   \n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls. This means the snake cannot move outside the grid.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (3, 6). So, the snake cannot move to this cell.\n\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented by the following coordinates in order from head to tail:\n     - Head: (3, 2)\n     - Body: (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)\n   - **Length**: The snake has 7 segments.\n   - **Current Direction**: The head is currently moving \"U\" (Up), meaning the last move was upwards (increasing y-coordinate).\n\n4. **Food**:\n   - **First Food**: At (6, 1) with value = 6 and life_span = 1.\n     - Value is positive (+6), so it's beneficial.\n     - Life_span is 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n   - **Second Food**: At (5, 4) with value = 9 and life_span = 1.\n     - Positive value (+9), beneficial.\n     - Life_span is 1, will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position\n\nThe snake's head is at (3, 2), moving \"U\". The possible moves are Up, Left, or Right (cannot move Down because that would be an instant reverse from Up).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: Move to (3, 3)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (3, 3) is not a wall (x=3 is not border, y=3 is not border, and it's not (3,6)).\n     - Body: Check if (3, 3) is in the snake's body segments.\n       - Current body: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n       - (3,3) is not in the body.\n   - Safe to move Up.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: Move to (2, 2)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (2, 2) is not a wall.\n     - Body: (2,2) is not in the body segments.\n   - Safe to move Left.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: Move to (4, 2)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (4, 2) is not a wall.\n     - Body: (4,2) is not in the body segments.\n   - Safe to move Right.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's see which moves can potentially lead to eating food:\n\n1. **Food at (6, 1)**:\n   - Current position: (3,2)\n   - To reach (6,1) in one move: Not possible, as it's 3 units right and 1 unit down from (3,2).\n   - This food is under the snake's body at (6,1), which is part of the body.\n   - To eat this:\n     - The body must move away from (6,1), and then the head must move onto it.\n     - Currently, the tail is at (6,3), and the body segment before tail is (6,2), then (6,1).\n     - If the snake moves such that the tail moves away from (6,1), the head would need to reach (6,1) in subsequent moves.\n     - Given the life_span is 1, this food will disappear after this turn, so we cannot eat it this turn or in the future.\n   - **Conclusion**: Cannot eat (6,1) food.\n\n2. **Food at (5, 4)**:\n   - Current position: (3,2)\n   - To reach (5,4) in one move: Not possible directly.\n   - Need to plan a path to reach it in future turns, but life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn.\n   - **Conclusion**: Cannot eat (5,4) food.\n\nSince both foods will disappear after this turn and cannot be eaten immediately, the priority is to avoid collisions and position the snake for future food collection.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in the next move?\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Check if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food.\n  - Tail is at (6,3).\n  - Adjacent cells to head (3,2):\n    - Up: (3,3)\n    - Down: (3,1) - part of body\n    - Left: (2,2)\n    - Right: (4,2)\n  - (6,3) is not adjacent to (3,2), so no danger from tail food.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nSince no food can be eaten this turn, the goal is to move safely without trapping ourselves. Let's evaluate each possible move's safety and future options:\n\n1. **Up (U) to (3,3)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (3,3):\n     - Current direction: U, so cannot move D next.\n     - Possible: U, L, R.\n   - Future options seem open.\n\n2. **Left (L) to (2,2)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (2,2):\n     - Current direction: L, cannot move R next.\n     - Possible: U, D, L.\n   - Moving left takes us towards the left wall (x=0), which may limit future moves.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (4,2)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (4,2):\n     - Current direction: R, cannot move L next.\n     - Possible: U, D, R.\n   - Moving right takes us towards the right wall (x=7), but there's more space currently.\n\nBetween these, moving Up seems the most open, as it moves the snake towards the center of the grid, providing more flexibility for future moves. Moving left or right may corner the snake over time.\n\n### Verifying Up Move\n\nLet's simulate moving Up to (3,3):\n\n- New head: (3,3)\n- Body segments shift: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n- Tail moves away from (6,3) to (6,2).\n\nThis seems safe and doesn't lead to any immediate dead ends.\n\n### Alternative Considerations\n\nIs there any reason not to move Up?\n\n- The food at (6,1) is under the body at (6,1), but since the tail is moving from (6,3) to (6,2), the (6,1) segment will remain unless the body moves in a way that shifts it, but since we're moving Up, (6,1) will still be occupied by the body next turn.\n- However, since the food at (6,1) disappears after this turn, it's irrelevant.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven all considerations, moving **Up** is the safest and most flexible move at this turn.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

This means the snake cannot move outside the grid bounded by x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (3, 6). This is a single cell that the snake cannot pass through.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body segments are at [(3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2)].\n     - Head is at (3, 3).\n     - The next segment is at (3, 2), then (3, 1), and so on until the tail at (6, 2).\n   - **Direction**: The snake's head is currently moving \"U\" (Up, which is increasing y-coordinate).\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are two food items:\n     - First food: at (6, 1) with a life span of 5 and value of 1 (positive food).\n     - Second food: at (5, 4) with a life span of 8 and value of 1 (positive food).\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me try to visualize the snake and food positions on the grid for clarity.\n\n- Snake:\n  - Head: (3, 3)\n  - Body: (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2)\n  \n- Food:\n  - (6, 1): This is interesting because the snake's body is already at (6, 1). According to the rules, food under the body can only be eaten if:\n    1. The body moves away from (6, 1), and\n    2. The head moves onto (6, 1).\n    Currently, (6, 1) is occupied by the snake's body, so we cannot eat it unless the body moves away first.\n  - (5, 4): This is at y=4, which is above the head's current y=3.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake's current direction is \"U\" (Up). The possible moves are U, D, L, R, but with constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is U, we cannot move D (Down) in the next turn.\n   - Allowed moves: U, L, R\n   - Disallowed move: D\n\n2. **Wall and Body Collisions**:\n   - **U (Up)**: Move to (3, 4)\n     - Check for walls: (3,4) is not a wall (no border walls here, and (3,6) is the internal wall which is not (3,4)).\n     - Check for body collision: The body segments are at (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), etc. (3,4) is not in the body, so safe.\n   - **L (Left)**: Move to (2, 3)\n     - Check walls: x=0 is a wall, but (2,3) is not a wall.\n     - Check body: (2,3) is not in the body.\n   - **R (Right)**: Move to (4, 3)\n     - Check walls: x=7 is a wall, but (4,3) is not.\n     - Check body: (4,3) is not in the body (body is at (4,1), etc.).\n\nAll three possible moves (U, L, R) are safe in terms of not hitting walls or body.\n\n### Evaluating Food Accessibility\n\nNow, let's see which move can help us reach the food.\n\n1. **Food at (6, 1)**:\n   - Currently under the body at (6,1). To eat this:\n     - The body must move away from (6,1), which would happen if the snake moves in a way that the tail moves forward.\n     - Then, the head must move onto (6,1).\n   - Currently, the tail is at (6,2). If the snake moves in a way that the tail moves, (6,1) would be freed, but the head is at (3,3), which is far from (6,1). It would take several moves to reach (6,1), and the food's life span is 5. It's unlikely we can reach it in time unless we plan a path, but as a non-thinking executor, we're only deciding the immediate next move.\n   - Given that, this food is not immediately accessible in the next move.\n\n2. **Food at (5, 4)**:\n   - Current head at (3,3). To reach (5,4):\n     - Need to move right (increase x) and up (increase y).\n   - Possible paths:\n     - One way: U to (3,4), then R to (4,4), then R to (5,4).\n     - Another: R to (4,3), then U to (4,4), then R to (5,4).\n     - Or R to (4,3), R to (5,3), U to (5,4).\n   - The fastest is probably moving U first to get closer in y-coordinate.\n   - Moving U now to (3,4) is safe, as checked earlier.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n- Currently, the tail is at (6,2). Adjacent cells to the tail are:\n  - (5,2), (7,2) (but x=7 is a wall), (6,1), (6,3).\n- The head is at (3,3), which is not adjacent to (6,2). So no danger here.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven the above, the immediate options are U, L, R.\n\n- **U (Up)**: Moves to (3,4), closer to food at (5,4).\n- **L (Left)**: Moves to (2,3), away from both foods.\n- **R (Right)**: Moves to (4,3), also moves towards (5,4) but not as directly as U.\n\nMoving U seems the most promising to reach the food at (5,4) quickly.\n\n### Verifying Safety After Move U\n\nAfter moving U to (3,4), the snake's new positions would be:\n- Head: (3,4)\n- Body: [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)]\n- Tail was at (6,2), which would move forward, so the segment at (6,1) would be the new tail, and (6,2) is no longer part of the snake.\n\nThis seems safe:\n- No body collision at (3,4).\n- No wall at (3,4).\n- Not moving opposite to current direction (current is U, next move can't be D, but U is fine).\n\n### Considering Other Moves\n\nJust to be thorough:\n\n- **R (Right) to (4,3)**:\n  - Next possible moves from there would be U, D, R (can't go L opposite to R).\n  - From (4,3), to reach (5,4), could go U to (4,4), then R to (5,4).\n  - This is also a valid path but takes one more move compared to starting with U.\n\n- **L (Left) to (2,3)**:\n  - Moves away from both foods, not optimal.\n\nThus, U seems the best immediate move.\n\n### Final Check on Food at (6,1)\n\nJust to confirm, the food at (6,1) is under the body at (6,1). To eat it:\n- The body must move away, meaning the tail must move from (6,2) to free (6,1).\n- Then the head must reach (6,1).\nCurrently, the head is at (3,3), and the tail is at (6,2). Even if we move in a way that the tail moves next turn, the head is too far to reach (6,1) before the food disappears (life span is 5, and it's turn 24 now). So, not a viable target currently.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves and considering the rules, the best immediate action is to move Up (U) to position (3,4), which is safe and moves the snake closer to the accessible positive food at (5,4).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

The borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, meaning the snake cannot move onto these cells. There's also an internal obstacle at (3, 6).\n\n**Snake Positions**: The snake's body is represented by the following coordinates in order from head to tail:\n- Head: (4, 4)\n- Body: (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: The snake is currently moving to the Right (R).\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (6, 1): Value = 3, Life Span = 1\n2. (5, 4): Value = 6, Life Span = 1\n3. (1, 3): Value = 9, Life Span = 1\n\n### Visual Representation\n\nLet's sketch a simple grid to visualize the snake and food positions. For clarity, I'll represent the snake's body with 'S', the head with 'H', food with 'F', and walls/obstacles with 'W'.\n\n```\ny=7: W W W W W W W W\ny=6: W . . W . . . W\ny=5: W . . . . . . W\ny=4: W . . S H F . W\ny=3: W . F S . . . W\ny=2: W . . S . . . W\ny=1: W . S S S F F W\ny=0: W W W W W W W W\n     x=0............x=7\n```\n\n(Note: This is a rough sketch. 'H' is at (4,4), 'S' represents body segments, 'F' are food items at (6,1), (5,4), (1,3). The internal wall is at (3,6).)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Right (R), the snake cannot instantly reverse to Left (L) on the next move. So, possible moves are U, D, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Right (R)**: Move to (5,4)\n   - Check if (5,4) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: Yes (x=5, y=4 is not a border wall, and not the internal obstacle (3,6)).\n     - Not colliding with body: The body segments are at (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). (5,4) is not in this list.\n     - Food at (5,4): Yes, with value=6, life_span=1.\n       - Eating this food would increase length by 1 and score by 6.\n       - Check Tail Reward Danger: The tail is at (5,1). Is (5,1) adjacent to (5,4)? Adjacent means same x and y differs by 1 or same y and x differs by 1. Here, x=5 for both, y=1 vs y=4, difference is 3, not adjacent. So no danger.\n   - So moving Right is safe and allows eating high-value food.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: Move to (4,5)\n   - Check if (4,5) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: Yes.\n     - Not colliding with body: (4,5) is not in the body list.\n     - Food at (4,5)? No food listed there.\n   - This move is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: Move to (4,3)\n   - Check if (4,3) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: Yes.\n     - Not colliding with body: Body is at (3,4), (3,3), etc. (4,3) is not in the list.\n     - Food at (4,3)? No.\n   - Safe but no food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's consider the food items:\n\n1. (6,1): Value=3, life_span=1\n   - Current turn is 26, so it will disappear at turn 27 (next turn).\n   - To reach (6,1) from (4,4):\n     - Path: Right to (5,4), then Down to (5,3), then Down to (5,2), then Left to (4,2), then Down to (4,1) (but body is at (4,1)), so cannot go there directly.\n     - Seems difficult to reach in one move; not immediately accessible.\n\n2. (5,4): Value=6, life_span=1\n   - Disappears at turn 27.\n   - Directly reachable by moving Right to (5,4) this turn.\n   - High value (6), safe to eat.\n\n3. (1,3): Value=9, life_span=1\n   - Disappears at turn 27.\n   - To reach from (4,4):\n     - Need multiple moves: Left to (3,4), Left to (2,4), Left to (1,4), Down to (1,3).\n     - Not reachable in one move.\n\n### Decision Making\n\nGiven the options:\n- Right (R): Move to (5,4), eat food with value=6, safe.\n- Up (U): Safe, no food.\n- Down (D): Safe, no food.\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Right to eat the high-value food at (5,4), as it's the most rewarding and safe option available this turn.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nJust to be thorough, let's ensure there's no Tail Reward Danger when eating the food at (5,4):\n- After eating, the snake grows by 1, so the new tail will be the old tail (5,1).\n- The new head is at (5,4), tail at (5,1).\n- Adjacent means same x and |y_diff| = 1 or same y and |x_diff| = 1.\n- Here, x=5 for both, y_diff = 4 - 1 = 3, not adjacent. So no danger.\n\n### Checking Other Constraints\n\n- No instant reverse: Current direction is R, so cannot go L. Allowed moves are U, D, R.\n- Wall collision: None for (5,4).\n- Body collision: (5,4) not in body segments.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe optimal immediate action is to move Right (R) to eat the high-value food at (5,4).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Maybe the head is at (5,4), next segment is (4,4), etc., meaning the head moved from (4,4) to (5,4) (right), so the direction is indeed Right.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,4), moving Right (R) is the current direction. The possible moves are U, D, L, R, but:\n\n- **No instant reverse**: Cannot move Left (opposite of Right).\n- So possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's check each:\n\n1. **Right (R)**: (6,4)\n   - Check walls: x=7 is a wall, but x=6 is not.\n   - Check body: Is (6,4) in the body? Current body segments: (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). No, (6,4) is not in the body.\n   - Safe to move.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: (5,5)\n   - Check walls: y=7 is wall, y=5 is not.\n   - Check body: Is (5,5) in the body? No.\n   - Safe to move.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: (5,3)\n   - Check walls: y=0 is wall, y=3 is not.\n   - Check body: Is (5,3) in the body? No.\n   - Safe to move.\n\nAll three moves are safe in terms of not hitting walls or body immediately.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's see where the food is and if we can reach it:\n\n1. **Food at (6,1)**:\n   - Value: 2 (positive), life_span: 1 (will disappear next turn).\n   - Current head at (5,4). Distance: |6-5| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4. Cannot reach in one move.\n   - Not immediately reachable.\n\n2. **Food at (1,3)**:\n   - Value: 8 (positive), life_span: 1 (will disappear next turn).\n   - Current head at (5,4). Distance: |1-5| + |3-4| = 4 + 1 = 5. Cannot reach in one move.\n   - Not immediately reachable.\n\nNeither food is reachable in the next move, so the immediate goal is to position the snake to possibly reach food in future moves while avoiding risks.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if the tail has positive food that could be dangerous:\n\n- Tail is at (5,1). Is there food at (5,1)? No, food is at (6,1) and (1,3).\n- So no immediate danger from tail reward.\n\n### Planning Next Moves\n\nSince no food is reachable now, we should choose a move that keeps options open for future moves, preferably towards the higher-value food (8 at (1,3)) if possible.\n\nCurrent head at (5,4):\n\n- To reach (1,3), need to move left and down.\n- Current direction is Right, so cannot move Left next. So immediate left is not possible.\n- Possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nWhich move gets us closer to (1,3)?\n\n- Right (R) to (6,4): increases x, away from (1,3).\n- Up (U) to (5,5): increases y, away from (1,3).\n- Down (D) to (5,3): decreases y, towards (1,3) in y-coordinate.\n\nDown seems best to approach (1,3).\n\n### Checking Safety of Down (D) to (5,3)\n\n- Next head position: (5,3).\n- Body will move: tail (5,1) is removed, new body is [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), ..., (4,1)].\n- Check if any food is at (5,3): no.\n- No immediate collision risks.\n\n### Alternative Consideration: Right (R) to (6,4)\n\nIf we go Right to (6,4):\n\n- Next head: (6,4).\n- Body: [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), ..., (4,1)].\n- Then next turn, can move towards (1,3) by going Left or Down.\n- But (1,3) is at x=1, y=3; from (6,4), need to go left and down.\n- Next turn could go Left to (5,4), but that's the current head position — no, wait, body would be [(5,4), (6,4), ...], so (5,4) is now body, cannot go there.\n- So from (6,4), possible moves would be U, D, R (cannot go L into (5,4)).\n   - U to (6,5): not helpful.\n   - D to (6,3): closer in y.\n   - R to (7,4): x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n   So only D is useful, to (6,3).\n   Then from (6,3), can go L to (5,3), etc.\n\nThis path seems longer to reach (1,3).\n\n### Comparing Down (D) vs Right (R)\n\n- Down (D) to (5,3):\n  - Next turn, can go Left to (4,3), then down to (4,2), left to (3,2), etc., towards (1,3).\n- Right (R) to (6,4):\n  - As above, longer path to (1,3).\n\nDown seems more direct towards the higher-value food.\n\n### Checking Up (U) to (5,5)\n\nGoing Up to (5,5):\n\n- Moves away from both foods.\n- Not beneficial unless there's food above, but none is listed.\n- Not optimal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBest immediate move is **Down (D)** to (5,3), as it moves the snake closer to the higher-value food at (1,3) without immediate risks.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 28  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 6)\n\n**Snake Positions**: \nHead at (5, 3), followed by:\n- (5, 4)\n- (4, 4)\n- (3, 4)\n- (3, 3)\n- (3, 2)\n- (3, 1)\n- (4, 1)\n\nSo, the snake's body segments are all these positions except the head.\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Down (D). This means the last move was from (5, 4) to (5, 3).\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (6, 1): value = 1, life_span = 1\n2. (1, 3): value = 7, life_span = 1\n3. (4, 6): value = 10, life_span = 1\n\nAll food items have a life_span of 1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5, 3), moving Down (D), the possible next moves are:\n- Up (U): (5, 4)\n- Down (D): (5, 2)\n- Left (L): (4, 3)\n- Right (R): (6, 3)\n\nBut we cannot reverse the direction immediately, so moving Up (opposite of current Down) is not allowed. So, possible moves: D, L, R.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D): (5, 2)\n- Check for walls: y=2 is not a wall, x=5 is not a wall.\n- Check for body collision: \n  - Snake body segments are at (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1).\n  - (5,2) is not in the body, so safe.\n- Check for food: No food at (5,2).\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L): (4, 3)\n- Check for walls: x=4, y=3 - no walls.\n- Check for body collision:\n  - (4,3) is not in the body segments.\n- Check for food: No food at (4,3).\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R): (6, 3)\n- Check for walls: x=6 is not a wall (border is x=7), y=3 is not a wall.\n- Check for body collision:\n  - (6,3) is not in the body.\n- Check for food: No food at (6,3), but there is food at (6,1).\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten this move, but moving right could be a step towards (6,1).\n\n### Checking Food Accessibility\n\nNow, let's see if any food can be eaten this turn by moving to its position.\n\nFood items:\n1. (6,1): To eat this, we'd need to move to (6,1) this turn.\n   - Current head is at (5,3). To reach (6,1) in one move, we'd need to move diagonally, which isn't allowed (only U/D/L/R).\n   - So, cannot eat (6,1) this turn.\n2. (1,3): At (1,3).\n   - From (5,3), to reach (1,3) in one move is impossible (would need to move left 4 steps).\n   - Cannot eat this turn.\n3. (4,6): At (4,6).\n   - From (5,3), to reach (4,6) in one move is impossible (would need to move left and up).\n   - Cannot eat this turn.\n\nSo, none of the food can be eaten this turn directly.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nSince we can't eat any food this turn, we should choose a move that:\n- Is safe (no collision with walls or body).\n- Potentially positions us to eat food next turn.\n\nLooking at the food:\n- (6,1): To reach next turn, we'd need to be at (6,2) or (5,1) or (7,1) this turn.\n  - From (5,3), moving right to (6,3) doesn't help directly.\n  - Moving down to (5,2), then next turn could move right to (6,2), then down to (6,1).\n- (1,3): Far away, not immediately reachable.\n- (4,6): To reach next turn, we'd need to be at (4,5) or (3,6) or (5,6) this turn.\n  - (3,6) is an internal obstacle, so can't go there.\n  - From (5,3), moving left to (4,3), then up to (4,4), then up to (4,5), then up to (4,6) - but food will be gone by then (life_span=1).\n\nGiven that all food has life_span=1, they'll disappear after this turn. So, none of the food will be available next turn. Therefore, positioning for future food isn't a concern here.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nIs there any positive food under the tail that could be dangerous if eaten?\n- Tail is at (4,1).\n- Is there positive food at (4,1)? Checking food positions:\n  - (6,1), (1,3), (4,6) - none at (4,1).\n- So, no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Deciding the Move\n\nSince:\n- No food can be eaten this turn.\n- All food will disappear after this turn.\n- We just need to choose a safe move that doesn't lead to a dead end.\n\nPossible safe moves: Down (D), Left (L), Right (R).\n\nLet's see where each leads:\n\n1. Down to (5,2):\n   - Next possible moves from (5,2):\n     - Can't go up (reverse), so D, L, R.\n     - D: (5,1) - is (5,1) safe?\n       - Walls: no.\n       - Body: (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1) - (5,1) is safe.\n     - L: (4,2) - is it safe?\n       - Not in body, no wall - safe.\n     - R: (6,2) - safe.\n   - Seems like a safe path.\n\n2. Left to (4,3):\n   - Next possible moves from (4,3):\n     - Current direction was L, so can't go R.\n     - U: (4,4) - is it safe?\n       - Body has (5,4), (4,4), ... - (4,4) is in body! So, collision.\n     - D: (4,2) - safe.\n     - L: (3,3) - is it safe?\n       - Body has (3,4), (3,3), ... - (3,3) is in body! Collision.\n   - So, from (4,3), only safe next move is D to (4,2).\n   - But then, from (4,2), options are limited - might lead to dead end soon.\n\n3. Right to (6,3):\n   - Next possible moves from (6,3):\n     - Current direction R, so can't go L.\n     - U: (6,4) - safe.\n     - D: (6,2) - safe.\n     - R: (7,3) - x=7 is wall, so can't.\n   - So, from (6,3), can go U or D.\n   - Seems like a safe path.\n\nBetween D, L, R:\n- L seems to limit future moves more.\n- D and R both seem safe with more options next turn.\n\nBetween D and R:\n- D to (5,2): next can go D, L, R.\n- R to (6,3): next can go U, D.\n- Maybe D is slightly better as it offers more options next turn.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all options, moving **Down (D)** seems the safest with the most flexibility for future moves, especially since we can't eat any food this turn and all food will disappear after this turn.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake at turn \\( t_0 = 29 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move outside these bounds.\n   - There's one internal obstacle at (3, 6).\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake's body segments (from head to tail):\n     - Head: (5, 2)\n     - Next segments: (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1)\n   - Current direction: Down (D). This means the snake was moving downward in the previous move (from (5,1) to (5,2), assuming).\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - Food at (1, 3): value = 7, life_span = 1\n     - This means it's positive food (+1 score, snake length +1), and it will disappear after this turn (since life_span decreases to 0 next turn).\n   - Food at (4, 6): value = 9, life_span = 1\n     - Similarly, positive food, disappears after this turn.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5, 2), moving Down (D) would go to (5, 1), but y=0 is a wall, so y=1 is valid. However, the current direction is D, so let's see possible moves considering the \"no instant reverse\" rule.\n\n- Current direction: D (Down)\n- Opposite direction: U (Up)\n- So, cannot move Up next (instant reverse is forbidden).\n- Allowed moves: D, L, R\n\nNow, let's check each possible move:\n\n1. **Move Down (D)**: (5, 2) → (5, 1)\n   - Check if (5,1) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: y=1 is not y=0.\n     - Not part of the snake body: Looking at snake positions, (5,1) is not listed (the tail is at (3,1)).\n     - So, (5,1) is safe.\n   - Is there food at (5,1)? No, food is at (1,3) and (4,6).\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n2. **Move Left (L)**: (5, 2) → (4, 2)\n   - Check (4,2):\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not in snake body: Snake has (4,4), (3,4), etc., but not (4,2).\n     - Safe.\n   - Food at (4,2)? No.\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food.\n\n3. **Move Right (R)**: (5, 2) → (6, 2)\n   - Check (6,2):\n     - Not a wall (x=7 is wall, x=6 is fine).\n     - Not in snake body.\n     - Safe.\n   - Food at (6,2)? No.\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's see if we can reach any food this turn.\n\n- Food at (1,3): Distance from (5,2) is |5-1| + |2-3| = 4 + 1 = 5. Can't reach in one move.\n- Food at (4,6): Distance is |5-4| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5. Also can't reach in one move.\n\nSo, no food can be eaten this turn directly. However, we should consider if moving in a certain direction sets us up better for future food collection.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nLooking at the food positions:\n- (1,3) and (4,6) both disappear after this turn, so next turn they'll be gone. So, no future benefit from them.\n- We might get new food next turn, but we don't have that info.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in any move?\n\n- Moving Down (D) to (5,1):\n  - Next possible moves from (5,1): Can't go Up (reverse), so D, L, R.\n    - D: (5,0) - wall, invalid.\n    - L: (4,1) - check if safe.\n    - R: (6,1) - check if safe.\n  - Not immediately dangerous.\n\n- Moving Left (L) to (4,2):\n  - From (4,2), can't go R (reverse), so U, D, L.\n    - U: (4,3) - check body: (5,3) is body, but not (4,3), safe.\n    - D: (4,1) - safe.\n    - L: (3,2) - body has (3,2) as the 7th segment. But the tail is at (3,1), and tail moves when head moves, so (3,2) will be vacated. So, moving to (3,2) is safe because the tail will move away.\n      - Wait, let's think: current tail is at (3,1). If head moves to (3,2), then the new tail will be the previous second-to-last segment, which is (3,2). So head at (3,2) and new tail at (3,2) - collision! So moving L to (4,2) and then L to (3,2) is dangerous.\n  - So, moving L now may limit future moves.\n\n- Moving Right (R) to (6,2):\n  - From (6,2), can't go L (reverse), so U, D, R.\n    - U: (6,3) - safe.\n    - D: (6,1) - safe.\n    - R: (7,2) - x=7 is wall, invalid.\n  - Seems safe.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail where the tail has positive food?\n- Tail is at (3,1).\n- Adjacent cells to head (5,2):\n  - (4,2), (6,2), (5,1), (5,3).\n  - Tail is at (3,1), not adjacent to head (distance is |5-3| + |2-1| = 3).\n- So, no tail reward danger.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that:\n- No food is reachable this turn.\n- Moving Down is safe but doesn't open up new options.\n- Moving Left could lead to a future collision if we go left again.\n- Moving Right is safe and opens up more space.\n\n**Best immediate action is to move Right (R).**\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state of the game and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn 30. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n   - Internal obstacle: (3, 6) is also a wall.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (6, 2), followed by body segments: (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2).\n   - Current direction: Right (R).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (1, 3): value = 1, life_span = 6.\n   - (4, 6): value = 1, life_span = 8.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me try to visualize the snake's position to better understand possible moves.\n\n- Head: (6, 2)\n- Next segments:\n  - (5, 2) - directly left of head (since head is moving right, this is the neck)\n  - (5, 3)\n  - (5, 4)\n  - (4, 4)\n  - (3, 4)\n  - (3, 3)\n  - (3, 2) - tail\n\nThe snake is moving right, so its head is at (6, 2), and the next segment is at (5, 2).\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Direction (R)\n\nFrom the current direction (Right), the possible next moves are:\n\n- **Right (R)**: Continue right to (7, 2).\n  - Check if (7, 2) is a wall: x=7 is a border wall, so this would be a wall collision → deadly.\n- **Up (U)**: Move up to (6, 3).\n  - Check if (6, 3) is occupied by the snake's body or is a wall.\n    - Snake body positions: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2).\n    - (6,3) is not in the body list.\n    - Walls: (3,6) is the only internal wall, not (6,3).\n    - So, (6,3) is free.\n- **Down (D)**: Move down to (6, 1).\n  - Check (6,1):\n    - Not in body segments.\n    - Not a wall (y=0 is a wall at y=0, but y=1 is not).\n    - So, (6,1) is free.\n  \nCannot move Left (L) because that would be opposite to the current direction (R), which is not allowed (\"No instant reverse\").\n\nSo, possible safe moves: Up (U) or Down (D).\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving Up or Down can lead us to food.\n\n**Food Positions**:\n1. (1, 3): value = +1, life_span = 6.\n   - Distance from head (6,2): |6-1| + |2-3| = 5 + 1 = 6.\n   - Not immediately reachable in one move.\n2. (4, 6): value = +1, life_span = 8.\n   - Distance from head (6,2): |6-4| + |2-6| = 2 + 4 = 6.\n   - Also not immediately reachable in one move.\n\nNeither food is adjacent to the head, so we can't eat food this turn regardless of the move.\n\n### Avoiding Future Collisions\n\nSince we can't eat food this turn, our primary goal is to avoid collisions and position ourselves for future food collection.\n\nLet's consider the two possible moves:\n\n1. **Up (U) to (6,3)**:\n   - Next head position: (6,3).\n   - New body segments: head at (6,3), then (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), etc.\n   - Check if moving here could lead to future issues:\n     - The tail is at (3,2), which is far away.\n     - No immediate collision risk.\n     - Future moves from (6,3): can go U, R, or L (not D, opposite of U).\n   \n2. **Down (D) to (6,1)**:\n   - Next head position: (6,1).\n   - New body segments: head at (6,1), then (6,2), (5,2), etc.\n   - Check:\n     - Tail is at (3,2), no immediate collision.\n     - Future moves from (6,1): can go D, R, or L (not U, opposite of D).\n\nBoth moves seem safe. Now, let's think about which move might be better for future food collection.\n\n### Future Food Collection Strategy\n\nLooking at the two food items:\n\n1. (1,3): To reach this, moving Up might be better because it's at y=3, and we're at y=2. Moving Up gets us closer in the y-direction.\n2. (4,6): This is at y=6, so moving Up also gets us closer in the y-direction compared to Down.\n\nHowever, (4,6) is at x=4, and we're at x=6, so we'd need to move left eventually. Moving Up now doesn't hinder that.\n\nMoving Down to (6,1) takes us further from both foods in the y-direction.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nOur tail is at (3,2). Adjacent cells to tail:\n- (3,3) - already part of the body.\n- (3,1) - below.\n- (2,2) - left.\n- (4,2) - right.\n\nOur head is at (6,2), not adjacent to tail (distance is 3 in x). So no risk here.\n\n### Life Span of Food\n\n- (1,3): life_span = 6. Current turn is 30, so it will disappear at turn 36.\n- (4,6): life_span = 8, disappears at turn 38.\n\nBoth have enough life left to consider pursuing.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween Up and Down, Up seems better because:\n\n- Moves us closer to both foods in the y-direction.\n- Doesn't lead us towards any immediate danger.\n- Keeps more options open for future moves.\n\nMoving Right is deadly (wall), and Left is not allowed (opposite of current direction).\n\n### Verifying Up Move\n\nLet me double-check moving Up to (6,3):\n\n- New head: (6,3).\n- New body: (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3).\n- Tail is now at (3,3).\n- Next turn, from (6,3), direction is U. Possible moves:\n  - U to (6,4).\n  - R to (7,3) - wall, deadly.\n  - L to (5,3) - body segment (5,3) is the 4th segment, but since the tail moves, (5,3) will be the new 3rd segment. Wait, need to see:\n     - After moving U, body is: (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), etc.\n     - So (5,3) is the 4th segment, and the tail is at (3,3).\n     - Moving L to (5,3) would collide with the body - deadly.\n  - So next turn after U, only safe move would be U to (6,4).\n\nThis seems a bit limiting, but since we're not near any food now, it's okay. Alternatively, moving Down to (6,1):\n\n- New head: (6,1).\n- New body: (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), etc.\n- Next turn, from (6,1), direction is D. Possible moves:\n  - D to (6,0) - wall, deadly.\n  - R to (7,1) - wall, deadly.\n  - L to (5,1) - check if it's free:\n     - Body segments after move: (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), etc. (5,1) is free.\n     - So L to (5,1) is safe.\n\nThis seems slightly better because after Down, we have a safe move Left to (5,1), whereas after Up, our only safe move is further Up.\n\nBut Down takes us away from both foods. Maybe it's better to go Up now, then next turn go Up again to (6,4), which is closer to (4,6).\n\nAlternatively, maybe both moves are safe, but Up seems more aligned with moving towards food in the long run.\n\nGiven that, I think Up is the better choice here.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all options, the safest and most strategic move is to go **Up (U)**.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game based on the provided information:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. So, the snake cannot move to any cell where x is 0 or 7, or y is 0 or 7.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (3, 6).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head to the tail: [(6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4)].\n   - **Direction**: The current head direction is \"U\" (Up, which is (x, y+1)).\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are three food items:\n     - (1, 3): value = 1, life_span = 4\n     - (4, 6): value = 1, life_span = 6\n     - (4, 4): value = 1, life_span = 9\n\n### Analyzing the Snake's Current Position and Possible Moves\n\nThe snake's head is at (6, 4), and it's currently moving Up (\"U\"). \n\n**Possible Moves**:\nFrom the current direction \"U\", the possible next moves are:\n- Continue Up (\"U\"): (6, 5)\n- Turn Left (\"L\"): (5, 4)\n- Turn Right (\"R\"): (7, 4) — but x=7 is a wall, so this is invalid.\n  \nWe cannot move Down (\"D\") because that would be the opposite of the current direction \"U\", which is not allowed.\n\nSo, the valid immediate moves are:\n1. Up (\"U\"): (6, 5)\n2. Left (\"L\"): (5, 4)\n\n### Checking for Collisions and Validity of Moves\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Move Up (\"U\") to (6, 5)**:\n   - Check walls: y=5 is not a border wall (y=7 is the upper border), and there's no internal wall at (6,5).\n   - Check body collision: The snake's body segments are at (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4). (6,5) is not in this list, so no collision.\n   - **Conclusion**: Valid move.\n\n2. **Move Left (\"L\") to (5, 4)**:\n   - Check walls: x=5 is not a border wall, and (5,4) is not an internal wall.\n   - Check body collision: (5,4) is the 6th segment of the snake's body (counting from 0: head is 0, then 1, 2, etc.). \n     - Normally, moving into a body segment is deadly, but there's an exception: if it's the tail segment, and the tail will move forward in the same turn, it's safe.\n     - The tail is at (3,4). (5,4) is not the tail; it's the 6th segment. So, this would be a body collision.\n   - **Conclusion**: Invalid move (would collide with body).\n\nSo, the only valid move is Up (\"U\") to (6,5).\n\n### Checking for Food at Possible Moves\n\nNow, let's see if there's any food at (6,5):\n\nLooking at the food positions:\n1. (1, 3): Not (6,5)\n2. (4, 6): Not (6,5)\n3. (4, 4): Not (6,5)\n\nNo food at (6,5), so moving Up doesn't eat any food this turn.\n\n### Considering the Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about the tail:\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nLet's check:\n- Tail is at (3,4).\n- Adjacent cells to the tail (assuming 4-directional adjacency):\n  - Left: (2,4)\n  - Right: (4,4) — which is part of the snake's body (the 7th segment)\n  - Up: (3,5)\n  - Down: (3,3)\n  \nThe head is at (6,4), which is not adjacent to the tail (3,4). So, this rule doesn't apply here.\n\n### Evaluating Other Food Items\n\nEven though moving Up is the only valid move, let's see where the other foods are to understand if we're moving towards them:\n\n1. (1, 3): Far left, near the bottom. Currently, the snake is on the right side. Not immediately reachable.\n2. (4, 6): Near the top-left. Current move Up doesn't directly help, but future moves might.\n3. (4, 4): This is interesting because (4,4) is part of the snake's body (the 7th segment). \n\n   - The food at (4,4) is under the snake's body. To eat it:\n     - The body must move away from (4,4), and then the head must move onto it.\n     - Currently, the body segment at (4,4) is the 7th segment (second to last). Next turn, if the snake moves Up, the tail will move from (3,4) to ... depending on how the body moves.\n     - It's complex to eat this food immediately, but it's something to consider for future moves.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Consumption\n\nIs there any food adjacent to the head that we can eat next turn?\n\nCurrent head is at (6,4). Adjacent cells:\n- Up: (6,5) — no food\n- Down: (6,3) — part of the snake's body\n- Left: (5,4) — part of the snake's body\n- Right: (7,4) — wall\n\nNo adjacent food to eat immediately.\n\n### Life Span of Foods\n\nThe foods have life spans:\n1. (1,3): life_span = 4\n2. (4,6): life_span = 6\n3. (4,4): life_span = 9\n\nAt turn 32, we don't know when they spawned, but their life spans are decreasing each turn. We might want to prioritize foods with lower life spans if they're reachable soon.\n\n### Future Moves Consideration\n\nAfter moving Up to (6,5), the next possible moves would be:\n- Continue Up to (6,6) — but y=7 is a wall, so (6,6) is safe, but next move would be risky.\n- Turn Left to (5,5)\n- Turn Right to (7,5) — invalid (x=7 is wall)\n\nThis could lead towards the food at (4,6), but it's several moves away.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the current state:\n- Only valid move is Up (\"U\") to (6,5).\n- No immediate food to eat.\n- No immediate collision risks.\n- Future moves can be planned after this step to target the foods.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter carefully considering all possible moves and their implications, the only safe and valid immediate action is to move Up.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game to understand where everything is positioned and what the constraints are.\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is bounded by walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, and y=7. This means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6) because moving to x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 would be a wall collision.\n   - There's also an internal obstacle at (3,6), which is a wall cell the snake cannot move into.\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - The snake's body is composed of the following segments in order (head first):\n     - Head: (6,5)\n     - Body: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)\n   - The current direction of the head is \"U\" (Up), meaning it's moving in the positive y-direction.\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - There are three food items on the grid:\n     1. (1,3): Value = 1, Life Span = 3\n     2. (4,6): Value = 1, Life Span = 5\n     3. (4,4): Value = 1, Life Span = 8\n   - All foods are positive (value = +1), so eating any will increase the snake's length by 1 and add to the score.\n   - The food at (4,4) is currently under the snake's body (specifically, the tail segment is at (4,4)). According to the rules, to eat this food:\n     - The body must move away from (4,4), and then the head must move onto (4,4) in a subsequent turn.\n     - Currently, since the head is not adjacent to (4,4), we cannot eat this food immediately.\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position\n\nThe snake's head is at (6,5), moving Up (\"U\"). The possible moves are Up, Left, or Right (cannot move Down because that would be an instant reverse from Up, which is not allowed).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: Move to (6,6)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=7 is a wall, but y=6 is within bounds.\n     - Body: The body segments are at (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4). (6,6) is not in this list, so no body collision.\n     - Obstacles: (3,6) is an obstacle, but we're moving to (6,6), which is not (3,6).\n   - Food: There is no food at (6,6).\n   - This move is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: Move to (5,5)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=5 is within bounds (1 to 6).\n     - Body: (5,5) is not in the body segments list.\n     - Obstacles: Not (3,6).\n   - Food: No food at (5,5).\n   - This move is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: Move to (7,5)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=7 is a wall (border cell).\n     - Moving here would cause a wall collision, which is deadly.\n   - This move is not safe.\n\nSo, the safe moves are Up and Left.\n\n### Evaluating Food Accessibility\n\nNow, let's see if any food can be reached in the next move or is adjacent to the head for potential future moves.\n\n1. Food at (1,3):\n   - Distance from head (6,5): |6-1| + |5-3| = 5 + 2 = 7 cells away.\n   - Not reachable immediately or soon; life span is 3, so it will disappear in 3 turns (including current turn). Unlikely to reach it in time.\n\n2. Food at (4,6):\n   - Distance from head (6,5): |6-4| + |5-6| = 2 + 1 = 3 cells away.\n   - Life span is 5, so it will disappear in 5 turns.\n   - Possible to reach in a few moves, but not immediately adjacent.\n\n3. Food at (4,4):\n   - Currently under the tail at (4,4).\n   - To eat this, the tail must move away first, then the head can move onto (4,4).\n   - Currently, the head is at (6,5), which is |6-4| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3 cells away.\n   - Life span is 8, so it will disappear in 8 turns.\n   - Possible to reach, but requires careful maneuvering to not collide with the body.\n\n### Immediate Food Considerations\n\nNone of the foods are adjacent to the head right now, so we cannot eat any food in the immediate next move. Therefore, the immediate goal is to move towards a food item while avoiding collisions.\n\n### Choosing Between Up and Left\n\nBoth Up and Left are safe moves. Let's consider which one is better for future moves towards food.\n\n1. **Moving Up to (6,6)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (6,6) would be Left (to (5,6)) or Down (to (6,5), but that's the previous position, and moving Down from Up is instant reverse, which is not allowed), or Right (to (7,6), which is a wall).\n   - So, only Left is possible from (6,6).\n   - Moving Left from (6,6) to (5,6) is safe (no body or walls there).\n   - From (5,6), possible moves would be Left (to (4,6)) where there is food with life span 5.\n     - After moving to (5,6) at turn 34, then Left to (4,6) at turn 35 to eat the food.\n     - The food's life span is 5, so it will disappear at turn 38 (current turn is 33, so 33,34,35,36,37,38 - disappears after 38).\n     - We can reach it by turn 35, so it's possible.\n\n2. **Moving Left to (5,5)**:\n   - From (5,5), possible moves are Up (to (5,6)), Left (to (4,5)), or Down (to (5,4)).\n     - Up to (5,6): then Left to (4,6) to eat food at turn 35 (same as above path).\n     - Left to (4,5): then possible moves are Up to (4,6) to eat food at turn 35.\n     - Down to (5,4): body is at (5,4), so collision.\n   - So from (5,5), we can also plan to reach (4,6) by turn 35 via (5,6) or (4,5).\n\nBoth initial moves (Up or Left) can lead to eating the food at (4,6) by turn 35. However, moving Up first limits our next move to only Left (to (5,6)), whereas moving Left first gives us more options (Up to (5,6) or Left to (4,5)).\n\nGiven that, moving Left initially provides more flexibility in case something changes or if we need to adjust the path later.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule states that if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrently, the tail is at (4,4), and the head is at (6,5). The distance is |6-4| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3, not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1). So, no immediate danger from this rule.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween Up and Left, both can lead to eating the food at (4,6) in two moves, but Left provides more flexibility for the next move. Therefore, the better immediate action is Left.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 34 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid and Walls:**\n- The grid is bounded by walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6.\n- There's an internal obstacle at (3, 6), which means the snake cannot move into that cell.\n\n**2. Snake:**\n- Positions (head first): [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)]\n  - Head at (5,5)\n  - Next segment at (6,5), then (6,4), and so on.\n- Current direction: L (Left). This means the snake was moving left in the previous turn, so it came from (6,5) to (5,5).\n\n**3. Food:**\nThere are four food items:\n1. (1, 3): value=2, life_span=1\n2. (4, 6): value=4, life_span=1\n3. (4, 4): value=7, life_span=1\n4. (6, 5): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (5,5), the possible moves are:\n- Up (U): (5,6)\n- Down (D): (5,4)\n- Left (L): (4,5)\n- Right (R): (6,5)\n\nBut we have to consider:\n- **No instant reverse**: The current direction is L (Left), so we cannot move Right (R) next, as that would be the opposite direction.\n  \nSo, possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, let's check each:\n\n**1. Up (U): (5,6)**\n- Check walls: y=7 is the upper wall, so y=6 is within bounds.\n- Check obstacles: (3,6) is an obstacle, but we're at (5,6), so no collision.\n- Check snake body: \n  - Snake body segments: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)\n  - (5,6) is not in the body, so safe.\n- Food at (5,6)? No food listed there.\n  \n**2. Down (D): (5,4)**\n- Check walls: y=0 is the lower wall, y=4 is within bounds.\n- Check obstacles: none at (5,4).\n- Check snake body: \n  - (5,4) is the tail end of the snake (last segment).\n  - Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves forward.\n  - But we have to check if there's food at the tail that would cause a collision after growth.\n    - Food at (6,5): value=10, life=1. But (6,5) is the segment right after the head, not the tail. The tail is at (5,4).\n    - No food is listed at (5,4), so no danger from \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n- So, moving to (5,4) is safe.\n  \n**3. Left (L): (4,5)**\n- Check walls: x=0 is left wall, x=4 is within bounds.\n- Check obstacles: none at (4,5).\n- Check snake body: \n  - (4,5) is not in the body segments.\n- Food at (4,5)? No food listed there.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable or beneficial:\n\n1. (1,3): value=2, life=1\n   - Distance from (5,5): |5-1| + |5-3| = 4 + 2 = 6 steps away. Life is 1, so it will disappear next turn. Can't reach in time.\n   \n2. (4,6): value=4, life=1\n   - Distance: |5-4| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2 steps. Life is 1, so it will disappear next turn. Can't reach in time (need to be adjacent now to eat next turn).\n   \n3. (4,4): value=7, life=1\n   - Distance: |5-4| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2 steps. Life is 1, so can't reach in time.\n   \n4. (6,5): value=10, life=1\n   - Current position: head at (5,5), next segment at (6,5).\n   - Food is at (6,5), which is under the snake's body.\n   - To eat it:\n     - The body must move away from (6,5), and then the head moves onto it.\n     - Currently, the body is at (6,5), (6,4), etc.\n     - If we move Left (L) to (4,5), the body would move: head to (4,5), then (5,5), (6,5) shifts to (6,4), etc.\n     - Then next turn, to eat (6,5), we'd need to move Right to (5,5) then Right again to (6,5), but that's two turns, and food disappears next turn.\n     - So, cannot eat (6,5) in time.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nFrom possible moves U, D, L:\n- U: (5,6) - safe, no food.\n- D: (5,4) - safe, no food, but tail is there (but no food at tail).\n- L: (4,5) - safe, no food.\n\nAll moves are safe, none can reach food in time. So, we need to choose a move that keeps us safe and possibly sets up for future food.\n\nLooking at the snake's body:\n- Current body forms a sort of \"U\" shape with the head at the top left.\n- Moving Left (L) to (4,5) seems to open up space to the left.\n- Moving Down (D) to (5,4) would make the snake curl more, possibly limiting future moves.\n- Moving Up (U) to (5,6) is also safe but doesn't seem to offer immediate advantage.\n\n**Potential Issue with Down (D):**\n- Moving to (5,4) where the tail is:\n  - After move: head at (5,4), body: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), etc.\n  - Next turn, tail moves from (5,4) to (5,5), but head is at (5,4), so no immediate collision.\n  - But this might lead to a tight loop, limiting future moves.\n\n**Potential with Left (L):**\n- Moves head to (4,5), body follows:\n  - New positions: head (4,5), then (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), etc.\n  - This seems to open up more space to the left and top for future moves.\n\n**Potential with Up (U):**\n- Moves head to (5,6), body follows:\n  - New positions: head (5,6), then (5,5), (6,5), etc.\n  - This also seems safe but may not be as advantageous as Left.\n\nGiven that, **Left (L)** seems the most promising to open up space without risking immediate danger.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Danger\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving Left?\n- New head position: (4,5)\n- Not adjacent to any body segments except the one following (which is (5,5), and that's fine.\n- No walls or obstacles at (4,5).\n- No food at (4,5) that could cause issues.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, moving **Left (L)** seems the safest and most strategic move at this turn, as it opens up space without leading to immediate danger or trapping.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Left (L) to (3,5):**\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=0 is a wall, but (3,5) is x=3, which is within bounds.\n     - Internal obstacle: (3,6) is an obstacle, but we're moving to (3,5), so no collision.\n     - Body segments: The body is at (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3). (3,5) is not in this list, so no collision.\n   - Food at (3,5): No food is listed at (3,5), so no food to eat.\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n**2. Up (U) to (4,6):**\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=7 is a wall, (4,6) is y=6, which is within bounds.\n     - Internal obstacle: (3,6) is not (4,6), so no collision.\n     - Body segments: (4,6) is not in the body list, so no collision.\n   - Food at (4,6): Yes, there's food with value=3, life_span=1.\n     - Check if it's safe to eat:\n       - After eating, the snake grows by 1, so the new tail would be where the current tail is (5,3).\n       - Is the head adjacent to the tail after eating? Current head is (4,5), new position after move is (4,6). Tail is at (5,3).\n         - Distance between (4,6) and (5,3): |4-5| + |6-3| = 1 + 3 = 4, which is not adjacent (adjacent means distance of 1).\n       - So, no tail reward danger.\n   - Outcome: Can eat positive food (+3), safe move.\n\n**3. Down (D) to (4,4):**\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=0 is a wall, (4,4) is y=4, within bounds.\n     - Internal obstacle: Not at (4,4).\n     - Body segments: (4,4) is not in the body list, no collision.\n   - Food at (4,4): Yes, food with value=6, life_span=1.\n     - Check if it's safe to eat:\n       - New head position: (4,4), tail is at (5,3).\n       - Distance: |4-5| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2, which is not adjacent (needs to be 1 to be adjacent).\n       - Wait, actually, adjacent means one coordinate differs by 1 and the other is the same, or vice versa. \n         - (4,4) and (5,3): x differs by 1, y differs by 1, so diagonal, not adjacent in grid terms (assuming 4-directional movement).\n       - So, no tail reward danger.\n   - Outcome: Can eat positive food (+6), safe move.\n\n### Comparing Up and Down Moves\n\nBoth Up and Down allow eating positive food safely:\n- Up: +3\n- Down: +6\n\nDown offers a higher reward (+6 vs +3), so it's preferable if both are safe.\n\n### Checking Other Considerations\n\nIs there any reason not to go Down to (4,4)?\n- The food at (4,4) has life_span=1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now.\n- The food at (4,6) also has life_span=1, but +3 is less than +6.\n- The other foods are at (1,3) and (6,5), which are not reachable in one move.\n\nIs there any immediate danger if we go Down?\n- After moving to (4,4), the new head is at (4,4), body grows to include (4,5) at the front.\n- Next possible moves from (4,4): current direction would be D (since we moved Down).\n   - Possible next moves: Left (L), Right (R), Down (D) (no Up, as that would reverse).\n   - Need to ensure that future moves are possible without getting trapped, but for immediate action, we're safe.\n\nIs the food at (6,5) under the snake's body?\n- Current body segments: (5,5), (6,5), etc. So (6,5) is under the body.\n- To eat it, the body must move away and head must move onto it.\n   - Currently head is at (4,5), moving to (4,4) or (4,6) doesn't help reach (6,5).\n   - So, cannot eat (6,5) this turn.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween Up (+3) and Down (+6), Down offers a higher reward and is safe.

So, this food is also unreachable this turn.\n\n### 3. Possible Moves\nFrom (4, 4), the valid moves are:\n- **D**: (4, 3) → Check for collisions:\n  - (4, 3) is not a wall (border is y=0, and no internal obstacle at (4, 3)).\n  - (4, 3) is not in the snake's body [(4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3)].\n  - Safe.\n- **L**: (3, 4) → Check for collisions:\n  - (3, 4) is not a wall (border is x=0, and no internal obstacle at (3, 4)).\n  - (3, 4) is not in the snake's body.\n  - Safe.\n- **R**: (5, 4) → Check for collisions:\n  - (5, 4) is not a wall.\n  - (5, 4) is not in the snake's body.\n  - Safe.\n\n### 4. Decision\nNo food is reachable this turn, so the priority is to avoid collisions and position the snake for future opportunities. All three moves (**D**, **L**, **R**) are safe. \n\n- Moving **D** (down) to (4, 3) keeps the snake away from walls and body.\n- Moving **L** (left) to (3, 4) is also safe.\n- Moving **R** (right) to (5, 4) is safe and might position the snake closer to future food.\n\nSince no food is reachable, any safe move is acceptable. Let's choose **R** to explore the right side of the grid.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 37 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Snake Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head to the tail. Here's the snake's body:\n- Head: (5, 4)\n- Body segments: (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (5, 2)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Right (R), meaning the last move was to the right (from (4,4) to (5,4)).\n\n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 6)\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (4, 6): value = 2, life_span = 1\n2. (6, 5): value = 7, life_span = 1\n3. (1, 6): value = 10, life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,4) and moving Right (R), the possible next moves are:\n- Up (U): (5,5)\n- Down (D): (5,3)\n- Left (L): (4,4) — but this is opposite to current direction (R), so it's not allowed (no instant reverse)\n- Right (R): (6,4)\n\nSo, allowed moves: U, D, R.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move\n\n**1. Move Up (U) to (5,5)**:\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Body segments: (5,5) is the 4th segment in the snake's body (positions are 0-indexed: head is 0, so (5,5) is index 3).\n  - Moving to (5,5) would collide with the body segment there, which is deadly. So, this move is invalid.\n\n**2. Move Down (D) to (5,3)**:\n- Check for collisions:\n  - (5,3) is not in the current body segments.\n  - Walls: y=0 is at the bottom, but (5,3) is not on a wall.\n  - So, no collision.\n- Check for food:\n  - No food at (5,3).\n- This is a safe move, but doesn't gain any points.\n\n**3. Move Right (R) to (6,4)**:\n- Check for collisions:\n  - (6,4) is the 5th segment in the snake's body (index 5).\n  - Moving to (6,4) would collide with the body segment there, which is deadly. So, this move is invalid.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check the snake's body positions:\nSnake Positions: [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2)]\n(6,4) is indeed in the list (index 5), so moving right would collide with the body. So, right is invalid.\n\n### Re-evaluating Possible Moves\n\nFrom the initial evaluation, only Down (D) to (5,3) seems valid. But let's check if there's any other consideration.\n\n**Tail Movement Consideration**:\nWhen the snake moves, the tail also moves forward. The current tail is at (5,2). After moving, the tail will be at the next position in the body, which is (6,2). \n\nIs there any food under the tail that could be dangerous if eaten next turn?\nCurrent tail is at (5,2). Looking at food positions:\n- (4,6), (6,5), (1,6) — none are at (5,2), so no immediate danger from tail food.\n\n**Food Considerations**:\nAll foods have life_span = 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn unless eaten now. But none are adjacent to the head's possible moves:\n- Head is at (5,4). Possible moves:\n  - U: (5,5) — no food\n  - D: (5,3) — no food\n  - R: (6,4) — no food\nSo, no food can be eaten this turn regardless of the move.\n\n### Checking for Future Moves\n\nEven though we can't eat food this turn, we should consider setting up for future moves. \n\nAfter moving Down to (5,3), next possible moves would be from (5,3):\n- Current direction would be D (since we moved down).\n- Possible next moves:\n  - Left (L): (4,3)\n  - Right (R): (6,3)\n  - Down (D): (5,2) — but (5,2) is the current tail, which will move to (6,2), so (5,2) will be empty next turn.\n  \nLooking at food positions after this turn (since all foods have life_span=1, they'll disappear unless eaten now, which they can't be), so next turn there might be new food.\n\n### Is There Any Immediate Danger?\n\nLooking at the current snake's body, the head is at (5,4), and nearby body segments are:\n- (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2)\nAdjacent to head:\n- Left: (4,4) — body, can't move there (opposite direction also)\n- Up: (5,5) — body\n- Right: (6,4) — body\n- Down: (5,3) — empty\n\nSo, only Down is safe.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe move at this turn is Down (D) to (5,3). All other possible moves lead to immediate collision with the body or walls.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake at turn \\( t_0 = 38 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid Layout:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n- **Border walls:** x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls; can't move there.\n- **Internal obstacle:** There's one internal wall at (3, 6).\n\n**2. Snake:**\n- **Positions (head first):** [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)]\n  - Head is at (5,3).\n  - Next segment is (5,4), then (4,4), and so on until the tail at (6,2).\n- **Current direction:** Down (D). This means the last move was from (5,4) to (5,3) (since moving down decreases y by 1).\n\n**3. Food:**\n  1. (4,6): value=1, life_span=1\n  2. (6,5): value=6, life_span=1\n  3. (1,6): value=9, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves and Restrictions\n\nFrom the current head position (5,3) and direction D, the possible moves are:\n- **Up (U):** (5,3) → (5,4)\n- **Down (D):** (5,3) → (5,2)\n- **Left (L):** (5,3) → (4,3)\n- **Right (R):** (5,3) → (6,3)\n\n**No instant reverse rule:** Since the current direction is D, the opposite is U. So we cannot move Up next. That leaves D, L, R.\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\n**1. Move Down (D): (5,3) → (5,2)**\n- Check for walls: y=2 is not a wall (y=0 is).\n- Check for body collision:\n  - Snake body segments: (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)\n  - (5,2) is not in the body segments → safe.\n- Check for food:\n  - No food at (5,2).\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n**2. Move Left (L): (5,3) → (4,3)**\n- Check for walls: x=4 is not a wall.\n- Check for body collision:\n  - (4,3) is not in the body segments → safe.\n- Check for food:\n  - No food at (4,3).\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n**3. Move Right (R): (5,3) → (6,3)**\n- Check for walls: x=6 is not a wall (x=7 is).\n- Check for body collision:\n  - Snake body includes (6,3) (7th segment from head).\n  - Moving to (6,3) would make the head touch the body at (6,3) → collision.\n  - Wait, but the tail is at (6,2). The segment at (6,3) is not the tail; it's followed by (6,2).\n  - Rule: Can move into tail's current position because tail moves away, but other body segments are deadly.\n  - Here, (6,3) is not the tail → collision.\n- Outcome: Deadly collision → cannot move Right.\n\nSo, Right is out. Now between Down and Left.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nLet's see if either Down or Left can lead to eating food in future moves or if there's immediate food to consider.\n\n**Food Positions:**\n1. (4,6): value=1, life=1\n   - Distance from head (5,3): |5-4| + |3-6| = 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Life span is 1, so it disappears after this turn. Can't reach it in one move.\n2. (6,5): value=6, life=1\n   - Distance: |5-6| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n   - Life span 1 → disappears after this turn. Can't reach.\n3. (1,6): value=9, life=1\n   - Distance: |5-1| + |3-6| = 4 + 3 = 7\n   - Life span 1 → can't reach.\n\nSo, none of the foods can be eaten this turn because their life spans are 1 and will disappear after this turn, and none are adjacent to the head.\n\n### Checking for Food Under Snake's Body\n\nThe rules mention that food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:\n1. The body moves away, and\n2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nLooking at food positions:\n- (6,5): value=6, is at (6,5), which is the 6th segment of the snake (counting head as 1st).\n  - Current snake: [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), ...]\n  - So (6,5) is under the snake's body.\n  - To eat it, the body must move away, and head must move onto (6,5).\n  - Currently, head is at (5,3), so to reach (6,5) in one move is impossible (must move right then up twice).\n  - Also, life span is 1, so it disappears after this turn → can't eat it.\n\nOther foods are not under the snake's body.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food.\n- Tail is at (6,2).\n- Adjacent to head (5,3): \n  - (5,3) is adjacent to (6,2)? Let's see:\n    - (6,2) is right and down from (5,3): x+1, y-1 → diagonally adjacent, not directly adjacent (direct adjacent would share one coordinate).\n    - Direct adjacents to (5,3): (5,4), (5,2), (4,3), (6,3).\n    - So (6,2) is not directly adjacent to head → no tail reward danger.\n\n### Deciding Between Down and Left\n\nBoth moves are safe, and no immediate food can be eaten. So, which is better?\n\nLooking at future possibilities:\n- **Move Down (D): (5,3)→(5,2)**\n  - Next turn, head at (5,2), direction D.\n  - Possible moves: D (to (5,1)), L (to (4,2)), R (to (6,2)).\n    - Cannot move U (opposite of D).\n  - (6,2) is the tail's current position, so moving R to (6,2) is safe because tail will move away.\n- **Move Left (L): (5,3)→(4,3)**\n  - Next turn, head at (4,3), direction L.\n  - Possible moves: U (to (4,4)), D (to (4,2)), L (to (3,3)).\n    - Cannot move R (opposite of L).\n  - (4,4) is a body segment → cannot move U.\n  - So possible: D or L.\n\nBetween Down and Left, Down seems slightly better because:\n- After Down, next move can be Right to (6,2), which is where the tail is now, but tail will move, so it's safe.\n- After Left, next moves are more restricted (cannot go up, must go down or left).\n\nAlternatively, moving Left might keep more options open in the center, but it's hard to say without more future steps.\n\nGiven that both are safe and no food is immediately available, and considering that the snake is quite long and we might want to avoid getting boxed in, moving Down seems reasonable to start moving towards the lower part where there's more space.\n\n### Verifying Down Move\n\nLet me visualize the snake after moving Down:\n- New head: (5,2)\n- Tail was at (6,2), moves to where the second last segment was, which is (6,3).\n- New snake: [(5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)]\n  - Wait, original snake: [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)]\n  - After moving Down, head is (5,2), add to front, remove last segment (6,2).\n  - So new body: [(5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)]\n  - Length remains the same unless food is eaten (none here).\n\nThis seems safe.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the safest and most reasonable move is **Down (D)**.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Move Left (L) to (4,2)\n- Check if (4,2) is valid:\n  - Walls: x=4 is not a wall.\n  - Snake body: (4,2) is not in the body segments.\n  - Food: No food at (4,2).\n- **Outcome**: Move to (4,2), no food eaten, continue safely.\n\n#### 3.

Distance is |6-5| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n   - Life_span = 6, so it will disappear at turn 39 + 6 = 45.\n   - To reach (6,5), need to move right and up, but currently moving down, so not immediately accessible.\n\n2. **Food at (1,6)**:\n   - Current head at (5,2). Distance is |1-5| + |6-2| = 4 + 4 = 8.\n   - Life_span = 8, so it will disappear at turn 39 + 8 = 47.\n   - Far away, not immediately reachable.\n\nNeither food is immediately adjacent to the head, so no immediate eating opportunity in the next move.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe tail is at (6,3). The head is at (5,2). Adjacent cells to the tail are:\n- (5,3), (6,2), (7,3), (6,4).\n\nHead is at (5,2), which is not adjacent to the tail (6,3). So no immediate danger from tail reward.\n\n### Potential Future Considerations\n\nLooking ahead, moving towards food might be beneficial, but in the immediate next move, none of the moves lead to food. So, the priority is to avoid collisions and stay safe.\n\n### Choosing the Safest Move\n\nAll three possible moves (D, L, R) are safe in terms of not hitting walls or body. \n\n- **Down (D)**: Moves towards y=0, which is a wall at y=0. Next move after would be at (5,1), then potentially (5,0) which is a wall, limiting future options.\n- **Left (L)**: Moves towards x=0, but not immediately limiting.\n- **Right (R)**: Moves towards x=7, but not immediately limiting.\n\nBetween L and R, moving Right (R) seems slightly better because:\n- The food at (6,5) is in that general direction, though not immediately reachable.\n- Moving right now could open up paths towards that food in future moves.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the safest immediate move is **Right (R)**, as it doesn't lead to any immediate danger and keeps future options open.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - Internal obstacle: (3, 6).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)].\n   - Current head direction: Right (R).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (6,5): value=1, life_span=5.\n   - (1,6): value=1, life_span=7.\n   - (2,4): value=1, life_span=10.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nFirst, let's visualize the snake's body to understand its shape and possible movements.\n\n- Head: (6,2)\n- Body segments follow: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4).\n\nFrom the head at (6,2), the snake is currently moving Right (R). The next segment is (5,2), which is to the left of the head. This means the snake just moved from (5,2) to (6,2), so the last move was Right.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nSince the snake's current direction is Right, the possible moves are:\n- Up (U): (x, y+1) = (6,3)\n- Down (D): (x, y-1) = (6,1)\n- Right (R): (x+1, y) = (7,2)\n- Left (L): (x-1, y) = (5,2)\n\nBut we cannot reverse direction instantly. The last move was Right (from (5,2) to (6,2)), so the opposite direction is Left. Therefore, we cannot move Left next.\n\nSo, valid moves are U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's check each:\n\n1. **Right (R) to (7,2)**:\n   - x=7 is a border wall. Moving here would cause a wall collision → deadly.\n   - **Invalid**.\n\n2. **Up (U) to (6,3)**:\n   - Check if (6,3) is part of the snake's body.\n   - Snake body positions: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4).\n   - (6,3) is not in the body → safe.\n   - Not a wall.\n   - **Valid**.\n\n3. **Down (D) to (6,1)**:\n   - Check if (6,1) is part of the snake's body.\n   - Not in the body list → safe.\n   - Not a wall (y=0 is a wall, but y=1 is not).\n   - **Valid**.\n\nSo, possible actions: U or D.\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving U or D can lead to eating food.\n\nFood positions:\n1. (6,5): value=1, life_span=5.\n   - Currently at (6,5), which is part of the snake's body (the 8th segment).\n   - To eat this, the body must move away, and then the head moves onto it.\n   - Currently, the head is at (6,2), moving to (6,3) or (6,1) doesn't help immediately.\n   - Maybe in future turns, but not now.\n   \n2. (1,6): value=1, life_span=7.\n   - Far from current head position (6,2). Not reachable immediately.\n   \n3. (2,4): value=1, life_span=10.\n   - Also not immediately reachable from (6,2).\n\nSo, neither U nor D leads directly to food in the next move.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if moving U or D could lead to a situation where the head is adjacent to the tail with positive food on the tail cell.\n\nCurrent tail is at (6,4). \n\nAfter moving:\n- If U to (6,3):\n  - New head: (6,3).\n  - Tail was at (6,4), but since the snake moves, the tail will move forward. The tail moves from (6,4) to (6,5) (since the segment before it is (6,5), but wait, let's see:\n  \n  Snake before move: [(6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)].\n  \n  After moving U to (6,3):\n  - New head: (6,3).\n  - Body segments shift: (6,2) becomes first body, (5,2) second, ..., (6,5) becomes the new tail (since the last segment was (6,4), which was preceded by (6,5), so (6,5) is now the new tail).\n  \n  So new tail is at (6,5).\n  \n  Is there food at (6,5)? Yes, value=1.\n  \n  Is the head adjacent to the tail after move?\n  - Head at (6,3), tail at (6,5).\n  - Adjacent means one cell apart in any direction, including diagonally.\n  - Distance: |6-6| + |3-5| = 0 + 2 = 2.\n  - For adjacency, distance should be 1 (directly adjacent) or sqrt(2) (diagonally).\n  - Here, distance is 2 (same column, two rows apart), so not adjacent.\n  \n  So no tail reward danger here.\n\n- If D to (6,1):\n  - New head: (6,1).\n  - New tail: similarly, shifts to (6,5).\n  - Head at (6,1), tail at (6,5).\n  - Distance: |6-6| + |1-5| = 0 + 4 = 4 → not adjacent.\n  \nSo both U and D don't pose tail reward danger in the next move.\n\n### Choosing Between U and D\n\nSince neither move leads directly to food, and both are safe in terms of collisions and tail reward danger, we can choose either. \n\nBut let's think about future possibilities:\n\n- Moving U to (6,3):\n  - Next possible moves from (6,3): U to (6,4), D to (6,2), L to (5,3), R to (7,3).\n  - (6,4) is part of the body (but will move), (7,3) is wall, (6,2) is body (but will move), (5,3) is body.\n  - So next moves would be limited.\n\n- Moving D to (6,1):\n  - Next possible moves from (6,1): U to (6,2), D to (6,0) (wall), L to (5,1), R to (7,1) (wall).\n  - (6,2) is body (but will move), (5,1) is free (assuming no walls or body there).\n  \nBetween the two, moving D seems slightly better because it opens up the possibility to move left to (5,1) next, which is currently not occupied by the snake's body (as per current positions).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Access\n\nWait, is there any food that can be accessed soon?\n\nLooking at food at (6,5):\n- Currently under the snake's body (segment at (6,5)).\n- To eat it, the body must move away, then head moves onto it.\n- If we move U to (6,3), next move could be L to (5,3), then D to (5,2), etc., but not directly helpful.\n- If we move D to (6,1), then next could be L to (5,1), then maybe U to (5,2), etc., still not directly helpful.\n\nNeither seems to directly help in eating the food at (6,5) soon.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince both U and D are safe and don't lead to immediate food, but moving D seems to open up slightly more options next turn (can move left to (5,1)), I'll choose D.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{D}",

From the current direction, the possible moves are:\n\n- **Continue Down (D)**: (6,0). But y=0 is a wall, so this is invalid (collision).\n- **Turn Left (L)**: (5,1). Need to check if this is valid.\n- **Turn Right (R)**: (7,1). x=7 is a wall, so invalid.\n\nFrom the current direction (D), the opposite move is Up (U), which is not allowed (no instant reverse). So, the only possible move is Left (L) to (5,1).\n\nBut let's verify if (5,1) is safe:\n\n- **Body Check**: The snake's body segments are at (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5). (5,1) is not in this list, so no body collision.\n- **Wall Check**: (5,1) is not a wall (no internal obstacle there, and not a border wall).\n\nSo, moving Left (L) to (5,1) seems safe.\n\n### Checking for Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if moving Left (L) can lead to eating food:\n\n1. **Food at (6,5)**:\n   - Current head is at (6,1), moving to (5,1). Not moving towards (6,5).\n   - Also, (6,5) is under the snake's tail. To eat it:\n     - The tail must move away first (which it will as the snake moves).\n     - Then the head must move onto (6,5). Currently, that's not possible in one move from (6,1).\n   \n2. **Food at (1,6)** and (2,4):\n   - Both are far from the current head position (6,1). Moving Left to (5,1) doesn't directly approach them.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nThere's a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\n- Current tail is at (6,5), which has food (6,5,4,1).\n- Adjacent cells to tail (6,5):\n  - (5,5), (7,5), (6,4), (6,6).\n  - Current head is at (6,1), not adjacent to tail. So no immediate danger here.\n\n### Other Considerations\n\n- **Future Moves**: Moving Left now might open up paths to other food later, but as a non-thinking executor, we focus on the immediate turn.\n- **Life Span of Food**: All foods have life spans > current turn (41), so they won't disappear this turn.\n\n### Verifying No Better Immediate Move\n\nIs there a better immediate move than Left (L)?\n\n- Only possible move is Left (L), as Down leads to a wall, Right leads to a wall, and Up is reverse (invalid).\n  \n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe and valid immediate action is to move Left (L) to (5,1).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

I'm going to analyze the current state of the game and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 42 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the given information:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (since x and y go from 0 to 7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the snake can't go beyond these).\n   - There's one internal obstacle at (3, 6).\n\n2. **Snake Details**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)]\n     - Head is at (5,1).\n     - Tail is at (5,5).\n   - Current head direction: Left (L).\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - (6,5): value=3, life_span=1\n   - (1,6): value=5, life_span=1\n   - (2,4): value=8, life_span=1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me try to visualize the snake's position to understand its shape and possible movements.\n\nStarting from the head at (5,1):\n\n1. (5,1) - head\n2. (6,1) - body\n3. (6,2) - body\n4. (5,2) - body\n5. (5,3) - body\n6. (5,4) - body\n7. (4,4) - body\n8. (4,5) - body\n9. (5,5) - tail\n\nDrawing this:\n\n- At y=1: (5,1) head, (6,1) body\n- At y=2: (6,2) body, (5,2) body\n- At y=3: (5,3) body\n- At y=4: (5,4) body, (4,4) body\n- At y=5: (4,5) body, (5,5) tail\n\nThe snake seems to be in a sort of \"S\" shape, starting left from the head, going right to (6,1), down to (6,2), left to (5,2), down to (5,3), down to (5,4), left to (4,4), up to (4,5), right to (5,5).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nCurrent direction is Left (L). The rules state that we cannot do an instant reverse, so we cannot move Right (R) next. So possible moves are Up (U), Down (D), or continue Left (L).\n\nLet's check each:\n\n1. **Left (L)**: From (5,1) to (4,1)\n   - Check if (4,1) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=4 is not a border (x=0 or 7), y=1 is not a border.\n     - Not an internal obstacle: internal obstacle is at (3,6), so (4,1) is clear.\n     - Not part of the snake's body: \n       - Snake body segments are at (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). \n       - (4,1) is not in this list, so safe.\n   - So moving Left is possible.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: From (5,1) to (5,2)\n   - (5,2) is part of the snake's body (4th position in the list).\n   - Moving into body is deadly, so cannot move Up.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: From (5,1) to (5,0)\n   - y=0 is a border wall, so cannot move Down.\n\nSo, the only possible move is Left to (4,1).\n\nBut wait, let's see if there's any food to consider that might make another move preferable if it were possible. Since only Left is possible, we might have to go Left, but let's double-check if there's any other consideration.\n\n### Checking Food\n\nFood items:\n\n1. (6,5): value=3, life_span=1\n   - Distance from head (5,1): \n     - x distance: 6-5=1\n     - y distance: 5-1=4\n     - Total distance: 5 steps away (Manhattan distance)\n   - Life_span=1, so it will disappear after this turn. We can't reach it in one move, so it's irrelevant for this turn.\n\n2. (1,6): value=5, life_span=1\n   - Distance: \n     - x: 1-5=4\n     - y: 6-1=5\n     - Total: 9 steps away\n   - Life_span=1, so it will disappear. Can't reach it now.\n\n3. (2,4): value=8, life_span=1\n   - Distance:\n     - x: 2-5=3\n     - y: 4-1=3\n     - Total: 6 steps away\n   - Life_span=1, so it will disappear. Can't reach it now.\n\nAll food items will disappear after this turn, and none are adjacent to the head, so no immediate food to eat. Therefore, the only concern is moving safely.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule mentions \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Tail is at (5,5).\n- Head is at (5,1). Distance to tail:\n  - x: 5-5=0\n  - y: 5-1=4\n  - Total distance: 4, not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1).\n- Also, there's no food at the tail currently (food is at (6,5), (1,6), (2,4)), so no danger here.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly possible safe move is Left to (4,1). Other moves are either into the body or walls.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

The next move cannot be Right (R) because that would be an instant reverse, which is not allowed.\n\n### Possible Moves from (4,1)\n\nFrom (4,1), the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (4, 2)\n   - Check if this is a wall: No walls at (4,2).\n   - Check if this is part of the snake's body: The body segments are at (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5). (4,2) is not in this list, so it's safe.\n2. **Down (D)**: (4, 0)\n   - Check if this is a wall: y=0 is a border wall, so this is invalid.\n3. **Left (L)**: (3,1)\n   - Check if this is a wall: No walls at (3,1).\n   - Check body collision: (3,1) is not in the body segments, so safe.\n4. **Right (R)**: (5,1)\n   - This is the immediate body segment behind the head. Normally, moving into the tail is allowed because the tail moves forward, but we need to check if this is the tail or another body part.\n   - The tail is the last segment: (4,5). (5,1) is the segment right after the head, so moving here would cause the head to collide with the body immediately after the tail moves, which is deadly. Hence, this is not safe.\n\nSo, possible safe moves: Up (U) or Left (L).\n\n### Checking Food Positions\n\nNow, let's see if any food is adjacent to the head that we can aim for:\n\nAdjacent cells to (4,1):\n\n- Up (U): (4,2) — no food here.\n- Left (L): (3,1) — no food here.\n- Down (D): (4,0) — invalid.\n- Right (R): (5,1) — body segment, not food.\n\nSo, no immediate food to eat in the next move. We need to choose between U and L based on future paths.\n\n### Evaluating Up (U) vs. Left (L)\n\n**Option 1: Up (U) to (4,2)**\n- From (4,2), possible next moves:\n  - U: (4,3) — check: not a wall, not in body.\n  - L: (3,2) — check: not a wall, not in body.\n  - R: (5,2) — check: body segment at (5,2), but it's the tail's position after the move? Let's see:\n    - Current tail is at (4,5). After moving head to (4,2), the tail moves from (4,5) to (4,4), so (5,2) is still occupied by the body (from (6,2) moving to (5,2)), so R would be deadly.\n  - D: (4,1) — original head position, now occupied by (5,1) moving to (4,1), but the head is at (4,2), so D would go to (4,1), which is now the segment that was at (5,1), so collision. Hence, D is not possible next turn.\n  \nSo from (4,2), next possible moves would be U or L.\n\n**Option 2: Left (L) to (3,1)**\n- From (3,1), possible next moves:\n  - U: (3,2) — not wall, not body.\n  - D: (3,0) — y=0 is wall, invalid.\n  - L: (2,1) — not wall, not body.\n  - R: (4,1) — original head position, now (5,1) moves to (4,1), so R would go to (4,1), which is now occupied by the segment from (5,1), so collision. Hence, R is not possible next turn.\n  \nSo from (3,1), next possible moves would be U or L.\n\n### Choosing Between U and L\n\nBoth moves don't lead to immediate food, but let's see which one opens up more options or gets us closer to food.\n\nLooking at food positions:\n- (6,5): Need to go right and up.\n- (1,6): Need to go left and up.\n- (2,4): Left and up.\n- (6,2): Right and up, but it's under the body at (6,2), which is part of the snake. To eat this, we'd need to move the body away first.\n\nCurrently, moving Left seems to head towards (1,6) and (2,4), while moving Up doesn't immediately help. \n\nAlso, moving Left to (3,1) might open paths towards the left side where there's food at (1,6) and (2,4), whereas moving Up to (4,2) doesn't seem to lead directly to any food soon.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe need to ensure that moving Left doesn't put us in a position where the tail has positive food that we might accidentally eat next turn, causing a collision.\n\nCurrent tail is at (4,5). The food at (6,2) is under the body, but not at the tail. Other foods are not at the tail's position, so no immediate danger from tail reward.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween U and L, moving Left seems more strategic as it heads towards areas with more food options ((1,6) and (2,4)), whereas moving Up doesn't provide a clear advantage currently.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

I'm going to analyze the current state of the game and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 44 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid Dimensions and Walls:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n- Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move outside these bounds.\n- There's one internal obstacle at (3, 6).\n\n**2. Snake Details:**\n- **Positions (head first):** [(3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4)]\n  - Head is at (3, 1).\n  - Tail is at (4, 4).\n- **Current Direction:** L (Left). This means the snake was moving left in the previous turn.\n\n**3. Food Items:**\n   - (6, 5): value = 1, life_span = 1\n   - (1, 6): value = 1, life_span = 3\n   - (2, 4): value = 1, life_span = 6\n   - (6, 2): value = 1, life_span = 9\n\nAll foods are positive (+1), and none are negative in this scenario.\n\n### Possible Moves and Constraints\n\n**Movement Constraints:**\n- Cannot reverse direction immediately. Since the current direction is Left (L), we cannot move Right (R) in the next move.\n- Possible moves: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L).\n\n**Current Head Position:** (3, 1)\n- Left (L): (2, 1)\n- Up (U): (3, 2)\n- Down (D): (3, 0) → y=0 is a wall, so invalid.\n  \nSo, valid immediate moves: L, U.\n\n**Checking for Collisions:**\n- **Left (L) to (2, 1):**\n  - Check if (2, 1) is in snake body: \n    - Snake body segments: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)\n    - (2,1) is not in the body. Also, not a wall.\n  - Safe to move left.\n  \n- **Up (U) to (3, 2):**\n  - Check if (3, 2) is in snake body:\n    - Not in the body segments listed.\n    - Not a wall.\n  - Safe to move up.\n\n**Food Considerations:**\nLet's see if moving in any direction can lead us to food.\n\n- **Left to (2,1):**\n  - Is there food at (2,1)? Checking food positions:\n    - (6,5), (1,6), (2,4), (6,2) → No food at (2,1).\n  \n- **Up to (3,2):**\n  - Is there food at (3,2)? No.\n\nSo, immediate moves don't lead to food directly. \n\n**Special Cases:**\n- **Tail Reward Danger:** If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n  - Tail is at (4,4).\n  - Adjacent to head (3,1)? Let's see:\n    - Adjacent means same x and y differs by 1 or same y and x differs by 1.\n    - (3,1) and (4,4): x differs by 1, y differs by 3 → not adjacent.\n  - So, no danger from tail food in this case.\n\n**Future Moves Planning:**\nSince immediate moves don't lead to food, let's think about future moves to reach food.\n\nLooking at food positions:\n1. (6,5): life_span = 1 → will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n   - Distance from head (3,1) to (6,5):\n     - Manhattan distance: |6-3| + |5-1| = 3 + 4 = 7.\n     - Can't reach in 1 move, so it will disappear.\n   \n2. (1,6): life_span = 3.\n   - Distance: |1-3| + |6-1| = 2 + 5 = 7.\n   - Can't reach in 3 moves (since life_span decreases each turn, including current).\n   \n3. (2,4): life_span = 6.\n   - Distance: |2-3| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n   - Possible to reach in 4 moves, life_span is 6 → can reach.\n   \n4. (6,2): life_span = 9.\n   - Distance: |6-3| + |2-1| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n   - Can reach in 4 moves, life_span is 9 → can reach.\n\nBetween (2,4) and (6,2), both are reachable. Let's see which is better:\n\n- (2,4): \n  - Path: From (3,1), need to go left to (2,1), then up to (2,2), (2,3), (2,4).\n  - But current direction is L, so next move can be L to (2,1).\n  \n- (6,2):\n  - Currently at (3,1), need to go right, but current direction is L, cannot reverse to R immediately.\n  - Next turn can go R, but need to wait.\n\nSo, immediate move L towards (2,4) seems better.\n\n**Alternative Paths:**\nIf we go U to (3,2), then next moves could be:\n- U to (3,3), then (3,4), then (2,4) to reach (2,4) in 3 more moves (total 4 moves).\nBut initial move is U, not L.\n\nGoing L first seems more direct towards (2,4).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers After Move\n\nAfter moving L to (2,1):\n- New head at (2,1), body segments shift:\n  - New body: [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)]\n  - Tail was at (4,4), now moves to (4,1) is the new tail? Wait, no:\n    - Original body: [(3,1), (4,1), ..., (4,4)]\n    - After moving head left to (2,1), tail (4,4) moves forward, so new tail is the segment before (4,4), which is (5,4).\n    - Wait, let's list new positions:\n      - Head moves to (2,1).\n      - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n      - So new positions: [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)]\n      - Tail is now at (5,4).\n    - No immediate collision at (2,1).\n  \nAfter moving U to (3,2):\n- New head at (3,2), body:\n  - [(3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)]\n  - Tail at (5,4).\n  - Also safe.\n\nBoth moves are safe, but L seems more towards food (2,4).\n\n### Deciding Between L and U\n\n- L:\n  - Next position: (2,1).\n  - Then can go U to (2,2), then (2,3), then (2,4) to reach food in 3 more moves (total 4 from now).\n  \n- U:\n  - Next position: (3,2).\n  - Then can go U to (3,3), (3,4), then L to (2,4) to reach food in 3 more moves (total 4 from now).\n  \nBoth paths take same number of moves to reach food. \n\nBut moving L first aligns with current direction (L), and doesn't require changing direction immediately, which might be simpler.\n\nAlso, moving L now gives more flexibility in future moves, as we're moving towards the left side where (2,4) is.\n\n### Checking Other Foods\n\n(6,2) is also food, but currently at (3,1), to reach (6,2):\n- Need to go right, but current direction is L, cannot reverse to R immediately.\n- Next turn can go R, but then path would be:\n  - Now: L to (2,1).\n  - Next: R to (3,1) - but that's back to body segment (3,1) is now at position 2 in body, so moving to (3,1) would collide with body.\n  - So not a good path.\n\nAlternative:\n- Now: U to (3,2).\n- Next: R to (4,2) - but (4,2) is not in body, but then how to reach (6,2)?\n  - Then R to (5,2) - but (5,2) is in body (original position 6 in body list).\n  - Original body at (5,2) will have moved by then, but seems complicated.\n\nSeems harder to reach (6,2) than (2,4).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBest immediate move is Left (L) towards (2,4) food, which is reachable in 4 moves (including this one), and its life_span is 6, so it will still be there.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 45 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid and Walls:**\n- The grid is bounded by walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6.\n- There's an internal obstacle at (3, 6), meaning the snake cannot move to that cell.\n\n**2. Snake:**\n- Positions (head first): [(2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)]\n- Current head direction: Left (L), meaning the last move was to the left.\n\n**3. Food:**\n- (1, 6): value = +1, life_span = 3\n- (2, 4): value = +1, life_span = 5\n- (6, 2): value = +1, life_span = 8\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake's body to understand its shape and possible movements.\n\n- Head at (2, 1), moving left (from (3,1) to (2,1)).\n- Body segments follow: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), then turns up to (6,2), then left to (5,2), then up to (5,3), then up to (5,4).\n\nThe snake is currently moving left at the head, with a long body extending right and then making a small upward turn near the top-right corner.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (2,1) moving left (L), the possible next moves are:\n- Left (L): (1,1)\n- Up (U): (2,2)\n- Down (D): (2,0) — but y=0 is a wall, so invalid.\n  \nCannot move Right (R) because that's the opposite of current direction (L), which is not allowed.\n\nSo, possible valid moves: Left to (1,1) or Up to (2,2).\n\n### Checking for Collisions\n\n**Move Left to (1,1):**\n- Check if (1,1) is a wall: x=1 is within bounds, y=1 is within bounds, and no internal obstacle at (1,1). So, not a wall.\n- Check if (1,1) is part of the snake's body:\n  - Snake body segments: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)\n  - (1,1) is not in this list, so no collision.\n  \n**Move Up to (2,2):**\n- Check if (2,2) is a wall: no, within bounds and not an obstacle.\n- Check if (2,2) is part of the snake's body:\n  - Not in the body segments list, so no collision.\n\nBoth moves are safe in terms of not colliding with walls or body.\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if either move leads to eating food.\n\n**Move Left to (1,1):**\n- Food positions: (1,6), (2,4), (6,2)\n- (1,1) is not a food position, so no food eaten.\n\n**Move Up to (2,2):**\n- (2,2) is not a food position, so no food eaten.\n\nNeither move directly eats food this turn. However, we should consider future opportunities based on these moves.\n\n### Considering Future Moves and Food Accessibility\n\nLet's think about which move positions us better to reach food in future turns.\n\n**Food Positions:**\n1. (1,6): life_span = 3\n   - Current turn is 45, so disappears at turn 48.\n   - Distance from current head (2,1) to (1,6):\n     - Need to go left to x=1, then up to y=6.\n     - Manhattan distance: |2-1| + |1-6| = 1 + 5 = 6 moves.\n     - But life_span is 3, so cannot reach in time.\n   \n2. (2,4): life_span = 5\n   - Disappears at turn 50.\n   - Distance from (2,1) to (2,4):\n     - Same x, just need to go up by 3.\n     - 3 moves: U, U, U.\n     - Can reach by turn 48 (45,46,47,48).\n   \n3. (6,2): life_span = 8\n   - Disappears at turn 53.\n   - Distance from (2,1) to (6,2):\n     - Need to go right by 4, up by 1.\n     - But current direction is L, so next move can't be R (opposite).\n     - To go right, would need to first move U or L, then R.\n     - Complicated path, but possible in more moves.\n\nSo, the most reachable food is (2,4), which we can reach in 3 moves if we start moving up now.\n\n**Path to (2,4):**\n- Current head: (2,1)\n- Move U: (2,2)\n- Next move U: (2,3)\n- Next move U: (2,4) — eat food at turn 48 (before it disappears at 50).\n\nThis seems like a good plan.\n\n**Alternative Move Left to (1,1):**\n- Head at (1,1)\n- Next moves to reach (2,4):\n  - Need to go right to x=2, then up to y=4.\n  - From (1,1), possible moves:\n    - R to (2,1) — but then need to go up, but (2,1) is part of the body (original position was (2,1) is head, but body is following).\n    - Wait, original body is [(2,1), ...], but after moving left to (1,1), the body becomes [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), ...].\n    - So moving R to (2,1) would collide with body at (2,1).\n    - So cannot move R from (1,1).\n    - Can move U to (1,2), then R to (2,2), etc.\n    - Longer path to (2,4).\n\nThus, moving left first makes reaching (2,4) harder or impossible within the life_span.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe should also check if moving up to (2,2) poses any tail reward danger.\n\nTail is at (5,4). Is (5,4) a food position? No, foods are at (1,6), (2,4), (6,2). So no danger from that.\n\n### Checking Other Foods\n\n(6,2) is currently under the snake's body (part of the body is at (6,2)). \n\nRules say:\n- Food under body can only be eaten if:\n  1. Body moves away, and\n  2. Head moves onto the food cell.\n\nCurrently, (6,2) is part of the body. To eat it:\n- Need the body to move away from (6,2), meaning the tail (which is at (5,4)) moves, and the segment at (6,2) moves to (6,1) or similar, but the snake is long, so this would take many moves.\n- Then head would need to move to (6,2), which is far and may not be feasible before the food disappears (life_span=8, so by turn 53).\n\nNot practical to aim for (6,2) now.\n\n### Decision\n\nBest immediate move is Up (U) to (2,2), setting up to reach (2,4) in the next few turns to eat the +1 food before it disappears at turn 50.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Better Option\n\nIs there any immediate food to eat this turn? No, none of the foods are at (1,1) or (2,2).\n\nIs there any danger in moving U to (2,2)? No, as checked earlier, no collision with body or walls.\n\nIs moving left to (1,1) better? No, as it delays reaching (2,4).\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's visualize the current state of the game based on the provided information.\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, indicating an 8x8 grid (from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n   \n2. **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal obstacle at (3, 6).\n\n3. **Snake Positions**: The snake's body is represented by the following coordinates in order from head to tail:\n   - Head: (2, 2)\n   - Body: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3)\n   \n   Plotting these, the snake's head is at (2,2), and the body forms a sort of \"S\" shape extending down and to the right, then looping back.\n\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: The head is currently moving \"U\" (Up), meaning it's facing towards increasing y-coordinates.\n\n5. **Food Items**:\n   - (1, 6): value=1, life_span=2\n   - (2, 4): value=1, life_span=4\n   - (6, 2): value=1, life_span=7\n   - (6, 3): value=1, life_span=10\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Up, the snake cannot instantly reverse to Down (rule against instant reverse). So, possible moves are U, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Move Up (U)**: (2,2) → (2,3)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=7 is the upper wall, (2,3) is within bounds.\n     - Body: Check if (2,3) is in the snake's body. Current body segments are (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3). (2,3) is not in this list.\n     - Obstacles: (3,6) is the only internal obstacle; (2,3) is clear.\n   - Food at (2,3)? No food listed there.\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n2. **Move Left (L)**: (2,2) → (1,2)\n   - Collisions:\n     - Walls: x=0 is the left wall; (1,2) is within bounds.\n     - Body: (1,2) is not in the body segments.\n     - Obstacles: Clear.\n   - Food at (1,2)? No food listed there.\n   - Safe move, no reward.\n\n3. **Move Right (R)**: (2,2) → (3,2)\n   - Collisions:\n     - Walls: x=7 is the right wall; (3,2) is within bounds.\n     - Body: (3,2) is not in the body segments.\n     - Obstacles: Clear.\n   - Food at (3,2)? No food listed there.\n   - Safe move, no reward.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions to see if any are reachable or beneficial to aim for:\n\n1. **(1,6)**:\n   - Current position: (2,2). To reach (1,6), need to go left and up.\n   - Distance: |1-2| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5 moves away.\n   - Life span: 2 turns. It will disappear after turn 48 (current is 46). Not reachable in time (need at least 5 moves, but only 2 turns left).\n\n2. **(2,4)**:\n   - Current position: (2,2). Directly above at (2,4).\n   - Distance: |2-2| + |4-2| = 0 + 2 = 2 moves (Up twice).\n   - Life span: 4 turns. Will disappear after turn 50. Reachable in 2 moves (turns 47 and 48).\n   - Path: Move Up to (2,3), then Up to (2,4).\n   - Need to ensure no collisions on the way:\n     - Next move Up to (2,3): safe as above.\n     - Then Up to (2,4): \n       - Check body: (2,4) is not in current body, but need to see where the body will be after first move.\n       - After first move Up to (2,3), the new body will be [(2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), ..., (5,3)].\n       - (2,4) is not in this new body.\n       - Also, no obstacles or walls.\n   - Eating (2,4):\n     - Value: +1, length increases by 1.\n     - Tail is currently at (5,3). After eating, new tail will be where the current tail is (since length increases by 1), but the tail moves forward each turn unless the head eats.\n     - Need to check \"Tail Reward Danger\": Is the head adjacent to the tail when eating?\n       - At turn 48, head at (2,4), tail will be at (5,2) (since after first move, tail moves from (5,3) to (5,2)).\n       - Distance: |2-5| + |4-2| = 3 + 2 = 5, not adjacent (adjacent means distance of 1).\n       - So no danger from tail reward.\n   - This seems like a good target.\n\n3. **(6,2)**:\n   - Current position: (2,2). To reach (6,2), need to go right.\n   - Distance: |6-2| + |2-2| = 4 + 0 = 4 moves.\n   - Life span: 7 turns. Will disappear after turn 53. Reachable in 4 moves.\n   - However, (6,2) is currently occupied by the snake's body (6th segment: (6,2)).\n   - Rule: Food under body can only be eaten if:\n     - Body moves away, and\n     - Head moves onto the food cell.\n   - Currently, (6,2) is part of the body. For the head to reach (6,2), the body must have moved away by then.\n   - Path: Right to (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2).\n     - After first move to (3,2), body will be [(3,2), (2,2), (2,1), ..., (5,3)].\n     - (6,2) is no longer in the body after first move (since the tail moves from (5,3) to (5,2), and (6,2) is not in the new body).\n     - Then next moves can proceed to (6,2).\n   - But life span is 7, so can reach by turn 50 (46 + 4).\n   - However, (6,2) is also adjacent to the tail at some point. Need to check \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n     - When head is at (6,2), tail will be at (5,0) (assuming initial tail at (5,3), moves to (5,2), (5,1), (5,0)).\n     - Distance: |6-5| + |2-0| = 1 + 2 = 3, not adjacent.\n     - But need to ensure that during the path, no collisions.\n   - This is a possible target, but (2,4) is closer and more straightforward.\n\n4. **(6,3)**:\n   - Current position: (2,2). To reach (6,3), need to go right and up.\n   - Distance: |6-2| + |3-2| = 4 + 1 = 5 moves.\n   - Life span: 10 turns. Will disappear after turn 56. Reachable in 5 moves.\n   - Similar to (6,2), but one move further.\n   - Also, (6,3) is not currently under the snake's body.\n   - Less urgent compared to (2,4).\n\n### Decision Making\n\nGiven the options:\n\n- (1,6): Not reachable in time.\n- (2,4): Reachable in 2 moves, life span allows it, no immediate dangers, straightforward path.\n- (6,2): Reachable, but requires more moves and some body movement considerations.\n- (6,3): Further away, less urgent.\n\nThe best immediate action is to start moving towards (2,4), which requires moving Up first to (2,3), then Up to (2,4).\n\n### Checking Immediate Safety\n\nBefore deciding to move Up, let's ensure there are no immediate dangers:\n\n- Moving Up to (2,3):\n  - Next possible moves from (2,3):\n    - Current direction would be Up (unless we change).\n    - From (2,3), to reach (2,4), next move would also be Up.\n    - Cannot reverse to Down, but that's not needed.\n  - No immediate threats at (2,3).\n\n### Potential Risks\n\nIs there any risk in moving Up now?\n\n- If we move Up to (2,3), and then Up to (2,4), we eat the food, increasing length.\n- The new tail will be where the current tail is (5,3), but since the snake grows, the tail doesn't move when eating.\n- Need to ensure that after eating, the next moves don't cause collision with the new tail.\n- After eating at (2,4), the snake's body will be [(2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), ..., (5,3)].\n- Then, the next move from (2,4) would need to avoid colliding with the body.\n- Possible next moves from (2,4): Up to (2,5), Left to (1,4), Right to (3,4).\n   - Up: (2,5) - check body: not in current body after growth.\n   - Left: (1,4) - not in body.\n   - Right: (3,4) - not in body.\n- So no immediate risk after eating.\n\n### Alternative Considerations\n\nIs there any reason not to go for (2,4)?\n\n- The other foods are either too far or not as immediately beneficial.\n- Moving Left or Right now leads to no immediate reward and may delay reaching other foods.\n- Moving Up starts the path towards (2,4), which is the most promising target.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up to (2,3), starting the path towards the positive food at (2,4).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Move Left (L) to (1, 3):**\n- Check (1, 3):\n  - x=1 is within bounds (not x=0).\n  - y=3 is within bounds.\n  - Not an obstacle.\n  - Not in snake's body.\n  - No food here (food is at (1,6), (2,4), etc.).\n- Is it safe?\n  - No immediate collision.\n  - But no reward either; just moving away from current position.\n\n**3. Move Right (R) to (3, 3):**\n- Check (3, 3):\n  - Within bounds.\n  - Not an obstacle (obstacle is at (3,6)).\n  - Not in snake's body.\n  - No food here.\n- Safe but no reward.\n\n### Comparing the Options:\n- **Up (U)**: Eat +3 food, safe.\n- **Left (L)**: No food, safe.\n- **Right (R)**: No food, safe.\n\nClearly, moving Up to eat the +3 food is the best immediate action.\n\n### Verifying Other Foods:\nJust to ensure we're not missing a better opportunity:\n- (1, 6): value=1, life_span=1 — far from current head (2,3), would take multiple moves to reach.\n- (6, 2): value=6, life_span=1 — current tail is at (5,2), and (6,2) is part of the snake's body (6,2 is the 8th segment). Can't eat food under body unless head moves onto it after body moves away. Currently, (6,2) is occupied by the snake, so can't eat it now.\n- (6, 3): value=9, life_span=1 — also far, would take multiple moves to reach.\n\nThe +3 food at (2,4) is the most accessible and highest immediate reward among reachable foods.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers:\nAfter moving Up to (2,4), the new head is at (2,4), and the tail moves forward, so the body becomes:\n- New head: (2,4)\n- Body: (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n- Tail was (5,2), which moves to (5,2) is no longer part after the move (since length increases by 1 when eating food, the tail doesn't move forward; actually, the last segment is removed, and a new segment is added at the head's new position, but the length increases by 1, so the tail stays where it was before the move. Wait, let's clarify snake movement after eating:\n\nWhen snake eats food:\n- Head moves to food cell.\n- New body segment is added where the head was (so length increases by 1).\n- Tail does not move.\n\nSo new body:\n- Head: (2,4)\n- Body: (2,3) (old head), then original body: (2,2), (2,1), ..., (6,2), (5,2) — but length increases by 1, so the tail (5,2) is still there, and the segment before it was (6,2), which was already part of the body.\n\nWait, original length is 9 (from positions list). After eating, length becomes 10, so the tail stays at (5,2), and a new segment is added at (2,3).\n\nSo no immediate collision next move unless head moves into body, which it won't if we choose moves carefully next time.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate action is to move Up to (2,4) to eat the +3 food, which is safe and maximizes the immediate score gain.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

(6, 3): value = 8, life_span = 1\n   - Positive food, will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Possible Moves:\nFrom the current head position (2,4) and direction \"U\", the possible moves are:\n- Up (U): (2,5)\n- Left (L): (1,4)\n- Right (R): (3,4)\nCannot move Down (D) because that would be the opposite of the current direction \"U\" (instant reverse is not allowed).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move.\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (2,5):\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is the upper border, (2,5) is within bounds.\n  - Internal obstacles: (3,6) is not (2,5).\n  - Body collision: Check if (2,5) is in snake positions.\n    - Snake positions: [(2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2)]\n    - (2,5) is not in the list, so no body collision.\n- Food at (2,5)? No food listed there.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (1,4):\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is the left border, (1,4) is within bounds (x=1).\n  - Internal obstacles: (3,6) is not (1,4).\n  - Body collision: (1,4) is not in snake positions.\n- Food at (1,4)? No food listed there.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (3,4):\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is the right border, (3,4) is within bounds.\n  - Internal obstacles: (3,6) is not (3,4).\n  - Body collision: (3,4) is not in snake positions.\n- Food at (3,4)? No food listed there.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food:\nCurrently, there are two food items:\n1. (6,2): value=6, life_span=1\n   - Currently under the snake's body segment at (6,2) (part of the snake's body).\n   - To eat this:\n     - The body must move away from (6,2), and then the head must move onto it.\n     - Currently, the tail is at (5,2), which is adjacent to the head (2,4) via a long path, but not directly adjacent.\n     - The head is not adjacent to (6,2), so cannot eat it this turn.\n2. (6,3): value=8, life_span=1\n   - Not under the snake's body.\n   - Distance from head (2,4) to (6,3): |6-2| + |3-4| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps away.\n   - Cannot reach it in one move, so cannot eat it this turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger:\nCheck if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food.\n- Tail position: (5,2)\n- Head position: (2,4)\n- Distance: |5-2| + |2-4| = 3 + 2 = 5 (not adjacent).\n- So, no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Decision:\nAll three possible moves (U, L, R) are safe with no immediate food to eat. We should choose a move that:\n- Doesn't lead to a dead end.\n- Keeps options open for future moves.\n\nLooking at the grid:\n- Moving Up (U) to (2,5): \n  - From there, possible moves would be U, L, R (cannot go D).\n- Moving Left (L) to (1,4):\n  - From there, possible moves would be U, L, D (cannot go R opposite of L).\n- Moving Right (R) to (3,4):\n  - From there, possible moves would be U, R, D (cannot go L opposite of R).\n\nThe snake is currently long and winding. Moving Right seems better to explore more space towards the right side where there's food (though not reachable this turn). Moving Left might corner us near x=0.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\\boxed{R}",

Safe.\n   - Food at (4,4)? No food listed there.\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: (3,5)\n   - Walls: y=7 is wall, y=5 is safe.\n   - Body collision: (3,5) not in body segments. Safe.\n   - Food at (3,5)? No food listed.\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: (3,3)\n   - Walls: y=0 is wall, y=3 is safe.\n   - Body collision: (3,3) not in body segments. Safe.\n   - Food at (3,3)? No food listed.\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions and see if any are reachable or beneficial:\n\n1. **Food at (6,2)**:\n   - Current position: (3,4).\n   - Distance: Need to move right to x=6 and down to y=2.\n   - Currently at y=4, need to go down twice.\n   - But the food is at (6,2), which is also the tail's current position (last segment: (6,2)).\n   - **Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n   - Adjacent to tail (6,2): \n     - Current head is at (3,4), which is not adjacent to (6,2). \n     - Distance: |3-6| + |4-2| = 3 + 2 = 5, not adjacent (adjacent means distance =1).\n   - So, no immediate danger, but to reach (6,2), we'd have to navigate there, and by then the tail may have moved.\n   - Life span is 1, so it disappears after this turn if not eaten now.\n   - Currently, the head cannot reach (6,2) in one move (from (3,4), need at least 3 right and 2 down). So cannot eat it now.\n\n2. **Food at (6,3)**:\n   - Position: (6,3).\n   - Distance from (3,4): need 3 right, 1 down.\n   - Cannot reach in one move.\n   - Life span is 1, so disappears after this turn. Cannot eat now.\n\n3. **Food at (5,3)**:\n   - Position: (5,3).\n   - Distance from (3,4): need 2 right, 1 down.\n   - Cannot reach in one move.\n   - Life span is 10, so it will stay for more turns.\n\n### Immediate Actions\n\nSince none of the food can be eaten in the immediate next move (all require multiple moves to reach), the priority is to move safely without colliding and position the snake to potentially reach food in future turns.\n\nFrom (3,4), possible safe moves: R to (4,4), U to (3,5), D to (3,3).\n\n- **Right (R) to (4,4)**:\n  - Moves towards the right side where some food is located (though not immediately reachable).\n  - Keeps options open to go up or down next turn to approach food.\n\n- **Up (U) to (3,5)**:\n  - Moves away from most food (which is at lower y values).\n  - Not immediately beneficial.\n\n- **Down (D) to (3,3)**:\n  - Moves closer to y=2 where some food is.\n  - Next turn from (3,3), could go right towards (5,3) food.\n\nBetween R and D, both are safe. D moves closer to the food at (5,3), which has a longer lifespan, making it a better candidate for future moves.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Under Snake\n\nThe rules mention that food can be under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:\n1. The body moves away, and\n2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nLooking at the snake's body:\n- (6,2) has food (6,2,5,1), but the head is at (3,4), not adjacent to tail.\n- The tail is at (6,2), which is also where food is. But the head is not adjacent to the tail, so no danger of eating tail food now.\n\nSince the head is not on the food, and the food under the body is not accessible this turn, we don't need to consider eating it now.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven the above, the best immediate move is to go **Down (D)** to (3,3), which:\n- Is safe (no collision).\n- Moves closer to the food at (5,3) which has a longer lifespan (10 turns).\n- From (3,3), next turn can go Right towards the food.\n\nOther moves:\n- Right (R) is safe but doesn't help in approaching food immediately.\n- Up (U) moves away from food.\n\n### Verifying No Better Immediate Option\n\nIs there any immediate food to eat? No, all food is at least 2 moves away, and the one at (6,2) is under the tail with life span 1, so it will disappear after this turn unless eaten now, but we can't reach it in one move.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the best immediate action is:\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 50 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid and Walls:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, we can't move to these coordinates.\n- Internal obstacle: (3, 6). We can't move here either.\n\n**2. Snake:**\n- Positions (head first): [(3, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1)]\n  - Head at (3, 3), direction is Down (D).\n  - Body segments follow the head.\n- Length: 10 segments.\n\n**3.

(5, 3): value = 1, life_span = 9\n\nAll foods are positive (+1 reward, +1 length).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nCurrent direction is Down (D). From the head at (3, 3), moving Down would go to (3, 2). \n\nPossible moves (without instant reverse):\n- Cannot move Up (U) because that's the opposite of current direction (D).\n- Can move Down (D), Left (L), or Right (R).\n\nLet's check each possible move:\n\n**1. Down (D) to (3, 2):**\n- Check for walls: (3, 2) is not a border wall or internal obstacle.\n- Check for body collision: \n  - Snake body positions: (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n  - (3,2) is not in the body segments. \n  - Tail is at (6,1), which will move forward when the head moves, so no collision with tail.\n- Is there food at (3,2)? No.\n- Safe move, but doesn't eat food.\n\n**2. Left (L) to (2, 3):**\n- Check for walls: (2, 3) is not a wall.\n- Check for body collision:\n  - (2,3) is in the body segments (4th segment). Moving here would collide with the body.\n- Not safe.\n\n**3. Right (R) to (4, 3):**\n- Check for walls: (4, 3) is not a wall.\n- Check for body collision:\n  - (4,3) is not in the body segments.\n- Is there food at (4,3)? No.\n- Safe move, but doesn't eat food.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see if we can reach any food safely in the next move or plan for future moves.\n\n**Food at (6,2):**\n- Current head at (3,3). To reach (6,2), we'd need to move right thrice and down once, but that's not immediate.\n- Not reachable in one move.\n\n**Food at (6,3):**\n- Same as above, not reachable in one move.\n\n**Food at (5,3):**\n- From (3,3), moving right twice would get us to (5,3).\n- First move right to (4,3), then next move right to (5,3).\n- But we need to ensure that after first move, the path is clear.\n- After moving to (4,3), the tail moves forward, so the body segments shift.\n- Next move to (5,3): \n  - Check body: original body was [(3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)]\n  - After moving head to (4,3), new body is [(4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)]\n    - Tail (6,1) is removed, new tail is (5,1).\n  - Next move to (5,3):\n    - Check body: (5,3) is not in the new body segments.\n    - No collision.\n    - Food is at (5,3), so we can eat it next turn if we move to (4,3) now.\n\nHowever, we're only deciding the immediate action at \\( t_0 \\). Moving right to (4,3) is safe and sets us up to eat (5,3) next turn.\n\n**Tail Reward Danger Check:**\n- For food at (5,3), is the head adjacent to the tail when eating?\n  - After moving to (4,3), tail is at (5,1).\n  - Distance from (4,3) to (5,1) is not adjacent (Manhattan distance is |4-5| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3).\n  - Next move to (5,3), new tail would be at (4,1) (since the snake grows by 1 after eating).\n  - Distance from (5,3) to (4,1) is |5-4| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3, still not adjacent.\n  - So no tail reward danger.\n\n### Other Considerations\n\n- Moving down to (3,2) is safe but doesn't lead to food immediately.\n- Moving right to (4,3) is safe and positions us to eat (5,3) next turn.\n- Moving left is unsafe due to body collision.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Right (R) to (4,3), setting up to eat the positive food at (5,3) on the next turn safely.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

(6,2) - value: +1, life_span: 3\n2. (6,3) - value: +1, life_span: 5\n3. (5,3) - value: +1, life_span: 8\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Right (R), the snake cannot immediately reverse to Left (L) (no instant reverse rule).\n\nSo, possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for collisions and food access.\n\n#### 1.

(5,3) is not in this list, so no body collision.\n- Food at (5,3): Yes, there's positive food with value +1.\n  - Check Tail Reward Danger: \n    - Current tail is at (5,1). Adjacent cells to tail: (4,1), (6,1), (5,0), (5,2). Head is moving to (5,3), which is not adjacent to tail. So no danger.\n  - Eating this food: \n    - Snake length increases by 1: new body will be [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), ..., (5,1), (5,3)]? Wait, no. The tail moves forward unless we eat food.\n    - Actually, when eating, the tail doesn't move, so the new segment is added where the head was, and the tail stays. So new body: [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), ..., (5,1)].\n\nThis seems safe and beneficial.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (4,4)\n- New head position: (4,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is wall, (4,4) is not a wall.\n  - Body segments: (4,4) is not in the body list.\n- Food: No food at (4,4).\n- This move is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (4,2)\n- New head position: (4,2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is wall, (4,2) is not a wall.\n  - Body segments: (4,2) is not in the body list.\n- Food: No food at (4,2).\n- This move is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nWe have three food items:\n1. (6,2) - life_span: 3\n2. (6,3) - life_span: 5\n3. (5,3) - life_span: 8\n\nThe closest is (5,3), which is directly to the right at (5,3). Moving right allows us to eat it immediately.\n\nOther foods:\n- (6,2): To reach this, we'd need to go right to (5,3), then down to (5,2), then right to (6,2). But life_span is 3, which means it disappears in 3 turns. After moving right to (5,3), it would have 2 turns left. Then moving down to (5,2), it would have 1 turn left. Then moving right to (6,2) would be just in time, but risky if timing is off.\n  \n- (6,3): Similar path, but life_span is 5, so more time.\n\nGiven that (5,3) is immediately accessible with no risk and good life_span, it's the best immediate choice.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger if we move right?\n- Next turn, if we're at (5,3), our options would be U, D, R (can't go left back to (4,3) because that's the reverse of right).\n  - U to (5,4): check for walls/body. Body will have moved: new body would be [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), ..., (4,1)], so (5,4) is safe.\n  - D to (5,2): safe, no body there.\n  - R to (6,3): food at (6,3), but need to check if tail is adjacent. Tail would be at (4,1), not adjacent to (6,3), so safe.\n\nNo immediate dangers detected.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nIf we eat (5,3), the snake grows longer, which might make future movements more constrained, but currently, it seems manageable.\n\nAlternative is to not eat now and explore, but given that (5,3) is safe and positive, it's better to eat it now to increase score and length.\n\n### Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves:\n- Right (R) to (5,3): eat positive food, safe, no immediate dangers.\n- Up (U) or Down (D): safe but no benefit this turn.\n\nThus, the best immediate action is to move Right to eat the food at (5,3).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Next, the tail will move to (4,1) as the head moves to (6,3) and the new tail is added at (6,3). So, no immediate collision with the new tail.\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move, can eat positive food.\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (5,4)**:\n   - **Position**: (5,4)\n   - **Food**: No food here.\n   - **Safety Check**:\n     - Is (5,4) in body segments? No.\n     - Wall collision: y=7 is the top wall, (5,4) is safe.\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe but no immediate reward.\n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (5,2)**:\n   - **Position**: (5,2)\n   - **Food**: No food here.\n   - **Safety Check**:\n     - Is (5,2) in body segments? No.\n     - Wall collision: y=0 is the bottom wall, (5,2) is safe.\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe but no immediate reward.\n\n### Comparing the Options\n\n- **Right (R)**: Immediate +1 score, safe.\n- **Up (U)**: No immediate gain, but opens up space.\n- **Down (D)**: No immediate gain, but moves towards (6,2) food next turn.\n\nGiven that the primary goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, moving Right to eat the food at (6,3) is the best immediate action.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nOne critical rule is the \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Current tail is at (5,1).\n- After moving Right to (6,3), the new tail will be at (6,3), and the old tail moves to (4,1).\n- The head at (6,3) is not adjacent to the new tail (which is also at (6,3) but that's the same cell, which is the head itself, but since it's the same cell, it's not adjacent. Actually, after eating, the tail grows, so the new tail is the previous last segment, which was (5,1), and now the new segment is added at (6,3), making the tail (5,1) still, but the segment before that is (4,1), etc.\n\nWait, let's clarify snake movement after eating:\n- Normally, when snake eats, it grows by one. So the tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added at the head's new position.\n- Original length: 11.\n- After eating: length 12.\n- Positions: new head at (6,3), then original body: (5,3), (4,3), ..., (5,1).\n- So new tail is still (5,1), but the segment before that is (4,1).\n- Head at (6,3) is not adjacent to (5,1) (distance is sqrt((6-5)^2 + (3-1)^2) = sqrt(1 + 4) = sqrt(5) > 1, so not adjacent).\n\nThus, no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Checking Other Food Items\n\nOther food items:\n- (6,2): life_span = 2. Next turn it will be 1, then disappear.\n- (1,5): life_span = 10, far away.\n\nMoving Right now allows us to eat (6,3), and next turn we can consider (6,2) if still available.\n\n### Potential Next Moves After Right\n\nAfter moving to (6,3):\n- Possible directions: R (but x=7 is wall), U, D.\n- U to (6,4): check for food - none.\n- D to (6,2): food with life_span 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten now).\n  \nBut since we're only deciding the current move, and moving Right is safe and beneficial, it's the best choice now.\n\n### Alternative Consideration: Moving Down to (5,2)\n\nIf we move Down to (5,2):\n- Next turn, can move Right to (6,2) to eat that food (life_span would be 1 then 0, so must eat next turn).\n- But then we miss the (6,3) food now, which is also positive.\n\nGiven that both (6,3) and (6,2) are positive, and (6,3) has higher life_span, it's better to eat (6,3) now and then see if (6,2) is still available next turn.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the best immediate action is to move Right to (6,3) to eat the positive food there, as it's safe and maximizes the current score.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game to understand the positions and constraints:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   \n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls. This means the snake cannot move outside the grid; it's bounded by these coordinates.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal obstacle at (3, 6). The snake cannot move into this cell.\n\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head. The current positions are:\n     - Head: (6, 3)\n     - Body: (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)\n   - **Length**: The snake has 12 segments (including the head).\n   - **Current Direction**: The head is moving Right (R), meaning it's facing towards increasing x-coordinate.\n\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are two food items:\n     - (6, 2): value = 1 (positive), life_span = 1\n     - (1, 5): value = 9 (positive), life_span = 1\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the snake is currently moving Right (R), it cannot instantly reverse to Left (L) in the next move. So, the possible immediate actions are U, D, or R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R):\n   - Current head position: (6, 3)\n   - New head position: (7, 3)\n   - Check:\n     - x=7 is a border wall → collision with wall → death.\n   - **Conclusion**: Invalid move (leads to death).\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U):\n   - Current head position: (6, 3)\n   - New head position: (6, 4)\n   - Check:\n     - Is (6, 4) a wall? No (walls are at y=0, y=7, x=0, x=7, and (3,6)).\n     - Is (6, 4) part of the snake's body? Let's see the body segments:\n       - (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)\n       - (6,4) is not in this list → no body collision.\n     - Is there food at (6,4)? No, food is at (6,2) and (1,5).\n   - **Outcome**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D):\n   - Current head position: (6, 3)\n   - New head position: (6, 2)\n   - Check:\n     - Is (6, 2) a wall? No.\n     - Is (6, 2) part of the snake's body? Checking the body segments:\n       - (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)\n       - (6,2) is not in this list → no body collision.\n     - Is there food at (6,2)? Yes, with value = 1, life_span = 1.\n       - To eat this food:\n         - The head moves to (6,2), which is currently not under the snake's body (since the snake's body doesn't include (6,2)).\n         - No need for the body to move away first in this case.\n         - After eating, the snake's length increases by 1, and the tail grows by one segment.\n         - Check for Tail Reward Danger:\n           - Current tail is at (5,1). The new tail after eating would be at (5,1) (since the tail doesn't move when the snake grows).\n           - Is the head adjacent to the tail after moving to (6,2)? \n             - Distance between (6,2) and (5,1): |6-5| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2 (not adjacent; adjacent would be distance 1).\n           - So, no immediate collision danger from the tail.\n   - **Outcome**: Safe move, eat positive food (+1 score, length increases to 13).\n\n#### 4. Move Left (L):\n   - Current direction is R, next move cannot be L (instant reverse).\n   - **Conclusion**: Invalid move.\n\n### Comparing Valid Moves: Up vs. Down\n\nWe have two valid moves: Up and Down.\n\n- **Move Up (U)**:\n  - Safe, no food eaten.\n  - Next head position: (6,4)\n  - Future considerations:\n    - From (6,4), possible moves would be U, R, or L (not D, as that would reverse).\n    - Moving U to (6,5) is safe (no walls or body).\n    - Moving R to (7,4) is wall collision.\n    - Moving L to (5,4) is safe (need to check body then).\n\n- **Move Down (D)**:\n  - Safe, eat positive food at (6,2).\n  - Score increases by 1, length to 13.\n  - Next head position: (6,2)\n  - Future considerations:\n    - From (6,2), possible moves would be D, R, or L (not U, as that would reverse).\n    - Moving D to (6,1):\n      - (6,1) is not a wall.\n      - Is (6,1) in body? Current body is (5,3),...,(5,1). After moving to (6,2) and eating, the new body is:\n        - New head: (6,2)\n        - Body: (6,3), (5,3), ..., (5,1)\n        - So (6,1) is not in body → safe.\n    - Moving R to (7,2) is wall collision.\n    - Moving L to (5,2):\n      - (5,2) is not in new body → safe.\n\nBetween U and D, moving Down allows us to eat positive food without immediate danger, increasing our score. Moving Up is safe but doesn't contribute to the score. Since the food at (6,2) has a life_span of 1, it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now. The other food at (1,5) is too far to consider for immediate action.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving Down?\n\n- After moving to (6,2), the new body will be:\n  - Head: (6,2)\n  - Body: (6,3), (5,3), ..., (5,1)\n- The tail is at (5,1). The distance between head (6,2) and tail (5,1) is 2, so no adjacency.\n- No walls or body collisions at (6,2).\n- The food is positive, so no penalty.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that moving Down allows us to safely eat positive food without any immediate risks and the food will disappear after this turn, it's the optimal immediate action.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (meaning the snake can't go beyond these coordinates).\n   - There's one internal obstacle at (3, 6).\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake's head is at (6, 2), moving Down (D).\n   - The body segments follow: [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)].\n   - So, the tail is at (5,1).\n\n3. **Food Information**:\n   - Only one food item: at (1,5) with value=1 and life_span=8.\n   - This is positive food (+1 score, increases length by 1).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving Down (D). The possible moves are:\n- Up (U): Opposite of current direction, so not allowed (no instant reverse).\n- Down (D): Continue moving down.\n- Left (L): Move left.\n- Right (R): Move right.\n\nSo, allowed moves: D, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D):\n   - Current head: (6,2). Down means (6,1).\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=0 is a wall, (6,1) is not a wall (y=1 is valid).\n     - Body: Check if (6,1) is in snake body.\n       - Snake body positions: from (6,3) to (5,1). (6,1) is not in the body.\n   - Next head position: (6,1).\n   - Is there food at (6,1)? No, only food is at (1,5).\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L):\n   - Current head: (6,2). Left means (5,2).\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: No walls at (5,2).\n     - Body: Is (5,2) in snake body?\n       - Snake body: (6,3), (5,3), ..., (5,1). (5,2) is not in the body.\n   - Next head position: (5,2).\n   - Food at (5,2)? No.\n   - Safe move, no reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R):\n   - Current head: (6,2). Right means (7,2).\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=7 is a border wall. So (7,2) is a wall. Can't move here.\n   - Invalid move.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\nFrom the above, only Down (D) and Left (L) are valid moves. Neither leads to immediate food consumption. So, we need to think about future moves and potential paths to the food at (1,5).\n\n#### Path to Food (1,5):\n\nCurrent head at (6,2), food at (1,5). We need to navigate towards the food while avoiding the body and walls.\n\nPossible path:\n- From (6,2), moving Left (L) to (5,2).\n- Then, possible moves from (5,2):\n  - Up (U) to (5,3): but (5,3) is in the body.\n  - Down (D) to (5,1): (5,1) is the tail. Moving here is safe because the tail will move away.\n  - Left (L) to (4,2).\n  \nMoving Left (L) now to (5,2) seems like a step towards the food, as it's moving in the negative x-direction towards x=1.\n\nAlternatively, moving Down (D) to (6,1) doesn't seem to help much in getting closer to (1,5).\n\n#### Checking for Immediate Dangers:\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving Left (L) to (5,2)?\n- No body collision.\n- No wall collision.\n- No food to eat that could cause issues (the only food is far away).\n\nSimilarly, moving Down (D) to (6,1) is safe but doesn't progress towards the food.\n\n#### Considering Future Moves:\n\nIf we move Left (L) to (5,2), next possible moves could be Left again to (4,2), then (3,2), etc., moving towards the food's x-coordinate.\n\nMoving Down (D) would take us to (6,1), and then we'd have to move Left multiple times to reach the food's x-coordinate, which might be less efficient.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween the two safe moves (D and L), moving Left (L) seems more strategic as it starts moving the snake towards the food at (1,5). Moving Down (D) doesn't contribute to reaching the food and might just delay the process.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule states that if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake. \n\nIn our case:\n- Tail is at (5,1).\n- Adjacent to tail: (4,1), (5,2), (6,1), (5,0) [but y=0 is a wall].\n- Head is at (6,2), which is not adjacent to (5,1) (adjacent would be one cell away in any direction).\n- So, no immediate danger from this rule.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Left (L) to (5,2), as it's safe and starts moving the snake towards the positive food at (1,5).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

So the snake was moving Right to reach (6,2), then turned Left to (5,2). \n\nBut the list shows [(5,2), (6,2), ...], which implies the head is at (5,2), next is (6,2), meaning the head just moved from (6,2) to (5,2), so current direction is Left (from (6,2) to (5,2)).\n\nWait, the \"Snake Head Direction\" is given as L, which is the current direction the head is moving in. So the head is at (5,2), moving Left, meaning it came from (6,2).\n\nSo the snake's movement was:\n... -> (6,2) -> (5,2) -> ?\n\nNext move is from (5,2) in direction L, but since it's already moving L, the next position would be (4,2), unless we change direction.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom current head at (5,2), moving Left (L), possible next moves are:\n\n1. Continue Left (L): (4,2)\n   - Check if (4,2) is occupied by body or wall.\n   - Body positions: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1)\n   - (4,2) is not in the body list.\n   - Walls: x=0 is a wall, but (4,2) is x=4, not a wall.\n   - Internal obstacle: (3,6) - not affecting (4,2).\n   - So (4,2) is safe.\n\n2. Turn Up (U): (5,3)\n   - (5,3) is in the body list (4th segment).\n   - So moving Up would collide with body - deadly.\n\n3. Turn Down (D): (5,1)\n   - Check if (5,1) is in body or wall.\n   - Body: not listed.\n   - Walls: y=0 is wall, (5,1) is y=1 - not a wall.\n   - Safe.\n\n4. Cannot reverse to Right (R) because that's opposite of current Left (L), which is not allowed.\n\nSo possible safe moves: Left (L) to (4,2), Down (D) to (5,1).\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food is adjacent to the head at (5,2):\n\nAdjacent cells to (5,2):\n- Left (L): (4,2)\n- Up (U): (5,3) - body, can't go there\n- Down (D): (5,1)\n- Right (R): (6,2) - but can't reverse\n\nFood positions:\n1. (1,5) - not adjacent to (5,2)\n2. (1,1) - not adjacent to (5,2)\n\nNo adjacent food, so no immediate food to eat in the next move.\n\n### Checking Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe tail is the last segment: (4,1). \n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail?\nHead at (5,2), tail at (4,1). \nAdjacent means one cell apart in any direction, including diagonally.\nDistance: |5-4| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2 (Manhattan distance). \nAdjacent is distance 1, so no, tail is not adjacent to head.\n\nAlso, even if it were, the tail cell (4,1) doesn't have food on it (food is at (1,5) and (1,1)), so no danger there.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nPossible safe moves: Left (L) to (4,2), Down (D) to (5,1).\n\nWhich is better?\n\nLooking at the food:\n- (1,5): to reach it, need to go left and up.\n- (1,1): to reach it, need to go left and down.\n\nCurrently at (5,2). \n\nOption 1: Left to (4,2)\n- Then can go Left to (3,2), then down to (3,1), then left to (2,1), then left to (1,1) to reach food at (1,1).\n- Or from (4,2), up to (4,3), but (4,3) is body, so can't go up immediately after.\n\nOption 2: Down to (5,1)\n- Then can go Left to (4,1), which is the tail, but tail will move away, so safe.\n- Then left to (3,1), then left to (2,1), then left to (1,1) to reach food at (1,1).\n\nBoth options can eventually lead to food at (1,1), but going Left first seems more direct because from (4,2), can go left to (3,2), then down to (3,1), etc.\n\nGoing Down first would require more turns to reach the same food.\n\nAlso, the food at (1,5) is further and may not be worth it right now.\n\n### Avoiding Future Collisions\n\nLooking at the body, if we go Left to (4,2), then next move could be Left to (3,2), which is safe (not in body). Then down to (3,1), which is body, but it's the tail which will move, so safe.\n\nAlternatively, if we go Down to (5,1), then Left to (4,1), which is tail - safe, then Left to (3,1), which is body but tail will move, etc.\n\nBoth seem safe, but Left seems more straightforward.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Benefits\n\nNo food is immediately accessible, so the choice is about positioning for future food.\n\nLeft seems better to start moving towards the food at (1,1).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all options, the safest and most strategic move is to continue Left to (4,2).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Here's the sequence:\n   - Head: (4, 2)\n   - Body: (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1)\n   - Total length: 13 segments.\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Left (L), meaning the last move was from (5,2) to (4,2).\n5. **Food**:\n   - (1, 5): value = +1, life_span = 6\n   - (1, 1): value = +1, life_span = 9\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is Left (L), the snake cannot immediately move Right (R) in the next turn.\n   - So, possible moves: U, D, L\n\n2. **Wall and Obstacle Collision**: The snake cannot move into a wall or an obstacle.\n   - Current head position: (4, 2)\n   - Possible moves from (4,2):\n     - U: (4, 3) — Check if this is a wall or part of the snake's body.\n     - D: (4, 1) — Check.\n     - L: (3, 2) — Check.\n     - R: (5, 2) — Not allowed (instant reverse).\n\nLet's check each possible move:\n\n#### Move Up (U) to (4, 3)\n- (4,3) is part of the snake's body (specifically, the 6th segment in the list: (4,3)).\n- Moving into your own body is deadly unless it's the tail, and the tail will move away.\n- The tail is at (3,1). The segment at (4,3) is not the tail, so this would be a collision.\n- **Result**: Deadly collision. Cannot move Up.\n\n#### Move Down (D) to (4, 1)\n- Check if (4,1) is a wall or body:\n  - Walls: y=0 is a wall, but y=1 is not a border wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: (3,6) — not (4,1).\n  - Snake body: Looking at the list, (2,1) and (3,1) are parts of the body, but not (4,1).\n- **Valid move**: No collision.\n- Now, check if there's food at (4,1):\n  - Food positions: (1,5) and (1,1) — no food at (4,1).\n  - So, this is just a move without eating.\n\n#### Move Left (L) to (3, 2)\n- Check (3,2):\n  - Walls: x=0 is a wall, but x=3 is not.\n  - Internal obstacles: (3,6) — not (3,2).\n  - Snake body: Looking at the list, (3,3), (3,4), (3,1) are parts, but not (3,2).\n- **Valid move**: No collision.\n- Check for food at (3,2):\n  - No food at (3,2).\n  - Just a move without eating.\n\n#### Move Right (R) to (5, 2)\n- Not allowed because it's the opposite of the current direction (L).\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions to see if moving towards them is beneficial.\n\n1. **Food at (1,5)**:\n   - Value: +1\n   - Life span: 6\n   - Distance from head (4,2):\n     - Horizontal: |4-1| = 3\n     - Vertical: |2-5| = 3\n     - Total Manhattan distance: 6\n   - Given the life span is 6, and the distance is 6, it's possible to reach it just before it disappears if we move directly towards it every turn.\n   - Path: Need to decrease both x and y. Current direction is L, so moving L decreases x, but we also need to increase y (since 2 to 5 is upwards).\n   - Next move towards (1,5): Ideally, we'd want to move Up (U) to increase y, but U is deadly as we saw.\n   - Alternative is to move Left (L) to (3,2), then possibly Up next turn if possible.\n\n2. **Food at (1,1)**:\n   - Value: +1\n   - Life span: 9\n   - Distance from head (4,2):\n     - Horizontal: |4-1| = 3\n     - Vertical: |2-1| = 1\n     - Total distance: 4\n   - With life span 9, easily reachable.\n   - Path: Need to decrease x and y.\n   - Next move towards (1,1): Down (D) to (4,1) gets us closer in y, then Left next turns.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe need to check if moving to a cell adjacent to the tail could lead to eating positive food that would cause the head and new tail to collide.\n\n- Current tail is at (3,1).\n- Adjacent to tail: (2,1), (3,0), (4,1), (3,2)\n   - (2,1) and (3,1) are already part of the snake.\n   - (3,0) is a wall (y=0).\n   - (4,1) and (3,2) are possible.\n- Food at (1,1) is near the tail's adjacent cell (2,1), but not directly adjacent to the tail's current position.\n- So, no immediate danger from this rule in the next move.\n\n### Decision Between D and L\n\nFrom the possible safe moves, we have:\n- D: (4,1)\n- L: (3,2)\n\nWhich is better?\n\n**Option 1: Down to (4,1)**\n- Moves towards food at (1,1) by decreasing y.\n- Next moves could be Left towards (1,1).\n- Doesn't help with (1,5) immediately.\n\n**Option 2: Left to (3,2)**\n- Moves towards both foods in x direction.\n- Next move could be Up towards (1,5) if possible, but currently Up is blocked by body.\n   - After moving to (3,2), the body will have moved, so (4,3) might no longer be part of the body, allowing Up next turn.\n   - Let's simulate the body movement:\n     - Current body: [(4,2), (5,2), ..., (3,1)]\n     - After moving head to (3,2), the tail (3,1) will move away (to (2,1)? Wait, no: the tail is the last segment, so the new tail will be the second last segment after the head moves.\n     - Actually, the entire body shifts: the segment after the head moves to the head's old position, and so on, with the tail segment being removed unless we eat food.\n     - Since we're not eating, the tail (last segment) is removed.\n     - New body after moving to (3,2):\n       - Head: (3,2)\n       - Body: [(4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1)]\n       - So, (4,3) is still in the body, so Up to (3,3) would collide with (3,3) in the body next turn.\n   - So, next turn after L, Up would still be deadly.\n   - Alternatively, could go Left again to (2,2), but that's part of the body (currently at (2,2) in the list, but after moving, (2,2) would be the new position after (2,1) moves to where (2,2) was, etc. — seems complex.\n   - Maybe Left isn't the best immediate move.\n\n**Re-evaluating Down to (4,1)**:\n- Moves towards (1,1).\n- Next turn, from (4,1), possible moves:\n   - Current direction would be D, so cannot move U (instant reverse).\n   - Possible: D (to (4,0) — but y=0 is a wall. Dead.\n   - L: to (3,1) — check if part of body.\n     - After moving to (4,1), body is [(4,2), (5,2), ..., (2,1)], so (3,1) is in the body (originally (3,1) is the tail, but after moving, the new tail is (2,1), so (3,1) is now the second last segment.\n     - So, moving to (3,1) would collide with body.\n   - R: to (5,1) — not part of body, not a wall.\n     - So, next move could be R to (5,1).\n   - Then from (5,1), can move towards (1,1) by going Left.\n\nThis seems more promising for reaching (1,1).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBetween the two safe immediate moves (Down and Left), moving Down to (4,1) seems better because:\n- It moves towards the food at (1,1), which is closer and has a longer life span.\n- The path seems more straightforward: Down to (4,1), then Right to (5,1), then Left towards (1,1).\n- Moving Left doesn't immediately help with reaching either food and may complicate future moves.\n\n**Final Decision**: Move Down (D).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Grid Layout:**\n- The grid is an 8x8 grid (since borders are at x=0/x=7 and y=0/y=7).\n- There's one internal obstacle at (3, 6).\n\n**2.

This means the snake was moving downward in the previous turn (from (4,2) to (4,1)).\n\n**3. Food:**\n- Two food items:\n  1. (1,5): value = +1, life_span = 5\n  2.

Actually, the tail moves forward based on the body's path, but since we're not eating, the length stays the same, and the tail moves away from (2,1) to (2,2).\n  \n  Wait, let's think about the tail movement:\n  - Current tail is at (2,1), connected to (2,2).\n  - After moving head left to (3,1), the segment at (4,1) becomes the new second segment.\n  - The tail was at (2,1), connected to (2,2). The tail moves to (2,2), and (2,1) is no longer part of the snake.\n  \n  So no collision with body.\n\n**Option 2: Right (R) to (5,1)**\n- Check if (5,1) is occupied by the snake's body:\n  - Body segments: (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), etc. (5,1) is not in the body.\n- Check for walls: (5,1) is not a wall.\n- Check for food: No food at (5,1).\n- After moving right:\n  - New head: (5,1)\n  - Tail moves forward similarly, no collision.\n\nBoth L and R seem safe in terms of not colliding with the body or walls.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see if either move can lead us toward food in the future.\n\n**Food at (1,5):**\n- Current head at (4,1), food at (1,5).\n- Distance is |4-1| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7.\n- Life span is 5, so it will disappear in 5 turns (including current turn), so it's not reachable in time (minimum steps needed is 7 > 5).\n\n**Food at (1,1):**\n- Current head at (4,1), food at (1,1).\n- Distance is |4-1| + |1-1| = 3 + 0 = 3.\n- Life span is 8, so it will disappear in 8 turns (including current), so it's reachable.\n  \nPath to (1,1):\nFrom (4,1), need to move left three times: (3,1), (2,1), (1,1).\n\nBut:\n- Current direction is D, so next move can be L or R.\n- If we choose L now to (3,1), then next turn direction is L, can continue L to (2,1), then L to (1,1).\n  \nHowever, we need to check if moving to (2,1) is safe:\n- After moving to (3,1), next turn head is at (3,1), direction L.\n- Then move L to (2,1):\n  - Is (2,1) occupied by body? Current body after first move:\n    - New snake: [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2), ... up to (2,2)]\n    - Tail is at (2,2).\n    - (2,1) is not in the body (since tail moved from (2,1) to (2,2)).\n  - So moving to (2,1) is safe.\n- Then move L to (1,1):\n  - Snake would be [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), ...]\n  - Check if (1,1) is under body: no, since body is at (2,1), etc., not (1,1).\n  - So can eat the food at (1,1).\n\nBut wait! There's a special rule:\n**Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nAt the point when we're at (2,1) and want to move to (1,1):\n- Tail is at (..., (2,2)), so (2,1) is adjacent to tail (since (2,1) is adjacent to (2,2)).\n- Is there food at the tail cell (2,2)? Currently, no food is listed at (2,2), only at (1,5) and (1,1).\n- So no danger from tail reward.\n\nBut actually, the food is at (1,1), not at the tail's position, so this rule doesn't apply here.\n\nTherefore, moving left three times is safe and leads to eating the food at (1,1).\n\n**Alternative if we choose R now:**\nMove R to (5,1), then next moves would have to go left to reach (1,1), which is longer and might not reach in time.\n\n### Checking Immediate Food Under Head or Adjacent\n\nIs there food adjacent to the head now?\n- Head at (4,1).\n- Adjacent cells:\n  - U: (4,2) - part of snake's body (second segment).\n  - D: (4,0) - wall.\n  - L: (3,1) - no food.\n  - R: (5,1) - no food.\n  \nNo immediate food to eat, so no risk of eating food under body or tail reward danger now.\n\n### Decision\n\nBest immediate action is to start moving towards the reachable food at (1,1), which requires moving Left (L) now.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Dangers with L\n\nMoving L to (3,1):\n- Not a wall.\n- Not part of body.\n- Not a food cell, so no eating.\n- Next turn can move L again towards food.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Move Up (U) to (3, 2)\n\n- Check (3, 2):\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Not an obstacle.\n  - Is it part of the snake's body?\n    - Looking at body segments: (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), etc. — (3,2) is not listed, so safe.\n  \n- Food at (3, 2)? No, food is at (1,5), (1,1), (1,4).\n  \n- After moving up:\n  - New head: (3, 2)\n  - Tail is at (2, 2), which is adjacent to head at (3,2). Is there food at tail?\n    - Tail at (2,2), no food there, so no danger.\n  \n- Check for body collision:\n  - Next body segment is (3,1), which is not (3,2).\n  - Other body parts are not at (3,2).\n  \n- Safe move.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (3, 0)\n\n- Check (3, 0):\n  - y=0 is a border wall. So this is a wall collision — deadly. Cannot move here.\n\n### Comparing Left (L) and Up (U)\n\nBoth left and up seem safe. Now, let's see which one is better in terms of accessing food or future moves.\n\n1. **Move Left to (2, 1)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (2,1):\n     - Current direction is L, so can't move R (instant reverse).\n     - Can move L (1,1), U (2,2), D (2,0).\n     - (1,1) has food (value=1, life_span=7).\n     - (2,2) is the tail — moving there is safe unless tail has food (it doesn't).\n     - (2,0) is a wall.\n   \n   - Moving left now sets up to possibly move to (1,1) next turn to eat food.\n\n2. **Move Up to (3, 2)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (3,2):\n     - Current direction would be U, so can't move D.\n     - Can move U (3,3), L (2,2), R (4,2).\n     - (3,3) is part of the body — collision.\n     - (2,2) is tail — safe.\n     - (4,2) is part of the body — collision.\n   \n   - Only safe move next would be to tail at (2,2), which doesn't lead to food directly.\n\nBetween the two, moving left seems better because it allows us to potentially reach food at (1,1) next turn, whereas moving up leads to a dead end next turn where the only safe move is to the tail.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nIs there any food adjacent to the current head (3,1)?\n\nAdjacent cells:\n- Left (2,1): no food.\n- Up (3,2): no food.\n- Down (3,0): wall.\n\nNo immediate food to eat, so the choice is based on future possibilities.\n\n### Avoiding Dead Ends\n\nMoving up leads to a position where next turn only one move is possible (to tail), which isn't productive. Moving left gives more options next turn.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\nIs there any risk in moving left to (2,1)?\n\n- Adjacent to tail at (2,2), but no food there, so no \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n- No immediate collision.\n- Not moving towards any walls or obstacles.\n\nSeems safe.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move **Left (L)**, setting up the possibility to reach the food at (1,1) in the next turn.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

The head is at (2, 1), and the body segments follow until the tail at (2, 3).\n   - Current Direction: The head is moving Left (L).\n4. **Food**:\n   - Three pieces of food are present:\n     - (1, 5): value = 1, life_span = 3\n     - (1, 1): value = 1, life_span = 6\n     - (1, 4): value = 1, life_span = 9\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nTo better understand, let's visualize the snake's body and the food positions:\n\n- **Snake Body**:\n  - Head: (2, 1)\n  - Body: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3)\n  \n  Plotting these, the snake is quite long and seems to be in a coiled position, possibly having made several turns.\n\n- **Food Positions**:\n  - (1,5): This is to the left (x decreases) and up (y increases) from the head.\n  - (1,1): Directly to the left of the head (same y, x decreases).\n  - (1,4): To the left and up from the head, but closer than (1,5).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving Left (L). The possible moves from the head at (2,1) are:\n\n1. **Left (L)**: (1,1) - There's food here with value 1.\n2. **Up (U)**: (2,2) - Need to check if this is safe.\n3. **Down (D)**: (2,0) - This is y=0, which is a wall. So, invalid.\n\nCannot move Right (R) because that's the opposite of current direction (Left), which is not allowed.\n\nSo, possible immediate actions: Left or Up.\n\n### Evaluating Left (L) to (1,1)\n\n- **Food**: There is positive food at (1,1) with value 1.\n- **Safety Check**:\n  - Moving to (1,1): \n    - Is (1,1) a wall? x=1 is not a border wall, and there's no internal wall at (1,1). So, not a wall.\n    - Is (1,1) part of the snake's body? Checking the snake positions: (2,1), (3,1), ..., (2,3). (1,1) is not in the list. So, no body collision.\n    - **Tail Reward Danger**: After eating, the snake's length increases by 1, and the tail doesn't move. The new tail would be the current tail (2,3). The new head is at (1,1). Is (2,3) adjacent to (1,1)?\n      - Adjacent means same x and y differs by 1 or same y and x differs by 1.\n      - (1,1) and (2,3): x differs by 1, y differs by 2 → not adjacent. So, no danger.\n  - **Conclusion**: Safe to move Left and eat the food.\n\n### Evaluating Up (U) to (2,2)\n\n- **Food**: No food at (2,2).\n- **Safety Check**:\n  - Is (2,2) a wall? No.\n  - Is (2,2) part of the snake's body? Checking the list: (2,1), (3,1), ..., (2,3). (2,2) is not in the list. So, no body collision.\n  - No tail reward danger since no food is eaten.\n  - **Conclusion**: Safe to move Up, but no immediate reward.\n\n### Comparing Left and Up\n\n- **Left (L)**:\n  - Pros: Immediate reward (+1), increases length.\n  - Cons: None in this scenario; it's safe.\n  \n- **Up (U)**:\n  - Pros: Keeps options open, no immediate risk.\n  - Cons: No immediate reward.\n\nGiven that moving Left is safe and provides an immediate reward, it seems like the better choice.\n\n### Checking for Other Considerations\n\n- **Food Lifespan**:\n  - (1,5): life_span = 3 (will disappear in 3 turns)\n  - (1,1): life_span = 6\n  - (1,4): life_span = 9\n  - The food at (1,1) has a longer lifespan, so no urgency to eat it now, but since it's directly accessible and safe, it's a good opportunity.\n\n- **Future Moves**:\n  - After moving Left to (1,1), the next head position is (1,1), direction Left.\n    - Possible next moves: Left (but x=0 is a wall), Up (to (1,2)), Down (to (1,0) which is a wall).\n    - So, next move would likely be Up to (1,2), which seems safe based on current snake body.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- **After Eating at (1,1)**:\n  - New snake: head at (1,1), body starts with (2,1), ..., tail at (2,3).\n  - Next move Up to (1,2): \n    - Check if (1,2) is safe: not in current body (but body will move; need to see if any part occupies (1,2) after move).\n    - Current body after moving left: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), ..., (2,3). (1,2) is not in this list, so safe.\n  \nNo immediate risks detected.\n\n### Alternative Paths\n\nIs there a better sequence than moving Left now? \n\n- If we move Up to (2,2), then possible next moves:\n  - Left to (1,2): food at (1,4) is up, but not directly accessible.\n  - Right to (3,2): but current body is at (3,1), (4,1), etc., so (3,2) is safe.\n  - Up to (2,3): current tail is at (2,3), but tail will move, so (2,3) becomes (3,3), so (2,3) is safe unless new tail is adjacent after growth, but no food is eaten here.\n\nThis path seems less rewarding immediately and may complicate future moves.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMoving Left to (1,1) is safe, provides an immediate reward, and doesn't pose any immediate or obvious future risks. The other options either don't provide rewards or are less optimal.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

This means the snake cannot move outside the grid bounded by x=1 to 6 and y=1 to 6.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (3, 6). The snake cannot move into this cell.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head to the tail. The head is at (1, 1), and the tail is at (2, 3).\n   - **Direction**: The snake is currently moving left (\"L\"), meaning its last move was from (2,1) to (1,1).\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are two pieces of food:\n     - (1, 5): value = 1, life_span = 2\n     - (1, 4): value = 1, life_span = 8\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake's body to understand its shape and possible movements.\n\n**Snake Body Segments**:\n1. Head: (1,1)\n2. (2,1)\n3. (3,1)\n4. (4,1)\n5. (4,2)\n6. (5,2)\n7. (6,2)\n8. (6,3)\n9. (5,3)\n10. (4,3)\n11. (3,3)\n12. (3,4)\n13. (2,4)\n14. Tail: (2,3)\n\n**Food Positions**:\n- (1,5): This is above the head (since y increases upwards).\n- (1,4): Also above the head, closer than (1,5).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving left (\"L\"). The possible moves from the head at (1,1) are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (1,1) → (1,2)\n   - Check if (1,2) is a wall or part of the snake's body.\n   - Walls: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. (1,2) is within bounds.\n   - Snake body: Check if (1,2) is in the snake's positions. From the list, it's not.\n   - Valid move.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (1,1) → (1,0)\n   - y=0 is a border wall. Invalid move.\n\n3. **Left (L)**: (1,1) → (0,1)\n   - x=0 is a border wall. Invalid move.\n\n4. **Right (R)**: (1,1) → (2,1)\n   - (2,1) is the second segment of the snake's body. Moving here would cause a collision with the body (since the body doesn't move until after the head moves). Invalid move.\n\n**Valid Moves**: Only Up (\"U\") is valid.\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving up leads to any food or has any risks.\n\n- Moving Up to (1,2):\n  - Is there food at (1,2)? No.\n  - Next possible moves from (1,2) would be U, L, R (can't reverse to D immediately).\n  \nHowever, we're only deciding the immediate next move, so we don't need to look further ahead unless considering future implications.\n\n### Considering the Food\n\nThe two food items are at (1,5) and (1,4). To reach them:\n\n- (1,4): Need to move up three times from (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (1,4).\n- (1,5): One more move up to (1,5).\n\nBut the life_span of (1,5) is 2, meaning it will disappear after 2 more turns (including the current one). So if we don't reach it by turn 61, it's gone.\n\nGiven that, moving up now (to (1,2)) is a step towards the food, but we won't reach (1,5) in time unless we move up consecutively, which may not be safe without knowing future body positions.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about tail reward danger: if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrently, the tail is at (2,3). Adjacent cells to the tail are:\n- (1,3), (3,3), (2,2), (2,4).\n\nOur head is at (1,1), not adjacent to the tail. So this rule doesn't affect us now.\n\n### Immediate Decision\n\nGiven that only \"U\" is a valid move, and moving up doesn't immediately lead to food or danger, the only possible action is to move up.\n\nHowever, let's double-check if moving up could lead to a trap or future collision:\n\nAfter moving to (1,2), the snake's new positions would be:\n- Head: (1,2)\n- Body: (1,1), (2,1), ..., (2,3)\n\nFrom (1,2), possible next moves would be U, L, R (not D due to no instant reverse). \n\n- U to (1,3): \n  - Check if (1,3) is free: Not in current body segments. \n- L to (0,2): Wall.\n- R to (2,2): \n  - (2,2) is not in current body segments (but after moving, the body will have shifted; need to see if it's occupied then).\n\nThis seems safe for now.\n\n### Alternative Consideration\n\nIs there any way to not move up? Since only \"U\" is valid, no. But let's confirm that \"R\" is indeed invalid because moving to (2,1) would collide with the body segment at (2,1).\n\nSimilarly, \"D\" and \"L\" are walls.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe and valid move is \"U\".\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Not immediately accessible.\n  - (1, 4): One cell above (1, 3), which is the next cell if moving Up.\n  - (2, 2): Adjacent to the right of the head; contains high-value food (10).\n\n### Possible Moves and Their Implications\n\nGiven the current direction is Up (U), the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Continue Up (U)**:\n   - Next position: (1, 3)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Is (1, 3) in the snake's body? Looking at the body segments: No.\n     - Is (1, 3) a wall? No.\n   - After moving to (1, 3), the next possible moves would be U, L, or R (cannot reverse to D).\n   - The food at (1, 4) is one step ahead. If we move U now, next turn we can move U to (1, 4) to eat the food (value 7).\n   - However, the food at (2, 2) is to the right with a higher value (10). Missing this might not be optimal.\n\n2. **Turn Right (R)**:\n   - Next position: (2, 2)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Is (2, 2) in the snake's body? Looking at the body: No.\n     - Is (2, 2) a wall? No.\n   - (2, 2) has food with value 10. Eating this would be highly beneficial.\n   - After moving to (2, 2), the direction is R. Next possible moves would be U, D, or R (cannot reverse to L).\n   - Need to ensure that after eating, the new tail doesn't cause a collision. Currently, the tail is at (2, 4). Eating at (2, 2) would add a new segment at the head, and the tail would move forward, so no immediate collision.\n\n3. **Turn Left (L)**:\n   - Next position: (0, 2) — This is a wall (x=0). Cannot move here.\n\n4. **Down (D)**:\n   - Next position: (1, 1) — This is the first body segment. Moving here would cause a collision. Also, it's opposite to current direction U, which is not allowed.\n\n### Evaluating the Best Move\n\nBetween the feasible moves (U and R):\n\n- **Move Right (R)**:\n  - Immediate reward: +10 (high value).\n  - Next position: (2, 2), direction R.\n  - After eating, the snake grows, and the tail moves from (2, 4) to (3, 4).\n  - No immediate danger from the new tail position.\n\n- **Move Up (U)**:\n  - Next position: (1, 3), no immediate reward.\n  - Next turn, can move U to (1, 4) for +7.\n  - However, the food at (2, 2) is more valuable and can be eaten now.\n\n**Potential Risks**:\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: After eating at (2, 2), the new tail is at (3, 4). The head is at (2, 2). The distance is more than adjacent, so no immediate danger.\n  \n- **Future Moves**:\n  - After R to (2, 2), next moves can be U, D, or R.\n    - U: (2, 3) — check if it's free.\n    - D: (2, 1) — part of the body (from current state: (2,1) is the third segment). Cannot move here.\n    - R: (3, 2) — check if it's free. Currently, (3,1) and (3,3) are body segments, but (3,2) is not listed, so likely free unless it's a wall. x=3 is not a wall except for y=6.\n\n### Checking Future Moves After R\n\nAssuming we move R to (2, 2):\n\n- New snake positions: [(2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), ..., (2, 4)]\n- Next possible moves from (2, 2), direction R:\n  - U: (2, 3) — not in body, not a wall.\n  - D: (2, 1) — in body (third segment). Cannot.\n  - R: (3, 2) — not in body, not a wall (internal obstacle is at (3,6)).\n\nSo, after R, we can choose U or R next turn.\n\n### Comparing with Move U\n\nIf we move U to (1, 3):\n\n- Next turn, can move U to (1, 4) for +7.\n- Then, the snake grows, and the tail moves.\n- But we miss the +10 at (2, 2), which is more valuable.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that the food at (2, 2) is more valuable (+10) and can be safely eaten now, it's better to prioritize this over the +7 at (1, 4). Moving Up would delay and might not guarantee getting the higher value food later.\n\n### Verifying Safety\n\nAfter moving R to (2, 2):\n\n- New head: (2, 2)\n- New body: [(1, 2), (1, 1), ..., (2, 4)]\n- Tail is at (2, 4), which is not adjacent to (2, 2). So no immediate collision from the tail.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move **Right (R)** to eat the high-value food at (2, 2).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Move Right (R) to (3,2)\n- Check if (3,2) is occupied by the snake's body:\n  - Snake body positions: [(1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4)]\n  - (3,2) is not in this list, so no body collision.\n- Check if (3,2) is a wall:\n  - Walls are at borders (x=0,7; y=0,7) and internal (3,6).\n  - (3,2) is not a wall.\n- Is there food at (3,2)? No, only food is at (1,4).\n- After moving, the tail will move from (2,4) to (1,4) (assuming the snake doesn't eat food this turn).\n- However, the food is at (1,4), which is where the tail is moving to. But since the head is not moving to (1,4), this isn't a \"Tail Reward Danger\" scenario.\n  \nThis move seems safe.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (2,3)\n- Check if (2,3) is occupied by the snake's body:\n  - Not in the body list.\n- Check if (2,3) is a wall:\n  - No.\n- Food at (2,3)? No.\n  \nThis move also seems safe.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (2,1)\n- Check if (2,1) is occupied by the snake's body:\n  - (2,1) is in the body list (4th segment).\n  - Moving here would collide with the body.\n  \nThis move is deadly.\n\n### Evaluating Safe Moves: Right (R) vs. Up (U)\n\nBoth R and U are safe moves. Now, let's see which one is better strategically, considering the food at (1,4).\n\n- **Food at (1,4)**:\n  - Currently, the tail is at (2,4), which is adjacent to the head at (2,2) (they share the same x-coordinate, y differs by 2, so not directly adjacent).\n  - The tail is moving towards (1,4) next turn (assuming the snake doesn't eat food now).\n  - If we move Up (U) to (2,3), next possible moves would be to approach (1,4) from above, but that might take longer.\n  - If we move Right (R) to (3,2), we can then consider moving up or right in subsequent turns to approach (1,4) from the right side.\n\nHowever, moving Right (R) to (3,2) seems to be moving away from the food at (1,4), which is not ideal since we want to maximize score by eating positive food.\n\nAlternatively, moving Up (U) to (2,3) brings us closer to the y-coordinate of the food (y=4), but we're still at x=2 while food is at x=1. From (2,3), next moves could be Left (L) to (1,3), then Up (U) to (1,4) to eat the food.\n\nBut we need to ensure that when we reach (1,4), the tail is not adjacent to the head to avoid \"Tail Reward Danger\". Currently, the tail is at (2,4), and if the head moves to (1,4), the tail would be at (1,4) after growing (since eating food increases length), but the old tail would have moved to (1,4) as well, causing a collision. Wait, no:\n\nActually, the \"Tail Reward Danger\" occurs if:\n- The head is adjacent to the tail, and\n- The tail cell has positive food, and\n- The head moves onto that food cell.\n\nCurrently, the tail is at (2,4), and the head is at (2,2). They are not adjacent (adjacent would be same x and y differs by 1, or same y and x differs by 1). Here, x is same (2), y differs by 2, so not adjacent.\n\nSo moving to (1,4) to eat the food is safe as long as the head is not adjacent to the tail at that time.\n\nBut to reach (1,4), the sequence would be:\n- Now: head at (2,2), move U to (2,3)\n- Next: head at (2,3), move L to (1,3)\n- Then: head at (1,3), move U to (1,4) to eat.\n\nAt that point, the tail would be somewhere along the body. We'd need to ensure that when head is at (1,4), tail is not at (1,3) or (2,4) (adjacent positions). Given the current body length is 15, it's hard to track, but likely safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving Right now might not help in reaching the food quickly.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that the food is at (1,4) with a limited lifespan (7 turns), and moving Up (U) to (2,3) is a step towards reaching it, while moving Right (R) is safe but doesn't help in getting the food soon, the better immediate action is to move Up.\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\n\\boxed{U}",

To eat this food:\n- The snake's head needs to move to (1, 4).\n- Currently, the head is at (2, 3). To reach (1, 4), the sequence would be:\n  - First move Left to (1, 3), then Up to (1, 4) next turn.\n  - Or first move Up to (2, 4), then Left to (1, 4) next turn.\n\nBut we're only deciding the immediate next move at turn \\( t_0 \\). \n\nLooking at the current possible moves:\n- Moving Left to (1, 3) is safe and positions the head one step closer to the food at (1, 4).\n- Moving Up to (2, 4) is also safe but doesn't directly help in reaching the food unless we plan to go Left next turn.\n\n### Checking for \"Tail Reward Danger\"\n\nThe food is at (1, 4). The tail is at (3, 4). \n- The head is at (2, 3). After moving Left to (1, 3), the next move would be Up to (1, 4) to eat the food.\n- At that point, the tail would have moved from (3, 4) to (3, 5) (assuming the snake's body moves forward as the head moves).\n- The new tail would be at (3, 5), and the head at (1, 4), which are not adjacent (distance is more than 1), so no immediate collision.\n- Therefore, eating the food at (1, 4) does not pose a \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n\n### Deciding the Best Immediate Move\n\nGiven the options:\n1. Up to (2, 4): Safe, no immediate benefit.\n2. Left to (1, 3): Safe, positions to potentially eat the food next turn.\n3. Right to (3, 3): Unsafe (collision).\n\nThe best immediate move is **Left (L) to (1, 3)**, as it positions the snake to potentially eat the positive food at (1, 4) in the next turn, which is safe and beneficial.\n\n### Verifying Future Steps\n\nAfter moving Left to (1, 3):\n- Next turn, the snake's head is at (1, 3), direction is Left (since we moved Left).\n- Possible moves from (1, 3) facing Left:\n  - Left (L): (0, 3) - wall (x=0), invalid.\n  - Up (U): (1, 4) - food is here.\n  - Down (D): (1, 2) - opposite of current direction (Left), invalid (cannot reverse from Left to Right).\n- So, the only valid move is Up to (1, 4), which is the food.\n- Eating the food at (1, 4) is safe as previously determined.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe immediate best action is to move **Left (L)** to position the snake to eat the positive food in the next turn safely.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

From the current direction, the possible moves are:\n\n- **Left (L)**: (x-1, y) → (0, 3)\n  - (0, 3) is a border wall → collision → invalid.\n- **Up (U)**: (x, y+1) → (1, 4)\n  - Check if this is a valid move.\n- **Down (D)**: (x, y-1) → (1, 2)\n  - Check if this is a valid move.\n  \nCannot move Right (R) because that's the opposite of current direction (L), which is not allowed.\n\n### Checking Valid Moves\n\n**Option 1: Up (U) to (1, 4)**\n- Is (1, 4) a wall? No.\n- Is (1, 4) occupied by the snake's body?

Is (3, 3) adjacent to head (1, 3)? Adjacent means one coordinate differs by 1.\n    - Distance: |1-3| + |3-3| = 2 + 0 = 2 → not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1).\n    - So no danger from tail food.\n  - After eating, the new tail would be where the current tail is (3, 3), but since length increases by 1, the tail doesn't move, and the new segment is added where the head was (1, 3).\n  - Next head position is (1, 4), which doesn't collide with the new tail (still at (3, 3)).\n- Seems safe and beneficial.\n\n**Option 2: Down (D) to (1, 2)**\n- Is (1, 2) a wall? No.\n- Is (1, 2) occupied by the snake's body? \n  - Looking at body segments: (2, 3), (2, 2), (1, 2), ... → yes, (1, 2) is the 4th segment.\n  - Moving here would collide with the body → deadly collision → invalid.\n\n**Option 3: Left (L) to (0, 3)**\n- (0, 3) is a border wall → collision → invalid.\n\n### Food Considerations\n\n- Food at (1, 4): value = 5, life_span = 1.\n  - After this turn, life_span decreases to 0 → disappears.\n  - So if we don't eat it now, it's gone.\n- Food at (4, 2): value = 10, life_span = 1.\n  - Also disappears after this turn.\n  - But it's at (4, 2), which is currently occupied by the snake's body (9th segment).\n  - To eat this:\n    - The body must move away first, then head moves onto it next turn.\n    - But life_span is 1, so next turn it's gone → cannot eat it.\n  - So effectively, this food is inaccessible.\n\n### Decision\n\nOnly valid and beneficial move is **Up (U)** to (1, 4) to eat the positive food there before it disappears.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Dangers After Move\n\nAfter moving Up:\n- New head: (1, 4)\n- New body: [(1, 4), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3)]\n  - Length increased by 1, so tail stays at (3, 3).\n- Check if new head collides with any body:\n  - (1, 4) is not in the rest of the body segments → safe.\n- No walls at (1, 4) → safe.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best and only safe move is to go **Up (U)** to eat the positive food at (1, 4).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

The body moves away (i.e., the segment currently at (4,2) moves).\n  2. The head moves onto (4,2) in the same turn.\n\nGiven that the food is at (4,2) with life_span=1, it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. \n\n### Possible Moves\n\nCurrent direction is U (Up). Possible moves (cannot reverse to D immediately):\n- U (continue Up)\n- L (Left)\n- R (Right)\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **U (Up)**: Move from (1,4) to (1,5)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=7 is a wall, but (1,5) is not a wall.\n     - Body: Check if (1,5) is in snake positions. Current body positions do not include (1,5).\n   - After moving, the tail (last segment) moves forward, so the segment at (3,3) will move to the next position in the body chain.\n   - Food at (4,2): The segment at (4,2) is the 10th segment. After moving U, the tail moves, so the segment at (4,2) will shift to (5,2), and the new tail will be at (4,3). So, (4,2) is now empty.\n   - However, the head is at (1,5), not at (4,2), so cannot eat the food.\n   - Outcome: Food disappears next turn, no score change.\n\n2. **L (Left)**: Move from (1,4) to (0,4)\n   - Check walls: x=0 is a wall. Collision, deadly. Cannot move L.\n\n3. **R (Right)**: Move from (1,4) to (2,4)\n   - Check collisions:\n     - Walls: x=7 is a wall, (2,4) is not a wall.\n     - Body: Check if (2,4) is in snake positions. Current body positions do not include (2,4).\n   - After moving, the tail moves forward. The segment at (4,2) moves to (5,2), so (4,2) is now empty.\n   - Head is at (2,4), not at (4,2), so cannot eat the food.\n   - Outcome: Food disappears next turn, no score change.\n\n### Considering Eating the Food\n\nThe food is at (4,2) with value=9 (positive), life_span=1. To eat it:\n- The body must move away from (4,2).\n- The head must move to (4,2) in the same turn.\n\nCurrent head is at (1,4). To reach (4,2) in one move is impossible (must move one cell only). Hence, cannot eat the food this turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe food is at (4,2), which is adjacent to the tail segment at (3,3). Distance between (4,2) and (3,3) is sqrt((4-3)^2 + (2-3)^2) = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2) ~ 1.41, which is adjacent (since diagonal is considered adjacent in some interpretations). \n\nBut in grid terms, (4,2) and (3,3) are diagonally adjacent. The rule mentions \"adjacent to the tail\", which could mean directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) or also diagonally. Assuming it's only direct adjacency (no diagonals), then (4,2) is not adjacent to (3,3) directly (no shared x or y with difference 1). \n\nBut even if it were, since we can't eat the food this turn, it's not a concern.\n\n### Best Move\n\nGiven that we cannot eat the food this turn (it's impossible to reach (4,2) from (1,4) in one move), and it will disappear next turn, our priority is to avoid death and position for future food.\n\nOptions:\n- U: Safe, moves towards center.\n- R: Safe, but not better than U in terms of future options.\n- L: Deadly.\n\nBetween U and R, U seems better as it moves towards the center where there's more space to maneuver.\n\n### Verifying U Move\n\nAfter moving U:\n- New head: (1,5)\n- New body: [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)]\n- Tail was at (3,3), now moves to where the next segment was, which is (3,3) is the last segment, so the new tail is (4,3).\n\nNo immediate collisions, and we're moving towards more open space.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up (U), as it's safe and positions the snake better for future moves.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Game Board and Walls:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n- Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n- There's one internal obstacle at (3, 6).\n\n**2. Snake:**\n- Positions (head first): \n  [(1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3)]\n- Current head direction: Up (U).\n\n**3. Food:**\n- Only one piece of food at (4, 2) with:\n  - Value: 8 (positive food, so +1 score and snake length +1).\n  - Life span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten).\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Up, we cannot instantly reverse to Down (D) on the next move. So, possible moves are U, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n**Current Head Position:** (1, 5)\n\n**1. Move Up (U) to (1, 6):**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is the top wall, (1,6) is within bounds.\n  - Internal obstacles: (3,6) is not (1,6).\n  - Body collision: Check if (1,6) is in snake positions. The snake's body is from (1,4) onwards, so (1,6) is not occupied by the body.\n- Food: No food at (1,6).\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n**2. Move Left (L) to (0, 5):**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is a wall. Moving to (0,5) would collide with the wall.\n- Outcome: Deadly collision. Invalid move.\n\n**3. Move Right (R) to (2, 5):**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is the right wall, (2,5) is within bounds.\n  - Internal obstacles: (3,6) is not (2,5).\n  - Body collision: Check if (2,5) is in snake positions. The snake's body is from (1,4) onwards, so (2,5) is not occupied.\n- Food: No food at (2,5).\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n**Additional Consideration: Food at (4,2):**\n- The food is at (4,2), which is currently occupied by the snake's body (specifically, it's the 11th segment: (4,2)).\n- According to the rules, to eat food under the body:\n  1. The body must move away from (4,2).\n  2. The head must move onto (4,2) in the same turn.\n- Currently, the head is at (1,5), which is quite far from (4,2). It's impossible to reach (4,2) in one move from (1,5).\n- Therefore, the food at (4,2) cannot be eaten this turn and will disappear after this turn since its life span is 1.\n\n### Evaluating Best Move\n\nGiven that the food at (4,2) is unreachable this turn and will disappear, our primary goal is to avoid collisions and stay alive.\n\nPossible safe moves:\n- Up (U) to (1,6)\n- Right (R) to (2,5)\n\nBetween these, both are safe, but we might consider which one positions the snake better for future moves.\n\n- Moving Up (U) to (1,6):\n  - Next possible moves from (1,6): U (to (1,7) - wall collision), L (to (0,6) - wall), R (to (2,6)).\n  - Only R is safe next move.\n  \n- Moving Right (R) to (2,5):\n  - Next possible moves from (2,5): U (to (2,6)), D (to (2,4)), R (to (3,5)).\n  - All three could be safe depending on the snake's body at that time, offering more flexibility.\n\nGiven that moving Right offers more flexibility for future moves, it seems slightly better than moving Up, which would corner us more.\n\nHowever, looking at the snake's body, moving Right to (2,5) isn't immediately adjacent to any body parts, so it's safe. \n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving Right?\n- The tail is at (4,3). The head is at (1,5), moving to (2,5). No adjacency to tail.\n- No food is adjacent to the tail that could cause a \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth Up and Right are safe, but Right offers more future flexibility. \n\nHowever, let's double-check the snake's body after moving Right to ensure no future collision:\n- Current body: After moving head to (2,5), the body will shift:\n  - New head: (2,5)\n  - Body: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n  - The tail (originally at (4,3)) will move to where the second last segment was, which is (5,3), but since the snake doesn't grow (no food eaten), the tail segment is removed, and the new tail is (6,3).\n\nThis seems safe.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the safest and most flexible move is to go **Right (R)**.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

So, the snake cannot move to any cell where x is 0 or 7, or y is 0 or 7.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (3, 6).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's head is at (2, 5), followed by body segments at (1, 5), (1, 4), ..., up to (5, 3).\n   - **Direction**: The snake is currently moving to the Right (R).\n4. **Food**:\n   - At (4, 2): value = 7, life_span = 1\n   - At (5, 6): value = 10, life_span = 1\n\n### Snake's Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is R, the snake cannot move Left (L) next.\n   - Allowed moves: U, D, R\n\n2. **Wall and Body Collisions**:\n   - **Right (R)**: Move to (3, 5)\n     - Check walls: (3,5) is not a wall (x=3 is not 0 or 7, y=5 is not 0 or 7), and (3,6) is a wall but doesn't affect (3,5).\n     - Check body: (3,5) is not in the snake's body positions.\n     - Valid move.\n   - **Up (U)**: Move to (2, 6)\n     - Check walls: y=6 is not 0 or 7, x=2 is not 0 or 7.\n     - Check body: (2,6) is not in the snake's body.\n     - Valid move.\n   - **Down (D)**: Move to (2, 4)\n     - Check walls: y=4 is not 0 or 7, x=2 is not 0 or 7.\n     - Check body: (2,4) is not in the snake's body (the body is at (1,4), not (2,4)).\n     - Valid move.\n\nAll three possible moves are valid in terms of not causing immediate collisions.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions to see if any are reachable or beneficial to target:\n\n1. **Food at (4, 2)**:\n   - Value: +7 (positive food)\n   - Life span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n   - Current position: (2,5)\n   - Distance: To reach (4,2) from (2,5), need to move right twice and down three times, which is not possible in one move.\n   - Cannot reach this food in the next move.\n\n2. **Food at (5, 6)**:\n   - Value: +10 (positive food)\n   - Life span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n   - Current position: (2,5)\n   - Distance: To reach (5,6) from (2,5), need to move right three times and up once.\n   - Cannot reach this food in the next move.\n\nNeither food can be reached in the immediate next move, so the primary goal is to move safely without colliding and possibly position ourselves to reach food in future moves.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\n- Tail position: The tail is the last segment, which is at (5,3).\n- Adjacent to head (2,5)? \n  - Adjacent means one move away: (2,5) is not adjacent to (5,3) (distance is |2-5| + |5-3| = 3 + 2 = 5, which is more than 1).\n  - So, no tail reward danger in this scenario.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nSince no food is immediately reachable, the priority is to move safely to a position that might allow reaching food in future turns or to avoid getting trapped.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, R\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Right (R) to (3,5)**:\n   - Moves away from the body (current body is mostly to the left and below).\n   - Opens up space to potentially move towards the food at (5,6) in future turns.\n   - No immediate risks.\n\n2. **Up (U) to (2,6)**:\n   - Moves towards the top of the grid.\n   - The food at (5,6) is at y=6, so moving up could be a step towards it.\n   - However, from (2,6), to reach (5,6), would need to move right three times, which is possible but not immediate.\n\n3. **Down (D) to (2,4)**:\n   - Moves towards the bottom.\n   - The food at (4,2) is at y=2, so moving down is a step towards it, but it's still far.\n   - From (2,4), would need to move down two more times and right twice to reach (4,2), which is not efficient given the food's life span is 1 (will disappear after this turn).\n\nBetween U and R, moving Right seems slightly better because:\n\n- Moving Up could corner the snake near the top wall (y=7 is a wall, and y=6 is close to it).\n- Moving Right keeps more options open for future moves towards either food, especially since the food at (5,6) is high value and moving right is a step in that general direction.\n\n### Verifying Safety of Moving Right\n\n- New head position: (3,5)\n- Next possible moves from (3,5):\n  - Current direction would be R, so can't move L.\n  - Possible: U (3,6) - but (3,6) is a wall, so invalid.\n  - D (3,4) - valid.\n  - R (4,5) - valid.\n  - So, from (3,5), can move D or R next turn, which is acceptable.\n\nNo immediate trapping or danger observed by moving Right.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves and considering the current state, the safest and most strategic immediate move is to continue moving **Right (R)**. This maintains flexibility for future moves and doesn't lead to any immediate dangers.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

So possible moves are:\n\n1. **Right (R)**: (4, 5)\n   - Check if (4, 5) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=4, y=5 is not in wall list.\n     - Not part of the body except possibly the tail:\n       - The tail is at (6, 3), so (4, 5) is not in the body.\n     - Valid move.\n2. **Up (U)**: (3, 6)\n   - Check:\n     - y=6 is within bounds (y=7 is wall, but y=6 is not).\n     - Internal wall at (3, 6): This is a wall.

To eat it:\n  - The body must move away from (4,2), which it will if the snake moves (since the tail moves forward).\n  - Then the head must move onto (4,2).\n  - Currently, head is at (3,5), so to reach (4,2), it's not possible in one move.\n- Food at (5,6) is not under the snake, and not reachable in one move from (3,5).\n\nSo, no immediate food to eat in the next move.\n\n### Choosing Between R and D\n\nSince no immediate food is accessible, we should choose a move that doesn't lead to a dead end and keeps options open.\n\n- **Move R to (4,5)**:\n  - From (4,5), can move U to (4,6), then R to (5,6) to reach food.\n  - Also, moving R doesn't seem to immediately trap the snake.\n- **Move D to (3,4)**:\n  - From (3,4), the snake is moving towards the lower part where the tail is.\n  - The tail is at (6,3), and the body is long, so moving D might lead to more constraints later.\n\nBetween the two, moving R seems better as it opens a path towards the food at (5,6).\n\n### Verifying Collision After Move R to (4,5)\n\nAfter moving R:\n- New head: (4,5)\n- Body segments: (3,5), (2,5), ..., up to (6,3).\n- Check if (4,5) is in the body:\n  - The body segments after the head are (3,5), (2,5), etc. (4,5) is not in the body.\n- Also, the tail is at (6,3), which will move forward when the snake moves, so no collision.\n\n### Verifying Collision After Move D to (3,4)\n\nAfter moving D:\n- New head: (3,4)\n- Body segments: (3,5), (2,5), ..., up to (6,3).\n- Check if (3,4) is in the body:\n  - Looking at the body, (1,4) is a segment, but (3,4) is not.\n- No immediate collision.\n\nBoth moves are safe, but R seems more promising for reaching food.\n\n### Considering Food at (4,2)\n\nThe food at (4,2) is under the body at (4,2). To eat it:\n- The body must move away: This happens as the snake moves.\n- Then the head must move onto (4,2):\n  - Currently at (3,5), to reach (4,2), the path would be:\n    - Move D to (3,4), then D to (3,3), then R to (4,3), then D to (4,2).\n  - This is multiple moves away, not immediate.\n- So, not a factor for the immediate move.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that:\n- Moving R is safe and moves towards the general direction of the food at (5,6).\n- Moving D is safe but doesn't seem to offer a direct advantage.\n- No immediate food to eat in one move.\n\nThe better immediate action is to move **Right (R)**.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

It's not.\n  - Tail: No issue.\n- Food: No food at (5,5).\n- Safety: Safe move.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable or poses a danger:\n\n1. **Food at (4,2)**:\n   - Current head is at (4,5). To reach (4,2), the snake would need to move down three times: (4,5) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (4,2).\n   - However, the food is at (4,2), which is currently under the snake's body segment (4,2) is part of the snake's body (from the positions list: ..., (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), ...).\n   - According to the rules, food under the body can only be eaten if:\n     1. The body moves away.\n     2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n   - Currently, (4,2) is occupied by the snake's body, so the head cannot move there directly. The body would need to move away first, which isn't immediate.\n   - Also, the tail is at (6,2), not adjacent to the head (head is at (4,5), so no \"Tail Reward Danger\" here.\n   - Life span is 5 turns, so it will disappear at turn 74 (current turn is 69).\n\n2. **Food at (5,6)**:\n   - Current head is at (4,5). To reach (5,6), the path could be:\n     - Right to (5,5), then Up to (5,6).\n   - (5,6) is not under the snake's body.\n   - Life span is 8 turns, so it will disappear at turn 77.\n   - No immediate danger in moving towards it.\n\n### Potential Paths\n\nGiven that both foods are positive and not immediately accessible in one move, we can consider paths towards them:\n\n- **Towards (5,6)**:\n  - Next move could be Right to (5,5), then Up to (5,6) to eat the food.\n  - Or Up to (4,6), then Right to (5,6).\n  \n- **Towards (4,2)**:\n  - Would require moving Down multiple times, but the food is under the body currently, making it risky to pursue immediately.\n\n### Avoiding Risks\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Not applicable here since the tail is at (6,2), not adjacent to the head (4,5).\n- **Body Collision**: Need to ensure that the next move doesn't collide with the body. Currently, all possible moves (U, D, R) are safe in this regard.\n- **Wall Collision**: All possible moves are within bounds.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that moving Right (R) to (5,5) is a step towards the food at (5,6), and both Up (U) and Down (D) don't lead directly to food, moving Right seems like a reasonable choice to eventually reach the food at (5,6).\n\nAlternatively, moving Up (U) to (4,6) is also safe and positions the snake to potentially move Right next to (5,6). However, moving Right now seems more direct.\n\nMoving Down (D) to (4,4) doesn't seem to offer any immediate advantage towards food.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nWait, let's double-check if any food is adjacent to the head:\n\n- Current head: (4,5)\n- Adjacent cells:\n  - Up: (4,6) — no food\n  - Down: (4,4) — no food\n  - Left: (3,5) — invalid (reverse)\n  - Right: (5,5) — no food\n\nSo no food is immediately adjacent, meaning no food can be eaten in the next move regardless of the direction chosen.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nSince no food can be eaten immediately, and moving Right is a step towards the food at (5,6), which is positive and has a longer life span (8 turns), choosing Right seems optimal.\n\nAlso, moving Right doesn't lead to any immediate dead ends or traps based on the current body positions.\n\n### Verifying Snake's Body After Move\n\nIf we move Right to (5,5):\n\n- New head: (5,5)\n- Body segments: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), ..., (6,2)]\n- Tail (6,2) will move to (5,2) (since the second last segment is (5,2)), so the tail moves left to (5,2).\n\nThis doesn't create any immediate collision risks for future moves.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves and considering the positions of the food and the snake's body, the safest and most strategic immediate move is to continue moving Right towards the food at (5,6).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

This means the snake cannot move to any cell where x is 0 or 7, or y is 0 or 7.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (3, 6).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head. The head is at (5, 5), followed by the body segments.\n   - **Direction**: The snake is currently moving to the Right (R).\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are three food items:\n     - (4, 2): value = 1, life_span = 4\n     - (5, 6): value = 1, life_span = 7\n     - (2, 1): value = 1, life_span = 10\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Right (R), the snake cannot instantly reverse to Left (L) on the next move. So, possible immediate actions are U, D, or R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R)\n- **New Head Position**: Current head is at (5,5). Moving right would be (6,5).\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Wall**: x=7 is a wall, and x=6 is not a wall, so no wall collision.\n  - **Body**: The snake's body segments are at [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2)]. (6,5) is not in this list, so no body collision.\n- **Food Check**: No food is at (6,5).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U)\n- **New Head Position**: (5,6).\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Wall**: y=7 is a wall, and y=6 is not, so no wall collision.\n  - **Body**: (5,6) is not in the body segments list.\n- **Food Check**: There is food at (5,6) with value 1 and life_span 7.\n  - **Eating Food**: \n    - The food is positive (+1 score, length +1).\n    - Check for Tail Reward Danger: The tail is at (5,2). The new head would be at (5,6), which is not adjacent to the tail (distance is 4 in y-direction), so no danger.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move with a reward of +1.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D)\n- **New Head Position**: (5,4).\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Wall**: y=0 is a wall, and y=4 is not, so no wall collision.\n  - **Body**: (5,4) is not in the body segments list.\n- **Food Check**: No food at (5,4).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n### Comparing the Options\n\n- **Move Right (R)**: Safe, no reward.\n- **Move Up (U)**: Safe, +1 reward.\n- **Move Down (D)**: Safe, no reward.\n\nThe optimal move is **Up (U)**, as it safely collects a positive food item without any immediate dangers.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nJust to be thorough, let's ensure that eating the food at (5,6) doesn't cause a collision in the next move:\n- After eating, the snake's length increases by 1, so the tail doesn't move immediately.\n- The new head is at (5,6), and the tail is at (5,2). They are not adjacent (distance is 4), so no collision risk next turn.\n\n### Checking Other Foods\n\nThe other foods are:\n- (4,2): On the body segment (4,2). To eat this, the body must move away first, so it's not immediately accessible.\n- (2,1): Also on the body segment (2,1), same issue.\n\nThus, only (5,6) is immediately accessible and safe to eat.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves, the best immediate action is to move **Up (U)** to eat the positive food at (5,6).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

The possible moves are U, L, R (cannot instantly reverse to D).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U):\n- New head position: (5, 6) + U = (5, 7).\n- Check:\n  - y=7 is a border wall → collision → death.\n- **Invalid move**.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L):\n- New head position: (5, 6) + L = (4, 6).\n- Check:\n  - Is (4,6) a wall? No, walls are at x=0,7; y=0,7; and (3,6).\n  - Is (4,6) occupied by the snake's body? Let's see the body positions:\n    - Body segments are from (5,5) to (5,2). (4,6) is not in the body.\n  - No collision.\n- **Valid move**.\n- After moving, the tail (last segment) moves forward, so the new tail is at (4,2) (since the current tail is at (5,2), and the segment before is (4,2)).\n  - There is food at (4,2) with value=3, life_span=1.\n  - If the head moves to (4,6), the tail was at (5,2), moves to (4,2), which has food.\n  - But the food is under the tail, and the head is not adjacent to the tail in this move, so no \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n  - However, the food at (4,2) is under the tail, and the tail moves away, but the head doesn't move onto it, so it's not eaten.\n- No food eaten in this move.\n- Next possible directions after L: Cannot reverse to R, so can go U, L, D.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R):\n- New head position: (5, 6) + R = (6, 6).\n- Check:\n  - Is (6,6) a wall? No.\n  - Is (6,6) in the body? No, body is from (5,5) to (5,2).\n- **Valid move**.\n- After moving, the tail moves to (4,2), same as above.\n  - Food at (4,2) is under the tail, not eaten.\n- No food eaten.\n- Next possible directions after R: Cannot reverse to L, so can go U, R, D.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's look at the food:\n\n1. (4,2): value=3, life_span=1.\n   - Currently under the snake's body (specifically, at the segment (4,2)).\n   - To eat it:\n     - The body must move away (tail moves from (5,2) to (4,2), but (4,2) is already part of the body, so the food is still under the body unless the tail moves further.\n     - The head must move onto it. Currently, head is at (5,6), food at (4,2), which is 4 units away in x and 4 in y, so not reachable in one move.\n   - Life_span=1, so it will disappear next turn. Cannot be eaten now.\n   \n2. (2,1): value=9, life_span=1.\n   - Currently under the snake's body (at segment (2,1)).\n   - To eat it:\n     - Body must move away: tail is at (5,2), moves to (4,2), so (2,1) is still under the body (segment (2,1) is not the tail).\n     - Head must move onto it: head is at (5,6), food at (2,1), too far.\n   - Life_span=1, will disappear next turn. Cannot be eaten now.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nNeither food can be eaten in the current move because:\n- Both are under the body and not adjacent to the head.\n- Their life_span is 1, so they will disappear after this turn regardless.\n\n### Avoiding Collisions\n\nPrimary goal is to avoid death. From the possible moves:\n- U: leads to death (wall).\n- L and R are safe in terms of not hitting walls or body immediately.\n\n### Future Considerations\n\nSince no food can be eaten now, and both will disappear next turn, the main goal is to stay alive and position for future food.\n\nLooking at the snake's length (17), it's quite long, so space is limited. We should avoid trapping ourselves.\n\nAfter L:\n- Head at (4,6), body follows.\n- Possible next moves: U, L, D.\n  - U: (4,7) → wall → death.\n  - L: (3,6) → internal obstacle → death.\n  - D: (4,5) → currently part of the body (second segment is (5,5), but (4,5) is the third segment).\n    - Wait, body is [(5,6) → (5,5) → (4,5) → ...]. After moving L, new body is [(4,6), (5,6), (5,5), ...], so (4,5) is not in the new body until the tail moves.\n    - Actually, after moving L to (4,6), the body is [(4,6), (5,6), (5,5), ..., (4,2)], so (4,5) is the third segment.\n    - Moving D to (4,5) would collide with the body.\n- So after L, only D is possible, but it leads to collision. Thus, L is a dead end.\n\nAfter R:\n- Head at (6,6), body follows.\n- Possible next moves: U, R, D.\n  - U: (6,7) → wall → death.\n  - R: (7,6) → wall → death.\n  - D: (6,5) → not in current body (current body is [(5,6), (5,5), ...], (6,5) is not there).\n    - After moving R, body is [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5), ..., (5,2)], so (6,5) is not in the body.\n    - Safe move.\n- So R allows a subsequent move to D, keeping options open.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween L and R:\n- L leads to a dead end (only D next, which collides).\n- R allows a subsequent D move, keeping the snake alive longer.\n\nThus, the best immediate action is R.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

The other food at (2,1) is quite far, and the snake is long, making it hard to reach without risking collision.\n\n### Alternative Considerations\n\nIs there any way to change direction to reach food? Currently, only D is possible. After moving D, the next move is also D, leading the snake downward. \n\nThe food at (4,2) is under the tail. To eat it:\n- The tail must move away first, then the head moves onto it.\n- Currently, the tail is at (4,2), and the segment before it is at (4,1).\n- Next move: tail moves from (4,2) to where (4,1) was, but (4,1) moves to (3,1), etc., based on the body segments.\n- It's complex, but essentially, the food at (4,2) would be accessible if the head can reach it after the tail moves away, but given the snake's length and current position, it's unlikely soon.\n\nThe food at (2,1) is near the body but not under it. To reach it, the snake would need to navigate its long body carefully, which isn't straightforward from the current position.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the current state, the only immediate safe move is **Down (D)** to (6, 5). Other moves lead to walls or body collisions. While this doesn't lead directly to food, it avoids immediate death, which is the priority.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Move Down (D)\n- New head position: (6, 4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=4 is not a wall (y=0 is the bottom wall).\n  - Body: Check if (6,4) is in the snake's body.\n    - Current body segments (excluding head): (6,6), (5,6), ..., (4,1).\n    - (6,4) is not in the body.\n- Food at (6,4)? No food listed there.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L)\n- New head position: (5, 5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=5 is not a wall.\n  - Body: Is (5,5) in the body?\n    - Current body segments: (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), ..., (4,1).\n    - (5,5) is the 4th segment (counting from head: head is (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)).\n    - Moving to (5,5) would collide with the body.\n- **Conclusion**: Unsafe, would collide with body.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R)\n- New head position: (7, 5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is a border wall.\n  - Body: Not relevant since wall collision is first.\n- **Conclusion**: Unsafe, would hit the wall.\n\n### Re-evaluating Move Down (D)\n\nSince Left and Right are unsafe, the only viable move is Down. But let's check if there's any food that could be reached soon to maximize score.\n\nLooking at the food:\n1. (4, 2): value = 1\n   - Current head at (6,5), moving Down to (6,4).\n   - Next moves could be to reach (4,2), but it's not directly accessible now.\n2. (2, 1): value = 7\n   - Currently at (2,1), which is part of the snake's body (the tail is at (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), etc.).\n   - According to the rules, food under the body can only be eaten if:\n     - The body moves away, and\n     - The head moves onto the food cell.\n   - Currently, the tail is at (4,1), and (2,1) is not the tail, so eating it would require the body to move away first, which isn't immediate.\n   - Also, the head is not adjacent to the tail (tail is at (4,1), head is at (6,5)), so \"Tail Reward Danger\" doesn't apply here.\n   - However, the food is under the body, and we can't eat it immediately.\n3. (2, 5): value = 10\n   - At (2,5), which is part of the body (positions: ..., (2,5), (1,5), ...).\n   - Similar to above, can't eat immediately unless body moves away.\n\nGiven this, the immediate move Down is safe but doesn't lead to eating food right away. However, since other moves are unsafe, Down is the only option.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Under Head\n\nIs there any food under the head currently? Head is at (6,5). Checking food positions:\n- (4,2), (2,1), (2,5) — none at (6,5).\nSo no food to eat this turn.\n\n### Verifying No Better Immediate Options\n\nIs there any other consideration? The food at (2,1) has a high value (7), but it's under the body. To eat it:\n- The body must move away from (2,1), then head moves there.\nThis would take multiple turns, and the food's life_span is 1, meaning it disappears after this turn (since countdown decreases every turn, including current).\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) and (2,5) also have life_span=1, so they'll disappear after this turn. Thus, we cannot eat any food this turn.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe only safe move is Down (\"D\"). Moving Left or Right would lead to collisions.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

However, since the current direction is Down (D), the snake cannot instantly reverse to Up (U) on the next move. So, possible immediate actions are D, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Continue Down (D) to (6, 3)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - Walls: (6, 3) is within bounds (x=6 is valid, y=3 is valid).\n  - Body: Check if (6, 3) is in the snake's body positions. The body segments are from (6,5) to (3,1). (6,3) is not in the list, so no collision.\n- **Food Check**: Is there food at (6,3)? No food is listed there.\n- **Result**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (5, 4)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - Walls: (5,4) is within bounds.\n  - Body: Check if (5,4) is in the body. It's not in the list.\n- **Food Check**: No food at (5,4).\n- **Result**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (7, 4)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - Walls: x=7 is a border wall, so (7,4) is a wall → collision.\n- **Result**: Illegal move, would die.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's look at the food:\n\n1. **(2,1)**: value = +7, life_span = 1 (disappears after this turn).\n   - Current head is at (6,4). Distance is |6-2| + |4-1| = 4 + 3 = 7 steps away. Can't reach in one move.\n   \n2. **(2,5)**: value = +9, life_span = 1.\n   - Distance: |6-2| + |4-5| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps away. Can't reach in one move.\n\nNeither food can be eaten this turn, so we don't need to consider the \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule.\n\n### Checking for Future Opportunities\n\nSince both foods disappear after this turn, they are not relevant for future moves unless we can reach them now, which we can't.\n\n### Considering Snake's Body and Potential Traps\n\nLooking at the snake's body:\n- The tail is at (3,1). The segment before tail is (2,1), which is where one of the foods is.\n- If we were to move towards (2,1), we'd have to be careful not to collide with the body as the snake grows.\n\nBut since we can't reach either food this turn, this is not an immediate concern.\n\n### Best Immediate Action\n\nGiven the options:\n- D (Down) to (6,3): safe, no food.\n- L (Left) to (5,4): safe, no food.\n- R (Right): illegal.\n\nBetween D and L, both are safe with no immediate benefit. However, moving Down (D) keeps the snake moving in the same direction, which might be preferable unless there's a reason to turn.\n\nLooking at the snake's body:\n- Moving Down would take the head to (6,3), which is not near any body segments.\n- Moving Left would take the head to (5,4), which is also safe.\n\nSince both are safe, and neither leads to food, we can choose either. However, moving Left might open up more options in the future by changing direction, whereas continuing Down might eventually lead to a corner.\n\nGiven that, moving Left seems slightly better to keep options open.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Dangers\n\n- After moving Left to (5,4), next possible moves would be U, D, L (can't reverse to R).\n  - U to (5,5): body segment at (6,5) and (5,5) is in the body (from the list: (5,5) is present). So, moving Up next would collide with body.\n  - D to (5,3): safe.\n  - L to (4,4): need to check if (4,4) is in body; not in the list, so safe.\n\nSo, moving Left now allows safe moves Down or Left next turn.\n\nMoving Down to (6,3):\n- Next possible moves: D, L, R.\n  - D to (6,2): safe.\n  - L to (5,3): safe.\n  - R to (7,3): wall, illegal.\n\nBoth initial moves seem safe, but moving Left might give slightly more flexibility next turn.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating, both Down and Left are safe, but Left provides slightly more flexibility for future moves without immediate risk.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

The head is at (5,4), which is not adjacent to the tail (2,1). Adjacent means one step in any direction (up, down, left, right). Distance is |5-2| + |4-1| = 3 + 3 = 6, which is more than 1.

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Game State\n\nFirst, let's visualize the current state of the game to better understand the positions and possible moves.\n\n**Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7), with walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and one internal obstacle at (3,6).\n\n**Snake Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head to the tail. Here's the sequence:\n- Head: (4,4)\n- Body: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: The head is currently moving left (L), meaning it's facing towards decreasing x-coordinates.\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (2,1): value=5, life_span=1\n2. (2,5): value=7, life_span=1\n3. (4,5): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, it cannot reverse its direction instantly. Since the current direction is Left (L), the opposite direction is Right (R), which is not allowed in the next move. So, possible moves are U, D, or L.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) - (x-1,y)\n- New head position: (4-1,4) = (3,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is a wall, but (3,4) is not on any wall.\n  - Body: Check if (3,4) is in the snake's body segments. Current body segments are from (5,4) to (1,1). (3,4) is not in this list.\n- Food at new position: Is there food at (3,4)? No.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) - (x,y+1)\n- New head position: (4,4+1) = (4,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is the upper wall, (4,5) is not on a wall.\n  - Body: Is (4,5) in the body? Yes, it's the 8th segment (counting from head as 1st).\n    - However, the tail is at (1,1), and the segment at (4,5) is not the immediate tail. But the rule states that the head cannot touch any body segment except possibly the tail if the tail moves away.\n    - Specifically, the tail is at (1,1), and the segment before the tail is (1,2), then (2,2), etc. The segment at (4,5) is part of the body, not the tail that's about to move.\n    - Therefore, moving to (4,5) would collide with the body.\n- Outcome: Deadly collision, cannot move Up.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) - (x,y-1)\n- New head position: (4,4-1) = (4,3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is the lower wall, (4,3) is not on a wall.\n  - Body: Is (4,3) in the body? Checking the list: no.\n- Food at new position: Is there food at (4,3)? No.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's look at the food items to see if any are reachable or beneficial:\n\n1. (2,1): value=5, life_span=1\n   - Current turn is 76, so it will disappear at turn 77.\n   - Distance from head (4,4): |4-2| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5 moves away.\n   - Cannot reach it before it disappears (life_span=1 means it disappears after this turn).\n\n2. (2,5): value=7, life_span=1\n   - Disappears at turn 77.\n   - Distance: |4-2| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3 moves away.\n   - Cannot reach it in one move.\n\n3. (4,5): value=10, life_span=1\n   - Disappears at turn 77.\n   - Distance: |4-4| + |4-5| = 0 + 1 = 1 move away.\n   - Adjacent to head, can reach in one move by moving Up.\n   - However, moving Up leads to a body collision as we saw earlier.\n   - Additionally, the food is at (4,5), which is currently occupied by the snake's body (8th segment). The rule states that food under the body can only be eaten if:\n     - The body moves away (i.e., the segment at (4,5) moves), and\n     - The head moves onto the food cell.\n   - Currently, the segment after (4,5) is (3,5), so the body is moving left. The segment at (4,5) will move to where (3,5) is, which is left to (4,5). So, (4,5) will be vacated if the head doesn't move there.\n   - If we move Up to (4,5), the body segment at (4,5) would move left to (3,5), and the head would move to (4,5), thus eating the food.\n   - But we must check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n     - The tail is at (1,1), which is not adjacent to the head (4,4). Adjacent means one move away: (4,4) is adjacent to (3,4), (5,4), (4,3), (4,5).\n     - The tail is at (1,1), not adjacent to (4,4), so no danger from tail reward.\n   - However, moving Up causes the head to collide with the body at (4,5), which is deadly. Even though the body is moving away, the head cannot occupy a body segment in the same turn unless it's the tail, which it's not.\n   - Therefore, cannot safely eat this food.\n\n### Determining the Best Move\n\nFrom the possible moves:\n- Left (L): safe, no food.\n- Up (U): deadly collision.\n- Down (D): safe, no food.\n- Right (R): not allowed (reverse of current direction L).\n\nBetween Left and Down, both are safe with no immediate food. We can choose either, but let's consider future moves:\n\n- If we move Left to (3,4):\n  - Next possible moves from (3,4) with direction L: U, D, L (no R).\n  - From (3,4), moving Left to (2,4) is possible, which is safe and moves towards the food at (2,1) (though it will disappear).\n  \n- If we move Down to (4,3):\n  - Next possible moves from (4,3) with direction D: L, R, D (no U).\n  - From (4,3), moving Left to (3,3) is possible, which is safe but doesn't lead to any immediate food.\n\nBetween the two, moving Left seems slightly better as it keeps the snake moving in its current direction without unnecessary turns, which might help in future moves to reach food that may appear.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Benefits\n\nIs there any food that can be eaten immediately without collision?\n- The food at (4,5) is under the body and can be eaten if the head moves there, but that causes a collision as the body is still there when the head moves.\n- Other foods are too far to reach in one move.\n\nThus, no immediate food can be safely eaten this turn.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the above analysis, the safest moves are Left or Down. Since moving Left maintains the current direction and may be more predictable for future moves, I'll choose Left.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Move Left (L) to (2, 4)\n\n- **Position After Move**: (2, 4)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: x=2 is not a wall, y=4 is not a wall. (2, 4) is not an internal wall.\n  - **Body**: Check if (2, 4) is in the snake's body.\n    - Current body segments: (4,4), (5,4), etc. (2,4) is not in the list except for the head's previous position, but the head is moving away from (3,4), and the tail is at (1,2), so (2,4) is safe.\n- **Food**: \n  - (2,1): Not at (2,4)\n  - (2,5): Not at (2,4)\n  - (4,5): Not at (2,4)\n  - No food at (2,4), so no eating.\n- **Safety**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (3, 5)\n\n- **Position After Move**: (3, 5)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: x=3 is not a wall, y=5 is not a wall. (3,6) is a wall, but we're moving to (3,5).\n  - **Body**: Check if (3,5) is in the snake's body.\n    - Current body segments: (4,4), (5,4), ..., (3,5) is the 10th segment in the list. So moving here would collide with the body.\n- **Food**: \n  - (4,5): Not at (3,5)\n  - (2,5): Not at (3,5)\n  - (2,1): Not at (3,5)\n  - However, (3,5) is part of the body where food is present (from the food list, (4,5) is food under the body, but (3,5) is not listed as food).\n  - Wait, looking back at food positions: (4,5) is food under the body, but we're moving to (3,5), which is not food.\n  - But (3,5) is part of the body, so this is a collision.\n- **Safety**: Collision with body at (3,5). **Invalid move**.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (3, 3)\n\n- **Position After Move**: (3, 3)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: x=3 is not a wall, y=3 is not a wall. No internal walls at (3,3).\n  - **Body**: Check if (3,3) is in the snake's body.\n    - Current body segments: (3,4), (4,4), etc. (3,3) is not in the list.\n- **Food**:\n  - (2,1): Not at (3,3)\n  - (2,5): Not at (3,3)\n  - (4,5): Not at (3,3)\n  - No food at (3,3), so no eating.\n- **Safety**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n### Considering Food Under the Body\n\nThere are two food items under the snake's body:\n1. (2,5): Part of the body at position (2,5).\n2. (4,5): Part of the body at position (4,5).\n\n**Rules for Eating Food Under Body**:\n- The body must move away from the food cell.\n- Then, the head must move onto the food cell to eat it.\n\nCurrently, the head is at (3,4). To eat:\n- (2,5): The head would need to move to (2,5), but currently, (2,5) is part of the body. To eat this, the body must first move away from (2,5), which isn't happening immediately.\n- (4,5): Similarly, the head would need to move to (4,5), but it's currently part of the body.\n\nThus, we cannot eat these foods in the immediate next move.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\n**Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrent tail is at (1,2). Adjacent cells to tail:\n- (0,2): wall (x=0)\n- (2,2): part of the body\n- (1,1): possible\n- (1,3): part of the body\n\nHead is at (3,4), which is not adjacent to (1,2), so no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Evaluating Potential Future Moves\n\nWhile we're only deciding the immediate move, considering future paths can help. \n\nFrom (3,4):\n- Left to (2,4):\n  - Then possible moves from (2,4): \n    - Left to (1,4): but (1,4) is part of the body.\n    - Up to (2,5): (2,5) is food under body, but body hasn't moved away yet.\n    - Down to (2,3): (2,3) is part of the body.\n  - So from (2,4), only possible move might be Left to (1,4) which is body, or Down to (2,3) which is body. So moving Left now might lead to a dead end.\n\n- Down to (3,3):\n  - Then possible moves from (3,3):\n    - Left to (2,3): part of the body.\n    - Right to (4,3): not body, but current direction is Left, so Right is allowed (not instant reverse from Down).\n    - Down to (3,2): not body.\n  - More options seem available after moving Down.\n\n### Decision Between Left and Down\n\nBoth Left and Down are safe immediate moves, but:\n\n- Left (L) to (2,4):\n  - Next moves seem limited, might lead to dead end.\n  \n- Down (D) to (3,3):\n  - Opens up more possibilities for future moves, like Right or Down next.\n\nGiven that both immediate moves don't lead to food, choosing the one that keeps more options open is better. Moving Down seems preferable.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Food Gains\n\nNeither move leads to eating food immediately, so the choice is based on safety and future flexibility.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the safest and most strategic immediate move is **Down (D)**.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Moving here would cause a collision.\n  - Down (D): (3, 2) - Check if this is a wall or body.\n    - y=2 is not a border wall.\n    - (3, 2) is not in the snake's body segments.\n  - Left (L): (2, 3) - Check:\n    - x=2 is not a border wall.\n    - (2, 3) is part of the snake's body (second last segment). Moving here would cause a collision.\n  - Right (R): (4, 3) - Check:\n    - x=4 is not a border wall.\n    - (4, 3) is not in the snake's body segments.\n\nFrom this, the possible safe moves from the head's current position are **Down (D)** and **Right (R)**.\n\n### Checking Food Positions\n\nNow, let's see where the food is relative to the head:\n\n1. **Food at (2, 1)**:\n   - Distance from head (3,3): Δx = -1, Δy = -2.\n   - Not adjacent; would require multiple moves to reach.\n2. **Food at (2, 5)**:\n   - Distance: Δx = -1, Δy = +2.\n   - Not adjacent.\n   - Also, (2,5) is part of the snake's body (12th segment). Even if it's food, it's under the body and can't be eaten unless the body moves away first.\n3. **Food at (4, 5)**:\n   - Distance: Δx = +1, Δy = +2.\n   - Not adjacent.\n   - (4,5) is part of the snake's body (10th segment). Same issue as above; can't be eaten immediately.\n\nGiven that all food is either not adjacent or under the body, we cannot eat any food this turn. Therefore, our primary goal is to move safely without colliding with walls or the body.\n\n### Possible Moves and Their Safety\n\nFrom the head at (3,3), moving Down (D) to (3,2):\n\n- (3,2) is not a wall or body. Safe.\n  \nMoving Right (R) to (4,3):\n\n- (4,3) is not a wall or body. Safe.\n\nWe cannot move Up (U) because it's the opposite of the current direction (D), and also (3,4) is the body. Similarly, moving Left (L) to (2,3) is the body.\n\n### Choosing Between D and R\n\nBoth D and R are safe. Now, let's consider which move might set us up better for future food collection.\n\n1. **Moving Down (D) to (3,2)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (3,2):\n     - Left (L) to (2,2): (2,2) is the tail. The tail will move away if we move there, so it's safe.\n     - Right (R) to (4,2): Need to check if (4,2) is safe.\n     - Down (D) to (3,1): y=1 is safe; check if (3,1) is body (no).\n   - Moving down takes us towards the bottom of the grid where there's no immediate food.\n\n2. **Moving Right (R) to (4,3)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (4,3):\n     - Up (U) to (4,4): (4,4) is part of the body (3rd segment). Not safe.\n     - Down (D) to (4,2): Safe.\n     - Right (R) to (5,3): Need to check (5,3) is safe (not in body).\n   - Moving right takes us towards the center where there's more space and potential to reach food later.\n\nBetween the two, moving Right seems slightly better as it keeps us more central, but both are safe. Since no food is immediately accessible, either is fine.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule states that if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\n- Current tail is at (2,2).\n- Head is at (3,3), adjacent to tail via Left-Down diagonal, but not directly adjacent (manhattan distance is 2). So this rule doesn't apply here.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven that both Down and Right are safe and no food is immediately accessible, and considering that moving Right keeps us more central, I'll choose to move Right.\n\nHowever, let me double-check the snake's body to ensure that moving Right doesn't lead to immediate trapping in the next steps.\n\nLooking at the snake's body, moving Right to (4,3):\n\nNext possible moves from (4,3):\n\n- Up to (4,4): body segment (3rd), unsafe.\n- Down to (4,2): safe.\n- Right to (5,3): safe (not in body).\n  \nSo from (4,3), we can go Down or Right next turn.\n\nAlternatively, moving Down to (3,2):\n\nNext possible moves from (3,2):\n\n- Left to (2,2): tail, will move, safe.\n- Right to (4,2): safe.\n- Down to (3,1): safe.\n\nBoth initial moves seem fine, but moving Right may give slightly more options next turn.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the safest immediate actions are Down or Right. Since no food is immediately accessible and both moves are equally safe in the immediate step, but moving Right may offer slightly better future mobility, I'll choose:\n\n\\boxed{R}",

No food listed there.\n   - Safe move with no immediate reward.\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (4,4)**:\n   - Check (4,4):\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Part of the body: (4,4) is the 4th segment in the snake's body.\n     - Moving here would collide with the body — deadly.\n   - Not safe.\n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (4,2)**:\n   - Check (4,2):\n     - Not a wall (y=2 is safe, y=0 is wall).\n     - Not part of the body: (4,2) isn't in the snake's positions.\n   - Food at (4,2)? No food listed there.\n   - Safe move with no immediate reward.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable or poses risks:\n\n1. **(2,1)**: value=1, life=2\n   - Distance from head (4,3): |4-2| + |3-1| = 2 + 2 = 4 steps away.\n   - Not immediately reachable in one move.\n\n2. **(2,5)**: value=1, life=4\n   - Currently at (2,5): This is the 13th segment of the snake (counting from 0: head is 0, then 1:(3,3), ..., 12:(2,5)).\n   - It's under the snake's body. To eat it:\n     - The body must move away from (2,5), and then the head must move onto it.\n     - Currently, the tail is at (2,3), so (2,5) is not the tail.\n     - Even if we could, eating body-covered food is complex and risky.\n   - Probably not a good target now.\n\n3. **(4,5)**: value=1, life=7\n   - At (4,5): This is the 11th segment of the snake.\n   - Similar to above, under the body — not directly accessible.\n\n4. **(5,5)**: value=1, life=10\n   - At (5,5): This is the 10th segment of the snake.\n   - Under the body — not directly accessible.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if any food is adjacent to the head and also at the tail:\n\n- Tail is at (2,3).\n- Adjacent to head (4,3): left is (3,3), right is (5,3), up is (4,4), down is (4,2).\n- Food at tail (2,3)? No food is listed at (2,3).\n- So no immediate danger from tail reward.\n\n### Deciding the Move\n\nFrom the possible safe moves:\n- Right (R) to (5,3): safe, no reward.\n- Down (D) to (4,2): safe, no reward.\n\nBetween these, which is better?\n\n- Moving right continues the current direction, possibly exploring new areas.\n- Moving down moves towards the lower part of the grid where there's less body presence currently.\n\nLooking ahead slightly:\n- After moving right to (5,3), next moves could be R to (6,3), U to (5,4), or D to (5,2).\n- After moving down to (4,2), next moves could be R to (5,2), L to (3,2), or D to (4,1) (but y=0 is wall, so D is invalid).\n\nBoth seem safe, but moving right may keep more options open since moving down limits future downward moves due to the wall at y=0.\n\n### Checking for Future Food Access\n\nIs either move more likely to lead to food soon?\n\n- Food at (2,1) is at y=1, so moving down might eventually help reach it, but it's still far.\n- Other foods are under the body and not immediately accessible.\n\nGiven that, both moves are equally safe with no immediate reward, but right seems slightly better for exploration.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- Moving right to (5,3):\n  - Next move could be R to (6,3), which is safe (not a wall or body).\n  - Then R to (7,3) is a wall (x=7), so would have to turn then.\n- Moving down to (4,2):\n  - Then could move R to (5,2), then R to (6,2), etc., staying near the bottom.\n\nBoth sequences seem safe for a few moves ahead.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nSince both R and D are safe with no immediate advantage, and R continues the current direction which is often a good default, I'll choose R.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn 80. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - One internal obstacle at (3, 6).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (5, 3), followed by body segments [(4, 3), (3, 3), ..., (1, 3)].\n   - Current direction: Right (R).\n4. **Food Items**:\n   - (2, 1): value=1, life_span=1\n   - (2, 5): value=3, life_span=1\n   - (4, 5): value=6, life_span=1\n   - (5, 5): value=9, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5, 3) moving Right (R), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (5, 4)\n- **Down (D)**: (5, 2)\n- **Left (L)**: (4, 3)\n- **Right (R)**: (6, 3)\n\nBut we cannot instantly reverse the direction. Current direction is R, so we cannot move Left (L) next. So possible moves: U, D, R.\n\n### Checking Each Possible Move\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (5, 4)\n- Check if (5, 4) is occupied by the snake's body:\n  - Snake body segments: [(4, 3), (3, 3), ..., (1, 3)]. (5, 4) is not in the body.\n- Check if (5, 4) is a wall:\n  - Not a border wall or internal obstacle.\n- Is there food at (5, 4)? No.\n- After moving, the tail moves forward, so the new tail is (1, 3) is removed, and a new segment is added at (5, 4) if we grow (but we're not eating now).\n- **Safety**: Safe move, no immediate collision.\n\n#### 2. Move Down (D) to (5, 2)\n- Check (5, 2):\n  - Not in snake body.\n  - Not a wall (y=2 is not a border, and no internal obstacle there).\n  - No food at (5, 2).\n- **Safety**: Safe move.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (6, 3)\n- Check (6, 3):\n  - Not in snake body.\n  - x=6 is not a border wall (border is at x=7), no internal obstacle there.\n  - No food at (6, 3).\n- **Safety**: Safe move.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable or beneficial to go for:\n\n1. **(2, 1)**: value=1, life_span=1\n   - Distance from head (5,3): |5-2| + |3-1| = 3 + 2 = 5 steps away.\n   - Life_span=1, so it disappears after this turn. Not reachable next turn.\n   \n2. **(2, 5)**: value=3, life_span=1\n   - Distance: |5-2| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5 steps away.\n   - Also disappears after this turn. Not reachable.\n   \n3. **(4, 5)**: value=6, life_span=1\n   - Distance: |5-4| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3 steps away.\n   - Disappears after this turn. Not reachable.\n   \n4. **(5, 5)**: value=9, life_span=1\n   - Distance: |5-5| + |3-5| = 0 + 2 = 2 steps away.\n   - Disappears after this turn. Can we reach it in 1 move? No, need at least 2 moves (first move towards it, then next move to eat).\n   - Current head is at (5,3). To reach (5,5), need to go Up twice.\n   - First move: Up to (5,4).\n   - Next move: Up to (5,5).\n   - But food disappears after this turn, so we can't reach it in time.\n\n**Conclusion**: None of the food items can be eaten this turn or next, as their life_span is 1 and they'll disappear after this turn.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail, and the tail cell has positive food?\n- Tail is at (1, 3).\n- Adjacent cells to head (5,3): (4,3), (6,3), (5,2), (5,4).\n- Tail is at (1,3), not adjacent to head (distance is 4 in x-direction).\n- So no tail reward danger.\n\n### Choosing the Safest Move\n\nSince no food is immediately reachable, we should choose a move that keeps the snake safe and possibly sets up for future moves.\n\nPossible safe moves: U, D, R.\n\n- **Up (U) to (5,4)**:\n  - Next positions: head at (5,4), body starts at (5,3), (4,3), ...\n  - Future moves from (5,4): can go U, D, R (cannot go L, which would be back to (5,3)).\n  \n- **Down (D) to (5,2)**:\n  - Next positions: head at (5,2), body starts at (5,3), (4,3), ...\n  - Future moves from (5,2): can go U, D, R (cannot go L to (4,2) unless it's allowed, but current direction was R, then D, so next cannot be U which is reverse of D? Wait, no, reverse is only from the last move. After R, then D, reverse would be U, but that's not the last move's opposite. Hmm, need to clarify instant reverse rule.\n  \n  Instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n  Current direction is R. Next move is D. Then next move cannot be U (opposite of D). But that's not relevant now.\n\n- **Right (R) to (6,3)**:\n  - Next positions: head at (6,3), body starts at (5,3), (4,3), ...\n  - Future moves from (6,3): can go U, D, R (cannot go L to (5,3), which is reverse of R).\n\nLooking at the snake's body, moving Right (R) to (6,3) seems safe and doesn't box us in immediately.\n\n### Potential Future Considerations\n\nAfter moving R to (6,3), next moves could be:\n- U to (6,4): but (6,4) is currently part of the snake's body (from the list: ..., (6,4), ...). So that would be a collision next turn.\n- D to (6,2): safe.\n- R to (7,3): x=7 is a wall, so collision.\n\nSo after R, only safe move next is D.\n\nAlternatively, moving U to (5,4):\nNext moves:\n- U to (5,5): but (5,5) has food with value=9, but it will be gone by then.\n- D to (5,3): reverse of U, but current direction was R, then U, so next cannot be D (opposite of U). So not allowed.\n- R to (6,4): (6,4) is body, collision.\nSo after U, no safe moves next.\n\nMoving D to (5,2):\nNext moves:\n- U to (5,3): reverse of D, not allowed.\n- D to (5,1): safe (not wall or body).\n- R to (6,2): safe.\nSo two safe options next.\n\nThus, moving D seems better for future flexibility.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween U, D, R:\n- U leads to being trapped next turn.\n- R leads to only one safe move next (D).\n- D gives two safe moves next (D or R).\n\n**Best immediate action**: Move Down (D).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

However, since (5, 1) isn't in the body segments, the snake must have been moving down from (5, 1) to (5, 2), but (5, 1) is outside the grid (y=1 is allowed, but y=0 is a wall). Wait, y=0 is a wall, so y=1 is valid. Maybe the snake was at (5, 1) before moving to (5, 2), but (5, 1) isn't in the current body, which starts at (5, 2). This suggests the snake was moving down into (5, 2).\n\n4. **Food**:\n   - (2, 5): value = 3, life_span = 1\n   - (4, 5): value = 5, life_span = 1\n   - (5, 5): value = 8, life_span = 1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake's body to understand its shape and possible movements.\n\nThe snake's head is at (5, 2), moving Down (D). The next segment is at (5, 3), meaning the snake's body is directly below the head. \n\nPossible movements from the head at (5, 2):\n- **Up (U)**: (5, 3) - but this is the next body segment, so moving up would collide with the body.\n- **Down (D)**: (5, 1) - but y=0 is a wall, so y=1 is valid. However, we need to check if (5, 1) is part of the body.\n  - Scanning the body segments: (5, 2), (5, 3), ..., (1,4). (5, 1) is not in the body, so moving down is possible.\n- **Left (L)**: (4, 2) - check if this is in the body or a wall.\n  - Body: (4, 3), (3, 3), etc. (4, 2) is not in the body.\n  - Walls: Internal obstacle is at (3, 6), so (4, 2) is clear.\n- **Right (R)**: (6, 2) - check body and walls.\n  - Body: (6, 4), (6, 5), etc. (6, 2) is not in the body.\n  - Walls: No wall at (6, 2).\n\nCurrent direction is Down (D), so the opposite is Up (U). The rule states we cannot move opposite to the current direction on the next turn, so Up is forbidden regardless of collision.\n\nThus, possible moves from (5, 2):\n- Down (D): (5, 1)\n- Left (L): (4, 2)\n- Right (R): (6, 2)\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see where the food is relative to the head:\n\n1. (2, 5): value = 3, life_span = 1\n   - Distance from head (5, 2): |5-2| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n   - Not adjacent to head.\n\n2. (4, 5): value = 5, life_span = 1\n   - Distance: |5-4| + |2-5| = 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Not adjacent.\n\n3. (5, 5): value = 8, life_span = 1\n   - Distance: |5-5| + |2-5| = 0 + 3 = 3\n   - Not adjacent.\n\nNone of the food is adjacent to the head, so we cannot eat any food this turn regardless of the move.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nGiven that no food is immediately accessible, our primary goal is to avoid collisions and position ourselves for future food collection.\n\nPossible moves: D, L, R.\n\n1. **Down (D) to (5, 1)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Body: (5, 1) is not in the body segments.\n     - Walls: y=0 is a wall, so y=1 is valid.\n   - Safe move.\n\n2. **Left (L) to (4, 2)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Body: (4, 2) is not in the body.\n     - Walls: No wall at (4, 2).\n   - Safe move.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (6, 2)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Body: (6, 2) is not in the body.\n     - Walls: No wall at (6, 2).\n   - Safe move.\n\nAll three moves are safe in terms of immediate collisions. Now, let's consider future implications:\n\n- **Down (D) to (5, 1)**:\n  - Next turn, the head is at (5, 1), direction D.\n  - Possible moves next turn: Cannot go U (opposite of D), so L or R.\n  - Adjacent cells: (4,1), (6,1).\n  - Checking food: No food at (4,1) or (6,1) currently, but future food may spawn.\n\n- **Left (L) to (4, 2)**:\n  - Next turn, head at (4, 2), direction L.\n  - Cannot go R next turn, so U or D.\n  - Adjacent cells: (4,3) - body segment, so cannot go U (collision), so only D to (4,1).\n  - This seems limiting, as only one safe move next turn.\n\n- **Right (R) to (6, 2)**:\n  - Next turn, head at (6, 2), direction R.\n  - Cannot go L next turn, so U or D.\n  - Adjacent cells: (6,3) - not in body (body has (6,4), (6,5), etc.), so U is safe.\n  - D to (6,1) - also safe.\n  - More options next turn.\n\nGiven this, moving Right seems better as it offers more flexibility next turn.\n\n### Checking Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule mentions \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nCurrent tail is at (1, 4). Head is at (5, 2), distance is |5-1| + |2-4| = 4 + 2 = 6, not adjacent. So no danger here.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nSince no food is immediately accessible, and moving Right offers more flexibility for future moves without immediate danger, the best action is to move Right.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 82  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n- Internal obstacle at (3, 6).\n\n**Snake Positions**:  \nHead at (6, 2), followed by body segments:  \n(5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Right (R).\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (2, 5): value = 2, life_span = 1\n2. (4, 5): value = 4, life_span = 1\n3. (5, 5): value = 7, life_span = 1\n4. (3, 4): value = 10, life_span = 1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nFirst, let's visualize the snake's position and the food locations to better understand the scenario.\n\n- **Head**: (6, 2)\n- **Tail**: (1, 5)\n- **Food**:\n  - (2, 5): This is where the tail is currently located. The tail is at (1,5), next is (2,5), which is food.\n  - (4, 5): Part of the snake's body is at (4,5), but it's also food.\n  - (5, 5): Snake body at (5,5), also food.\n  - (3, 4): Snake body at (3,4), also food.\n\nFrom this, all food items are currently under the snake's body. \n\n### Rules Recap for Eating Food Under Body\n\nFood under the snake's body can only be eaten if:\n1. The body moves away from that cell.\n2. The head moves onto the food cell in the same turn.\n\nAdditionally, **Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nCurrent direction is Right (R). Possible moves from Right are:\n- **Right (R)**: Continue right to (7,2)\n- **Up (U)**: Move to (6,3)\n- **Down (D)**: Move to (6,1)\n- Cannot move Left (L) because that's the opposite of current direction (R), which is not allowed.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Right (R) to (7,2)**:\n   - Check walls: x=7 is a border wall. So moving right would hit the wall → collision → death.\n   - **Invalid move**.\n\n2. **Up (U) to (6,3)**:\n   - New head position: (6,3)\n   - Check if (6,3) is part of the body: Current body segments are from (5,2) to (1,5). (6,3) is not in the list → safe.\n   - Check walls: No wall at (6,3).\n   - Now, check if any food can be eaten:\n     - Food is at (2,5), (4,5), (5,5), (3,4). None of these are (6,3), so no food eaten.\n   - After moving, the tail moves from (1,5) to (2,5), which is food.\n     - But since the head didn't move onto any food, nothing is eaten.\n   - **Valid move**, no food eaten.\n\n3. **Down (D) to (6,1)**:\n   - New head position: (6,1)\n   - Check if (6,1) is part of the body: Not in the list → safe.\n   - Check walls: y=0 is a wall, but (6,1) is y=1 → safe.\n   - Check food: No food at (6,1).\n   - After moving, tail moves to (2,5), which is food, but no eating since head didn't move onto food.\n   - **Valid move**, no food eaten.\n\n### Considering Food Under Body\n\nAll food is under the body. To eat any, we'd need to:\n- Move the body away from the food cell.\n- Move the head onto that food cell in the same turn.\n\nLet's see if any food is adjacent to the head that we can aim for:\n\nHead is at (6,2). Adjacent cells:\n- Right: (7,2) - wall\n- Up: (6,3) - no food\n- Down: (6,1) - no food\n- Left: (5,2) - part of body (second segment)\n\nNo adjacent food to head. So we cannot eat any food this turn by moving onto it directly.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe tail is at (1,5), next is (2,5), which is food. The head is at (6,2), which is not adjacent to (2,5) (distance is |6-2| + |2-5| = 4 + 3 = 7, not adjacent). So no immediate danger from tail reward.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nBetween Up and Down:\n- Up to (6,3):\n  - Next possible moves from (6,3) with direction U: U, R, L (can't go D opposite)\n- Down to (6,1):\n  - Next possible moves from (6,1) with direction D: D, R, L (can't go U opposite)\n\nBoth seem safe. Let's see future possibilities:\n\nAfter Up to (6,3):\n- Next turn, if we go Left to (5,3), that's part of the body (current (5,3)) but it will move to (4,3) by then, so (5,3) will be free unless the body moves there.\n- Alternatively, can go Right to (7,3) but that's a wall.\n\nAfter Down to (6,1):\n- Next turn, can go Left to (5,1) - not in body, not wall.\n- Or Right to (7,1) - wall.\n- Or Down to (6,0) - wall.\n\nDown seems slightly more limiting next turn. Up gives more options next turn (can go Left to (5,3) which might be free).\n\n### Checking Immediate Food Opportunities\n\nAll food is under body, and none are adjacent to head to eat this turn. So no immediate eating possible.\n\n### Avoiding Future Collisions\n\nLooking at the snake's body, it's quite long and convoluted. Moving Up might start moving towards the center where there's more space, whereas Down is closer to the bottom wall.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween Up and Down, both are safe this turn, but Up seems to offer slightly more flexibility next turn. \n\n**Final Answer**: \\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 83 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid and Walls:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n- Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n- There's one internal obstacle at (3, 6).\n\n**2. Snake:**\n- Positions (head first): [(6, 3), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5)]\n- Current head direction: U (Up, which is (x, y+1)).\n\n**3. Food:**\n- (2, 5): value=1, life_span=1\n- (4, 5): value=3, life_span=1\n- (5, 5): value=6, life_span=1\n- (3, 4): value=9, life_span=1\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving Up (U). The possible moves are U, L, R (can't go D because that's the opposite of current direction U, which is not allowed).\n\nLet's check each possible move:\n\n**1. Continue Up (U): (6, 3) → (6, 4)**\n- (6, 4) is already part of the snake's body (10th segment in the list). \n- Moving here would cause a collision with the body. \n- **Not safe.**\n\n**2. Turn Left (L): (6, 3) → (5, 3)**\n- (5, 3) is the 4th segment of the snake's body.\n- Moving here would collide with the body.\n- **Not safe.**\n\n**3. Turn Right (R): (6, 3) → (7, 3)**\n- x=7 is a border wall.\n- Moving to (7, 3) would hit the wall.\n- **Not safe.**\n\nHmm, all three possible moves from the current position and direction lead to collisions or walls. This seems like a dead end. \n\nWait a minute, let me double-check the snake's body positions to ensure I didn't miss anything.\n\nCurrent head is at (6, 3). Adjacent cells:\n- Up (U): (6, 4) - occupied by snake (10th segment)\n- Left (L): (5, 3) - occupied by snake (4th segment)\n- Right (R): (7, 3) - wall\n- Down (D): (6, 2) - occupied by snake (2nd segment), and also opposite direction, so not allowed.\n\nThis seems correct. All immediate moves lead to death. \n\nBut let me check the food positions to see if any are under the snake's body that could be eaten by moving away:\n\nFood at:\n- (2, 5): part of the snake's tail (last segment)\n- (4, 5): part of the snake's body (16th segment)\n- (5, 5): part of the snake's body (15th segment)\n- (3, 4): part of the snake's body (7th segment)\n\nThe food at (2, 5) is under the tail. To eat it, the tail would have to move away, and then the head moves onto it. But currently, the head is at (6, 3), which is far from (2, 5). \n\nSimilarly, other foods are under the body, but the head can't reach them in one move without colliding.\n\nGiven that all immediate moves lead to death, it seems the snake is trapped and cannot make a safe move this turn. \n\nBut let me think if there's any special rule that could help. The \"Tail Reward Danger\" mentions that if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail has positive food, eating it kills the snake. Here, the tail is at (2, 5) with food value=1, but the head is at (6, 3), not adjacent (they are more than one cell apart). So this doesn't apply.\n\nGiven that, it seems there's no possible move that doesn't result in death. \n\nHowever, the rules state that the snake can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment since the tail will move forward. Let me check that.\n\nCurrent tail is at (2, 5). The head is at (6, 3), not adjacent to the tail, so this exception doesn't help here.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully analyzing all possible moves:\n- Up: collides with body at (6, 4)\n- Left: collides with body at (5, 3)\n- Right: hits wall at (7, 3)\n- Down: opposite direction, not allowed\n\nAll immediate moves lead to death. Therefore, the snake cannot make a safe move this turn. \n\nBut since we must choose an action, and all choices are equally fatal, we can choose any. However, typically in such cases, the game would end, but since we have to pick, let's choose one that might have been intended to be safe if there was a miscalculation, say Left (though it's not safe here).\n\nBut upon re-reading, the tail is at (2,5), and the segment before tail is (3,5), so the tail will move to (3,5) next turn if the snake moves. But the head is at (6,3), not near the tail, so no help there.\n\nGiven that, it seems the snake is doomed this turn. \n\nBut perhaps there's a misinterpretation. Maybe the \"snake positions\" list includes the tail's current position, and the tail moves after the head moves, so the cell that was the tail is now free. \n\nLet me see: current tail is at (2,5). If the snake moves, the tail moves forward, so (2,5) is no longer occupied. \n\nBut the head is at (6,3), and to reach (2,5), it would take multiple moves, not immediate. \n\nSo no, that doesn't help for immediate move.\n\nGiven that, it seems no safe move exists. \n\nBut since the problem requires an answer, perhaps the initial assumption about the body segments is incorrect. Maybe the list includes the tail's position, and after moving, the tail moves, so the cell that was the tail is now free. \n\nBut even then, the head is at (6,3), and the tail is at (2,5), which is not adjacent, so moving doesn't free up a cell adjacent to the head.\n\nThus, all moves lead to death. \n\nBut since the format requires an action, and all are equally bad, I'll choose one arbitrarily, say Left, though it's not safe.\n\nBut perhaps the correct interpretation is that the snake can move into the tail's current position because the tail will move away. \n\nCurrent tail is at (2,5). Head is at (6,3), not adjacent, so this doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake can reverse direction if it's the only move, but rules say no instant reverse.\n\nGiven that, it seems the snake cannot make a safe move. \n\nBut since the problem expects an answer, perhaps the initial body collision checks are incorrect. \n\nLet me recount the body segments after the head:\n\nHead: (6,3)\nNext: (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nPossible moves from (6,3):\n- U (6,4): is (6,4) in the body? Yes, it's the 10th segment.\n- L (5,3): is (5,3) in the body? Yes, it's the 4th segment.\n- R (7,3): wall.\n- D (6,2): opposite direction and body segment (2nd).\n\nSo all moves collide or hit wall.\n\nThus, the snake is trapped. \n\nBut since the answer must be given, and all moves are fatal, perhaps the correct answer is that the snake must collide, and the game ends. \n\nBut the format requires an action, so I'll choose one that seems least bad, say Left, though it's not safe.\n\nHowever, since all moves are equally fatal, and the problem expects an answer, perhaps the initial state has an error, or perhaps the snake can stay in place, but the rules say it must move one cell per turn.\n\nGiven that, the only possible answer is to choose one of the fatal moves, say Left.\n\n\\boxed{L} \n\nBut realistically, the snake is trapped and cannot make a safe move. \n\nGiven that, and since the problem expects an answer, I'll choose Left, acknowledging that it leads to a collision. \n\nFinal Answer:\n\n\\boxed{L} \n\n(Note: All possible moves lead to collision or wall hit; the snake cannot make a safe move in this state.)",
